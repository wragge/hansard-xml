            <para>- I direct a question to the Minister representing the Minister for National Development. A meeting of 34 commercial aircraft operators was held in Perth yesterday to discuss the shortage of fuel confronting these operators. I understand that the shortage has had the effect of reducing fuel supplies by 30 per cent in the southern part of Western Australia and by 55 per cent in the north. I ask the Minister: Firstly, is there any truth in the rumour that the one oil company in Australia which produces aviation fuel for piston-engined aircraft is planning to sell some of this fuel to New Zealand? Secondly, as there are two areas in which the Commonwealth uses substantial amounts of aviation fuel- namely, defence and coastal surveillance- are the cutbacks in supplies being experienced by the commercial operators being shared by defence and coastal surveillance operations? Thirdly, does the Government understand that some of these operators may be forced into liquidation because of fuel shortages? </para>

            <para>-I ask the Minister representing the Prime Minister: Is it not apparent from today&#39;s media observations that there is public disquiet about the personal financial dealings of the Minister for Primary Industry? Does the Government think it proper that in these circumstances a Minister of the Crown should be permitted to continue to act in that capacity, representing and speaking for the Government? If it does, does that mean that the standards of ministerial propriety laid down by the Prime Minister no longer apply, or that this Government is indifferent as to whether its Ministers observe the high standards allegedly demanded by the Prime Minister? </para>

            <para>-Whether or not members of the public have disquiet on this matter obviously cannot be measured. They do not have the facts before them at the moment. They have only the series of allegations put by the Labor Opposition which in themselves at this moment are baseless. That is an answer to the first part of the question. As to the second part of the question, no definition of any breach by a Minister is before this Government or the people of Australia today. In New South Wales at this moment under State law an investigation is being conducted by a man named, I think, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Finnane.</inline> It was instigated by the New South Wales Attorney-General. I think it was several days ago that I was lectured by members of the Opposition who said that one should not intervene when a case was before an industrial commission. It would be much more proper if honourable senators opposite applied that principle to the civil liberties and rights of the individual. An investigation having been properly ordered by an Attorney-General- a Labor Attorney-General at that- they should not embark upon Moscow trials themselves but should wait to see what emerges. That would be the logical thing to do. If standards in terms of the ordinary rights of the citizen are being infringed, they are not being infringed by those on this side of the chamber. </para>

            <para>- My question is directed to the Minister representing the Prime Minister. Did the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development examiners in 1974 draw attention to what they called the lack of a clear national science and technology policy in Australia? Does the report from the Senate Standing Committee on Science and the Environment which was tabled this week say, in part, that at present there is no clear national policy for science and technology in Australia? Is the Minister aware of the disastrously declining levels of real research and development in Australia in all sectors and in ail disciplines? Does he agree that the co-ordination, measurement and integration of research and development in Australia are in a deplorable shambles and are in need of a total and thorough review and overhaul? Will he convey to the Prime Minister the feeling that perhaps the Australian Science and Technology Council would be well charged with the responsibility to look at this matter in the national interest, on the ground that nobody else appears to be doing so? </para>

            <para>-I believe <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Puplick</inline> is correct in his assertion of the comment made by the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development. I believe it is correct to say that a number of statements have been made by people whose views ought to be respected that the co-ordination of science and technology in Australia is not good enough. The establishment of the Australian Science and Technology Council is in itself a recognition by the Government of the need for better coordination. The reform of the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation also has been an expression of part of that need. I would not use the superlative adjectives that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Puplick</inline> used with regard to the matter. Nevertheless, I believe that the Government would acknowledge that there is a need for even better co-ordination and that ASTEC has a very significant role to play. </para>

            <para>- My question, which is directed to the Minister representing the Minister for Employment and Youth Affairs, refers to the report titled &#39;Employment prospects by industry and occupation&#39; which he tabled yesterday and which was put out by the Manpower Programmes Section of the Department of Employment and Youth Affairs. I think that most people, including the Minister, will agree that it is a very good report and that it illustrates the difficulties in obtaining employment. In view of the very pessimistic report, will the Minister consider the frequent requests from staff organisations and from the Opposition that now is the time to reconsider the staff ceilings in the various departments and statutory authorities which, it has been pointed out to the Minister many times, inhibit the recruitment of a number of people, including apprentices and trainees, who could fill the vacancies for skilled workers which presently exist in industry? Does the Minister contemplate any such action by the Department? What will be the result of the inquiries into the report? When will it be considered on the basis of the propositions I have put before the Minister? </para>

            <para>- As I have said in the Senate on numerous occasions in answer to questions about staff ceilings- I acknowledge the particular interest that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bishop</inline> has had in this matter- the Government&#39;s policy to maintain staff ceilings is a very clear and firm one. The Government sees the maintaining of staff ceilings as being fundamental to its policy of restricting the growth of the public sector. The Public Service ceilings are important in that respect. They are important also from the point of view of encouraging efficiency in the Public Service. At the same time the Government is keeping constantly under review, both the overall level of staff ceilings and in particular the levels in areas where there are problems. I have already indicated that at the moment I am considering the advice of the Public Service Board on staff ceilings in the Family Court. We are looking at whether something can be done about problems that may exist in that area. I hope to be able to say more about that matter shortly. </para>

          <para>That is the general situation in the area about which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bishop</inline> asked. He has a particular interest in the recruiting of people for training. The Government has already taken some steps this year to make available more places for apprenticeships. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Viner,</inline> the Minister for Employment and Youth Affairs, has given some details of that initiative. I refer the Senate to the statements he has made. I do not have them with me at the moment so I am unable to quote them. The matter raised by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bishop</inline> is certainly one which the Government is aware of and concerned about. I will refer his question to the Minister for Employment and Youth Affairs and ask him to give further and close consideration to it. </para>

            <para>- My question is addressed to the Minister representing the Minister for Employment and Youth Affairs. The Minister will agree that it is necessary for field officers of the Commonwealth Employment Service to make frequent visits to employers to learn about the possibilities of job vacancies and the sort of applicant that employers may be seeking. Is the Minister aware of claims by CES officers in Melbourne suburbs that they have difficulty in carrying out their tasks because of limited availability of departmental cars? Is it a fact that officers count themselves lucky if three or more of them in any one office get one Commonwealth car among them for two days a week? To overcome these difficulties, will the Government consider making hire cars available to allow these CES officers to get on with their jobs? </para>

I refer to reports in today&#39;s <inline font-style="italic">Courier-Mail</inline> which state that a recent survey showed that parents of students in Queensland government schools paid $8. 5m from their own pockets to keep their schools running last year. I also refer to a statement in the Schools Commission report for the 1979-81 triennium that target resource standards for the triennium should be such that there should be, amongst other things, sufficient cash resources to obviate the necessity for semi-compulsory fees in government schools for the purchase of needed equipment and consumable resources. Does the Minister expect this element of the configuration set out by the Commission to be achieved in government schools throughout Australia by 1981? </para>

            <para>- There are a number of aspects to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Colston&#39;s</inline> question. There is nothing new in the contribution by parents to certain running costs of schools. Ever since government schools have existed parents- as I well know and most other parents who have had children at government schools well know- have had their hands in their pockets for certain expenses in schools. Those who have been members of parents and citizens associationsand I still have some lingering membership, but not a direct one-know that this is so. It may well be that there have been some increases in costs in recent times. It is a matter entirely for State governments. However, I do not hide behind that as any alibi. It is a matter entirely for the States as to what they do within their Budgets. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>
            <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Colston</inline>is correct in his interpretation of the comment made by the Schools Commission. Since in real money terms the recurrent funds for the Schools Commission next year will be the same as they were this year, there is no reason at all why that comment should apply not only to Queensland but also to other States. It is entirely a matter for the States how they allocate their resources. I know that in some StatesVictoria for instance- part of the recurrent funds go directly to payments to schools for specific purposes. That ought to be by way of alleviation. I stress that it is a phenomenon which has always existed. It is a great strain on the toffee apple and hoopla stalls with which we have all been involved and it ought to be one which can be mitigated. </para>

            <para>- I recall that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Archer</inline> raised this matter previously. My recollection is that it came up some three or four years ago in relation to a Tasmanian company which at that stage was harvesting kelp or seaweed off the Tasmanian coast. I have seen an article indicating that sales of that product are being made overseas. That is greatly to the credit of the company concerned. The honourable senator asked whether the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation might be encouraged to make trials on the product. My recollection is that previously the company concerned was anxious to have CSIRO endorse the general thrust of its argument relating to the quality of the product which was available for use as a fertiliser. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>I remember that at that time my comment was that the evaluation of the commercial products of any manufacturer was not a role of CSIRO. I think that perhaps it is appropriate that from some quarter the Government might assist in, say, the preparation of trials on that product. If the honourable senator would care to arrange a meeting with the company in the near future I will attend. Perhaps I will arrange for a CSIRO officer to be present at that meeting to consider the proposal it puts. </para>

The Government has had recommendations from the Australian Vice-Chancellors&#39; Committee, and of course it will have for consideration the report of the Williams Committee. The Government&#39;s policy to establish that tertiary institution remains. It has not been subject to any reconsideration in the light of later evidence that has emerged. For the moment, there has been some deferral in terms of financial priorities. Nevertheless, since it is a matter that concerns the Minister for Defence and the Government I will draw the honourable senator&#39;s question to the attention of the Minister. </para>

            <para>- My question is directed to the Minister for Education. In view of the cuts of 32 per cent in Commonwealth capital funds for government schools and 19 per cent for non-government schools, has the Minister considered the need for new or upgraded facilities in both systems pointed out by the Schools Commission in its 1978 report? I further ask: Since the Commonwealth is virtually the sole provider of capital funds for non-government schools and has a great degree of control over the disbursement of those funds, will action be taken to ensure that limited funds go preferentially to schools of lowest resources, namely, the Level 6 schools? </para>

            <para>-It is true that the Commonwealth Government provides the total source of capital funds for non-government schools. Some of the States provide interest rate subsidies, but South Australia, I think, does not. It is true that the Commonwealth&#39;s contribution to capital funding in government schools amounts to one-third. It is equally true that over recent years the States have decreased their input, and they could reverse that. As I pointed out at a Press conference, if the States are looking for money to deflect to offset any capital cut, the savings they now make by the abandonment of teacher training scholarships and the transfer of the burden of maintenance of trainees to the Tertiary Education Assistance Scheme are of the order of $40m a year. So the States have an obvious transfer payment, and that transfer payment is of considerable interest to the Labor Party. No doubt it will find that of considerable delight. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>The difference in the percentages- 32 per cent and 19 per cent- is in recognition of the fact that, on the one hand, the States have a two-thirds responsibility and, on the other hand the Commonwealth has a total responsibility. Therefore, if anything, this weighs more heavily on the non-government schools. The recommendation to the Schools Commission, and through that Commission to me as Minister, comes from finance and planning committees in each of the States, which are community bodies and are widely representative. Their considerations rest heavily upon the needs principle. Of course, the money will go preferentially to those most in need. It is fair to say that the $26m odd capital made available to non-government schools will cover all works now in process and perhaps a little more. The advance planning device whereby schools can make plans and get approval from us against the fact that they will be in a slot in a year&#39;s time or two years&#39; time, would enable those who wanted to go ahead to seek that planning and not suffer any real disruption. </para>

In view of the loss of overseas forward naval bases by the United States of America in recent times and the vulnerability of its island base in the north Indian Ocean, would the Government favourably support the establishment of a United States naval base in Australia? Would not such a base provide a needed economic boost to the Australian economy and to employment because of the high degree of local servicing that would be required? Finally, would not such a base strengthen Australia &#39;s defences? </para>

              <para>- One should keep this in mind because, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Primmer</inline> has said, we used to say it about Great Britain and the sad fact is that the number of its naval bases has declined. As a schoolboy I was able to recite Gibraltar, Malta, Aden, Mauritius, Singapore, Hong Kong and Wei-hai-wei as the great naval bases of the British Empire. We now do not measure its sea power in those terms. The fact of the matter is that we do have an interest in the deterrent role of the United States in keeping peace in the world by having effective defence installations throughout the world. The United States has never requested, to my knowledge, base facilities or installations of that kind from the Australian Government. If that were done it would be a policy decision for the Australian Government. I know of no such request at all. I will refer the question to the Minister concerned. </para>

            <para>- I understand that the original idea of the Year of the Child cannot be attributed to any particular person or body. There was a Declaration of Rights of the Child in 1959 and since that time many members of the United Nations have been urging the setting aside of a special year during which particular attention could be given to the situation of children. The decision to have an International Year of the Child was taken at the Thirty-first Session of the United Nations General Assembly on 2 1 December 1976 and the year 1979 was chosen as it is the 20th anniversary of the Declaration of Rights of the Child. </para>

I know the matter has been raised on several occasions and questions have been directed to me on this matter. The Leader of the Opposition will probably recognise that, so far as Australia is concerned, the declaration of any particular area basically does not have reference to me or my portfolio responsibilities. The Leader of the Opposition will know that the declaration of either a three mile, a 12-mile or a 200-mile limit off the Australian coast probably has reference to the Attorney-General. Where the honourable senator has asked me questions relating to the Antarctic and some particular aspect of it, I will need to look at the original questions that he asked. I do know by the study of recent questions that he has asked me that he has completely misled the Senate on a couple of occasions. If he likes, I will bring those particular questions and the statement he has made to the attention of the Senate. He may find time, when he thinks it appropriate, to apologise to me and to change his attitude. </para>

            <para>-Can the Minister representing the Minister for Home Affairs say whether the Commonwealth grant to the State of Tasmania, through the Council for the Arts, is meant primarily to assist local arts, or is meant to assist arts companies in other States. I ask this because the Tasmanian Minister for Education, Recreation and the Arts, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Holgate,</inline> while making a grant to the Tasmanian Ballet Company of $35,000, has also made a grant to the New South Wales Dance Company, which is about to tour our State in competition with the Tasmanian Ballet Company. I might add that the New South Wales Dance Company is funded by its own State to the tune of $300,000, compared with the $35,000 that the Tasmanian Ballet Company is given, and that, as a result of its large budget, the New South Wales Dance Company&#39;s advertising far outstrips that of the Tasmanian Ballet Company, to the latter&#39;s disadvantage. </para>

            <para>-The honourable senator&#39;s question concerns a very important matter to her State. I am unable to state the level of the grants that are administered by the Minister for Home Affairs. However, my understanding would be that funding would be made available to the various State governments which, in turn, would decide how it should be applied to assist the arts within their States. If the State of Tasmania has seen fit to grant funds to another organisation, perhaps its domestic politics would suggest whether that would be a correct procedure. I am unable to verify the figures that the honourable senator presents, but will refer them to the Minister for Home Affairs and endeavour to obtain an answer for her. </para>

Firstly, why did the Government not consult the head of the Narcotics Bureau, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Harvey</inline> Bates, before setting in train the multiforce inquiry in question? Secondly, if, as appears, it was because the Government lacked confidence in at least some aspects of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Bates&#39;s</inline> administration of the Bureau, why did the Government take such elaborately obsequious pains to persuade <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Bates</inline> to withdraw his resignation? </para>

              <para>- I am not going into relative degrees of sadness in terms of bloody murder. I noticed that the only select selective morality lay with the Labor Party, which would always protest if the extreme left wing sector of the spectrum was being subjected to cruelty- and I would too- but never opened its mouth if noncommunists were being hurt. So do not let us have any talk in this place about morality. After all, there was a silence about Kampuchea which was resounding. I was asked a serious question by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Kilgariff.</inline> Australia has successfully sought to encourage an international approach to the whole question of Indo-Chinese refugees. Part of this approach has been to seek the cooperation of governments in the Association of South East Asian Nations in holding boat people while in transit. ASEAN countries have cooperated on this matter. On 15 May a meeting was held in Jakarta to examine the establishment of a refugee island processing centre. We have already offered $250,000 towards the cost of establishing the centre. We are prepared to work through well-established forums for the resettlement of refugees and to this end we have officials in Malaysia, Thailand and Indonesia processing refugees in an orderly way. </para>

          <para>Inevitably some people will attempt to by-pass the selection process. They represent only a small proportion of the people from Indo-China who have come to Australia. The refugee problem hps posed a serious problem for Australia and the  region.  We, along with other countries, including ASEAN and the United States, have appealed to the Vietnamese Government to act to regularise the outflow of people. </para>

            <para>- My question is directed to the Minister representing the Minister for Administrative Services, or to the Minister representing the Minister for Employment and Youth Affairs, and concerns the Olympic Games. Nobody has been able to tell me which Minister should answer this question. Has the Minister seen a statement by the Premier of New South Wales that it would cost approximately $2,000m for Sydney to stage the 1988 Olympic Games and that the Federal Government had not indicated what financial support, if any, could be expected? If these costs are correct it would, therefore, be impossible for any Australian city to stage the Olympics in Australia&#39;s bi-centenary year without substantial support from the Federal Government. Will the Government consider making a detailed statement on this matter as soon as possible? </para>

I heard <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Brian</inline> Dixon say in a radio broadcast this morning that Melbourne could do it for $500m, so he has just reduced the ante by 75 per cent.

            <para>-My question to the Minister for Education relates to migrant education and the substance of newspaper reports yesterday. Has the Minister&#39;s attention been drawn to a report pointing to the success of migrant children who achieve results in spite of language difficulties? Has he noticed incidentally that those same migrant children watch less television? Has his attention also been drawn to a second item calling for a greater diversity in English language courses? Is the Minister aware that there are many professional migrants whose skills are being denied to the Australian community because of a lack of training in English language at senior levels? Is this due to a lack of courses at these levels? Can arrangements be  made for various language centres and other institutions to provide more opportunities for migrants to acquire English language skills at a level suitable for the professions? </para>

            <para class="block">7 June 1979 </para>
            <para>Migrant children are showing more determination than Australian students in staying on at school for good results despite a &#39;hostile environment&#39;, according to a Commonwealth Government report. </para>
            <para>The report says that &#39;a substantially greater proportion &#39; of those from non-English-speaking backgrounds study through to high or medium Higher School Certificate ( HSC) passes. </para>
            <para>This is despite evidence of entrenched &#39;narrow . . . and explicit anti-migrant attitudes&#39;. </para>
            <para>Students of non-English-speaking origin often face the kind of hostile environment that might be expected to make them leave school rather than stay on &#39;, the report claims. </para>
            <para>It quotes questionnaire answers from &#39;at least pockets of Australian children with highly aggressive attitudes towards migrants&#39;. </para>
            <para>One Australian student wrote: &#39;I hate the bastards! They pick fights and are annoying. I hate them, I hate them, I hate them! They even fight when there going to get done. They eat garlic and breath all over you &#39;. </para>
            <para>The report is the first to study over a period of years (1974-77) whether migrant children from nonEnglishspeaking backgrounds tend to complete a full secondary school course, and whether they do well in their final examinations. </para>
            <para>
              <inline font-weight="bold">Dr Jean</inline>Martin, of Canberra, and <inline font-weight="bold">Dr Phil</inline> Meade, of Brisbane, examined the school experiences of 3,043 students in a sample of sixteen Sydney High Schools. </para>
            <para>
              <inline font-weight="bold">Dr Martin</inline>is a Senior Fellow in the Sociology Department of the Research School of Social Sciences at the Australian National University. </para>
            <para>
              <inline font-weight="bold">Dr Meade</inline>is head of the School of Education Studies at the Kelvin Grove College of Advanced Education. </para>
            <para>They also interviewed the parents of about 690 of the students, and gained questionnaire answers from 637 teachers. </para>
            <para>The work was funded first by the Commonwealth Immigration Department, and later the Commonwealth Education Department in co-operation with the Academy of Social Sciences. </para>
            <para>The report, called &#39;The Educational Experience of Sydney High School Students&#39;, is being issued through the Australian Government Publishing Service. </para>
            <para>It says that, in order to cope, the migrant children may need to show &#39;remarkable insight (that is, grasping clues to rewarded and punished behaviour) and immense selfcontrol and hard work&#39;. </para>
            <para>In this sample, children with both parents born in a nonEnglishspeaking country are very heavily concentrated in: the lower intelligence quotient ( IQ ) scores (66 per cent, compared with 41 per cent of children of Australian-born parents); in the lower socio-economic stratum (SES) group (79 per cent, compared with 55 per cent); and in the group of combined lower IQ and SES (55 per cent, compared with 25 per cent). (IQ was measured by tests devised for English-speaking students, which tend to disadvantage nonEnglishspeaking students. ) </para>
            <para>In spite of those scores, the comparison for School Certificate and Higher School Certificate results between the total samples of children of non-English-speaking and of Australian origin is very much in favour of the migrant children. </para>
            <para>Large numbers of children from non-English-speaking ethnic groups cling to higher aspirations and stay at school despite a low level of performance as their school assesses it. </para>
            <para>In general, when similar IQ and SES groups are compared, children of non-English-speaking background did as well as or better than other students in School Certificate results. </para>
            <para>However, with migrant children comprising the larger part of the group in the low SES and with low IQ scores, migrants of low SES overall gained much poorer results than did other students of low SES. </para>
            <para>Again battling against this situation, educational aspirations in themselves played a bigger part in determining whether migrant children remained at school to the HSC than did their IQ, their SES, or their SC results. </para>
            <para>As a result, a substantially greater proportion of these children continued through to the HSC than did Australian or other English-speaking students (41 per cent, compared with 30 and 35 percent respectively). </para>
            <para>A greater proportion of the total number of migrant children gained medium or high HSC results than did the Australian or other English-speaking-children. </para>
            <para class="block">In a chapter on policy implications, the report claims that the Sydney inquiry &#39;points unmistakeably to the need for resources (of talent and imagination as well as money) in three broad areas&#39;. </para>
            <para>Firstly, it wants to encourage the education system (not only the high schools themselves) to serve children characterised as of low IQ and low SES &#39;whom it now does its best to throw off&#39;. </para>
            <para>Secondly, it claims that resources are needed &#39;to dislodge the narrow . . . and explicit anti-migrant attitudes that appear to be entrenched in some schools, and to develop the capacity of all children to benefit from living in an ethnically plural society- which we take to be the rationale for multicultural education&#39;. </para>
            <para>Thirdly, it asks for resources to be allocated to monitoring and research on two lines. </para>
            <para>One of these would test systematically in Australia recent radical overseas reviews of education, and the relation between educational qualification and the social structure. </para>
            <para>The other would &#39;bring into public awareness the reality of the school experience of teachers, students, and parents&#39;. </para>

            <para>- As I understand the decision of the Industrial Court in Queensland, there is no commencing date because the award wages should have been paid all along. I understand that the basis of the decision was that the award overrode the regulations under which the less-than-award wages were paid. I have not seen the actual judgment- I am relying on reports which have been given to me on it- but, if it is the case that the Court has found that award wages are payable on the reserves, that finding would be applicable immediately because that is the law. There has been talk of the additional cost to the State of Queensland. I think that the Queensland Government has put a figure of some $7m on it. It has made a request to the Commonwealth for additional grants to cover that sum. The Government has that request under consideration. I simply point out to the </para>

My understanding is simply that the judge has said that that is the law which applies and therefore the award wages should be paid. I cannot say whether there is a right to claim retrospectively. 1 would have to seek advice on that matter. </para>

            <para>- My attention was drawn to the statement. As a result, I sought a brief on it. My advice is that the statement made at the weekend by the  President  of the Australian Capital Territory Branch of the Returned Services League contained three significant inaccuracies. The first one was his statement that: </para>

          <quote>
            <para>As a new Act it will supersede previous Acts under which the Commonwealth employs its staff. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">This is incorrect. The new Act does not change the Superannuation Act or repatriation legislation. It only substitutes new provisions for provisions that are already in the Public Service Act- for example, sections 20 and 67. The second inaccurate statement was: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>Under the Bill &#39;s invalidity provisions an employee could receive a lower rate of superannuation pension. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">I am advised that this is incorrect. An officer or employee who was invalided out would receive exactly the same benefits under this Act as he would under the existing provisions. The </para>
          <para class="block">Superannuation Act is not altered. The third inaccurate statement was: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>There is also the possibility that any war compensation received may be deducted from this lower pension. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">Again, I am advised that this statement is incorrect. The Act does not allow a war pension to be taken into account in determining superannuation pension. The fact that a person is invalided out may be grounds to claim increased war compensation. The RSL resolution called on the Government to amend the Bill to preserve ex-servicemen&#39;s preference for redeployment and to preserve superannuation entitlements. I am advised that there is no need to amend the Act. The only preference for ex-servicemen is related to recruitment. The skills of the individual and the requirements of any vacant positions determine whether redeployment is possible. </para>

            <para>- Would the Minister representing the Prime Minister and the Treasurer agree that the report presented yesterday, entitled &#39;Employment Prospects by Industry and Occupation&#39;, makes depressing reading, accentuating, as it does, the decreasing job opportunities over the next few years for school leavers and for most graduates? As a kind of eleventh hour appeal, I ask: Will the Government now recognise the appalling economic and social costs of major unemployment to this country? Will it give a high priority in the Budget to a comprehensive and realistic program to encourage work-sharing, optional earlier retirement and other similar measures throughout the work force that might reduce unemployment in both the short and long term, and permit that program to be freely debated here? </para>

            <para>- The Government would have no hesitation in stating that chronic unemployment, particularly among juveniles, is a sad and very unfortunate occurrence. It is something which ought to be worked against strongly and which ought to be overcome with all the resources available. I do not say this to the honourable senator defensively, but I believe that we should take into account the record of previous governments- some two decades of full employment. In those decades and up until as late as 1 968, the community accepted that there was full employment when 59.5 per cent of all people over 1 5 years of age indicated that they wanted work and, in fact, got work. Today 6 1.5 per cent of the people have indicated that they want work and have got work but there are still more people unemployed. I think that the honourable senator recognised in his question that the problem is a complex one. We must create many more and different ways of overcoming this problem. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>One of the sad difficulties is that employers- I suppose it is natural enough- are choosing to employ the mature person rather than the adolescent. This is an enormous problem in terms of the transition from school to work. I accept the general premise that this Government should examine all ways of overcoming what is sadly a new problem. It has many complications the like of which we have never seen before. It was as an earnest of this kind of thinking that the Government set up a special new Department of Employment and Youth Affairs. </para>

            <para>- My attention was drawn to the incorporation of a table by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Button.</inline> I think it was shown to me when I came into the chamber later. My attention was also drawn to an interjection by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Chaney</inline> that the table had some defects. I have had prepared another table, which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Button</inline> should welcome because he asked that we might indicate the defects in his table. The table which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Button</inline> had incorporated in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> on 4 June, at page 2545, dealt with Australian Government outlays on education in current and constant dollars from 1970-71 to 1978-79. The table did not take account of the tertiary offsets; that is, of the adjustments made to general purpose grants to the States in association with the assumption by the Commonwealth of full financial responsibility for universities and colleges of advanced education from 1 January 1974. 1 should like to incorporate in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> a modification of that table to take account of that factor. The table that I will seek leave to incorporate in a moment was prepared by the Department of Education. I think <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Button</inline> would acknowledge the objectivity of approach and the skills of the Department. </para>

          <para>My table varies the figures in the last four columns of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Button&#39;s</inline> table. The real significance of the table in either version is the dramatic turnaround of Commonwealth expenditure on education which occurred in 1975-76 under the influence of the Hayden Budget and of the Whitlam Government&#39;s decisions about the programs of the education commissions for 1 976. 1 remind the Senate that decisions on funding levels for the education commissions&#39; programs, which represent 80 per cent of total Commonwealth expenditure on education, are made on a calendar year basis. Financial year actual expenditure figures are cash flows resulting from approved calendar year programs. If we make a true comparison- that is, a comparison between the effects of the decisions taken by the respective governments in issuing guidelines to the education commissions- we see the full picture clearly. Expressed in constant values, the Whitlam Government&#39;s direction for the 1976 program represented a reduction of 7 per cent on the previous year and the decisions of the Fraser Government represented an increase of 3.2 per cent in 1 977, an increase of 0.6 per cent in 1 978, no change in 1 979 and a reduction of 2. 1 per cent in 1980. 1 seek leave to incorporate that table in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard.</inline></para>

Although the persons who lead the new regime in Ghana apparently have announced that they will be holding some form of election, will the Government insist that the same criteria be applied to Ghana as are being insisted upon in the case of Rhodesia and that no recognition will be granted to the new government until such time as internationally supervised, free elections have been held in Ghana? If this is not the case and recognition is granted to Ghana during the period that the Parliament is in recess, for the benefit of those of us who find these events a little difficult to follow, will the Government prepare a list of those countries where a change of regime can be recognised only after the holding of internationally supervised, free elections and those countries where this is not necessary? </para>

On a casual perusal of my brief, I do not have more detailed information. I think that the world lacks a considerable amount of such information at this moment. So I cannot add to the storehouse of knowledge on the matter. I would have to acknowledge that the whole world has had some difficulties in recent years in understanding what principles were adopted worldwide in deciding the difference between de facto and de jure recognition of various nations following a coup or non-legal change of government. I take aboard the question in its sense. Whether or not it lends itself to a precise answer, as unhappily so many questions on the international level do not, I will try to answer the question. </para>

The answer to that question is that the Mobil company, which of course is the only producer in Australia, has contracts or obligations to supply New Zealand and Pacific islands which are part of its international network. It has a policy of allocating to each customer 70 per cent of the previous year&#39;s demand. </para>

          <para class="block">These contracts are of long standing. Some of Mobil&#39;s crude oil is supplied only on the understanding that customers will be supplied. Another part of the question related to supplies for defence operations. I am advised that the general shortage of Avgas is not presently affecting Defence Force operations as defence stock holdings are sufficient to meet current operational requirements. The third part of the question, which related to commercial aviation, asked: </para>

I add to the answer as follows: On the matter of media publicity for information pamphlets on energy and other matters, CSIRO through its Canberrabased media group directs the attention of the media to a wide range of new publications as they become available, as well as facilitating the covering by the electronic and print media of research work not published in pamphlet form. CSIRO believes, and I agree, that it is more valuable to the media to highlight the content and worth of information material as it becomes available rather than simply provide long lists of CSIRO publications. A complete publications list and the pamphlets themselves are readily available through CSIRO &#39;s central information service in Melbourne. I have urged CSIRO to continue to encourage the media to make Australians aware of the useful information that is available through the Organisation. </para>

            <para>-Senator Mason asked me a question relating to reducing the level of lead in petrol and to the effect of lead on children, as reported by Professor Smythe. The Minister of National Development has advised me as follows: </para>
          </talk.start>
          <quote>
            <para>The senator has raised the specific point of the cost of reducing the level of lead in petrol, suggesting that there is a big discrepancy between industry claims and those of Professor Smythe. Firstly let me say there is no great difference between the two claims. I understand the industry has said that the removal of lead would cost about Se per gallon, not Se per litre as indicated by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Mason,</inline> and this is of the same order of cost that Professor Smythe has indicated. </para>
            <para>Studies are under way by the Committee on Motor Vehicle Emissions to assess the cost benefits of lead-free petrol. The result of these studies will be presented to the Australian Transport Advisory Council and will take into account the capital investment costs and the overall fuel and energy costs. At this stage any estimate of the final cost to the motorist is pure guesswork. </para>

            <para>-On Wednesday <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lewis</inline> asked a question about the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal&#39;s inquiry into radio station 3CR and reports of a breakdown in discussions between the Board of Management of radio station 3CR and the Jewish Board of Deputies, Victorian Division. He suggested that the Government give consideration to the suspension of 3CR&#39;s licence as a means of reopening discussions between the parties. Before advising the honourable senator of the current position in this matter I remind all honourable senators that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lewis&#39;s</inline> suggestion that the Government suspend 3CR&#39;s licence is of course impossible to implement. Amendments to the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal Act in 1977 removed any government involvement in the broadcasting licensing process by referring this function to and placing full authority for its decisions in an independent statutory authority, namely the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal. Concerning the current state of negotiations, the Minister for Post and Telecommunications has informed me that at the Tribunal&#39;s last sitting on 7 May 1979 the Board of Management of the station requested the Tribunal to adjourn its hearings into this matter because of substantial changes to the composition of the Board of Management and the fact that the station&#39;s counsel was no longer available and new counsel would need to be briefed. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>The Tribunal agreed to the adjournment and set Tuesday, 31 July 1979, as the date for resumption of the inquiry. The extended delay in resuming the inquiry was unavoidable in view of the Tribunal&#39;s commitments to other licence inquiries, notably those in respect of the Melbourne television stations. The discussions between the parties have received considerable Press coverage and of course took place at the initiative of the parties themselves and were not part of or conditional on the adjournment of the inquiry. The Tribunal is unaware of the nature of the discussions and the reasons for the reported breakdown. All parties to the inquiry have indicated a desire for the terms of reference to be clarified and narrowed in the interests of expediting its completion. The Jewish Board of Deputies, for its part, has indicated it is not averse to having references to possible suspension or revocation of 3CR &#39;s licence removed from the terms of reference. I am sure all honourable senators hope that this matter will be settled quickly through co-operative discussions between the parties. </para>

        <para class="block">At this stage I have not had the opportunity of perusing this report in detail. It relates to the Commonwealth Teaching Service and involves an important item of Commonwealth expenditure on education. I refer to the general question of Commonwealth expenditure on education which was raised in Question Time today, when the Minister for Education <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Carrick)</inline> gave some figures prepared by his Department. He assured me of their impartiality. I do not disagree with that for a moment. The figures which I had incorporated in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> &#39;last Monday were prepared by the Parliamentary Library, an organisation for which I claim the same degree of impartiality. I do not question the impartiality of either set of figures; I question their accuracy. </para>
        <para>Whilst I appreciate the Minister&#39;s explanation of specific purpose and general purpose payments to the States, I draw the attention of the Senate to the actual Commonwealth outlays on education in specific years taken form the Budget Papers. In 1973-74 Commonwealth outlays on education were $858. 7m. In 1974-75 the outlays were almost double that figure at $1,67 1.6m. In 1975- 76, which is the relevant year in terms of the Minister&#39;s answer this morning, the outlays were $ 1,846.5m, an increase of over $170m. In 1976- 77 they were $2, 160.1m. In 1977-78 they were $2, 354. 8m. In 1978-79 they were $2,497.6m. Of course, any subsequent figure would be an estimate. The Minister gave the percentage increase for the calendar year 1977 as 3.2 per cent and for 1978 as 0.6 per cent. For 1979 the figure was nil and for 1980 he gave a decrease of 2. 1 percent. </para>
        <para>Its interesting to compare the figures of nil in 1979 and minus 2.1 per cent in 1980 with the figure for 1975-76, when the actual increase was in excess of $ 170m. In fairness Commonwealth outlays in 1975-76 could not be described as a decrease. The figure for that year of the Hayden Budget contracts sharply with the figures given by the Minister for 1979 and 1980. I also draw the Senate&#39;s attention to the fact that prior to the Australian Labor Party&#39;s coming to power in December 1972, Commonwealth outlays on education were abysmally low compared with Commonwealth outlays on education since. When I say &#39;since&#39; I include the regimes of all parties. The enormous increase in education expenditure occurred in 1974-75. The first relevant decline, of course, appears, as the Minister pointed out, in 1 979.I seek leave to continue my remarks later. </para>

          <para>-When the Bill for the Foreign Anti-Trust Judgments (Restriction of Enforcement) Act 1979 was before the Parliament it was indicated that the Attorney-General intended to make an order in respect of an antitrust judgment obtained by the Westinghouse Electric Corporation. An order in respect of that judgment, and another judgment related to it, have now been made. Both judgments were entered by the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois, Eastern Division. One was entered on 3 January 1979; the other was entered on 24 January 1 979. The proceedings in which the judgments were entered were brought by the Westinghouse Electric Corporation against 29 uranium producers including the following Australian companies: Conzinc Rio Tinto of Australia Limited; Mary Kathleen Uranium Ltd; Pancontinental Mining Ltd; and Queensland Mines Ltd. The proceedings relate to arrangements for the marketing of uranium alleged to have been made in 1972 in violation of the antitrust laws of the United States of America. The claim in the proceedings is for treble damages approximating $US7 billion. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>The judgment of 3 January 1979 is a final judgment on issues of liability. The judgment was entered against nine non- United States defendants- including the Australian companies mentioned above- which have declined to enter appearances. They so declined because they considered there were jurisdictional objections to the proceedings against them and that they might be taken to have waived those objections if they were to enter appearances. By the judgment the Court ordered and adjudged those nine defendants to be jointly and severally liable to the plaintiff in an amount which as yet remains to be determined by the Court. The judgment of 24 January 1979 is an interim injunction restraining those nine defendants until further order of the Court from dealing with their assets in the </para>
        <para class="block">United States except as provided in the injunction. The purpose of the injunction is to have those assests kept available to satisfy the judgment of 3 January 1979 when the amount of that judgment has been determined. </para>
        <para>The order in respect of both judgments has been made pursuant to section 3 of the Foreign Anti-trust Judgments (Restriction of Enforcement) Act 1979. Under sub-section (2) of that section before making an order the Attorney-General is required to be satisfied of the existence of one or more prescribed grounds. The prescribed ground on which the order is based is the Attorney-General&#39;s satisfaction that it is desirable for the purpose of protecting the national interest in relation to the trading operations of trading or financial corporations formed within the limits of the Commonwealth that the judgment should not be recognised or enforceable in whole or in part in Australia. If the before mentioned judgments were permitted to be enforced in Australia against the corporations referred to, the consequence could be of such an order that the very ability of those corporations to maintain their Australian operations would be endangered. Moreover, the position which the corporations collectively occupy in the Australian economy, particularly in relation to the marketing of Australian resources, is such that it is in the national interest that their ability to continue those operations be protected from such a liability under a law of a foreign state. This is particularly so where, as here, that law is being applied to conduct of Australian corporations outside that foreign state contrary to the expressed views of the Australian Government as to what is appropriate in that regard. </para>

This order, and the legislation from which it flows, are really part of the support given by the Government to our commodity producers when they seek markets abroad. What has happened is that there has been a conflict of interest between United States consumers of our energy resources on the one hand and Australian producers of certain energy primary products on the other. Whereas the United States legal system has been manipulated by United States consumers in order to achieve benefits for those consuming these energy resources within the United States, that manipulation is now being confronted by an Australian government which at last, somewhat belatedly, has recognised its obligation to ensure that Australian producers, whether of energy resources, iron ore, bauxite or alumina, et cetera, can themselves present a united front to the united buying power of groups abroad, of which United States utility companies and Japanese steel companies are perhaps the best known examples. So in principle, the Opposition certainly agrees with the order that has been placed before the Senate today by the Attorney-General. </para>
        <para>With regard to the actual details of this particular judgment, whilst the quantum of the liability has not yet been determined, given the fact that a $7 billion liability is possible against 29 companies spread throughout the world, four of which are Australian, it is quite clear that the effect of enforcement of that order within Australia would be to cripple enterprises which are extremely important to the economic and commercial well-being of this community. As I said, the Opposition has not had the opportunity to look at the matter in detail, but for the reasons I have mentioned, we support the order placed before the Senate. </para>

          <para>- Whilst certainly not dissenting from anything that either the Attorney-General, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Durack,</inline> or <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Tate</inline> has said about this matter, a number of unanswered questions still exist in relation to the conduct by the Government of this whole matter of the Westinghouse Electric Corporation uranium litigation. Those questions are raised very cogently and forcefully in a letter to the <inline font-style="italic">Australian Financial Review</inline> of 3 1 May 1979 by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Laurence</inline> W. Maher, a Melbourne solicitor, who knows what he is talking about in this area because he has previously had a substantial period of government service. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Maher</inline> makes the point that the real reason for the Government&#39;s legislative and political behaviour in relation to this matter so far has less to do with abstract questions of international law and protection of domestic sovereignty and rather more to do with worries by the Government about the avoidance of political embarrassment that might be thought to flow from an acknowledgement that Australia was indeed involved up to its neck in the cartel of uranium producers in this particular area and an anxiety on the part of the Government to avoid putting on the public record anything about the inner workings of that cartel. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>A policy of silence has been maintained by the Government in this respect, and not only in the context of this particular legislation, which may be justifiable on other grounds. It is a policy of silence that raises some concern, which I think needs to be allayed. I quote from the last two paragraphs of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Maher&#39;s</inline> letter which I think make a point that needs to be answered by the Government. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Maher</inline> said: </para>
        <quote>
          <para>Australia&#39;s reaction contrasts with that of other parties in the cartel, including Canada and the United Kingdom, which have each permitted their own courts to pass on Westinghouse &#39;s search for evidence. The Canadian Government has gone further by candidly admitting its participation in the cartel. </para>
          <para>Contrary to its oft proclaimed commitment to its openness in government the present Australian Government <inline font-style="italic">refuses to</inline> reveal any information regarding its participation in the cartel. A detailed public statement by the Government in line with that made by the Canadians in 1976 is long overdue and would do much to clear the air. </para>
        </quote>
        <para class="block">I endorse those sentiments and accordingly I request the Government to consider the making of such a statement and to bring it forward at the earliest opportunity. I do not dissent from the terms of the legislation which has been enacted. I simply make the point that there are many aspects of this whole affair which need to be put on the public record, in the interests of openness of government and information acquisition by the Australian community.

        <para class="block">In speaking very briefly to the motion, I take the opportunity to raise again in this chamber the apparent inability of the Government to make a decision on its policy concerning sovereign rights and the 200-mile off-shore area of the Antarctic. One would have thought that this document might have given some indication that the Government had decided to come down with a policy statement. But, as we know, the Government is badly divided as to the policy decision it should take. That has been the reason for the delay. If we go back to 20 October 1 977, the then Minister for Construction <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr McLeay)</inline> said in the House of Representatives: </para>
        <quote>
          <para>The provision of laboratory facilities for the Antarctic Division will be re-examined in the light of a Government White Paper relating to the Antarctic policy and programs which is now being prepared. </para>
        </quote>
        <para class="block">It was that matter to which I referred at Question Time today. We have never seen that White Paper. The Minister for Science and the Environment <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Webster)</inline> seemed to be confused as to whether it has ever been presented. It is quite apparent now that it has not been presented. The reason that the paper has not been presented is because the Government cannot decide on what to do. That is also the reason why the Committee referred to in that statement, the Antarctic Research Policy Advisory Committee, ARPAC as it is commonly known, was formedbecause the Government could not declare a position and bring down a White Paper. This statement has been designed simply as a cover-up position for the fact that the Government has not been able to make up its mind. </para>
        <para>The only other matter which I find difficult to understand is the reference to the provision of finance in 1 979-80 for a feasibility study of intercontinental air transport, including . the possibility of an ice runway near Casey station, a permanent runway on rock near Davis station, and some other associated facilities. On 10 April 1978 I asked, upon notice, a series of questions concerning the building of transport facilities in the Antarctic. Without going through all the details, the Minister, in reply, itemised the estimated costs of various facilities necessary for particular types of aircraft. During the course of his answer he said: </para>
        <quote>
          <para>The above costs -  which amounted to very many millions of dollars-  are provided in a detailed report by the Department of Transport in December 1977. </para>
        </quote>
        <para class="block">I am at a complete loss as to whether it is now intended that additional appropriations will be required in the financial year 1979-80 over and above those which were referred to in the Minister&#39;s answer which appeared in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> on 5 May 1978. This is our last day of sitting but I would ask that the Minister clarify that answer at some stage, by way of a public statement, so that we know exactly what we are committing ourselves for in respect of these programs.

          </para>
          <para>The purpose of the Bill now before the House is to amend the Albury-Wodonga Development Act 1973 in order to approve the Albury-Wodonga Development Agreement Amendment Agreement No. 1 and to implement its provisions in so far as they relate to the structure of the Albury-Wodonga Development Corporation. The Amendment Agreement, which was signed by the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Malcolm Fraser)</inline> and the Premiers of New South Wales and Victoria on 4 September 1 978, provides for an expansion in the membership of the Albury-Wodonga Development Corporation from five to eight members; common membership of the Albury-Wodonga Development Corporation, the Albury-Wodonga (New South Wales) Corporation and the Albury-Wodonga (Victoria) Corporation; and the abolition of the Consultative Council. At present the Albury-Wodonga Development Corporation is made up of three full time and two part time members. The Commonwealth, New South Wales and Victorian Ministers on the ministerial council responsible for oversight and development of Albury-Wodonga were of the unanimous view that there was a need for greater local government involvement in the decision-making process and a more effective link between the councils and the Corporation. </para>
          <para>It was agreed that these objectives could best be achieved if the Mayors of Albury and Wodonga were to become ex officio part time members of the Corporation. The ministerial council agreed that provision should also be made for a prominent businessman to serve on the Corporation to ensure that its membership reflects the nature of the partnership between the three levels of government and the private sector in the development of the growth centre. The responsibility for the development of Albury-Wodonga is vested in three corporations established under legislation of the Commonwealth, New South Wales and Victorian parliaments. In practice, the three corporations act as one, and it is therefore important that they have common membership. The Amendment Agreement provides for the part time members to take their places on all three corporations. The Amendment Agreement also abolishes the 16-person Consultative Council which has tended to create friction between the Corporation and local governments. </para>
          <para>Apart from the provisions now incorporated in the Agreement to include the Mayors of Albury and Wodonga and a businessman of national standing on the corporations, the ministerial council has also decided that the role of the range of community advisory committees that have been established to support the Corporation should be strengthened and enhanced. The ministerial council believes that these measures will ensure that the relationship between the Corporation and councils is strengthened without in any way affecting the access of interested community groups on the advisory committees to the Corporation. I understand that the measures that I have outlined were announced in the growth centre some time ago and that they have received general community support. I commend the Bill to honourable senators. </para>

          <para>The Migration Amendment Bill is a timely initiative of the Government to provide responsible and effective regulation of the entry to and stay in Australia of people from overseas. In the 2 1 years since the Migration Act was passed, the character of the Australian community has markedly changed, with radical amendment to immigration policies and in the volume and nature of movements into and out of Australia. Changing conditions in other countries tend to increase the attractions of Australia for many people, making the task of control more difficult. The Act itself is a 1958 measure being tested by 1979 circumstances, and being found wanting. </para>
          <para>The basic mechanisms for controlling entry and residence must reflect the attitudes a.id interests of the community. They must operate to protect the community from the entry and residence of people the community does not wish to enter Australia or remain here as residents. The legislation must provide the powers to enable these mechanisms to be used effectively- to prevent entry, to enforce departure when necessary and to impose adequate penalties to deter would-be offenders. Most travellers respect Australia&#39;s immigration laws. Unfortunately, there are some who enter or remain illegally in Australia, regarding breaches of immigration laws and policies as offences of small significance. Indeed, there are those in the community who actively encourage people to break the law and evade controls and who find prohibited immigrants a lucrative source of income. </para>
          <para>Clearly, people who try to evade immigration controls should gain no advantage over those many others who, being also ineligible to migrate to Australia, are prepared to abide by the rules. The limits which must be set to the migrant intake are easily met through the regular processes of interview, medical examination and selection in offices around the world- criteria which are not applied to people entering temporarily or illegally. Individuals cannot be allowed to make their own rules about staying on and taking employment. Indeed, it is a fundamental and internationally accepted principle that every country has the right to determine who may enter and who may remain within its boundaries. Australia is no exception and the Government reserves to itself the right to set the conditions under which people may enter Australia and remain in Australia. It believes that immigration laws and procedures should be observed and followed just as any other Australian law should be observed. </para>
          <para>The purpose of this Bill is to make essential amendments to the Migration Act without changing the basic concepts in the existing legislation. In 1958 when the Migration Act was passed, there were an estimated 1.57 million overseas-born members of the Australian population. Perhaps almost half of these were pre-war settlers of long standing. The remainder were relatively new post-war arrivals. In total, people born overseas other than in Europe, including Britain, were of the order of only 160,000. By 1978 the overseas-born component had almost doubled to an estimated 2.8 million and it included settlers from every continent. This diversified expansion of the overseas-born component of the population reflects itself in the changed demographic and ethnic composition of Australia. </para>
          <para>In 1958 Australia was strongly seeking migrants. Immigration restrictions applied mainly to people of non-European origin. The occupational categories actively sought by Australia almost covered the spectrum, including unskilled. Earlier policies based on an intake of migrants predominantly British had been abandoned but British migration was still seen as the dominant element in the migrant intake. The intake from the relatively few other main source countries, all of which were in Europe, was nevertheless, by 1 958, quite high. Nor was it subject to restraint. There was little need or incentive for people who wanted to settle here to resort to subterfuge if they were of European origin. </para>
          <para>By 1 973 discrimination on grounds of race had disappeared from immigration selection policy. That was a policy evolved by several governments of both political colours. The present level of immigration for settlement is relatively low, with an emphasis on encouraging only those skills in short supply. In 1977-78 it was about 80 per cent of the level of the 1 958-59 intake despite the wider range of source countries from which settlers came. In this regard, I draw the attention of honourable senators to the Minister&#39;s statement on immigration policies and Australia&#39;s population of 7 June 1978 which emphasised the Government&#39;s recognition of immigration as a necessary element in economic growth. The Government&#39;s program acknowledges the case for caution in current conditions but is sensitive to family reunion and to humanitarian and international responsibilities. We are pursuing a long term approach to population building in which immigration is the only directable factor. The fact that the Australian community is now barely reproducing itself must recommend immigration policy to all persons who genuinely have the future welfare of this nation in mind. While the volume of intake of migrants for settlement is at a relatively low level, the level of people entering as tourist or business visitors, to undertake approved temporary employment and in other non-migrant categories has increased enormously, rising at the rate of about 5 per cent per year. The changes that have taken place in total movement are illustrated by the figures of 395,000 in 1958 and 3.4 million in 1977-78, an increase of more than 800 per cent. </para>
          <para>I invite attention to the increase in the volume of air movement. More than 98 per cent of arrivals are by air, and have increased from 86,300 in 1958 to almost 1.7 million in 1977-78. In the same period, the arrivals by sea declined from 144,000 to 33,000. The relatively low volume of admission for settlement in more recent years inevitably prompts attempts to circumvent immigration policies and procedures either by malpractice or by entering for allegedly temporary purposes but then staying on without authority. It is estimated that there are approximately 57,000 prohibited immigrants in the country at this time. The Government is determined to stem the flow and to reduce the numbers already here competing with citizens for employment and other benefits. No government can abdicate its responsibilities in this area. In this I am sure it has the support of the Opposition as well as the community. </para>
          <para>The first of the principal changes is the introduction of a statutory visa system. This is provided for by clause 9 of the Bill. A visa is a document or notation specifically in the form of a stamped impression in a passport, which informs the carrier company and immigration officer at the port of arrival in Australia that the holder, prima facie, may enter Australia. However, a visa is not, in itself, an authority to enter. Under the existing Migration Act the legal entry authority is an entry permit issued at the point of arrival. In general, however, a visa holder may expect to receive an entry permit on arrival. Thus Australia&#39;s entry control is based on the issue of a visa overseas and the grant of an entry permit on arrival in Australia. The visa system is almost universally used as a travel facilitation and control mechanism. A visa system for intending travellers to Australia has been in force administratively for many years. It has lacked statutory backing. Given the changes in the nature and volume of entry of people into Australia and the need in the light of recent review legislation for every major procedure to have its foundation in law, it has become necessary for it to be given a statutory basis in the Migration Act. The Bill provides therefore in clause 9 that a visa or return endorsement may be granted to a person by an authorised officer and that that person may seek an entry permit upon arrival in Australia. I emphasise for the information of honourable senators that Australian citizens travelling on Australian passports will not require visas or return endorsements. </para>
          <para>It will be an offence under clause 9 for a carrier to bring a person, other than an Australian citizen or an exempt person, to Australia without a visa or return endorsement. The offence will be punishable by a fine not exceeding $2,000. The Bill provides for the classes of persons who are excempt from visa requirements to be notified in the <inline font-style="italic">Commonwealth of Australia Gazette</inline> and, in addition, individual carriers will be notified as in the past, of any change in visa requirements. The section will also provide carriers with a defence to a prosecution if the vessel was forced into Australia due to stress or weather or in circumstances of emergency, or where the carrier reasonably believed that when a person last boarded a vessel for travel to Australia, the person was an Australian citizen, a visa holder or an exempt person. The persons to be exempted from holding a visa will generally be New Zealand citizens or international travellers in transit through Australia to another destination. </para>
          <para>Under the amendments to be made by clauses 20 and 2 1 of the Bill it will also be possible to require carriers to remove from Australia passengers who, on arrival in Australia, have sought and been refused an entry permit. This requirement will be applicable to persons arriving by ship or by aircraft. It is not an unusual requirement. There is ample international precedent. The search for persons who breach the immigration law is an expensive and an unwanted burden on the Australian taxpayer. Thus the second major innovation included in the Bill is the introduction in clause 12 of a requirement that deportees meet the cost of their detention awaiting deportation and of their removal from Australia where they are in a position to do so. There have been numerous cases where the Commonwealth has been required to pay the fares of deportees who have by acting contrary to their conditions of temporary entry, accumulated substantial assets in this country. There are others who see it as a laudable achievement when they cash their return ticket and are sent home at cost to the Australian taxpayer. Under the present legislation deportees cannot be required to pay costs associated with their detention or removal even though they have accumulated a considerable amount of money in Australia by engaging in unauthorised employment or have valid tickets for travel out of Australia. In the period 1 July 1976 to 31 </para>
          <para class="block">December 1978, 2,157 deportations were effected. It is estimated that the requirement for deportees to pay costs of deportation will result in savings to the Commonwealth of over $200 per deportee for fares. In addition, I believe that the deterrent effect of the provision will be significant. Legislation in respect of deportation costs is already in force in a number of countries. New Zealand has legislation to cover this, as does Great Britain. </para>
          <para>The third significant measure dealt with by the Bill is the introduction of offences for temporary entrants and prohibited immigrants who engage in employment in Australia without authority. At present, visitors to Australia give an undertaking at the time of visa issue that they will not work in Australia, but it is not an offence for them to engage subsequently in employment. Similarly, it is not an offence for a prohibited immigrant to work in Australia. Most prohibited immigrants apprehended by departmental officials in the course of their investigations are either working or have been in employment in Australia. In addition, there is little doubt that many of the approximately 57,000 prohibited immigrants in Australia are working partly in order to sustain themselves. Some of what they earn is sent abroad to maintain families and relatives overseas. That is perhaps understandable but it represents a notable capital outflow instigated by people who are filling jobs which should otherwise be available to unemployed Australian residents. There must be limits to our community tolerance of such matters. </para>
          <para>Clause 4 of the Bill will provide for the grant of a temporary entry permit subject to conditions relating to work. Clause 19 will provide for an offence where a person contravenes a condition in respect of work or where a prohibited immigrant performs any work in Australia without the written permission of an authorised officer of the Department. The penalty for this offence will be a fine not exceeding $1,000. The Bill also provides in clause 19 for new offences where a person makes a false statement in connection with an application for work or uses a forged authority for work. These offences will attract a maximum penalty of $1,000. The introduction of these offences is indicative of the gravity with which the Government views this growing problem. I do point out that the Government&#39;s attitude is consistent with that in many other countries, including New Zealand and Canada where it is also an offence for unauthorised persons to engage in employment. </para>
          <para>The fourth significant change picks up the fact that the existing penalties in the Migration Act have remained unchanged since the legislation was passed in 1958. The Bill increases the penalties specified in the Act to bring them into line with current levels of penalties for equally serious offences in other Commonwealth legislation. The Bill also introduces three new penalties, two of which I have already referred tonamely, when carriers convey people to Australia without proper documentation and when temporary entrants and prohibited immigrants work without authority. The other penalty relates to deportees who return to Australia without authority. </para>
          <para>Honourable senators will recall that on 10 August 1978 the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr MacKellar)</inline> announced that from that date prohibited immigrants who had been deported from Australia for any reason would be barred from re-entering Australia for a period of five years, except in the most compelling circumstances. If deportees gain re-entry to Australia by subterfuge, it is only proper that they should be liable to a penalty as well as second deportation at their expense if possible. The Government cannot, in the public interest, tolerate breaches of our entry requirements and controls. I consider the penalty of $1,000 or six months imprisonment to be reasonable punishment and a prospective deterrent. Other provisions in the Bill are of a technical nature, designed to improve control mechanisms and to correct deficiencies. They do not introduce major changes in policy or vary the basic concepts currently embodied in the legislation. </para>
          <para>The dominance of international travel by fast jet aircraft and the large increase in the number of arrivals since the present Act was introduced have revealed a number of deficiencies in control procedures that were unknown or not exploitable in the more leisurely days of sea-travel or early international air travel. The demands on control procedures are aggravated in Australia because, due to our geographical position and airport curfews, arrivals and departures are not evenly spaced throughout the day, taking place within relatively short peak periods with necessarily brief tum-around periods. </para>
          <para>A number of these provisions arose out of the recommendations of a management review which reported on its investigation of immigration policies and procedures in July of last year. The review conducted by a consultant, the Public Service Board and the Department, examined problems confronting the Department and their causes, and evaluated options for changes to the Migration Act. The Government believes that the Bill will provide for a considerable increase in control capacity while new immigration legislation is being developed. These are measures which deserve, and I believe will enjoy, bipartisan support. The impact will not be discriminatory and nor is that the intent. I commend the Bill to honourable senators. </para>

            <para>- The Opposition has given notice of a series of amendments which obviously will preclude dealing with the Bill as a whole. The only comment I wish to make at this stage of the Committee is that, having been through those amendments, it is clear that although they are many in number, they cover broad subject matters. For example, the twocomponent force proposition encompasses quite a number of the amendments. As with other debates and a debate yesterday, although it will not be possible to group all those amendments together on each occasion, because they do not lie necessarily in sequence, we might be able to deal with the matters of principle involved in such amendments, indicating perhaps as we arrive at each that subsequent amendments are encompassed by the current debate. I make that suggestion in the interests of getting both a coherent and reasonably-timed debate. </para>

            <para>-The amendment to clause 6 seeks to leave out paragraph (d) which contains a reference to commissioned and noncommissioned protective service officers. The amendment to clause 7 deals with the components of the proposed Australian Federal Police. These clauses related to the dual nature of the proposed police force as the Minister stated a minute ago. Let me briefly retrace some of the history of this matter. The Senate will recall that the Labor Government first proposed an amalgamation of Commonwealth police forces in 1975 on the grounds that it would increase operational efficiency. When the Australia Police Bill was brought in in 1975 it met strong opposition from the Liberal Party. It was eventually blocked. It was after the report by <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Robert</inline> Mark consequent upon the Sydney Hilton bombing that the idea of amalgamation was again recommended. </para>
          </talk.start>
        </continue>
        <para>The Opposition still supports the notion of amalgamation but does not support the concept of a two-component police force. We regard it as being totally inconsistent with the aim of amalgamation. We say that the creation of what is effectively a two-class system within the police force will have a detrimental effect on morale and efficiency within the proposed Australian Federal Police. In support of that viewsometimes these things can be overstated but we do not think so in this case- the Opposition has had extensive consultations with officers of the Commonwealth Police Officers Association. I am sure the government parties have also. Views have been put very strongly to us on this issue. The Association is particularly opposed to the notion of a two-component system. It is opposed because it sees the proposed new Federal Police offering a career for police officers. We are concerned that people who choose the career of a police officer receive identical training but will have to face the prospect of being relegated to what is in effect a sub-level of police force activity. As we understand the Government&#39;s intention, the protective service component will carry out duties such as guarding embassies and buildings and will not, for example, be involved in anti-terrorist operations should that question arise. These will be carried out by the ordinary members of the police force as distinct from the protective service component. </para>
        <para>We cannot over-emphasise the notion of people entering the police force as a career and then being stratified, as it were, in mid-stream by the provisions of this Bill which, if carried into effect will not in any way offer an incentive to the career aspect of promotion and so on which we would see as logically flowing in a force which has a single purpose and identity. The old saying that &#39;a policeman&#39;s lot is not a happy one&#39; would apply to the ordinary members of the force. It is our impression that those who are on protective duties will take the view that they are not really policemen at all in the true sense of the term. </para>
        <para>In regard to the recommendations of <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Robert</inline> Mark, I just mention that he suggested that a whole range of second-level protective functions could be carried out by civilian employees. First of all, we are critical of that notion because the development of civilian protective police forces is proliferating in most Western countries now. That really lays the ground for a whole new collection of mini-para-fascists who enjoy the same view of themselves as do parking attendants and everybody else in that category. We think that that is generally undesirable. What the Commonwealth Police Officers Association is concerned about particularly is that the Bill seems to embody a government resolve to effect that precise purpose. That is a criticism which the Government really has failed to answer in any discussion of the Bill at this stage. </para>

We say quite categorically that, in the Opposition &#39;s view, if would be better to have a unified force in which, according to age, qualification, expertise and matters of that kind which normally lead to promotion, people would perform different functions rather than our building into the force those two separate components right from the beginning.

          <para>- I support <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Button</inline> in this very important and central question on the operation of the Australian Federal Police Bill. The matter has been canvassed extensively, not only now by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Button</inline> but also in the second reading debates both here and in the other place. I merely succinctly repeat the point which I made last night in the second reading debate, that is, that the provisions for a twocomponent force contained in this Bill in reality will create a two-class force, one of Brahmins and the other of Untouchables. That result is not in accordance with the recommendations of <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Robert</inline> Mark. It certainly is not in accordance with the wishes of the Commonwealth Police Officers Association and to the extent that it will militate against both the morale and the effectiveness of the new force, it is not in the interests of the Australian people. </para>

          <para>- I draw the attention of the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Chaney)</inline> to a submission which was made by the South Australian branch of the Commonwealth Police Officers Association. I think that that Branch has prepared an interesting document relating to several clauses of the Bill, and expressing some concern about certain aspects of it. I do not think that the points raised are of major concern. I believe that the Minister has given due consideration to them. I understand that a lot of complaints which that branch might have will revolve around regulations. I understand also that those regulations have not been fully determined as yet, so I guess that a certain amount of flexibility exists already for resolving some of the problems which it might have simply by introducing appropriate regulations. But I suggest to the Minister that he might care to refer to these matters as they arise, clause by clause. If he can respond to them briefly I will be satisfied with that. </para>

          <para>-The amendments which we are now considering overlap with other amendments we will be dealing with later and centre on the objection which the Opposition has mentioned in the motion which it moved last night as an amendment to the motion that the Bill be now read a second time. The Opposition sought the creation of a single component force. I will try to cover the matters which have been raised in a way which might enable us to simply refer to the debate we have had on subsequent amendments. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>There is no disagreement between the Government and the Opposition on one of the fundamental points made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Button,</inline> namely, that it is important that people should be able to enter the police force as a career. I will be explaining why the Government believes that that is achieved by this legislation. It is quite clear that the morale of the force and, indeed, the sorts of people who are attracted into the force, are affected by the sort of considerations mentioned by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Button.</inline> I assure him and, indeed other honourable senators and the existing police forces that these are matters of concern to the Government. </para>
        <para>I noted too, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Button&#39;s</inline> comments about not liking the idea of civil guards. I do no more than note it. It may assist his Western Australian colleague, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Mcintosh,</inline> to respond to the views which have been put to him by the Western Australian branch of the Commonwealth Police Officers Association. The Government&#39;s reason for not picking up what was not a recommendation of <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Robert</inline> Mark, but something which he suggested might be given consideration, has already been explained, I think, both in this chamber and in the other place. But it is basic to government policy for the Bill that it should be what is called a two-component force. We have modified the suggestion, after giving it consideration as requested by <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Robert</inline> Mark, that civil guards do protective service functions for a number of reasons. The Government would not be able to retain the thousand or so Commonwealth policemen who broadly could be said to be engaged in the sorts of duties which are described and then to employ an additional 1,000 civil guards. That would not be a sensible approach to the matter and certainly would be most costly. If we had faced the prospect of turning over such work to civil guards and if we thought that was an acceptable solution, of necessity it would have put at risk a very large number of jobs which obviously, would not be the wish of the Government. More importantly, the Government required a police protective security function to continue for such areas as defence, munitions and other security risk government installations, embassies and official residences. It is very easy to downgrade the importance and the sensitivity of that sort of work but if honourable senators reflect on it a little, they will see that there are aspects which might be called the &#39;guarding&#39; function which go to the very serious and important responsibilities of the Federal Government. It is responsible for the security of foreign diplomatic personnel. Honourable senators will know that that is not a token matter any more. We are mercifully free from many incidents taking place but there have been incidents involving foreign diplomats. That tends to underline the significance and importance of that work and why it ought to be done by people who are responsible to government rather than a body of some private nature. </para>

            <para>- I think there are important career questions which arise in the point raised by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Button.</inline> Some people might be quite happy to be in that position but others obviously would want more job mobility, and I will come to that in a moment. In fact the Government decided to provide general mobility between the two components. I do not wish to discuss in detail provisions of the Bill which are not before us. However, clauses  25  and  26  of the Bill provide for mobility between the two components subject to the usual principles of competence and qualifications. Of course, those principles would apply internally anyway in the manner in which people would be transferred into other sorts of work. But I direct the Committee &#39;s attention to those two clauses. </para>
          </talk.start>
        </continue>
        <para>I also direct the Committee&#39;s attention to clause  73  which relates to the Government&#39;s decision to provide preferential opportunity of mobility between components for present police as against recruits. If someone who is already in one of the components wishes to apply for a job in another he will receive preference against an outside applicant. This provision underlies the Government&#39;s wish to meet the sorts of needs that were raised by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Button.</inline> Training opportunities will also be provided, as was indicated in the second reading speech, to enable people to achieve competence and qualifications to enable transfer to various jobs that they might wish to undertake. </para>
        <para>These are the fundamental reasons why the Government resists the Opposition&#39;s amendments of this sort. Ministerial assurances were given that job career prospects and terms and conditions of service would not be at risk. The Government believes that this objective is achieved by the provisions to which I have referred. The Government does not intend a lower status for one component but a different function and the allocation of detailed functions and personnel to components will be a matter to be determined by the Commissioner. For that reason the Government will be opposing the amendment to clause  6,  which is the clause before the Committee at the moment. </para>

          <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Jessop</inline>suggested a course of action which I think is very sensible.

        <para class="block">The effect of the amendment is at the end of subclause  (2)  to leave out the words &#39;Commissioner and the Commissioner of Police (however designated) of that State&#39; and to insert the words Minister and the appropriate Minister of that State&#39;. Clause  8 (2)  deals with the question of arrangements between the Commonwealth and the States in relation to the investigations of offences applying to Commonwealth places as they are denned under the Commonwealth Places (Application of Laws) Act  1970.  This Bill allows arrangements to be made in relation to the question of investigations of offences in and around Commonwealth places; it enables arrangements to be made between the Federal Commissioner of Police and a State commissioner of police as to how those investigations are carried out. This could be quite a substantial matter because important questions of the use of manpower and resources are involved in the decisions which have to be made regarding the investigations of those offences. That is the first concern of the Opposition. </para>
        <para>The second concern is that questions not only of the use of manpower and resources but also of Federal and State relations are involved in these decisions.

          <para>- The Government does not accept the amendment to this clause. Clause 8 deals with the provision of police services. In the view of the Government this is an operational matter between commissioners rather than a matter to be dealt with between politicians. It relates to the provision of services in relation to a Commonwealth place in a State, being services by way of the investigation of offences against the laws of that State.

        </motion>
        <para class="block">Clause 13 concerns the general administration and control of the Australian Federal Police. The Opposition&#39;s particular quarrel is with sub-clause (2) of that clause which relates to the specific question of the nature and extent of the directions which can be given by the Minister or the government of the day to the Chief Commissioner. The crucial element, perhaps above all others in the establishment, operation and maintenance of any police force, is the matter of the definition of the relationship between the commissioner on the one hand and the government on the other hand. The Senate need hardly be reminded just how sensitive a question this has been in recent Australian history. It has arisen in such contexts as the resignation of Commissioner Whitrod in Queensland, the very recent retirement of Commissioner Wood in New South Wales and the spectacularly controversial dismissal of Commissioner Salisbury in South Australia. </para>
        <para>It is also a question which has arisen again very recently in the context of relations between the Government and the head of its Federal Narcotics Bureau, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Harvey</inline> Bates. The Opposition believes that the basic principles which should govern the relationship between the Government and the head of the police agency in question are these: Firstly, the Government should certainly never in any circumstances give any direction to the commissioner, to the force, which is motivated in any way by party political bias. Secondly, the Government should not interfere with day-to-day administration and operational requirements in matters affecting the force. Thirdly, the notion of operational autonomy, which looms very large, of course, in the Mark report, and presumably in the Government&#39;s thinking in writing this Bill in the way it has, ought not in the Opposition&#39;s view to be attained at the cost of removing or weakening the principle of the accountability of police to the elected government of the day. The Opposition believes that in order to ensure that accountability there must be a general power, not only to hire and fire the commissioner and other police officers, but to give directions. Such a power, to give directions of all kinds, must be vested in the government of the day. </para>
        <para>We notice, of course, that clause 13, as written, does to a certain extent vest in the Minister power to give directions. Clause 13(2) provides that the Minister may, after taking the advice of the Commissioner, give written directions to him with respect to &#39;the general policy to be pursued in relation to the performance of the functions of the Australian Federal Police&#39;. So the power vested and acknowledged in the Bill relates only to general policy matters, whatever that means. I make the point that the very expression &#39;general policy&#39; is one of the most uncertain connotation and is likely, in itself, quite apart from any other consideration, to give rise in practice to a degree of difficulty in working out the extent of its proper application in any particular case. The Opposition believes that it is inappropriate to seek to distinguish in this way between different kinds of directions. Accordingly, the amendment does not seek to make any such distinction, but simply states: </para>

        <para class="block">It is a general power that we propose to vest in the Minister- one of simply giving written directions. It is important to appreciate that putting matters in this way is not a Labor Party plot, not something which we have invented for scurrilous reasons of our own. We are referring here to something that is not at all unusual in Australian police legislation. In fact, to demonstrate how usual a provision of this kind is, I seek leave to incorporate in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> a table which summarises the main statutory provisions which apply in respect of State police commissioners in Australia. </para>

            <para>- A reading of that table shows that in five of the six States of Australia a general power to give directions is vested in the political arm of the Government. Only in Western Australia is there no such explicit statutory power at all. In three States, namely New South Wales, Queensland and Tasmania, the power to give directions is vested, without reservation or qualification, in the Minister in charge of police. In Victoria the same general power is vested, again without reservation, in the GovernorinCouncil. In South Australia, the fifth State in question, under statutory provisions which have applied since at least 1972, the power is vested in the Governor-in-Council, but with certain reservations. Those reservations are that any such direction, whatever its nature, be it of a general police kind or much more specific, shall be given </para>

        <para>by the Governor-in-Council, subject to a requirement by legislation that copies be immediately laid on the table of Parliament, if Parliament is sitting, and certainly immediately published in the <inline font-style="italic">Commonwealth of Australia Gazette.</inline> As a result, there is no question of any secret directions, perhaps motivated by some form of party political bias, being given. What the Government directs the Commissioner to do is entirely a matter of public record. Obviously that acts in practice as a disincentive to any tendency to misuse the power of direction. </para>
        <para>The Opposition believes the South Australian formula is a sensible and appropriate one, and one which best embodies the combination of the basic principles of accountability on the one hand and on the other hand the requirement that there be appropriate checks and balances ensuring that that accountability principle is not abused in practice. It is for those reasons that the Opposition moves the amendment in the terms in which it has been circulated and I hope that the Government will appreciate the force of the Opposition view on this and accept the amendment accordingly. </para>

          <para>- This is the second area where there is a substantial difference of viewpoint between the Government and the Opposition with respect to the shape of this Bill. In this area of the relationship between the Minister and the Commissioner, the Government has accepted the recommendation of <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Robert</inline> Mark that administratively a police force should be seen to be accountable to government, and operationally it should be seen to be as free as possible from political influence. It is provided in the Bill that the Commissioner should be operationally independent and administratively accountable to the Minister and the elected Government. Because of that difference of approach, the Government does not accept the amendment put forward by the Opposition. Clause 13(1) provides:  the Commissioner has the general administration of and control of the operations to the Australian Federal Police. </para>

        </quote>
        <para class="block">As I said in the second reading debate last night, in my view, that difference accords with the general public view in Australia as to how the police force should operate; namely, that the police should be responsible for the actual operation of the force and that the Government should simply determine the policy and not get involved in particular cases. </para>
        <para>A number of other matters were raised, not in Committee, but in the second reading debate. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Messner</inline> addressed himself to matters that were dealt with in the House of Representatives also, and in particular, the question of the privacy of individuals. The Minister representing the Attorney-General in the other place clarified the position in respect of privacy of individuals by informing the House of Representatives that he proposed to give written direction on general policy relating to dissemination of information which will protect the privacy of individuals, and that he would table that direction. He said further that the direction would be revised in the light of Government consideration of the Law Reform Commission report on privacy. In my view, the Minister&#39;s statement is helpful in alleviating at least some of the concern which has been expressed about this clause. The amendment generally is opposed by the Government. </para>

        <para class="block">In moving <inline font-style="italic">these</inline> amendments, might I note that the arguments applicable to these amendments are equally applicable to the amendments proposed to clauses 22 and 25, which appear as amendments ( 1 1 ), ( 1 2 ), ( 1 3 ) and ( 1 4). </para>
        <para>What the Opposition seeks to do with respect to these various provisions, which relate to the appointment and dismissal of the Commissioner and other officers, is to change all the references to &#39;Governor-General&#39; which appear in the clause to &#39;Governor-General in Council&#39;. The reason why we want to do that is to make it absolutely clear that this clause does not refer to any personal discretion vested in the Governor-General, but rather of an essentially political decision which is made in accordance with the advice rendered to the Governor-General by his elected Ministers. </para>
        <para>This matter was the subject of some discussion and some comment by the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Chaney)</inline> in the course of the second reading debate last night. The Opposition is of course aware of section 16A of the Acts Interpretation Act which reads in relevant part: </para>
        <quote>
          <para>Where, in an Act, the Governor-General is referred to, the reference shall, unless the contrary intention appears ... be read as referring to the Governor-General, . . . acting with the advice of the Executive Council. </para>
        </quote>
        <para class="block">We still, however, press the amendment. We do so not just because of any lingering sensitivity we might have- which obviously we do- arising out of the events of 1975 in respect of all matters connected with the Governor-General. It is because we believe that there are some quite genuine grounds for concern about the effects of the possible interpretation of these references in the police Bill to the Governor-General rather than the Governor-General in Council. There is quite a long line of common law cases, the best known of which in Australia is the case of Enever v. R in 1 905 in which the courts enunciated the principle that constables or police officers- peace officers as common law terminology tends to have it- are not public servants in the ordinary way, but exercise an independent authority which is derived from the very nature of their office. A variety of things flows from that common law characterisation, including the question of vicarious liability which we will come to later in this debate. </para>
        <para>A number of statutory inroads have been made in the common law doctrine but the situation is that unless the statutory provision in question is unequivocally clear, the common law characterisation prevails; that is, police officers are regarded as independent and not servants of the Crown or the government of the day in the ordinary way. It does not take much in the nature of a further extension of that common law reasoning to find oneself confronted with the kind of claim that was asserted by Commissioner Salisbury in South Australia that his allegiance as a commissioner was owed not to the government of the day as his employer, but owed directly to the Crown. He asserted that that allegiance was not in any sense qualified by any loyalty or subjection to the direction of the elected government of the day. Although this notion of Commissioner Salisbury was, of course, promptly and effectively quashed by Justice Roma Mitchell in her royal commission report on the Salisbury dismissal, it is apparent that it is a view-I put it, respectfully, in this way- that has some considerable currency in conservative establishments around Australia. The Opposition just makes the point that it is not beyond the realm of possiblity that a court comprised of judges, who might be taken by some people to be by and large fairly well locked into their conservative establishments, might be confronted with having to resolve this particular question. Such a court might take the view that the references to &#39;Governor-General&#39; in this Act should be looked at in the context of a police Bill creating a police force with all the common law baggage that is carried with it. The Opposition thus makes the point that it is not beyond the realms of possibility that a court might construe this as being one of those situations where in fact the Bill does reveal a contrary intention, that this is one of those situations where the Acts Interpretation Act does not apply and that the reference to the Governor-General should be read literally to refer to the the Governor-General exercising a personal discretion. The Opposition simply wants to put the matter beyond doubt. As we understand it, the Government seems not to disagree with us about what the section ought to mean. </para>
        <para>I take it that as far as the Government is concerned there is no resiling from the notion that this section is to be read as a reference to the Governor-General in Council. I notice that the Minister is nodding his head so I take it that there is that degree of agreement between us. I seek now to invite the Minister to demonstrate some of that grace and charm, for which he is justly well known and to accept the Opposition&#39;s amendment accordingly. </para>

          <para>- I had no doubt about the sincerity of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Evans&#39;s</inline> arguments until his last sentence. Having been assured in an earlier statement by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Evans</inline> that nothing he was putting forward was a Labor Party plot- a thought which had not crossed my mind- the rather flowery compliment has left me with very considerable doubts about everything he has put forward. However, he is correct in saying that this is not an area where the Government and the Opposition are saying that the effect should be different. The Government takes the view that the reference to the Governor-General in these clauses is to the Governor-General acting with the advice of the Executive Council, in accordance with section 16A of the Acts Interpretation Act, which was quoted by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Evans.</inline> I must say that until I heard that argument I had never thought of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Evans</inline> as a belt and braces man. It seems to me that not only is he seeking here both a belt and a set of braces, he is also trying to sew his trousers to his shirt.

          <para>- My understanding is that this is a fairly standard provision for this level of appointment. In fact, if one did not have this provision the Commissioner would be dismissable at pleasure. The Bill provides that he can be dismissed only for specified grounds, which are misbehaviour or physical or mental incapacity. There are then prohibitions about him engaging in paid employment outside the duties of his office and so on. It is a provision which essentially restricts rather than enlarges the Government&#39;s ability to take action against the Commissioner. </para>

        </motion><para class="block">Clause 32 in its present form provides that the Minister shall not make a determination except after obtaining the views of the Public Service Board, the Secretary to the Department of Industrial Relations and the Secretary to the Department administered by the Minister. It is conceded that those bodies which are referred to in the clause as it stands have some relevance to the making of a determination. Perhaps in the case of the Department of Industrial Relations it may be of only marginal relevance. It is considered by the Opposition that the more relevant persons concerned are the Commissioner himself and the secretaries of those associations representing the members whose terms or conditions are to be affected by the determination or agreement, namely, such a body as the Commonwealth Police Officers Association, as it now is. The reasons are simply stated in that this is a clause which deals with essentially an industrial relations matter. The making of a determination is a matter which, it would be hoped, would be arrived at by conciliation between the parties. To go ahead with this clause ignoring the association of the people directly concerned and ignoring the Commissioner who is also directly concerned is, in our view, an error. It is an error which characterises, if I may say so, the somewhat spastic activities of this Government in relation to industrial relations. We feel that it would be appropriate to include that provision in order that the most appropriate bodies and relevant persons are recognised for the purpose of this clause. </para>

          <para>- The Government does not accept this amendment. Clause 32 is intended only to specify the coordinating regulatory agencies of government which are involved in determining the government employment position for negotiation with the police associations and for arbitration proceedings. I hasten to add that, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Button</inline> surmised, it is envisaged that the usual process of negotiation of agreements will proceed. The associations will be intimately involved in that process. The associations do not fit into this provision, which is meant to indicate which agencies of government are involved in determining the Government &#39;s position. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>There is no way, of course, that the role of the associations could be removed by their not being mentioned in this clause. The appeal provisions ensure that if the Government proceeded in a unilateral manner there would be a recourse and that obviously would not be a sensible way for the Government to proceed. In practice, what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Button</inline> referred to will occur. It is not necessary to amend this clause to achieve it. The Commissioner is always free and able to advise on any matter affecting the police. In the light of this amendment we sought advice from the Commonwealth Police Officers Association. Its advice was that it was better not to have the Commissioner sharing statutory responsibility for the pay of the members of the police so as not to affect his major responsibility for command and discipline of them. </para>

          <para>-Clause 36 is a very lengthy provision. In view of the time available I do not wish to read it to the Minister for his enlightenment. It provides a promotion system. The Opposition, in some ways, regards the lack of an appeals system as a serious omission from the Bill. The 1 975 legislation provided specifically for a member of the force to appeal to a promotions appeals board if he felt that he should have been promoted in preference to another member. This is fairly usual practice in Public Service legislation. It is considered that the right of appeal against promotions is basic to anybody working in any area of the Public Service. The present Bill provides only the criteria to be considered in promotion. Those criteria are contained in clauses 36 and 40 (c). They enable the Government to do virtually what it likes, one suspects, in relation to promotion appeals by making regulations. </para>
        </talk.start></continue><para>It is our understanding that the Commonwealth Police Officers Association is concerned about this matter having, I think, been used to a promotion appeals system. It is for those reasons that we will move an amendment to replace clause 36 in order to provide a system of promotion appeals. If I may refer to clause 43, there is little understanding- or undertaking- so far as we know, about what regulations could be made and whether there would be prior consultation with the Commonwealth Police Officers Association under the provisions of that clause before regulations were made.

The appeal provisions are provided under clause 40 and I will be speaking perhaps at slightly greater length to that clause, lt is the object of this legislation not to vary the appeal rights which at present exist for the Commonwealth Police Force and the Australian Capital Territory Police Force. I will explain that further under clause 40. </para>

It is a proposal to add in line 14 the word &#39;voluntary&#39;, to make it clear that in this clause which deals with the regulation making power, the Government is empowered to legislate not as is presently provided simply for the early retirement from the Australian Federal Police of members who have attained the age of 55 years, but rather to ensure that the power of the Government is confined to making regulations with respect to the voluntary early retirement from the police force of members 55 years of age and above. The Opposition is particularly anxious to ensure that there does not sneak in here, through the aegis simply of the regulation making power, something akin to the Commonwealth employees legislation which we have recently debated in this Parliament, but which is not, of course, legislation dealing only with the subject of voluntary retirement. It deals very specifically with compulsory, or, as the euphemism has it, &#39;management initiated retirement&#39;. </para><para>It may or may not be the intention of the Government to have this provision applicable only to voluntary retirement situations. It is the belief of the Opposition that the regulation power, however, is wide enough to encompass situations of involuntary retirement. If that is what the Government has in mind, or what this provision is capable of achieving, we believe that the Government ought to come out and say so explicitly, and not just do it by the back door, which can be done under this regulation as it is now put together. So for that reason and in order, we hope, to clarify the matter and to confine the scope of this clause, we argue for the insertion of the word &#39;voluntary&#39; in paragraph (d) of clause 40. </para><para>The third matter dealt with in respect of clause 40 is the omission of paragraph (f), which provides for a power to make regulations in respect of disciplinary offences and disciplinary procedures. The reason for our seeking omission of paragraph (f) is simply that we provide for it in a much more elaborate and, we would argue, an effective and satisfactory way in amendments which are to be moved later in the context of complaints against police. It is for those reasons that I have moved the three amendments relating to this clause. </para>

          <para>- Clause 40 deals generally with the question of regulations which may make provision for various things. It also covers appeals. My advice is and the Government&#39;s view is that as the Bill is not creating or extending new police powers, it preserves the status quo of the present two police forces in this matter, and that is the way it should be. In other words, there is no proposition in this Bill to change the appelate rights of policemen as they exist at present. As far as promotions are concerned, the question of appeals will be dealt with by regulation, including the establishment of a promotions appeal board as provided for in paragraph (c) of this clause. These regulations are, of course, subject to review and disallowance by this chamber. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>In the area of discipline, the appeal provisions will be in regulations, including the establishment of a Disciplinary Board provided for in paragraph <inline font-style="italic">(f).</inline> That provision is the same as that laid down in respect of the present two forces. All the appeals in respect of transfer, retirement and retrenchment are provided for in clauses 38 and 39. The provisions in the Bill are the same as those in respect of the present two forces, and it is not proposed by the Government that that situation should be changed. With respect of those areas, the Minister for Administrative Services <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr McLeay)</inline> advised the House of Representatives that the Government will give serious consideration to the possibility of the provision of an appeal to an appropriate tribunal, not necessarily the Federal Police Arbitral Tribunal. </para>

        <para class="block">The first amendment relates to questions concerning rights of appeal. The Opposition believes that not only an association as here provided should have rights of appeal, but also a member aggrieved by a decision under clause 38 or clause 39. That is a reference to persons caught up by the retirement and the retrenchment provisions of the Bill. </para>
        <para>The second amendment relating to clause 46 is one that is consequential upon amendments which have been moved previously. It relates to the identification of the Governor-General as distinct from the Governor-General in Council. In the amendment to clause 46 (3) (a) it is also sought to remove t&#39;ie reference to the Commissioner. The clause would then make it possible for in fact appeals to be heard by the proposed Federal Police Arbitral Tribunal in respect of transfers which have been made by the Commissioner. </para>
        <para>The third matter in clause 46- again a very important one, not in terms of the length of the language but in terms of the effect it would have- is the amendment to clause 46 (3) (b). This amendment would have the effect of giving appeal rights to the Arbitral Tribunal in respect of retirements and dismissals, which is not presently the case. I think the reason why there should be appeal rights in these areas has been sufficiently canvassed in earlier debate. </para><continue><talk.start>

          <para>- In my comments to clause 40 I canvassed the points which have been raised in respect of this clause. The amendment numbered 46 is not acceptable. It proposes that there should be appeals to the Tribunal in respect of decisions made under clauses 38 and 39. The right of appeal exists already in the same form in the present legislation governing the police force. If there were a wrongful retirement or dismissal under clauses 38 and 39, a member could test it out in ordinary court. The Government will, as I have previously indicated, give serious consideration to the possibility of the provision of an appeal to an appropriate tribunal, not necessarily the Federal Police Arbitral Tribunal, to which clause 46 refers. The principles relating to the amendment numbered 47 have been dealt with earlier in argument. The Government opposes the proposed amendment to clause 48. It has not agreed to the previous amendment seeking appeal to the Federal Police Arbitral Tribunal under clauses 38 and 39. It is therefore necessary for the words that the amendment proposes to leave out to remain. </para>

        <para class="block">Each of these amendments incorporate various changes to the arbitration procedure to embody the substance of procedures suggested previously by the Opposition in respect of other members of the force. The object of these amendments is to make it possible clearly in a way that is not possible perhaps at the moment for an employee of the association in question to have representative rights before the Arbitrary Tribunal. At the moment the legislation is expressed simply as the right of a member or an officer of an association of employees. There is a situation which could arise whereby an advocate of such an association does not formally have either status but is rather an employee of the association. We have moved these amendments to cover that situation. </para>

( I ) The appointment of a person as a member, or the service of a person as a member, does not affect his tenure of a judicial office or office under an Act or his rank, title, status, precedence, salary, annual or other allowances or other rights or privileges as the holder of a judicial office or office under an Act and, for all purposes, his service as a member of the Tribunal shall be taken to be service as the holder of his judicial office or other office. &#34;(2) In this section, &#39;judicial office&#39; includes an office of magistrate in a Territory. &#34;114. Subject to this Division, a member holds office for such period, not exceeding 7 years, and on such terms and conditions, as are specified in the instrument of his appointment but is eligible for re-appointment. &#34;115. ( 1 ) A member, not being the holder of a judicial office, shall be paid such remuneration as the Remuneration Tribunal determines but, if no determination of that remuneration by that Tribunal is in operation, he shall be paid such remuneration as is prescribed. &#34;(2) A member shall be paid such allowances as are prescribed. &#34;(3) This section has effect subject to the Remuneration Tribunals Act 1973. &#34;(4) In this section, &#39;judicial office&#39; includes an office of magistrate in a Territory. &#34;116.

(1) Where the  President  no longer holds judicial office, the Governor-General in Council may terminate his appointment. &#34;(2) The termination of the appointment of a  President  under sub-section ( I ) does not prevent his reappointment as a  Deputy President.  &#34;(3) The  President  shall not be removed from office except as provided by this section. &#34;118. ( I ) Where a  Deputy President  no longer holds a judicial office or the office of  Deputy President  of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal, the Governor-General in Council may terminate his appointment. &#34;(2) A  Deputy President  shall not be removed from office except as provided by this section. &#34; 1 1 9. ( 1 ) This section applies to a member other than the  President  or a  Deputy President.  &#34;(2) The Governor-General in Council may remove from office a member to whom this section applies on an address praying for his removal on the ground of proved misbehaviour or incapacity being presented to the Governor-General in Council by each House of the Parliament in the same session of the Parliament. &#34;(3) The Governor-General in Council may suspend such a member from office on the ground of proved misbehaviour or incapacity. &#34;(4) Where the Governor-General in Council suspends a member from office under sub-section (3), the Minister shall cause a statement of the grounds of the suspension to be laid before each House of the Parliament within 7 sitting days of that House after the suspension. &#34;(5) Where such a statement has been laid before a House of the Parliament, that House may, within 15 sitting days of that House after the day on which the statement has been laid before it, by resolution, declare that the member should be removed from office and, if each House so passes such a resolution, the Governor-General in Council shall remove the member from office. &#34;(6) If, at the expiration of 15 sitting days of a House of the Parliament after the day on which the statement has been laid before that House, that House has not passed such a resolution, the suspension terminates. &#34;(7) The suspension of a member from office under this section does not affect any entitlement of the member to be paid remuneration and allowances. &#34;(8) If a member to whom this section applies becomes bankrupt, or if the affairs of such a member are being dealt with under Part X of the Bankruptcy Act 1966, the Governor-General in Council shall terminate his appointment. &#34;(9) If a member to whom this section applies ceases to possess the qualifications necessary for his appointment, the Governor-General in Council shall terminate his appointment. &#34;( 10) A member to whom this section applies shall not be removed or suspended from office except as provided by this section. &#34; 1 20. A member may resign his office by writing under his hand delivered to the Governor-General in Council but the resignation does not have effect until it is accepted by the Governor-General in Council. &#34;Sub-Division 3- Staff of Tribunal &#34;121.(1) There shall be a Registrar of the Tribunal and such  Deputy  Registrars of the Tribunal as are appointed in accordance with this section. &#34;(2) The Registrar and the  Deputy  Registrars shall be appointed by the Minister and have such duties and functions as are provided by this Division and by the regulations and such other duties and functions as the  President  directs. &#34;(3) The Registrar and the  Deputy  Registrars, and the staff necessary to assist them, shall be persons appointed or employed under the Public Service Act 1 922. &#34;Sub- Division 4- Constitution and Powers of Tribunal &#34; 122.

( 1 ) The Tribunal shall, for the purpose of the exercise of its powers in relation to a matter, be constituted by one member. &#34;(2 ) The Tribunal constituted by one member may sit and exercise the powers of the Tribunal notwithstanding that the Tribunal constituted by another member is at the same time sitting and exercising the powers of the Tribunal. &#34; 1 24.

( 1 ) The Tribunal may, at any time during the hearing by it of a charge under section 124, or of an appeal under section 125, recommend to the Commissioner that the police officer concerned, if he is not at that time suspended from duty, be so suspended pending the determination of the charge or of the appeal and, where the Tribunal so recommends, the Commissioner shall suspend the police officer from duty accordingly. &#34;(2) The officer is entitled to be paid salary during the period of his suspension. &#34;(3) The Tribunal may, at any time during or after the hearing, recommend to the Commissioner that the suspension be removed and, where the Tribunal so recommends, the Commissioner shall remove the suspension. &#34; 127. ( 1 ) The Tribunal may inquire into a matter relating to the Police Force that is referred to it by the Minister. &#34;(2) If the Minister so directs, the Tribunal shall be constituted, for the purposes of the inquiry, by the  President  or by a  Deputy President.  &#34;(3) The Minister may arrange for counsel to be engaged to assist the Tribunal in connection with the inquiry. &#34;(4) Where the Tribunal is not assisted by counsel, the Commissioner shall, if he is requested by the Tribunal to do so, arrange for a member of the Internal Discipline Section, or for an appropriate police officer other than such a member, to assist the Tribunal in connection with the inquiry. &#34;(5) Upon completing its inquiry, the Tribunal shall report to the Minister the results of the inquiry. &#34; 128. The Tribunal may, at any time during the hearing of a proceeding, refer a matter relevant to the proceeding to the Commissioner for investigation by the Internal Discipline Section and, where it does so, the Commissioner shall cause the Section to investigate the matter. &#34; 129. ( 1 ) Where, after a complaint has been made or referred to the Ombudsman concerning action taken by a police officer, a charge of breach of discipline is referred to the Tribunal for hearing and determination, the complainant may, by leave of the Tribunal, appear before the Tribunal on the hearing of the charge. &#34;(2) The Registrar shall, unless it is impracticable to do so, notify the complainant of the time and place at which the Tribunal will sit to hear the charge and that he is entitled to seek leave of the Tribunal to appear upon the hearing of the charge. &#34;(3) The complainant may, if the Tribunal grants him leave to appear- </para>

(1) Subject to sub-section (2), the hearing of a proceeding before the Tribunal shall be in public. &#34;(2) Where the Tribunal is satisfied that it is desirable to do so in the public interest or by reason of the confidential nature of any evidence or matter, the Tribunal may- </para>

As a further amendment, after this one is dealt with, I propose to move the Opposition&#39;s amendment No. 53 which relates to vicarious liability or torts committed by police officers but I do not propose to deal with that now. I will deal with that separately. The question of complaints against the police is an extremely important one. The amendment now before the Committee is quite  possibly one of the longest single amendments ever moved in this Parliament occupying as it does some 43 pages of typescript. Again I do not detain the Committee by reading it. I would hope that although we are obviously pressed for time we could give this proposed new Part slightly less cursory attention than it received during the Committee stage in the other place when in fact the whole of this amendment was dealt with by that chamber in three and a half minutes. The subject matter is extremely important and although I will not trespass on the time of the Committee for very long I think this amendment needs just a little less cursory treatment than that. </para><para>The amendment is taken directly from the draft Bill appended to the ninth report of the Australian Law Reform Commission entitled Complaints Against the Police: Supplementary Report&#39;. The circumstances which gave rise to the production of that report and the relationship it bears to the earlier report of the Commission on this same subject have been dealt with in my speech in the second reading debate and I do not propose to go over that ground again. What I do propose is very briefly to summarise the substance of this amendment and explain to the Committee and the Government why it is that we of the Opposition think it ought to be adopted. The main thing that this amendment is seeking to do is to introduce new machinery for the resolution of complaints, whether internally or more importantly externally, generated against the police. The machinery proposed involves the use of three distinct instruments to infuse elements of independence into the complaint determination process. Those three elements are respectively: The Ombudsman; a special unit of the police force; and a police tribunal. It is proposed that the Ombudsman would have the position, for a start, of neutral territory for the receipt of complaints and further to have the role of investigator of last resort. He also will have the role of public guardian, as the Law Reform Commission put it in its report, to require certain public complaints to be scrutinised in a public forum. </para><para>The second instrument in the machinery is a special unit of the police force which in the draft amendments is entitled &#39;the internal discipline section&#39; and which is modelled on the famous A- 10 unit of Scotland Yard. It is proposed that this unit be separate and distinct from the main body of the police operations and, for that reason, it will have a greater degree of efficiency and accumulated experience and independence in dealing with complaints. The third element is the proposed new police tribunal to deal with matters that go to the stage of a charge being laid, which tribunal is to be constituted by a single member and the  president  of which, it proposed, will be a judge. </para><para>Briefly the machinery which is proposed to deal with complaints, however initiated, is as follows: First of all, as to the receipt of complaints, it is proposed in our amendments that complaints be received either orally or in writing and that they be made either to the police, as is the case at the moment, or as well to the neutral territory constituted by the Ombudsman. So members of the public who presently might be deterred at the prospect of complaining to a policeman about another policeman&#39;s behaviour are given the opportunity by this Bill to complain directly to the Ombudsman. Secondly, as to the investigations of complaint so received, it is proposed that normally such investigations be conducted by the proposed internal discipline section of the new force. However, by our amendment the Ombudsman would be given a special discretion in four specifically described cases to undertake an independent investigation of his own. These cases include circumstances where, firstly, the complaint involves a member of the police force who is senior to all members of the internal discipline section; secondly, the complaint involves a member of the section itself; thirdly, the complaint is related to a matter that the Ombudsman has already investigated; and, fourthly, the Ombudsman is simply of the opinion that it is in the public interest that the complaint should be investigated by him. Those are the proposals relating to the investigation of complaints. </para><para>The next machinery matter is the question of actually bringing charges that arise out of such an investigation. It is proposed in this amendment that if a criminal charge suggests itself, that should be brought and dealt with in the ordinary way- through the courts. If it is thought more appropriate that something in the nature of a disciplinary charge be brought against the alleged offending officer, such disciplinary charges are to be dealt with by the police tribunal. The decision as to how to handle a matter and whether to bring a charge is left normally within the discretion of the police force itself by this legislation. But there is provision for the Ombudsman, where a difference arises in respect of the proper way of dealing with an externally initiated complaint, to ensure unilaterally that that charge is laid and proceeds to be determined by the tribunal. </para><para>Fourthly, and lastly, I refer to provisions relating to the operation of the tribunal itself. In the amendments there are a very large number of provisions dealing with this. Let me simply deal with the more important of them as quickly as I can. The composition of the tribunal, as I have already mentioned, is proposed to be a single member judicial-type tribunal presided over by a judge. The proceedings of the tribunal are proposed normally to be conducted in public. Further, it is proposed that the penalties should be decided by the tribunal itself but acting in this case with the assistance of a senior police officer as an assessor. Further, it is provided that important decisions of the tribunal be published with due consideration nonetheless of orders that might be made concerning confidentiality. Finally, it is provided that there be a right of appeal to the Australian Federal Court on matters of law. </para><para>A very elaborate network of provisions is proposed by the Opposition in this very lengthy amendment. I take it that it is unnecessary to labour the point to the Committee as to the crucial importance of having a proper and balanced complaint resolution system in which the public can have full confidence. Events in Queensland, as demonstrated by the findings of the Lucas committee, in Victoria, as demonstrated by the findings of the Beach inquiry, in New South Wales and in most other parts of Australia have demonstrated just how grave can be both the allegations and the findings that can be made in respect of those allegations and how unsatisfactory the existing complaint resolution process is. </para><para>It would be fair to say that in the Commonwealth arena- the operations of the Commonwealth Police Force and the Australian Capital Territory Police Force, which are to be amalgamated into the new Australian Federal Police- there has been a lesser incidence of complaints and a greater degree of public trust. Nonetheless, the Opposition believes that there can be no reason whatsoever for failing to implement, indeed right from the outset of the operation of this new force, as <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Robert</inline> Mark himself recommended, a proper systematic set of machinery for dealing with the determination of complaints, particularly complaints laid by members of the public. </para><para>We have had an undertaking from the Government that something in the nature of legislation on this subject will be introduced at some unspecified time in the future. It is the view of the Opposition that the Australian Law Reform Commission&#39;s recommendations, themselves the subject of enormously wide consultation and lengthy deliberation, represent a model balanced statutory formula for which there is no excuse whatsoever for the Government not accepting as a package as written and incorporating into this legislation now. The Oppositions moves accordingly. </para>

        <para class="block">As I mentioned with respect to an earlier amendment, the common law position, as has been established in the Enever case and other cases, is that police officers are not regarded as either employees or as agents of the Crown which employs them. The result is that police officers are treated by the common law as being personally liable for any injury which may be wrongfully caused by them in the execution of their duty. Whilst it has been argued that this concentrates wonderfully the minds of police officers and acts as a disincentive to misbehaviour on their part, for a long time it has been apparent that that particular rule indeed is capable of causing very great injustice. </para>
        <para>In the first place, in situations in which an injured party can identify the police offender in question and actually can win a case against that officer, that victory might well prove quite hollow and meaningless if the police officer in question is of limited means. In those circumstances it is a matter of simply waiting upon the Commonwealth to make some ex gratia or grace and favour payment, which it is not obliged to do and which it may or may not be of a mind to make in the particular case to satisfy the damages award. Furthermore, in a situation in which the injured person cannot identify the offending police officer- that is not an unknown situation; for example, when a scuffle develops and the officer in question is in plainclothes or is wearing insufficient identification, or there is a possibility of confusion between that officer and another officer- under the present rules the injured party effectively is denied any form of legal redress. </para>
        <para>It is apparent that that situation, which presently is the law with respect to police officers, is quite out of line with that which now prevails everywhere in other areas of government service and, indeed, everywhere else in the economy, where general statutory provisions relating to the implementation of vicarious liability are now in fact universal and have been long established. Accordingly, the Opposition agrees with the Australian Law Reform Commission, whose recommendations again we adopt, this time without any drafting modifications of our own, so I think that in this case the drafting will prove to be entirely satisfactory. The amendment I moved is to the effect that there should be an explicit statutory provision which makes the Commonwealth Government vicariously liable for the torts of its police officers. The recommendations of the Commission which we have incorporated in our amendment again have been the subject of extensive inquiry and consultation. They seem to have universal support from the Government; certainly they have it from the police officers; and they have it from the community at large. Again, there would appear to be no reason whatsoever for the opportunity not to be taken to incorporate in this legislation this long overdue reform. </para>

          <para>-by leave- <inline font-weight="bold">Mr President,</inline> I wish to make a personal explanation. I feel I was misrepresented this morning by the Minister for Science and the Environment <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Webster)</inline> in his reply at the end of Question Time to a question I asked on Wednesday last. In the course of that reply the Minister also misled the Senate. I raise this matter today because our proceedings are being broadcast and the issue in question is of great importance to the listening audience and, indeed, to the public at large. Furthermore, my veracity has been questioned. The question I asked is in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> of 6 June and states: </para>

        <quote>
          <para>My question, like that asked by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gietzelt,</inline> relates to the serious effects that lead levels in petrol appear to be having on thehealth of Australian children. In view of recent statements in the media attributed to the petroleum industry that it would cost more than5c a litre to reduce existing lead levels and a counter claim by Professor Lloyd Smythe, Professor of Analytical Chemistry at the University of New South Wales, that it would cost less than1c a litre, will the Minister for Science and the Environment ask his Department to research this matter, inform the Senate of the result and issue an informed public statement as soon as possible? </para>
        </quote>
        <para class="block">This question was taken on notice and I stress to honourable senators that the reference in my question was to &#39;recent statements in the media&#39;. This morning the Minister for Science and the Environment <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Webster)</inline> stated in his reply that the actual figure referred to by the industry was5c a gallon, not 5c a litre, hence there was no cause for disagreement, 5c a gallon being roughly1c a litre. This clearly imputed that I had misled the Senate in the terms of my question, either deliberately or through carelessness. As a result, I will quote from an article which appeared in the <inline font-style="italic">Sydney Morning Herald</inline> on 5 June and which referred to a report concerning Professor Lloyd Smythe and <inline font-weight="bold">Dr Freeman</inline> of the </para>
        <para class="block">Department of Pediatrics, Prince of Wales Hospital. The article states: </para>

        <quote>
          <para>Professor Smythe said a chemical engineer from Union Carbide had said the cost could be less than1ca litre. </para>
        </quote>
        <para class="block">Since this morning both I and the <inline font-style="italic">Sydney Morning Herald</inline> have carefully checked this matter. In fact, the statement made, as stated last Friday, referred to 5c a litre, not 5c a gallon as stated by the Minister this morning. I may say that I have checked that statement back to its highly reputable source. This matter is very important because of the effect on the health of children. It seems to me strange that the Department of Science and the Environment should presumably have advised the Minister to answer the question in the way he did. I have been here all week and I also feel it was less than fair to me that the Minister did not check this matter with me before he delivered the answer he did this morning knowing full well that his answer was being broadcast. This imputed quite baldly that I was careless or inaccurate and that the <inline font-style="italic">Sydney Morning Herald,</inline> from which I obtained the information, was also one or both of those things. </para>
        <para>Finally, accuracy in this matter is vital. It is obviously very important to the public whether they will have to pay 5c a litre more or lc a litre more for petrol that does not harm the health of as many as 20 per cent of all children in our cities. I quote again from the result of Professor Smythe &#39;s survey. It states: </para>

I personally believe it to be wrong that this matter should be judged on economic grounds at all. I do not think that health hazards - </para>

          <para>- by leave- I realise the time and I do not think this is a point for debate. I acknowledge that the honourable senator has made some comment in this regard. I can assure the honourable senator that when he asked me a question, I think two days ago, I attempted immediately to get a response, not from within the area of science but from the appropriate authority within government which has the responsibility for lead content in petrol. My understanding was that that was the Department of National Development. That Department gave me an answer to the honourable senator&#39;s question. It is impossible for me at Question Time to give on alert that I am going to give an answer or additional answer to the question which is raised. I did give an additional answer at the end of the Question Time today. The honourable senator raised the question of the importance and cost of lead content. Certainly I will seek that information. I think it is unfair to say that I misled anyone or that I misled the honourable senator. </para>

            <para>- I take the opportunity afforded me under Standing Orders to raise a matter on the first reading of these Bills. This is not the first time that I have raised this matter in the Senate. I wish to refer to the plight that is being experienced at present by kindergartens in South Australia and the concern that is being expressed by the Kindergarten Union of South Australia. This is not the first time that I have had to raise this matter in the Senate. On 4 May last year, I asked the Minister responsible, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guilfoyle,</inline> a question in relation to the way in which the Government had altered its funding for kindergartens. I pointed out to her the plight being experienced at that time by the Oakbank Kindergarten in the Adelaide Hills. On 10 May, I again raised the same matter with the Minister. I was not satisfied with the answer that I was given on either of those occasions. On 1 1 May, I again raised this question with the Minister. Again, not being satisfied with the answer I received to my request for the Government to spell out its policy in this area, I made a rather lengthy speech in this place on 29 May 1978 giving chapter and verse to the Senate the way in which kindergartens in South Australia were suffering under the changed policy of this Government as compared with the situation under the Whitlam Government. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>I will be as brief as I can. However, this is the last occasion on which I can again make a plea on behalf of the Kindergarten Union of South Australia before the Government brings down its Budget on 21 August. Of course, between now and then the Government will be considering what finance is available. On behalf of the Kindergarten Union of South Australia, and no doubt on behalf of all kindergarten unions in Australia which are suffering the same plight, I make the plea to the Government to reconsider its attitude and to make more money available for this very wonderful cause, that is, for preschools in Australia. </para>
          <para>I point out briefly that in December 1972 the Whitlam Government announced in a pre-election speech that pre-school education would be made available within six years to every child. That was a promise we made and a promise we endeavoured to keep. In December 1975 the present Government came to office, although there had been an election in the meantime. The Liberal-National Country party&#39;s election policy of that time stated: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>We believe that pre-school education has important social and educational functions . . . </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">In February 1976 the Minister for Social Security, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guilfoyle,</inline> issued a Press statement which stated:   . . I would like to point out that the former Government&#39;s policy of providing 75 per cent cost of salaries of agreed staff in pre-schools, provided they confirm that they extend and integrate their activities to cover other areas of family need, will continue. </para>
          <para class="block">On 29 May the Minister said to me that there had been no change in the Government&#39;s policy in relation to pre-schools. But then the Government changed its policy from direct funding of the State governments for pre-schools to what it termed block funding. If we look at the 1975-76 Budget Speech of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Hayden</inline> we find under the heading of education and the sub-heading of pre-schools and child care in the States that in 1973-74 the actual expenditure on pre-schools and child care in the States was $6.8m, that in the next year the actual expenditure was $45. 6m and that for the year of that Budget- that is, 1975-76- the Labor Government estimated that it would expend $74m, which represented an increase of $28.4m over its previous Budget. Honourable senators know that due to many happenings at that time, particularly in the Senate, the Labor Government was not able to put its Budget into operation. The 1977-78 Budget Speech of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Howard</inline> shows that there has been a complete turn around in the funding arrangements for kindergartens. Page 87 of that Budget Speech, under the heading &#39;Children&#39;s Services&#39; reads: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>The Commonwealth provides capital and recurrent assistance for pre-school and child care projects including home care, vacation and after-school care projects. Assistance is provided through the State Governments and directly to organisations concerned with pre-school and child care activities. </para>
            <para>Since I January 1 977, assistance to the States for the recurrent costs of pre-school services has been provided in the form of a block grant, subject to certain broad requirements concerning priority of access. An amount of $39m was provided to the States by way of block grants in 1 977-78. </para>

            <para>The Government has decided that $32. 75m will be paid to the States by way of block grants in 1978-79 and that this will represent the total Commonwealth contribution to preschools in the States, for both capital and recurrent purposes. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">Let us examine the present situation. I cannot speak for the other States, but I can speak for South Australia. The legislation and the Budget of the Labor Government, insofar as it was able to go, provided that the Commonwealth would fund approximately 70 per cent of the cost of pre-schools and the State Government would provide 30 per cent. Of course, we made a solemn promise to the electorate that by 1980 preschools would be fully funded. We find now that the reverse has happened. The South Australian Government now has to find 70 per cent of the funds to operate its pre-schools and the Commonwealth, through its block grants system, is finding only 30 per cent. This has placed a great strain on the Kindergarten Union and the people who endeavour, through their own fund raising efforts, to keep pre-schools going in South Australia. The South Australian Kindergarten Union is making a plea to the Government to reconsider its attitude. This plea is made not only on behalf of the parents but also on behalf of the children who need pre-school education, which </para>

          <para class="block">That petition is circulating among concerned parents throughout South Australia and should be sufficient advance warning to the Government that South Australian parents are vitally concerned about its policy in regard to preschool children. </para>
          <para>I realise that the time available is short but I wish to relate briefly some of the history of the pre-school situation. In 1972, the Australian Government first promised to make pre-school education available to every Australian child within 6 years. In 1974 the Prime Minister further promised that this service would be free. Now, in 1979, pre-school education is free in South Australia. However, it is questionable how long it can remain free and still offer the current range and quality of services. Some programs have already been adversely affected by cuts in funds from the Federal Government. Understaffing and long waiting lists of children are becoming all too common. </para>
          <para>In 1974 the Federal Government promised that: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>By 1980 all children in Australia will have access to services designed to take care of their educational, emotional, physical, social and recreational needs. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">In 1978 the Prime Minister stated that:  the block grants represent the highest practicable contribution towards the current costs of pre-schools the Commonwealth is able to make. </para>
          <para class="block">What started in 1974 as a policy of providing pre-school education for all children in the year prior to school entry is now rated as an area of the Budget worthy only of &#39;topping up&#39; by Federal funds. This represents a withdrawal of commitment, and subsequently money, which leaves the States, pre-school organisations and, most importantly, children and their parents, stranded. </para>
          <para>In South Australia in 1 978 there were almost twice as many pre-school services as there had been in 1 974. with an equivalent increase in the numbers of children using these services. Yet, in real money values, South Australia received in the 1978-79 Federal Budget only 62 per cent of the allocation for pre-school and day care which it had been granted in 1974-75. As greater emphasis has been laid on day care during that period, the actual cut-back in pre-school funding is even more dramatic. In South Australia the State Government has so far been able and willing to make up the deficit but in doing this its proportion of the liability has increased from 32 per cent in 1 974-75 to approximately 70 per cent at present. </para>
          <para>I have outlined the problems that are experienced by kindergartens operated through the Kindergarten Union in South Australia. I conclude my remarks by reading to the Senate a letter that 1 received from the Murray Bridge South Kindergarten, which is in the town where I live. It is addressed to me and reads: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>The Murray Bridge South Kindergarten is concerned that pre-school <inline font-style="italic">education in</inline> South Australia is being adversely affected by cuts in funds from the Federal Government. The South Australian State Government has so far been able and willing to make up the deficit in the reduced allocation received from the Federal Government but in doing this its proportion of the liability has increased from 32 per cent in 1 974-75 to the approximately 70 per cent it is providing now. </para>
            <para>We are very concerned that if the further projected cuts in federal funding for the pre-schools eventuate it is likely that it will be impossible for the South Australian State Government to maintain existing services. If tuition fees have to be reintroduced this will preclude many children from the benefits of pre-school education. </para>
            <para>This kindergarten has already had the services of its teacher&#39;s aide reduced to half time and this is causing problems in adequately providing for our children. </para>

          <para class="block">I have raised this matter, as I have on four other occasions, to endeavour to persuade this Government to honour its responsibilities and the election promise that it made in 1975. I make this plea not only on behalf of all of the kindergarten unions in South Australia but especially on behalf of the people of the Murray Bridge South Kindergarten at Murray Bridge who I know are working very hard to try to raise money through fetes, raffles and in any other way they can, to keep this kindergarten going and to provide the funds for a full time staff. The kindergarten in Murray Bridge is situated in a very densely populated Housing Trust area. There is a desperate need for it and I hope that the Government will take heed of the request I make on behalf of these people. </para>

            </talker>
            <para>- I wish to take the occasion of this first reading debate to speak on the defence needs of this country. Throughout out history Australia has been sheltered from the responsibility of providing for its own defence. We have been sheltered by our traditional allies and to a lesser extent by the fact that our near neighbours in South East Asia have relatively stable governments with armed forces that often were technologically inferior to our own. These circumstances no longer apply. We no longer have the unqualified support of our allies. The ability of any European power to help Australia is severely limited. The ANZUS pact provides the only treaty support for Australia, and that is a very qualified document which certainly does not provide a water-tight commitment for the United States. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>The United States support for Australia could conceivably be compromised by another nation&#39;s interests. There are also circumstances where, if the United States wished to help, it would not be able to do so because of higher priorities. In a major conflict the United States has defined its priorities as being Western Europe, Japan and then Australia- in that sequence. In the foreseeable future South East Asia will have areas of instability. There may well be governments with objectives and ideals different from our own. As the Minister for Defence <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Killen)</inline> has frequently said, peace in our region could be shattered without warning by an assassin&#39;s bullet. Nor can we assume that the armed forces of South East Asia will necessarily be technologically inferior to our own. </para>
          <para>Imposed on this political pattern in South East Asia we have the superpower ambitions of the Soviets and their objective of encircling and containing China by setting up bases and client regimes in the Indian Ocean and in South East Asia. These circumstances differ fundamentally from those in existence 20 years ago. The responsibility for coping with the defence consequences of these changes is ours and ours alone. </para>
          <para>What are the threats that face Australia? At the present time there are no actual threats, but evidence of the fact that these circumstances can change overnight is the invasion of Kampuchea by Vietnam and the later invasion of Vietnam by China. In the doctrine of no actual threat there are no grounds for complacency. World War II ran for some years- from 1939 to 1942- without any direct military threat to Australia. But then the threat became very real. </para>
          <para>Let us look at some of the possible threats to Australia. Potential threats fall into two broad categories: A resource grab and/or interception of our seaborn trade. Interception of sea trade is an unlikely eventuality. We have no large merchant marine fleet. Our cargoes move in foreign bottoms. Any aggressor would be attacking the ships of another nation. Those nations would not permit their ships to sail under Australian convoy escorts. They would withdraw their ships from the trade or use their own escorts. </para>

              </talker>
              <para>- That is a good point, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Tate.</inline> It is important to appreciate this in view of the major campaign being waged for a new carrier to replace <inline font-style="italic">HMAS Melbourne.</inline> The case for this and for other major surface ships is based principally, but not exclusively, on the need for convoy escort duties. In an age of satellites, when the precise position of surface ships can be updated every few minutes, and with missile technology, the only place to survive is under the water, except for the massive fleets of the superpowers. The threat that Australia faces comes from our resource base. Most people think of invasion in terms of the capture of cities and factories. They think of the south-east corner of Australia as being the essential ground to hold. Who would want factories with their union problems? What army commander would want to become involved in taking the big southern cities which, if they were defended by a wellmotivated defence force, could be as expensive an exercise as Stalingrad? It is simply not a cost effective exercise, even for a major power. </para>
            </talk.start>
          </continue>
          <para>The converse is true. Australia is attractive because of its great resources- the coal in central Queensland, the iron ore at the Pilbara, the alumina at Weipa and the great expanses of tropical farmland. The essential ground in Australia is the northern half. It is possible that some nation would wish to invade and capture one or more of our resources. Our defence requirements, therefore, are to protect our extended economic zone- and our fishing and seabed rights- to prevent migration occurring by force and not in accordance with our wishes and to deny occupation of any resource areas to invading forces. This is something we can do on our own if only we set our minds to it and get our priorities right. Our objective must be to provide a deterrent force strong enough that it is simply not worth while anyone taking us on, as was the case with Switzerland and Sweden in the Second World War. </para>
          <para>The biggest problems we face in providing this defence is that people either believe that it is beyond us or that there simply is no threat. The first argument is not true. We can defend this country. The second argument is also not true. The advocates of this case ask: &#39; Who is going to attack us today?&#39; They follow up this argument with statements to the effect that only the United States of America and Soviet Russia have the logistic resources to land an army on this continent. Threats, however, develop very quickly. The time frame is months, not 10 or 15 years. The Soviet Union has developed a capacity to transfer technology and arms quite rapidly around the world. We need a lead time of the order of 10 years to marshal our resources. The &#39;no threat today&#39; people are thinking of by-gone wars and of different weapons systems. If we sacrificed enough lives we gained enough breathing space to get ready. Those days are gone. Defence capacity cannot be considered solely in terms of arms or manpower. The defence of this country involves three interrelated areas- the development of the actual Defence Force, the maintenance of a sound economy and the development of regional stability through our foreign policy. </para>
          <para>What are our assets from a defence point of view? The first great asset we have are the present services. Whilst they are few in number, they are very competent and very professional. They form a superb nucleus on which to expand provided they have the time to do so. The problem that the Services face is not one of our own making but of the society that supports them. Here I must pay tribute to the Minister for Defence, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Jim</inline> Killen- probably the best Defence Minister this country has had- who has fought valiantly in Government for a higher priority for his portfolio. The second asset was have is geographical. Australia is an island. Anyone invading this country has very considerable logistic problems to overcome and long and vulnerable lines of communication to maintain. </para>
          <para>The final point, and certainly not the least, concerns the great revolution in weapons technology- a revolution which is every bit as important as the invention of gunpowder. Current weapons systems give us the means to defend our geographical position with our low population numbers. We can equalise the huge imbalance of numbers with our neighbours, at a cost which is economically manageable. With electronic intelligence and surveillance equipment- some of it unmanned- and with missile technology, we have the ability to cover those vast areas of this continent in a way we have never done before. How can all this be done? </para>
          <para>The very first task is to educate the public to recognise that we are at risk and that we can be secure. When the need is recognised we can move to develop the industrial base, the weapons systems and the forces we need. This year we will spend $2, 500m on defence. That sounds like a great deal of money, but it is only as much as we spend on education, it is less than we spend on health and it is only a third of what we spend on social security and welfare. We are buying an enormous amount of social security, but how much national security are we buying? I do not believe social security can survive without national security. </para>
          <para>We spend 2.7 per cent of our gross domestic product on defence which is one of the lowest percentages in the world. The Soviets spend 13 per cent, and the United States of America 6 per cent. Even Britain, with all its economic problems, spends 5 per cent. The international consequences of this are twofold. First of all, no nation will be inclined to help us when we clearly have been making less effort than it has. Secondly, we need foreign capital to develop this country. Projects like the North West Shelf run into the thousands of millions of dollars and no overseas company will risk that sort of money if the host country will not make reasonable efforts to defend that investment. I therefore welcome recent statements of the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Malcolm Fraser)</inline> that defence spending will be increased by 2 per cent in real terms in the coming Budget. It is a matter of high priority. </para>
          <para>The next step is the development of our industrial base to produce our own new weapons systems. We have maintained the factories to produce our own munitions and armaments and despite what is said in the newspapers, these are technically excellent organisations. They have certainly suffered from not having had enough money spent on them over the years, but the staff are very capable. We should aim for self-reliance industrially for our own production is the only source on which we can rely in time of need. It also makes good sense economically for it provides employment and very considerably helps our balance of payments. We should be looking at designing our own weapons systems. Our operational requirements are never the same as those of Europe and North America. As Ikara and BARRA have shown, we have the ability to design and build world class systems. We have the potential for a considerable export market in sales to friendly regional governments. It is very much part of our defence to have stable governments in the region and to see that they have a capacity to defend themselves. </para>
          <para>Some equipment, such as the tactical fighter force replacement, will need to be bought overseas but the overwhelming majority can be of our own design and production. </para>

              <para>- That is the point I am making. In association with this move, the three Services will have to develop and refine contingency plans. They will have to look at what numbers of servicemen they can reasonably expect to have in uniform in peace time. That may well be much the same as at present. Clearly, these numbers will be quite inadequate in an emergency and numbers will have to be brought up quickly by reservists. A complete reappraisal of our reserve system is required. We will need a level of reservists many times what we have today, at higher levels of training and with clear tasks assigned to them so they can have incentives and goals in their training. A great deal of creative thought has to be put into this reserve program. Whether or not Australia becomes involved in any regional instability in the area is a matter for conjecture. If we do become involved, we will certainly have to rely on our own resources. I believe we can look after ourselves if we get our priorities right. The time to do it is now so that by 1 990 we have attained that goal. </para>

            </talker>
            <para>- 1 rise to speak about the Government&#39;s attitude to migration. After listening to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator MacGibbon</inline> I must say that it might be as well if we all migrated to New Caledonia, leaving this country to be used as one big quarry by every other country! I query the genuineness of this Government&#39;s attitude to migration. I refer to the extraordinary difference in attitudes towards people from different countries and the basis for this discrimination. The Government insists that we need more workers to immigrate to Australia. Despite the downturn in our economy, despite the highest unemployment this country has ever known, this Government is using taxpayers&#39; money to advertise in Europe for workers in certain areas of expertise- amongst them, hairdressers. There must be hundreds and hundreds of women in the community who are trained hairdressers because that was the only area in which women could get any sort of apprenticeship. The Government is saying that the old </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para class="block">White Australia policy is long dead, that our immigration policy today is totally nondiscriminatory and is applied consistently to all applicants regardless of race, colour, nationality, descent, national or ethnic origin and sex. I query these statements. I feel that they are hypocritical, taking into account the attitude the Government is taking to certain races and nationalities in the world. </para>
          <para>The Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr MacKellar,</inline> says that Australia wants to protect the social and economic future of all its citizens and that therefore it has to limit the number of migrants it accepts each year and give preference to those with close family ties, and with skills, professional qualifications or experience that are in strong demand. I maintain that this Government picks and chooses between the races and countries from which it chooses those migrants. I would like to know what the real criterion is. I do not believe that it is based on need, I believe that it is based on prejudice, and on the prejudice of big business. Certainly <inline font-weight="bold">Mr MacKellar</inline> has said that we now have migrants from more than 100 countries, but I would like to know what the proportions are because, from my observation, they are far from equal. He has gloated about the fact that we now take a large number of migrants from Asia and says that this represents 22 per cent of the total migrant intake. We resettle large numbers of Indo-Chinese refugees. Of the migrants who come to live in Australia, 13 per cent are from Asia, and amongst them are a substantial number of professional and technical workers. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr MacKellar</inline> also says that in recent years numbers of Japanese migrants have come to Australia. The Government has even spent part of the taxpayers&#39; money on a special program of films to encourage more Japanese workers to settle in Australia. Of course, that might have something to do with the fact that the Japanese have a reputation for being good workers who accept all sorts of conditions and their place in society. </para>
          <para>The Government is not making quite such a large splash about the fact that during the last financial year South Africa was the third largest source of migrants for Australia. The second largest source was Great Britain and if the refugee component is included, the third was Malaysia. The Government does not advertise to any large degree the fact that the largest migrant source, excluding refugees, was South Africa. So great is the number of migrants now coming from South Africa that Australia has increased its immigration staff in Pretoria to cope with the increased numbers of applications from people in Rhodesia who wish to settle in Australia. An article appearing in the <inline font-style="italic">Johannesburg Star</inline> on 30 January this year stated: </para>
          <list type="lowerroman-dotted">
            <item label=".">
              <para>. that Australia was considering a plan to accept up to 10,000 Rhodesian refugees if the transitional Government collapsed. </para>
            </item>
          </list>
          <para class="block">The United States is another area from which the Government is encouraging emigration to Australia. Recently the Federal Government allowed 1 8 American families to enter Australia to establish a multimillion dollar jewellery manufacturing business in Perth, but the decision may have been coloured by the fact that a significant investment was involved. Of course, these days we take migrants from all areas, including areas to which this Government would never before have looked for migrants. We show a great deal of compassion for young ladies in red bikinis who jump off Russian cruise vessels. We show great compassion for the daughter of an elderly German couple who was in Australia with her son and wished to stay here with her parents, despite the fact that she could not speak English. Of course, she should have been allowed to stay, and of course governments should show proper compassion in such cases. But what about the young Greek couple who were here with their seven-week old Australian-born baby and who were deported, even though a very large section of the community asked the Government to change its mind? What about the Fijian parents who were deported, despite the fact that they too had an Australian-born child? No compassion was shown to them and they were sent back to Fiji. </para>
          <para>In the last few weeks we have heard of the case of a young man who jumped ship in Australia when he was 1 8 years old in order to settle with his mother and sister, who were his only relations. He lived here very happily, found a job and worked very hard. He thought that if he put his case honestly before the Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs some sympathy would be shown. He thought honesty was the best policy. This young man went to the Department and told his story, and he was not allowed to return home. The Department was told that if he were sent back to Greece he would have to face the consequences of having jumped ship. His 19-year-old fiancee lost her job because the Commonwealth Police visited her at her office almost every day to ask her for further facts. His brother-in-law fears that because he was of military age, he may be court-martialled for desertion and his length of service may be increased from between 18 and 27 months to at least three years. His brother-in-law wanted to put up half the bail so that the family could spend Greek Easter together before he was deported, if he were to be deported. </para>
          <para>Despite all endeavours to stay, this man- he is still only a young man of 22 years of age who has committed no crime other than wanting to be with his mother and sister when he was 1 8 years of age- was deported back to Greece. I think his fate had a great deal to do with the fact that he was a Greek. Had he been of some other nationality, such as British or South African, maybe he would not have been sent back. </para>
          <para>The fiancee of a South American migrant who has been detained awaiting deportation alleged that he was being removed from Australia to avoid any investigations into a racket defrauding migrants, but no attempt was made by this Government to look into that matter. Migrants in Melbourne and Sydney have made allegations of bribes up to $1,500 being paid to people who pose as immigration officers expecting that people who are making desperate, last minute attempts to stay in Australia will pay any money to do so. No investigation has been made of those allegations. Despite the fact that a woman who recently went back to the United Kingdom with her five children because she said she could not stand Australia has been backwards and forwards two or three times, it is interesting to note that authorities in Britain said that Australia House was very helpful in arranging for her and her family to be repatriated back to Australia when they had gone home to England before and then had wanted to return to Australia. The same compassion does not seem to be shown for people from other areas, especially people of Greek origin. A Greek-born member of the New South Wales Legislative Council recently said: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>I know of instances where Australian citizens of Greek descent who have married in Greece have serious difficulties to bring their wives back here. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">We know very well that files on Greeks had been checked by the fraud squad of the Department of Social Security, although there is not much information to show that files on people of other nationalities have been checked. It is interesting to note that the Federal Government is to review the type and number of doctors migrating to Australia because there are too many in some fields and not enough in others. However, not much effort is made to see to it that we attract doctors from multi-cultural backgrounds who may be able to assist the migrant families in Australia. The doctors do not come into Australia in proportion to the areas from which Australia brings migrants. This is causing a great deal of concern and hardship to migrant people, who find it hard to relate to doctors who do not speak their languages and who do not know their background. </para>
          <para>There is a great deal of talk in the community about many doctors migrating to Australia coming from South Africa and Rhodesia. A report tabled by the Minister for Health <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Hunt)</inline> showed that by 1981 Australia would have one doctor to 543 people. It was found that the net inflow of long term immigrants and settler doctors was higher than anticipated- about 600 a year. The report says that the two most common reasons given for the high gains from immigration are that practice in Australia was more lucrative than in many other countries and that the more restrictive conditions for migration of doctors to other countries made migration to Australia comparatively attractive. This makes one wonder whose fault it is that health costs are rising so rapidly. </para>
          <para>All the figures on where Australia&#39;s migrants have come from over the last few years show an extraordinary pattern. South Africans, Britons, Americans and Northern Europeans are being granted visas with little difficulty. However, Southern Europeans- especially Greeks and people from the Middle East- and South Americans have far less chance of getting a visa to come to Australia to see friends and relatives or simply to tour the country. All these figures were given by the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs. The breakdown of the numbers of visas issued and the number of applications refused in the 12 months ended February this year is as follows: Whilst 2,634 Greeks were given visas, 825 were refused. That is a ratio of almost one in three. Whilst 1 85 visas were issued to Turkish nationals, 124 were refused. People from Lebanon were even worse off. The number of applications refused was higher than the number approved. There were 275 visas granted and 291 rejected. </para>
          <para>However, there is a stark difference when these figures are compared to those of South Africa, Northern Europe, Britain, the United States and Canada. Whilst 5,715 South Africans were allowed into Australia only 225 applications were refused, or one refusal for every 30 approved. About 50,000 Americans were granted visas and only 189 were refused. More than 5,600 British applications were approved and 450 were rejected. Not one application from Austria was rejected and 1,459 visas were granted. Precisely 18 applications from Sweden and Norway were refused whilst 2,170 were approved. I suppose after knowing this, I should not have been surprised to receive the following letter from the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs: </para>
          <quote>
            <para class="block">Dear <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Melzer,</inline></para>
            <para>I refer to your further letter concerning the visitor entry to Australia from Greece of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Alexander</inline> Grekos  who is seeking to visit his sister, <inline font-weight="bold">Mrs</inline> Alkisti Yallouridis  of 10 Harrow Street, Blackburn, </para>
            <para>I reject utterly your accusation that Greek people are singled out by my Department for discriminatory treatment. It is correct that visit applications lodged in Greece and in certain other countries too are subjected to a closer scrutiny than applies elsewhere. This has resulted from the fact that so many attempts have been made to abuse the visitor policy and I have been compelled to instruct officers overseas to look more closely at the bona fides particularly of people of nationalities which have shown up in our records as being among those most consistently flouting entry requirements. I am sorry to say that Greeks are included in this category. </para>
            <para>In assessing <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Grekos</inline> intended other than a genuine visit the officer who interviewed him in Athens took into account factors such as an awareness by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Grekos</inline> that he would not be eligible for migrant entry, his below average income, no property ties in Greece, no previous travel and seeking a stay of six months. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr</inline> Grekos&#39;s  background fitted what might be termed a profile of visitors from Greece most likely to become over stayed visitors in Australia. The doubts held by the interviewing officer in Athens were not alleviated by a report from the Regional Director of my Department in Melbourne, which indicated that after a telephone conversation with <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Grekos&#39;s</inline> brother-in-law, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Yallouridis,</inline> they also had doubts that a genuine visit was intended. </para>
            <para>I have again reviewed this case but I am satisfied the decision to refuse <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Grekos</inline> a visit visa was reasonably based on policy and there was no discrimination based on race or nationality. I have decided to maintain that decision. . . . </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">This is a young man in his early twenties whose sister had married an Australian, had come out to live in Australia and had just had her first baby. Her father, this young man&#39;s father, came out to Australia to visit his daughter and his new grandchild. This young man wished to come out to visit his sister and his new nephew. His relatives out here were perfectly prepared to put up bonds, to make sure that a ticket was bought that showed he was going to return. The Minister said that he had below average income. How many of our young people going overseas to visit would have a greater than average income? The letter says that he has no property ties in Greece. He is of an age when one could not expect him to have property ties in Greece. He had made no previous travel and he sought a stay of six months. A young man with no property ties and below average income is not going to be able to visit his sister very often. So one would expect that he would stay for the maximum time he could. </para>
          <para>I spoke to this young man&#39;s relatives and they were most anxious that he should be out here in time to have the baby christened. The Minister says he is not discriminating against Greeks who most consistently flout entry requirements; I say to him that the Greeks are not the worst flouters of entry requirements. </para>
          <para>A report in the <inline font-style="italic">Sunday Mail</inline> stated that British people top the list of illegal migrants in Australia. A total of 58,883 illegal immigrants is now at large in Australia. The British top the &#39;wanted list&#39; followed by the Americans and the Malaysians. The report stated that the others are Indonesians, Fijians, Italians, West Germans, Hong Kong Chinese, Greeks, Dutch and Singaporeans, in a descending order of numbers. The Greeks are nowhere near the top of the list of those who make up the greatest number of illegal immigrants. The greatest number of illegal immigrants come from Britain and America. If the Government continues in this vein it will mean that people in Australia who are of Greek origin will be able to have no visitors from their home country. There will be no family reunions. The only way that these people will be able to have reunions with their families is by going home to Greece. If they do not they will lose contact with their families and the areas from which they came. </para>
          <para>I refer to another case involving 13 Greek teachers who came to Australia under a temporary teaching scheme in 1977. Of those 13 teachers five later applied for permanent residency. One of them was English and was travelling on a British passport. Honourable senators would not be surprised to know that he was granted permanent residence. The applications of the other four, who had Greek passports and Greek citizenship, were rejected. They all came to Australia on the same basis but the applications of the four who had Greek passports were rejected. The application of the one who travelled on a British passport was accepted. I say to the Government that all immigrants are human beings. They all love their mothers, grandfathers and children. They sometimes have wider and deeper family feelings than we have. People in the community are concerned at this sort of discrimination. People from the Greek community are certainly concerned. The Government has castigated other countries about the treatment of their nationals and their treatment of refugees. It has called on them to show greater compassion, to take a greater proportion of refugees and to allow more families to be reunited. I come from the second largest Greek speaking city in the world. I think it is time that this Government showed its bona fides, recognised the tremendous qualities that these people bring to Australia and treated them like human beings. </para>

            <para>- The fluoridation of water supplies is carried out as a preventive health measure of great importance. Fluoride is a natural constituent of surface and underground water. Most Australian water supplies are deficient in the chemical. Therefore, it is added to the water supplies of about 67 per cent of Australian people. On 2 1 April this year the Australian Broadcasting Commission program, <inline font-style="italic">Four Corners,</inline> a program which I enjoy watching and which I admire for some of the subjects it raises for public discussion, screened a segment featuring an anti-fluoridation message. This program has given rise throughout the community to some concerns and to some issues which should usefully be made public in this place. One of the results has been that the authorities in the Shoalhaven area have stopped their fluoridation program and intend to hold a public referendum. I understand that the authorities in Forbes have done the same. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>I will set out briefly the sequence of events associated with the program. During March 1979 the <inline font-style="italic">Four Corners</inline> team produced a segment which it called &#39;Shades of Doubt&#39;. The program included some dental scientists, together with people who spoke against fluoridation. The request for the program came through the Health Commission of New South Wales and involved a dental scientist. The point is that is of most concern is that the program, which made the assertion that fluoridation causes malignant disease, or cancer, did not involve any experts from this country who have made a specialised study of cancer and its causes. There was no representative from the Australian Cancer Society. There were no representatives from the Cancer registry in New South Wales or in other States. There were no representatives from the State cancer councils. There were no Australian epidemiologists who are concerned with cancer and its likely causes. I believe that in this way the program was unbalanced, which was very unsatisfactory. The New South Wales State Cancer Council heard of the program, in fact, before it actually went to air. It became aware of it when advertisements began to appear for the segment some days before its screening. It approached <inline font-style="italic">Four Corners</inline> on the day before the program was produced. </para>
          <para>The program featured the claims made by an American Ph.D., a man of some learning, a man named Dean Burk. He was introduced by the program reporter <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Charles</inline> Wooley as &#39;Doctor Dean Burk, an eminent American cancer specialist&#39;. That is an incorrect description for this man. </para>
          <para class="block">He is not a cancer specialist. He has been involved for some time in  anti-fluoridation  campaigns- that is his right- but the Australian Broadcasting Commission should have been careful how it introduced him. </para>
          <para>The problem that rises may be encapsulated if we refer back to the basis of modern science. The modern philosopher who has guided science is Karl Popper. He has said that if something is scientific it has to be falsifiable. One had to be able to prove it is wrong. If you cannot prove that it is wrong, it is not science. It may be myth or it may be some polemical statement. The problem with the <inline font-style="italic">Four Corners</inline> program is that many of the statements made were simply not falsifiable. They were put in such a way that they could not be treated scientifically. This has been the case with many of the issues which have been raised by Dean Burk and his associate, <inline font-weight="bold">Dr</inline> Yiamouyiannis,  in relation to anti-fluoridation campaigns. I have previously brought to the attention of the Opposition Whip, and I now bring to the attention of the Senate, a segment from <inline font-style="italic">Consumer Reports,</inline> the journal of the United States Consumers Association, for July and August 1978. It sets out some of the activities of these people. I seek leave to have a column and a half of that journal to be incorporated in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard.</inline></para>

            <para class="block">RAISING THE SPECTRE OF CANCER </para>
            <para>The first big target was Los Angeles, whose City Council had voted in September 1974 to fluoridate the water supply. The NHF&#39;s ammunition was a study by <inline font-weight="bold">Dr Yiamouyiannis</inline> that purported to link fluoridation to an increase in cancer deaths. The study and a couple of publicity handouts that accompanied it were eventually reviewed by various public health officials, including Thomas Mack, M.D., of Los Angeles, an associate professor of community medicine and an expert in cancer epidemiology. (Epidemiology is a branch of medicine that studies the incidence, causes, and control of a disease in specific populations.) The nature of the Yiamouyiannis study is apparent in an excerpt from <inline font-weight="bold">Dr Mack&#39;s</inline> review: </para>
            <para>I cannot begin without commenting on the form of the documents you sent me,&#39; <inline font-weight="bold">Dr Mack</inline> stated. &#39;Despite the gravity of the question addressed, the form of these sheets is that of a propaganda flyer rather than a serious scientific effort. Specifically, there is no indication that any of the material was ever prepared for submission to a reputable scientific journal ... All over the documents one finds . . . conclusions emblazoned essentially in the form of slogans, without cautious interpretation or restrictions. For these reasons, the reader must immediately presume that objectivity has never been considered  . . At the same time this bias is so pervasive and obvious, the mistaken logic so gross and naive, that the reader assumes the author to be, however competent in his Ph.D. field, totally unaware of the principles of epidemiology.&#39; </para>
            <para>Most people are unfamiliar with the principles of epidemiology, however, and a Ph.D. degree can sometimes lend credibility even to claptrap. In Los Angeles it evidently did. The scare tactics of the NHF and other antifluoridationists scored a stunning victory over dental health: </para>
            <para>There is no evidence that fluoride increases the incidence or mortality of cancer in any organ.&#39; (from a study by the Royal College of Physicians). </para>
            <para>Around the beginning of 1975, <inline font-weight="bold">Dr Yiamouyiannis</inline> also joined forces with <inline font-weight="bold">Dr Burk.</inline> Like the National Health Federation, <inline font-weight="bold">Dr Burk</inline> is a leading advocate of the worthless cancer drug Laetrile (Consumer Reports, August 1977), and he shares the NHF&#39;s aversion to fluoridation. </para>
            <para>The collaboration produced a study claiming that 25,000 or more excess cancer deaths occur annually in U.S. cities that fluoridate their water. The assertion was based on a comparison of death rates for specific cancers in some counties that were fluoridated compared with some that were not. In July 1975, Representative Delaney entered the study into the Congressional Record and called for &#39;an immediate suspension of all artificial fluoridation. &#39; </para>
            <para>The National Cancer Institute reviewed the study and was unimpressed. Unlike a proper epidemiological study, it had failed to take into account widely recognised risk factors known to affect the death rate from specific types of cancers. Using the same data, the NCI reanalyzed the study, taking into account such influences as ethnic composition of the population, geographic location, socioeconomic status, and other fundamental risk factors. The purported differences in the cancer death rates promptly disappeared. Undaunted, Drs Burk and Yiamouyiannis bounced back with another study. This time they compared overall cancer death rates for 10 large cities that were fluoridated versus 10 large cities that were not. Again, the fluoridated cities came out second best. Over the 20-year period studied, cancer death rates in the fluoridated cities purportedly increased 10 per cent more than in the un fluoridated ones. In December 1975, Representative Delaney entered the study into the Congressional Record and demanded that all (foundation be stopped. </para>
            <para>If anything, the new study was even more amateurish than the July entry. In the judgment of one NCI official at the House subcommittee hearings, it represented &#39;the worst piece of work that has been done to date on fluoride&#39; Drs Burk and Yiamouyiannis had somehow managed to ignore the most fundamental factors involved in cancer mortality rates- age, sex, and race. Old people die from cancer more often than young people; men have a higher cancer death rate than women; and blacks a higher one than whites. Unless those factors are taken into consideration, the results of a cancer-mortality comparison would be meaningless. When NCI scientists reanalysed the Burk- Yiamouyiannis data, they found that the difference in the cancer death rate was due entirely to the age and racial make-up of the respective populations. Fluoridation was irrelevant. </para>

          <para>The central question whether fluoridation causes cancer has been examined by a lot of people. I do not want to spend a lot of time on that question today. It is an important question and it is desirable that something is put on public record to identify the vast body of literature which has been prepared on this matter. I have available to me a table which was prepared by a Commission which reported to the Governor of Minnesota, and which has summarised many  studies which have been done on the association of malignant diseases with fluoridation.

              <para>-The table shows that many studies in many parts of the world have been unable to verify an association of the kind that was claimed on the <inline font-style="italic">Four Comers</inline> program. The program has caused concern and complaints have been expressed to the ABC and have been investigated by the ABC. I must say that the ABC has really taken some trouble to investigate the complaints in some depth and to make, I think, a very adequate response to the various dental groups. I would like to identify also an extract from a letter written by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr T.</inline> S. Duckmanton, General Manager of the Australian Broadcasting Commission. It was written on 30 May 1979 to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Graeme</inline> Dunn, the  President  of the Dental Health Education and Research Foundation, in which the ABC admits that there was probably a lack of balance in the program. I seek leave to have that extract incorporated in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard.</inline></para>

            <para>Following lengthy and detailed discussion, the Commission expressed the view that the program of 2 1 April should have provided a full opportunity, either by way of statement or interview, for the presentation of the considered views of a number of professional bodies concerned with the fluoridation issue. While of the opinion that the public has the right to be informed about potential hazards, as well as potential benefits from any mass medication program, the Commission considered that the first program on the fluoridation of water supplies did not adequately present that range of professional opinion which, by its exclusion from the program, gave rise in some quarters to allegations of biased and inadequate reporting. </para>

              <para>- I believe that it is right, proper and essential for programs like <inline font-style="italic">Four Corners</inline> to continue to investigate any matter which they think is of public interest. The title used, &#39;Shades of Doubt&#39;, is not a bad title. If <inline font-style="italic">Four Corners</inline> thinks there is an issue affecting fluoridation, vitamins, medication or tobacco, it should be allowed to investigate the subject. The concern that many of us have is that the ABC, because of its very great capacity to influence the views of a lot of people, has a special responsibility to ensure balance and justice in the programs which it produces. If it is to cover something like the cause of cancer, which is likely to create anxiety in a lot of people, it has a special responsibility which I do not believe it discharged properly in this case. That responsibility is to balance up the particular program. The views it chooses to push on the issue of fluoridation, I am not going to argue about; but I place on record my concern about the way the program was constructed. I hope that <inline font-style="italic">Four Corners,</inline> because of the dramatic impact that it can have, will ensure in future that it does achieve balance in its programs, even at the expense of the dramatic impact of the segment that it screens. </para>

          <para>Live-stock Slaughter Levy Amendment Bill 1979 </para>
          <para>The purpose of this Bill is to amend the Live-stock Slaughter Levy Act 1 964 to increase the maximum rates of levy which may be prescribed for cattle disease eradication and to provide for the introduction of levies on the slaughter of two categories of calves. </para>
          <para>The importance of animal disease control to the future of the Australian cattle industry cannot be too highly stressed. Our major export market, the United States of America, and a number of other countries which are either markets or competitors for Australian beef are well on the way to tuberculosis and brucellosis eradication. In these circumstances the tempo of the Australian campaign must be maintained. It is, however, a very costly business. </para>
          <para>In the three years to June 1979 the Government will have provided grants totalling some $8. 5m for the compulsory slaughter of reactor animals. Over the same period, the Government has advanced $47m for campaign operations. Recoveries from the disease eradication components of slaughter levies and export charges are estimated at $2 8m. Thus, net advances to the industry over the period have approximated $19m. The Government has decided that such outstanding advances should bear interest at the long term bond rate from 1 July 1979. For 1979-80, the Government has agreed to an allocation of $22m for operations and $3. 6m for compensation towards a Commonwealth-States program totalling $36.4m. The Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Howard),</inline> in the 1978-79 Budget Speech announced that the Government would be reviewing the industry&#39;s financial contribution to the campaign. The outcome of that review was announced by the Treasurer in his statement to the House of Representatives on 24 May 1 979. </para>
          <para>Given the marked improvement in returns to the cattle industry in the past year, it has been decided that the industry&#39;s rate of contribution to brucellosis and tuberculosis eradication can be stepped up. The Bill reflects that decision and provides for the maximum disease eradication levy on cattle slaughter to be increased from $ I to $3 a head. The Government has agreed to a request from the Australian Meat and Live-stock Corporation to introduce levies on the slaughter of calves. Until now, calves under 90 kg dressed weight have been exempt from levy. The industry sector producing calves does receive substantial benefit, however, from the marketing and promotional activity of the AMLC and from the research funded from the slaughter levies and matching Commonwealth contributions. At the request of the dairy industry, provision has been made for a special category of bobby calves. These are intended to be levied at 10 per cent of the rate for cattle. The rate proposed for heavier calves is approximately 35 per cent of the cattle rate. For disease eradication, the proposed maxima are respectively 30c and $1 a head. The Government proposes to recommend to the Governor-General that regulations be promulgated setting the disease eradication components of cattle, calf and bobby calf slaughter levies as from 1 July 1979 at the maximum levels provided in the Bill- namely at $3, $1, and 30c a head respectively. On projected 1 979-80 slaughterings the resulting revenue for cattle disease eradication is estimated at $2 3. 6m in a full year. </para>
          <para>I turn now to a summary of the specific provisions of the Bill before the Senate. Clause 3 provides for amendments to definitions to reflect the inclusion of the two additional categories of bobby calf and calf. Clause 4 deletes from subsection 5(2)(b) of the Act the provision that levy is not payable on the slaughter of cattle the dressed weights of which do not exceed 90 kg. This results from the proposal that calves should become subject to levy. Clause 4 also provides for amendment of sub-section 5 (2) (a) of the Act. The purpose of this is to achieve consistency with a similar provision included in the Livestock Slaughter (Export Inspection Charge) Bill. It was considered necessary to use the amended form of words in that Bill to ensure that charge could be imposed on the slaughter of horses notwithstanding that horsemeat cannot be used for human consumption in any Australian State. </para>
          <para>Clause 5 provides for the maximum amount of the disease eradication component of the cattle slaughter levy to be amended from $ 1 a head to $3 a head. Clause 6 provides for the same amendment in relation to the slaughter of buffaloes. Clause 7 provides for levies to be payable on the slaughter of bobby calves and calves. The levy components provided for in each case are the same as those for cattle. Clause 8 relates to the requirement for certain bodies to be consulted before recommendations are made on amounts of levy to be prescribed. The amendment proposed in this clause extends these requirements to apply also to recommendations for rates of levy on calves and bobby calves. I commend the Bill to honourable senators. </para>
          <para>Live-stock Slaugher Levy Collection Amendment Bill 1979 </para>
          <para>The purpose of this Bill is to amend the principal Act so as to take account of the proposed introduction of levies on the slaughter of bobby calves and calves under the Live-stock Slaughter Levy Act 1964. The amendment is to authorise payment into the National Cattle Disease Eradication Trust Account of the proceeds of the disease eradication components of bobby calf and calf slaughter levies. I commend the Bill to honourable senators. </para>
          <para class="block">Live-stock Export Charge Amendment Bill 1979 </para>
          <para>The purpose of this Bill is to amend the Livestock Export Charge Act 1977 to increase the maximum rate which may be charged on live cattle and buffalo exports for the purposes of animal disease eradication from $1 to $3. This matches the similar amendments provided in the Live-stock Slaughter Levy Amendment Bill just introduced. The Government proposes to seek the promulgation of regulations to increase the charge to $3 a head from 1 July 1979. At this rate it is estimated to yield approximately $ 1 50,000 in a full year. I commend the Bill to honourable senators. </para>
          <para>Australian Meat and Live-stock Corporation Amendment Bill 1979 </para>
          <para>The purpose of this Bill is to amend the Australian Meat and Live-stock Corporation Act 1977 to take account of the proposed introduction of levies on the slaughter of bobby calves and calves under the Livestock Slaughter Levy Act 1 964. The amendments are to authorise payment to the Australian Meat and Livestock Corporation of the proceeds of those components of bobby calf and calf levies which are designed to provide funds for the Corporation&#39;s administration and promotion activities. I commend the Bill to honourable senators. </para>
          <para class="block">Meat Research Amendment Bill 1979 </para>
          <para>The purpose of this Bill is to amend the Meat Research Act 1960 to take account of the proposed introduction of levies on the slaughter of bobby calves and calves under the Live-stock Slaughter Levy Act 1964. The proposed amendments to paragraphs 5 ( 1 ) (a) and 5(1) (aa) of the principal Act are to authorise payment into the Meat Research Trust Account of the proceeds of the research components of bobby calf and calf slaughter levies. The proposed amendment to sub-paragraph 8 (2) (a) ( 1 ) of the principal Act is to authorise the Australian Meat Research Committee to make recommendations on the amounts to be prescribed for the research components of bobby calf and calf slaughter levies. I commend the Bill to honourable senators. </para>

            <para>- Firstly, I wish to explain the procedures which the Opposition intends to follow on the five Bills which are before us. The first three Bills listed on the business paper are a package which seeks to increase the levy imposed on slaughtered livestock for the purpose of financing the tuberculosis and brucellosis eradication campaign. The Opposition will be opposing those three Bills. We intend to call a division on at least the first of those three Bills. The remaining two Bills extend to bobby calves and lighter cattle the existing levy on livestock slaughter which is imposed to finance the administration of the Australian Meat and Livestock Corporation and that Corporation&#39;s meat promotion activities. The Opposition will not be opposing those two Bills. So although we are debating these Bills cognately - </para>

              </talker>
              <para>- I just wanted to make that clear at the beginning, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr President.</inline> We are not opposing the last two Bills because they seek to extend to a class of cattle previously exempt from it a levy that has been applied for some time to other cattle. However, I do observe in passing that we have grave reservations about the justification of the Australian Meat and Livestock Corporation&#39;s present meat promotion campaign. The overwhelming probability is that there can be no possible financial gain to the Australian meat industry in promoting on the domestic market under these conditions, but that is another matter. That is a question of AMLC policy which is not, in our view, directly relevant to the final two Bills of the five Bills that are currently before the Senate. </para>
            </talk.start>
          </continue>
          <para>The three Bills which make up the package for financing disease eradication propose to increase the existing $1 levy on the slaughter of adult cattle to $3. As I have said, we will be opposing those Bills. I readily concede- the Minister for Science and the Environment <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Webster)</inline> will probably make the point in his closing remarks- that a levy for a similar purpose was imposed by the Federal Labor Government in 1973, but we have been persuaded to modify our view on this matter for the following reasons: Firstly, to a substantial extent, the brucellosis and tuberculosis eradication campaign is a public health measure. By contrast, the meat export inspection charges Bills which were debated and passed last week have a purely commercial application. They enhance the value of Australian meat on overseas markets. But there is a public health component in the disease eradication Bills, and for that reason we believe that there is a much stronger case for a greater contribution from public funds. </para>
          <para>The second major reason is that the Bill discriminates unfairly against particular regions of Australia, most notably Tasmania and to a slightly lesser extent Western Australia. I understand that there has been no reported case of tuberculosis or brucellosis in Tasmania for a number of years. The State is provisionally free and maybe entirely free. It is necessary, of course, for any Commonwealth levy to be imposed throughout the Commonwealth on a uniform basis so we recognise that there is no scope for imposing a higher federal levy or tax in those regions of Australia which are still tuberculosis and brucellosis prone. The levy has to be uniform for constitutional reasons. Whilst it is reasonable to argue that one could impose a relatively small levy even on those Tasmanian cattle producers and, to a slightly lesser extent, Western Australian cattle producers who have little concern about this and will derive little benefit from it, we believe that a $3 levy becomes a significant impost. We are opposing it for that reason. </para>
          <para>Supplementary to the points that I have already made is the fact that the Commonwealth Government has not, at this stage, picked up the share of this tuberculosis and brucellosis eradication campaign which the 1975 Industries Assistance Commission report recommended it should do. The eradication of TB and brucellosis is an eight-year campaign, embracing both detection and compensation for the slaughter of diseased animals. Compensation costs will, of course, decline over time. As the diseases approach eradication, fewer cattle will be slaughtered. Therefore expenditure on compensation will decline over time. But the detection costs, if anything, are likely to increase. The Commonwealth liability is limited to paying 75 per cent of the compensation payments for brucellosis and 50 per cent for TB. For the reasons that I have stated, the proportion of the total costs paid by the Commonwealth will be highest in the early years of the campaign, that is, the number of cattle requiring to be slaughtered will be fewer and therefore the amount of compensation will decline over time. </para>
          <para>The 1 975 report of the IAC recommended that the Commonwealth pay 1 5 per cent of the cost of the entire eight-year program, that the industry pay 60 per cent, and that the States pay 25 per cent. To date, however, the Commonwealth has paid only 7 1/2 per cent of the total costs incurred in the eradication campaign; the industry has paid nearly 68 per cent, and the States have paid 25 per cent. If the lAC&#39;s recommendations had been followed, the Commonwealth&#39;s contribution to the total cost of the scheme in the early years would have been something of the order of 25 per cent, possibly even higher. In fact, it has been only <inline font-style="italic">Vh</inline> per cent. The existing $1 levy has not yielded enough revenue to pay the industry contribution. The shortfall in the industry contribution has been met by a Government advance which is recorded as a debt to the industry trust fund. As yet, no interest has been charged on that debt in the trust fund. There are some doubts as to whether it will be applied in the future. The Commonwealth has been providing bridging finance for the industry&#39;s share of the cost of the total program. </para>
          <para>The estimated expenditure for the current financial year was $37. 5m. I understand that has since been modified to something like $33. 5m. On the original estimate of $37. 5m the industry levy was expected to supply $7.8m, the contributions from the States was expected to supply $8. 7m, a loan from the Commonwealth- the bridging finance to which I referred earlieramounting to about $ 12.1m, and the Commonwealth&#39;s compensation grant of about $8. 7m. It is now expected that the compensation expenditure will be only $4m. That is the only Commonwealth contribution to the program, apart from the loan which the industry is expected ultimately to repay. The proposed $3 levy is estimated to yield $23. 26m, which should exceed current industry expenditure on the program, and gradually repay the accumulated debt. The Commonwealth continues not to meet its share of the scheme as envisaged by the IAC. I stress that as the program was envisaged by the IAC, the Commonwealth&#39;s share of the total cost, although 1 5 per cent over the entire eight-year period, would be substantially higher than 15 per cent in the early years of the program. </para>
          <para>Unless the program is completed in 1 984, Australian beef could be banned from the United States markets and other markets. But eradication in northern Australia may prove to be a real technical problem, because of feral cattle and buffaloes, and the extensive management practices. The costs of testing vary quite widely between the States, and nobody seems to have given a satisfactory explanation as to why that is so. At the January 1979 meeting of the Australian Agricultural Council, a proposal was endorsed to modify the protection plan, with more emphasis on traceback which, it was estimated, could have saved some $30m over the five years. It has not been implemented and nobody- nobody I have spoken to, anywayknows why. Perhaps the Minister for Science and the Environment can give us some reasons when he replies to this debate. </para>
          <para>The final two points I want to make are political ones. In speaking in the debate on a similar Bill on 18 September 1973 <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Fraser,</inline> as recorded at page 1205 of the House of Representatives <inline font-style="italic">Hansard said:</inline></para>

          <para class="block">That is, the tuberculosis and brucellosis eradication campaigns-  is borne largely by the States and at the most $6m to $7m would be required from the Commonwealth. </para>
          <para class="block">
            <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Fraser</inline>was using that as an argument against imposing a levy on cattle slaughter. I just note the gross inconsistency between <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Fraser</inline> &#39;s attitude at that stage and the actions that his Government is actually taking now, whereby it proposes to raise from the industry $23.26m by way of levy. </para>
          <para>The other political point concerns the Minister for Primary Industry <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Sinclair)</inline> who, in his second reading speech on the legislation now before us, said on 26 May: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>In times of oversupply of livestock the levy is likely to bc reflected in prices paid to livestock producers. In the reverse situation - </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">That is, when demand for beef is extremely high-  the levy will tend to be absorbed further along the marketing chain. </para>
          <para class="block">What <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Sinclair</inline> was saying was that in times of heavy demand for meat the levy is likely to be absorbed by someone other than the producer and that in times of oversupply of meat the full cost of the levy is likely to be passed on to the producer. Many people would agree with that assessment of the probability but I make the point again that it stands in stark contrast to the comments made by the present Minister for Primary Industry on 18 September 1973, as recorded at page 1 192 of the House of Representatives <inline font-style="italic">Hansard,</inline> when he said:  the Minister must be in dreamland if he thinks that the influence of the levy will not be passed on to the producers. </para>
          <para class="block">The marketing situation at that time was very similar to that of the present time with a very strong overseas demand for beef and very high beef prices. As is typical of this Government in so many areas, the remarks that Ministers make today are totally inconsistent with the remarks and assertions they made when they were in opposition. </para>

            <para>- I will be as brief as possible in my remarks. Basically, I would go along with many of the things that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Walsh</inline> said or implied in the early part of his speech. I think it is well known in this chamber that I have spoken several times on cattle disease eradication and the importance of an eradication program. There is no doubt that, as far as the cattle industry of Australia is concerned, disease eradication still is the most important single factor that has to be considered. On 30 May I got a reply from <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Webster</inline> to a question that I asked on 28 May on brucellosis control. As a result of that a statement was made by the Minister for Primary Industry <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Sinclair)</inline> on 3 1 May setting out the position in a fairly clear and conclusive form. I seek leave to have that statement incorporated in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard.</inline></para>

            <para>BOVINE BRUCELLOSIS AND TUBERCULOSIS ERADICATION CAMPAIGN </para>
            <para>The Minister for Primary Industry, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Ian</inline> Sinclair, today announced that the Commonwealth Government will make available $25. 6m in 1 979-80 towards the State and Territory bovine brucellosis and tuberculosis eradication campaigns. </para>
            <para>Commonwealth funds for campaign operations will total $22m, an increase of 10 per cent on the provision in 1978-79. This is expected to be offset by the proceeds from the $3 per head disease eradication component of the Cattle Slaughter Levy. </para>
            <para>In addition the Government would provide up to $3.6m to compensate producers for cattle compulsorily slaughtered under the campaigns. The contribution to compensation is in the form of a Government grant and is not recoverable from the cattle industry. The Commonwealth contribution to the net compensation cost would be 50 per cent in the case of tuberculosis and 75 per cent in the case of brucellosis. In both cases the balance would be met from State sources. The amount provided for compensation is based on estimates made by the States of the numbers of livestock which they expect to slaughter in their campaigns this year. The amount provided for compensation is less than half the total made available in 1978-79 as expanding eradication testing operations have cleared out heavily infected areas and generally the level of reactors is less than anticipated from the original surveys of brucellosis in cattle. </para>
            <para>Commenting on progress so far the Minister said Tasmania has been free of the two diseases for some years. Western Australia was the most advanced of the mainland States and its efforts to eradicate brucellosis and could reach provisionally free status before the national target date if the present rate of the campaign was maintained. </para>
            <para>The brucellosis eradication campaign in Queensland had been highly successful. Most of the eastern half of the State is under eradication testing and by mid 1979, 20 shires in the north east should be declared provisionally free. By that time only three shires in the south west of the State would not be under eradication testing. The New South Wales eradication plans for 1979-80 would involve eradication testing of 85 per cent of the States breeding cattle and all of the State, except for 7 pasture protection districts in the central west and one in the north west, will be under eradication testing. In addition it is expected that 15 pasture protection districts in the north east of the State will be declared provisionally brucellosis free. Victoria will test 3 million cattle in 30,000 herd tests on 12,500 properties in their State wide program. South Australia will test 1 million cattle in 8,500 herd tests on 3,500 properties and all of the State south of the dog fence should be under eradication testing by 1 979-80. The Northern Territory expects to test 350,000 on approximately 150 properties and eradication activity will be intensified whenever possible. </para>
            <para>Concerning tuberculosis eradication, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Sinclair</inline> said that Queensland hoped to be able to declare all of the State (with the exception of 6 shires in the far west) provisionally tuberculosis free. This means that all cattle in the State except for 0.5 million in 146 herds will be within the provisionally free area. Some 600,000 cattle will be TB tested during the year. Queensland will be approaching the situation which exists in the southern States which are all declared provisionally free even though each State still has some herds in quarantine (Tasmania excepted ) and has to maintain an effective monitoring system to pick up any re-emergence of the disease. In the extensive cattle producing areas of Western Australia, South Australia and the Northern Territory tuberculosis eradication is a continuing problem and marked progress is not expected. </para>

              <para>- Cattle numbers in Australia have come down from the peak of 33.5 million reached in 1976. I understand that the herd numbers approximate 26.8 million and, on the estimates that we are able to get at present, it appears that those numbers are likely to fall a little before it bottoms out in another year or so. I believe that the estimates for bottoming out may even be shown to be a little optimistic. There are still enough farmers in Australia with a liquidity problem which will require them to sell even more stock than is currently budgeted for. I hope that I am wrong, but I believe that we have to look at this as being a reasonable expectation. So that we can get these Bills passed as quickly as possible, I seek leave to incorporate in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> some documents showing livestock numbers on an Australia-wide basis from 1970 to 1979, cattle numbers in Australia and in certain States and slaughtering projections from 1 974 to 1 982. </para>

              <para>- It is interesting to note from these figures not only that cattle numbers are on the decline and likely to continue to do so, but also that until last year sheep numbers were declining very rapidly- although they showed a slight recovery in 1979- and that pig numbers are at their lowest level since 1970. Livestock numbers in Australia are now substantially lower than they have been previously. </para>
            </talk.start>
          </continue>
          <para>I give a warning about the likely results that this will have. I start with my State where the cattle numbers have dropped by almost one-third in the last four years. In this four-year period Tasmania actually has increased its killing capacity quite substantially. The effect that this will have on abattoirs, meat industry employees and associated things will be quite serious. Of course, this will be the case in other parts of Australia as well. We are now overequipped with killing space. I expect quite naturally that the Australian Meat Industry Employees Union also is likely to realise this and will inevitably apply some sort of squeeze to try to recover the loss of earnings that its members will suffer as a result of there being a lower throughput. I think that this is inevitable and that it will be one of the matters to be tested in the right place at the right time. </para>
          <para>This will result also in higher meat inspection costs. I am now referring again to the meat inspectors and other employees in the other half of the industry. I hope that the committee of which Bert Kelly is chairman will be capable of rationalising some of the creeping overheads in this area. While cattle numbers are down and values are high it appears that we should be able to get far more co-operation from farmers in all areas towards disease eradication. The proportional cost of mustering, which has been so high for the last four or five years, made mustering in the outback areas impossible even to contemplate. I believe that with the better prices now we should be able to expect a far greater level of mustering. I think that we have to look to this. </para>
          <para>Recently I was talking to one gentleman who said that during the last two or three years his stockmen occasionally rounded up a bunch of the oldest cows on his property and drove them as far out into the bush as they could to let them die in peace and cause as little trouble as possible. He has now reached the stage of hiring a helicopter to ascertain whether they all died. It is worth it to him to look for the residue of these cattle to try to convert them to money. </para>
          <para>Because of the change in such a short time in the value of animals much of the money which the Commonwealth Government provided to assist the industry over the last year or so was not spent to the current advantage of the farmers. I refer particularly to the contribution paid towards the spaying of females. It has turned out to be quite unfortunate. The killing figures that I have been able to get hold oflately indicate that of the total cattle kill, 50 per cent is female. On this basis it is difficult to try to increase herd numbers. Several speakers have quoted from the report of the Industries Assistance Commission so I will not bother to do so. </para>
          <para>I refer to two points that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Walsh</inline> endeavoured, unsuccessfully, to make. Firstly he said that it was justifiable to try to make political capital by saying that the Bill should be thrown out, on the grounds that it involves a public health and is not a meat matter. If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Walsh</inline> believes that, he is deluding himself. I tell him quite bluntly that it is very much a meat matter. Unless we get brucellosis and tuberculosis under control there will be no sale of meat. It does not matter whether it is a health matter. I respectfully suggest that to say that this is a public health matter will have no reaction at all in the place where we are selling meat. Another aspect of this matter relates to Tasmania. I have a lot of sympathy for the Tasmanians for what they have achieved over time and at great cost. I suggest to the Tasmanians, as I have done before, that we are talking about an Australian industry. It is all very well for them now to say that they feel that they should not have to contribute. But the Commonwealth Government has contributed substantially towards the eradication of brucellosis in Tasmania. There is no way that we will have an export market of Australian meat based on the fact that Tasmania is clean. It is in the interest of Tasmania as much as every other State to see that the eradication program is carried through fully. </para>

          <quote>
            <para>Human brucellosis is an insignificant health problem in Australia when compared to the damage to society caused by such agents as alcohol and motor vehicles. </para>
            <para>For instance in 1977-78 there were 1 IS clinical cases of brucellosis in Australia. </para>
            <para>New South Wales 29; Victoria 12; Queensland 59; South Australia 14 Western Australia - ; Tasmania - ; Northern Territory 1; Australian Capital Territory - ; </para>
            <para>Without exception these 1 1 S cases were either farmers or meat workers. </para>
            <para>The human health hazard in Australia could be reduced without resorting to an expensive brucellosis eradication campaign by emphasizing increased attention to personal hygiene and by controlling the disease instead of eradicating it. Vaccines suitable for control are relatively cheap and effective. </para>
            <para>The justification for the massive expenditure on brucellosis eradication (in 1979-80 Commonwealth and States are expected to spend $36.8m ) depends almost exclusively on the need to ensure that our continued access to the lucrative northern American market is not endangered. </para>
            <para>The Commonwealth, of course, makes grant funds available for compensation payments to producers for the compulsory slaughter of reactor animals. These have totalled $8.5m over the last three years and are expected to be $3.6m in 1979-80. </para>
            <para>
              <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Walsh</inline>referred to the Commonwealth&#39;s share of cost so far being lower than the IAC recommended. This results from the need for compensation payments to be lower than expected. Honourable senators also should not overlook the fact that of the $47m provided by the Commonwealth over the last three years for campaign operations, only $28m has been recovered from industry levies. These additional funds do not enter into the percentage calculations referred to by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Walsh.</inline></para>

              <para>- I am willing to oblige <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Young</inline> and to comply with his sensitivities. The fabrications and hallucinations of Lord Hailsham support the fabrication concocted by Lord Hailsham &#39;s Australian bedmates, by people such as those representing the League of Rights and the extreme Right of the Liberal and National Country Parties. In reference to <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> Kerr&#39;s dismissal of the Whitlam Government, Lord Hailsham said: </para>
            </talk.start>
          </continue>
          <list type="lowerroman-dotted">
            <item label=".">
              <para>. should he - </para>
            </item>
          </list>
          <para>That is the Governor-General-  deem it his duty to use the reserve powers of the Monarchy against a would-be Mussolini, or a Prime Minister who wishes to govern unconstitutionally, he must make his preparations in secret or not at all. </para>
          <para class="block">Leaving aside his Mussolinic hallucination, Lord Hailsham is asserting that the Whitlam Government breached the Constitution. The same fabrication was, and continues to be, asserted by Lord Hailsham &#39;s Australian counterparts. It has never been specified by these constitutional literalists what sections of the Constitution were alleged to have been breached. It never will be because no sections were breached. Lord Hailsham charges <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Whitlam</inline> with being a republican, an attribute which is abhorrent to Lord Hailsham. Giving free rein to his febrile mind, he then asserts with respect to republicanism: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>Commonwealth statesmen would do well to reflect that a republican form of Government, in which the executive assumes independence of the trusteeship of the Crown, leads straight along the path to Tea Pot Dome, Watergate or Mulder - </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">By which I presume he means Muldergate-  and the Sanjay motor factory, and possibly to Idi Amin or worse. </para>
          <para class="block">In short, Lord Hailsham is asserting that republics are necessarily corrupt and constitutional monarchies are above corruption. Somebody should remind Lord Hailsham about the milliondollar bribes accepted by Prince Bernhard and perhaps someone should remind him that his Tory ministerial colleague, Reginald Maudling, was kicked out of Parliament when his corporate criminal activities were exposed. Perhaps someone should remind him also of the Thorpe case and a few other things that go on in England. </para>
          <para>Lord Hailsham exhibits a penchant for wrapping up his political prejudices in pseudo-judicial trappings.  His  Australian quasi-counterpart has exactly the same penchant. In 1974 a Court of Dispute Returns judgment cleared <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Webster</inline> on the grounds that no evidence had been presented to suggest that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Webster</inline> had used his senatorial position to secure Postmaster-General contracts. That was quite true. But it was not the charge; it did not refer to the charge. The charge was that he was a shareholder in a company of less than 25 persons which had contracts with the Commonwealth and was therefore in breach of section 44 (v). The enormity of the Chief Justice &#39;s finding in this matter was dramatised in two contemporary comments made by Federal Liberal politicians, both lawyers. I will not embarrass them by naming them, but one said that it had destroyed his faith injustice and the other said that if <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Webster</inline> was not caught by section 44 (v) nobody could be; the section was meaningless. </para>
          <para>In the next brazen demonstration of political bias the Chief Justice went beyond emasculating those sections of the Constitution which do not suit his purpose. If the legal assertion of his cousin, who is a former Solicitor-General and Attorney-General, is correct, the Chief Justice&#39;s advisory opinion to <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> Kerr in 1975 was actually illegal. It breached the judgment of his own court which ruled in the engineers&#39; case that the court could not give advisory opinions. In what purported to be a review of <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> Kerr&#39;s book published in the <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> of 19 December last, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Ellicott</inline> claimed not only that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Whitlam</inline> knew he could be dismissed but that he actually expected to be dismissed. The proof <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Ellicott</inline> offered was that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Whitlam</inline> had not appealed to the High Court against his dismissal. That assertion by the Chief Justices &#39;s cousin, a former Solicitor-General and Attorney-General, blows apart the excuse offered by the Chief Justice at the National Press Club on 10 June 1976. When asked by journalists about the legality of his advisory opinion, the Chief Justice replied: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>It  doesn&#39;t  alter my own opinion. The question of whether the Governor-General could withdraw his Ministers&#39; commissions could never come before the High Court in any shape or form. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">Questioned later at that Press Club meeting he said: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>No, I had no need to consult with my fellow judges. For one thing it was a matter that could not in any sense come before the court. There is no doubt about that. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">I will not indulge in any legal sophistry, for which I am not trained anyway. But anyone who comprehends simple English can see that the assertions by the Chief Justice and his cousin are mutually exclusive. At the very least the Chief Justice&#39;s action was legally arguable but that did not deter him from pressing for and sanctioning the most provocative, enduring and divisive political action Australia has known since the conscription fracas of World War I. </para>
          <para>The Chief Justice was shocked on that occasion by the tenacity and by the legal skill of journalists who interrogated him on that day. In a previously unreported comment after the formal luncheon had ended he showed his mind all too clearly. &#39;If I had been Governor-General&#39;, he said, &#39;I would have sacked Whitlam the day after the Senate first deferred the Appropriation Bills&#39;. </para>

            <para>- Honourable senators will be aware that yesterday in the House of Representatives the report of the Australian delegation to the United Nations 33rd Session and the report by the Australian delegation to observe the elections in ZimbabweRhodesia were presented to Parliament. Those reports had some pertinent things to say about events in southern Africa. Just a few hours ago the  President  of the United States of America announced that, in spite of the recent elections in Zimbabwe-Rhodesia, the United States would not recognise that country, nor would it take off the international sanctions imposed on it. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>I wish to make some observations on the current situation in Zimbabwe-Rhodesia, South West Africa-Namibia and South Africa itself. There has been some disquiet about the constitution of Zimbabwe-Rhodesia which entitled electors to vote. There have been questions raised that the white minority there still holds control of the police, the judiciary, the security forces and the public service. For the information of honourable senators, a copy of that constitution was placed in the Parliamentary Library by the honourable member for Wills <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Bryant)</inline> yesterday. If honourable senators peruse the constitution they will see that it is quite flexible. Power does reside in the hands of the black majority in that Parliament in that it has complete authority over the allocations of money to the armed forces and to the police. Honourable senators may find that information reassuring. </para>
          <para>Turning to the elections in ZimbabweRhodesia, as honourable senators know there was no register of voters in that country. Voting is not compulsory there, as is the case in many other places. Other methods were determined to ensure that as many people who were  entitled  to vote did vote, but double voting was avoided. South West Africa-Namibia and ZimbabweRhodesia have held elections which have been judged to be technically fair by the swarms of observers and reporters from international papers and agencies. None of them could find any defect that would render invalid the decision of the electorates. From our observation the reporters were basically hostile to the governments holding those elections. Similar regulations to those in force in South West Africa-Namibia and Zimbabwe-Rhodesia are used in other countries in Africa and in parts of the Third World. For example, there was no register of voters in Gabon and no register of voters in Mozambique for their  1978  elections. Further, there was no register of voters in Iran this year for the refer- endum for the establishment of the Islamic Republic. The practice of requiring electors to dip their fingers in indelible dye for identification purposes is not unusual. It is the system used in Iran, Kenya and Tanzania. The fact that regional party lists were used is not unusual. They are used in Senegal. Even in the Ivory Coast they have a national list. The fact that there are reserves or appointed seats is not unusual either, because that system is used in many countries, particularly Malawi, Sierra Leone, Zambia, Kenya and Tanzania, where 106 of the 206 seats are reserved. Of course, in Lesotho all of the seats are reserved. </para>
          <para>Zimbabwe-Rhodesia has now satisfied the entire six principles, laid down by successive British governments over the years, as qualifying her for independence. The problem was always one for Great Britain to decide. It still is and the sooner Great Britain can bring ZimbabweRhodesia to legality the sooner she can decolonise her in the same way as she has decolonised her other colonies over the years. In that way, less upset will be caused all of the countries of the Commonwealth. The withholding of recognition from both of these countries has been caused by the fact that the General Assembly of the United Nations, the front line states and the Organisation of African Unity have painted themselves into a corner by their support for SWAPO-the South-West African People&#39;s Organisation- and the Patriotic Front. It is because these two nationalist groups have refused to take part in elections- although invited to do so- that their backers are opposing recognition. These two external parties have not contested the elections, simply because they were not sure of winning. The publication of extracts from a recent Luanda meeting show a resolve on the part of the SWAPO, Angola, Zambia and Botswana to make unreasonable demands upon South Africa regarding the bases of SWAPO within South-West African Namibia, demands that South Africa could not possibly meet, and then blame South Africa for breaking off negotiations. </para>
          <para>Certain nations, including Australia, are clearly applying double standards in regard to recognition of administrations that have been established by force. I cite as an example the recognition of Pol Pot in Kampuchea in 1975, as compared with the refusal to recognise Zimbabwe-Rhodesia. While I am on that subject I remind honourable senators that when Mozambique and Angola came to independence, they had imposed upon them governments that were not subject to elections at all. In other countries, such as Saudi Arabia, the people are governed entirely without elections. In countries such as Nigeria, Jordan, Kuwait and Saudi Arabia, women do not get a vote at all. It is impossible to escape the conclusion that Australia and other nations are withholding recognition, not because of a careful analysis of the merits of the case but because they do not wish to run counter to the views of the front-line states, the Organisation of African Unity, some members of the Commonwealth, and some members of the Third World- a number of which are far less democratically governed than is ZimbabweRhodesia. Any steps which encourage the forces of SWAPO and the Patriotic Front to hold out for a unilateral takeover of these countries makes their chances of success just that more likely. If that happens, the risk that the whole region will pass under the control of parties that are committed to their social backers is also more likely. I stress at this stage that in both ZimbabweRhodesia and South-West Africa racial discrimination has been eliminated in its entirety. </para>
          <para>I turn now to South Africa. Whatever anyone may think about the apartheid policies of the Republic of South Africa, one must concede that it has brought about many changes. So far as the South Africans are concerned, they are far-reaching changes. As far as other people are concerned they may have been changes that have occurred too slowly and have not gone far enough. But the fact is that many changes have been made. The important thing is that the South African Government is getting no credit for the changes that it has made. The West and the Third World countries are making a grave mistake if they think that these changes are being made from a position of weakness. It is a bigger mistake to think that by applying more pressure they will get more changes. Unless South Africans can see that the changes are bringing some reward by way of co-operation it will be hard for the South African Government to convince the electorate that it must make further changes. It will also increase the risk of more support going to the Right wing politicians, who would put a stop to any changes occurring at all. </para>
          <para>It has been claimed that recognition of Zimbabwe-Rhodesia and South West AfricaNamibia, with the removal of sanctions from Zimbabwe-Rhodesia, would split the Commonwealth of Nations. Maybe it would. But in all fairness, on a cold analysis of the facts, Britain, Canada, Australia and New Zealand should give a lead to the Commonwealth and recognise those nations and remove the sanctions. By some twisted logic there are those who think that recognition would aid the aims and objectives of the Soviet Union. I mentioned previously in my speech that exactly the opposite would occur. Far from upsetting Britain, the United States, New Zealand and Canada we should be putting spurs into them to recognise and cut sanctions. Why should we all be applying sanctions when Britain, France, Canada and the Soviet Union are breaking them, and have been doing so for years? The sanctions have been a sick gesture and the sick gesture has now become a sick joke. </para>
          <para>What is in it for Australia, one might ask? Apart from any moral questions, I think security is important. Our trade with Europe has to go around the Cape route. If the oil artery to Europe were cut it could grind the wheels of Europe to a halt within a few months. South Africa has ports which are fully operational. She has an immense defence force; she has roads, railways, telecommunications; and above all she has people, both white and black, who are pro- West. In Southern Africa there are critical supplies of strategic minerals, and as I see it there is some urgency to see that those supplies are not added to the reserves of the Soviet Union and denied to the West. I see the security of the Indian Ocean as important, particularly with its African choke points at Gibraltar, the Suez, the Red Sea, the Gulf of Aden, Zanzibar, Mozambique and the Cape itself. </para>
          <para>As honourable senators will know there is an inability for the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation forces to come below the Tropic of Cancer, but there is no such restriction on the Soviet forces. Perhaps I place too much importance on the security question, but I think not. Concerning trade, Zimbabwe-Rhodesia, South Africa and probably South West Africa-Namibia would in all likelihood be competitors of Australia. To some this may appear to be an impediment but at least we have been free of that competition for some years. Nevertheless, there are great investment possibilities in those countries, as the British and American investors have found out. Tourism between us would be a boon to all. Anyone who has been there will attest to that. Sporting, artistic and cultural exchanges could be nothing but agreeable. </para>
          <para>In the wider sense, Zimbabwe-Rhodesia, South West Africa-Namibia and South Africa have had experience in bringing underdeveloped peoples to economic, social and political independence. These experiences should not be neglected by the rest of the world. The rest of the world has few enough successful examples but these countries have many. They have realised the paramount importance of tribalism- I stress tribalism not nationalism- to the black Africans, the importance of land to the tribes and the tragic effects for all those peoples of the entrenchment by the Organisation of African Unity of the colonial boundaries. Those colonial boundaries divided the tribes and rendered most of the sub-Sahara countries in Africa ungovernable. </para>
          <para>Zimbabwe-Rhodesia and South West Africa-Namibia are now destined to become independent countries with popularly elected governments, with or without the blessing of the international community. South Africa is a militarily powerful country and if necessary will fight to preserve her future. She cannot be conquered by any other country in Africa and I am sure that she would not stand idly by and watch Zimbabwe-Rhodesia and South West AfricaNamibia fall to Marxists, as happened in Mozambique and Angola. We should short circuit all this and recognise that the elections in South West Africa-Nimibia and ZimbabweRhodesia have opened the way for an association of free States working together for their security and progress. </para>

            <para>- I desire again to say a few words on a matter that I have raised continually in this Parliament since 22 February. Yesterday when speaking in the debate on Supply Bill (No. 1) I said that if the Government did not supply me with an answer to my question as to whether the immediate past Governor-General has a free telephone service between Australia and England I would raise the matter again at the earliest opportunity. I spoke to the Opposition Whip today and asked him to speak to the Leader of the Government in the Senate <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Carrick)</inline> to see whether he had an answer. The answer has not yet been given to me. So I am as good as my word. I said yesterday that I would raise the matter again today. It is now 1 5 weeks since I asked whether that gentleman has a free telephone. It looks as though the Senate will go into the winter recess and I will have to wait until the Budget session to ask my question again. I tried to get the answer through legitimate means- firstly by asking a question without notice, then by putting a question on notice and again during the Estimates Committees&#39; consideration of the supplementary Supply Bills. I could not get an answer. I can only assume that in fact this person has a free telephone. If he has not, the Government could quite easily have come back with an answer to that effect. </para>

            <para>- I refer to the situation facing Australian musicians and recording artists, many of whom are associated with or involved in an organisation known as the Australian Music Makers Association. I raise this issue because I believe that this industry should be recognised as a major industry with great potential. Those people involved in the industry have initiative and energy and can add a great deal to this nation&#39;s development. It should also be recognised, because of its importance to Australian cultural development, the arts and our national ethos. It also makes a significant contribution to the image of Australia in many other countries. It has to be emphasised that this industry is not seeking support because it is uncompetitive. Given a fair go, it has shown that it can be more than competitive even against the European and United States marketing machines which are involved in this sort of industry. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>My concern is a result of a prolonged delay by the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal in deciding on an increased quota for Australian music broadcast by Australian radio stations. My fear is that that decision, if not made soon and in the interests of Australian performers, could deal a serious blow to this important industry. The many people involved in the industry produced a pamphlet last year in which it was pointed out that Australia has the second highest per capita spending on recorded music in the Western world, yet Australian musicians, artists and record makers have to struggle to survive. Many of these talented people have to leave Australia to gain the success that they deserve. As I understand it, 80 per cent of broadcasting time is given over to non-Australian products. This has stunted the growth of this already substantial, but potentially much more important, Australian industry. The Australian Broadcasting Tribunal, in a report some time ago, indicated that from 1 May this year there should be an increase of from 20 per cent to 30 per cent in the time available for the transmission of music programs of Australian performances. The Government has indicated its support for this proposal. In relation to that, I seek leave to incorporate in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> a letter from the Minister for Home Affairs <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Ellicott)</inline> on the subject. </para>

            <para>I refer to your letter of 14 November 1978 about the playing of Australian music on Australian radio. </para>
            <para>I wrote to you on 4 January 1979 advising that a subcommittee of the Australia Council&#39;s Music Board would report to the Board in February on the problem of increasing the Australian content of radio music programs and examine the proposals put forward in the pamphlet &#39;Fair Play for Australian Music&#39;. </para>
            <para>The Board has now met and I am advised that it has welcomed the Government&#39;s decision to introduce a 30 per cent quota for Australian music on Australian radio from 1 May 1979. On the specific points raised in the pamphlet, the Board sees no reason to alter its position on the Australian music content of radio programs stated in its submission to the IAC Enquiry into the Music Recording Industry in Australia in September 1977. </para>
            <para>In its submission, the Board endorsed the following principles: </para>
            <para>A points system should operate which is weighted in favour of Australian composition. </para>
            <para>Artists to whom the local content rule is applied should be either of Australian nationality or currently resident in Australia. </para>
            <para>The points system should favour the use of local content in peak listening times. </para>

              <para>- I thank the Senate. This letter followed a question I asked in the Senate on 28 February. At that time I was informed that the Government had indicated its general endorsement of the Tribunal&#39;s proposal. However, no action has yet been taken to implement the Tribunal&#39;s recommendations. It is my understanding that now there may be some suggestion that the quota be increased to only 25 per cent, with an increase to 30 per cent next year. The Australian Music Makers Association has suggested- I support its view- that a 30 per cent quota for Australian performances should be introduced immediately, and this should be increased by annual increments to a total of 40 per cent. The Association has suggested that this be done over five years. The Minister for Post and Telecommunications <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Staley)</inline> has indicated that discussions on this matter are still being held.

            <para>I have discussed with <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Bruce</inline> Gyngell,  Chairman  of the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal, the matter you raise and he has informed me that the Tribunal is having discussions with the Federation of Australian Radio Broadcasters aimed at reaching an early decision. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Gyngell</inline> has stressed the importance of ensuring that the decision is capable of implementation given the various forms of music currently  being broadcast and the ability of producers to supply recorded music in these forms. </para>
            <para>I understand that the Tribunal will give the matter its undivided attention when the current public inquiries into the renewal of the three Melbourne television licences conclude in mid-June. </para>
            <para>Yours sincerely, A. A. STALEY </para>

              <para>- I thank the Senate. There has been a substantial delay in this matter already and I believe it should be resolved as quickly as possible in the interests of Australian artists. I believe that the Broadcasting Tribunal should implement its own recommendation, which the Government has endorsed, and immediately introduce a quota of 30 per cent for performances by Australian artists. It is my view that the proposal of the Australian Music Makers Association for an increase to 40 per cent by the mid-1980s is a modest and a reasonable request which should also be endorsed. I reiterate that this is an industry which has great potential and which is not simply seeking protection to prop itself up; it is seeking a fair go so that the full benefit of the industry might be felt by the whole of Australia and not just those involved directly in the industry. Therefore, I believe that it is a matter of some urgency and that the Broadcasting Tribunal has a duty to act promptly. If it does not introduce the 30 per cent quota it could deal a serious blow to an industry with enormous potential, both within Australia and overseas. If it does so it would be only a proper recognition of that industry and the efforts of those involved in it. </para>

            <para>- I intended to speak at some length on the motion for the second reading of the Wine Overseas Marketing Amendment Bill but because of the lateness of the hour on this, the last day of session, I intend to keep my remarks to a couple of minutes on the motion for the first reading of these wine Bills. I merely indicate my concern and the concern of members of the Federated Liquor and Allied Industries Employees Union of Australia about the amount of wine that is imported into Australia compared with the amount of Australian wine being exported. There are about 1 70 manufacturers of wine in Australia, and about 6,000 Australian workers are engaged in the manufacturing side of the wine industry. That section of the industry- apart from the growing or agricultural section- has an annual wage bill of about $38m. So honourable senators will see that the wine industry is of considerable importance to employment opportunities in Australia. As I said, I had intended to speak at length on this subject but I now intend to make more comments on the subject during the Budget session. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>While the Government is engaging in its Export Now policy- a lot of publicity has been given to that campaign by the Department of Trade and Resources and the Minster for Trade and Resources <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Anthony)-</inline> the Department should be attempting to step up Australian wine exports if employment opportunities are to grow within the industry. I have obtained from the Australian Bureau of Statistics the latest figures available on the industry, which relate to the financial year 1976-77. In 1976-77 some 5.2 million litres of still wine was imported into Australia, the total value of which was $7.2m. However, in that year only 4.8 million litres of Australian wine was exported, the total value of which was a mere $4.5m. So whilst the value of wine imported into Australia in 1976-77 was $7.2m, the value of wine exported was $4.5m, or almost $3m less. While the Government is engaging in an Export Now policy, I suggest to the Minister for Science and the Environment <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Webster),</inline> who is at the table, and to the Minister for Trade and Resources <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Anthony)</inline> that they should be looking at the promotion of Australian wine, particularly on the export market, to ensure that there are greater opportunities for Australian workers in the industry. I will deliberately cut short my remarks, but I believe that this is a matter of great importance. If the Government is looking for employment opportunities, this is one way in which those opportunities can be achieved. </para>

            <para>- I wish to take advantage of the first reading of the Wine Grapes Levy Bill to make a few brief comments about penalty rates. I was quite staggered to hear a few minutes ago the contribution made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sheil</inline> when he spoke about southern Africa. I must say that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sheil</inline> is always consistent when he talks about Zimbabwe-Rhodesia and South Africa. I know that he believes what he says, but I think he is tragically wrong. If he looked at the situation that occurred in the election that took place recently in Zimbabwe-Rhodesia he would find that 4 per cent of the white minority in that country had 28 per cent of the votes in the lower House. The role of the Senate is not being talked about at all at the moment, but one-third of the people who were elected to the Senate are from the white minority and one-third are from the ranks of the tribal chiefs. If one looks at the statements of the tribal chiefs and their role in ZimbabweRhodesia, they often turn out to be more conservative than the whites. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>
            <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sheil</inline>was putting a case for the instant recognition of Zimbabwe-Rhodesia and a lifting of the restrictions that apply. Of course, if that were to happen there would be an immediate campaign by all the black countries in Africa. Moderate countries such as Nigeria, Kenya and Tanzania have pledged themselves to support the Patriotic Front if this situation occurs. This would be a tragedy because there would mean a step-up in the fighting and a step-up of the guerrilla activity. The Rhodesians themselves would turn to South Africa, and I think everybody recognises that South Africa has said that it would commit itself militarily in a situation such as this. Of course, with the forces that South Africa possesses, it would be in a much stronger situation than the Patriotic Front. As I have said, if the Patriotic Front, aided by moderates states such as Nigeria, Kenya and Tanzania, did not have arms and could not get supplies it would turn to the Eastern bloc. It has been said already that the East Germans acknowledge that they have in Africa what they call volunteers who would be prepared to fight. There would then be a blood bath that nobody would be able to stop and nobody wants. </para>
          <para>It is not often that I agree with the Prime Minister of Australia, but I am sure that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Fraser</inline> knows that. One only has to read his statements to understand that. One has to read only what  President  Carter and the United States Ambassador to the United Nations, Andrew Young, have said to realise that they know it too. It is for that reason that the United States will not lift the sanctions that apply at the moment and bring about instant recognition of ZimbabweRhodesia. It seems to me that only <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sheil</inline> and Margaret Thatcher do not seem to understand that point of view. </para>
          <para>I want to speak briefly about an issue that is causing a great deal of concern to a large number of trade unionists and their families. I refer to the consistent attack on penalty rates by this Government and by employer organisations. Under the guise that assistance has to be given to tourism and to the tourist industry, a campaign has been orchestrated by the Press, especially the <inline font-style="italic">Sydney Morning Herald</inline> and the <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> aimed particularly at the liquor and hospitality employees in this country. No regard has been given to the consequences of this campaign. One only has to look at the history of penalty rates in this country. They have been an integral part of the Australian wage structure since 1947, following a test case in the Federal Arbitration Court. They are standard in seven-day-a-week industries. People in the industries do not regard penalty rates as fringe benefits. Because they have been in existence since 1 947, the people who work in those industries now regard penalty rates as a basic industrial right. </para>
          <para>There has been no consultation with the trade unions about this at all and, if it continues, there will be complete industrial chaos in the hospitality industry. It will not be any help for tourism at all. The unions will ensure that. It will be of no help to tourism if people cannot get a drink, if they cannot get their meals and if they have to carry their own luggage. There has been a union campaign against this situation. There are 90,000 members of the Liquor Trades Union throughout Australia. In New South Wales, 15,000 members of the Liquor Trades Union have already attended stop work meetings. Honourable senators hear a lot from the Government about the fact that unions hold stop work meetings and nobody turns up; only a militant few are able to manipulate union meetings. I stress again the fact that at stop work meetings called in an industry where it is particularly hard for some people to attend meetings, over 15,000 people have attended. They are determined. They voted unanimously. If this campaign continues they will close every club and hotel in this country. </para>
          <para>There are people who say that that is a threat, that the union is threatening industrial anarchy. I pose the question to anybody in the work force, or to any honourable senator: Who would be prepared to drop 25 per cent of their weekly salary if there were an immediate taking away of penalty rates? That is what it means to the vast majority of people who work in this industry. One also hears members of the Government talk about the odd person in the hospitality industry who, because of overtime rates say at Christmas time, earns a huge amount of money. The vast bulk, the overwhelming majority, of people in this industry do not receive those wages. They receive ordinary wages with inbuilt penalty rates. For historical reasons, weekends in Australiaespecially Saturday and Sunday nights- have been considered to be free time. Of course, some industries must continue over the weekends. The hospitality industry is essential but, as I have said, there are hundreds of thousands of people in the liquor industry whose average weekly wage is $2 10 a week. That includes penalties. </para>
          <para>It is also said by some people that in Australia and New Zealand there is a penalty rate situation that does not exist in any other country and that, therefore, they are better off. I point out that Australia and New Zealand probably also have one of the safest industrial records and some of the best workers compensation schemes anywhere in the world. Does that mean that we should start attacking these conditions the way that the penalty rates are being attacked? I would say not. It has been said by many people that if penalty rates are cut then that will help the tourist industry. If one compares Australian tariffs with those in the major tourist resorts, one finds that Australian rates compare quite favourably. </para>

              <para>- The <inline font-style="italic">Australian</inline> carried a short but very revealing article on 2 February 1978 which reported on the regular <inline font-style="italic">Financial Times</inline> survey of the relative costs of hospitality in the major trading cities of the world. Sydney was thirtieth out of 72 cities, and well behind other capital cities where no penalty rates are paid to any of the employees. In many cases, room service would cease altogether at about 10 p.m. and many of these countries by comparison are very low-wage economies. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Hamer</inline> mentioned people not being able to get a meal on a Sunday. I suggest that in a lot of tourist resorts in the world, a similar situation exists. I suggest that honourable senators go to Fiji or Hawaii and try to get room service after midnight when there are no penalty rates, see what is charged, and compare that with the wages that people get. </para>

          </continue>
          <para>The Liquor Trades Union in New South Wales carried out a survey throughout the world. I will not take the time of the Senate by quoting extensively from the document that I have. I will just mention one particular example, in which the Liquor Trades Union found that the Hyatt hotel in Berlin charged $80, in Hawaii the charge was $60 and in Sydney it is only $45, and yet Sydney was the only place where penalty rates were paid. Similar examples can be quoted in detail for many other cities, especially Karachi, Bangkok, New Delhi, Calcutta and other Asian nations where hotels are as expensive or more expensive than Australian hotels but in which the people employed work for pathetically low wages by Australian standards. Often, a section of the staff works for nothing else but tips. </para>
          <para>The Premier of New South Wales has pointed out that the only fair way to adjust the present penalty system without provoking industrial chaos would be to negotiate a trade-off in wage levels. I believe that this process would be painstaking and would take a long time. It would cost almost as much as the present system. I have raised this issue as a warning to the Government that a deliberate attack on penalty rates would be unjust and would be seen to be unjust by those who have come to expect them as part of their conditions. Such an attack would be based on false premises economically and would be an invitation to prolong industrial conflict. The Liquor Trades Union in New South Wales is gearing itself for a prolonged conflict and for industrial chaos if this campaign continues. </para>

          <para class="block">Wine Grapes Levy Bill 1979 </para>
          <para>The purpose of the Bill is to ensure that levy is paid in respect of all grapes and grape juice used in the production of wine, brandy and spirit for fortifying wine. This was the intention of the Wine Grapes Charges Act 1929, now to be replaced by the provisions of this Bill. Because of developments in wine industry technology it has become apparent that the Act does not authorise levy collections in certain situations. In terms of the Wine Grapes Charges Act levy is payable by the owner of the winery or distillery to which grapes are delivered &#39;for use in the manufacture of wine&#39;. Of particular significance are new methods of storing single strength grape juice at the establishment producing the juice pending a decision at some future stage whether to convert it to wine manufacture, or sell the juice to another establishment which would use it for the manufacture of wine. Under the existing law levy is not payable on these transactions. </para>
          <para>To ensure that the original intentions of the Wine Grapes Charges Act are fully met, the Bill provides that levy is payable by the proprietor of the establishment concerned in respect of grapes and grape juice when used in the manufacture of wine, brandy and fortifying spirit. For the bulk of grapes received, the wine making process starts immediately following crushing and so most of the levy would continue to be paid on the fresh grapes used. Levy on the fresh grape equivalent will be payable by a winery when grape juice is used for wine making in those instances where it has been brought in from another establishment or has been stored prior to wine making. The winery would not be liable in respect of grape juice sold for consumption as such. </para>
          <para>The proceeds of the levy form the income of the Australian Wine Board, which is responsible under the Wine Overseas Marketing Act 1929 for controlling export of wine, undertaking promotion in Australia and overseas and research into the quality of Australian wine and brandy. </para>
          <para class="block">The maximum rate of levy imposed by the Wine Grapes Charges Act is $2.50 per tonne in the case of fresh grapes. This maximum is being retained under the provisions of the Bill. Additionally, for the purposes of calculating levy, provision is being made for conversion of dried grapes and grape juice to their fresh grape equivalents. The existing operative rate of levy at $2.40 a tonne for fresh grapes is also retained and provides the Board with an income of about $1.lm a year. </para>
          <para>The Bill is presented following concern being expressed within the industry of the possible adverse and growing effect on the funds available to the Board if no payment of levy were made on grape juice brought into wineries and put to wine making or of grape juice not used immediately for wine making. The Bill is to come into operation on the date that royal assent is given but with provision being made in section 5 for the levy to be imposed on prescribed goods used in the manufacture of wine on or after 1 January 1979. Under the terms of the Wine Grapes Charges (Repeal) Bill to be introduced the Wine Grapes Charges Act is to continue in operation until 30 June 1979. Having both Acts operate for the first six months of 1979 is to facilitate the transition from the old levy system to the new one. There are, of course, provisions to obviate double payment of levy on any grapes or juice. </para>
          <para>
            <inline font-weight="bold">Mr President,</inline>I should refer to recent representations from parliamentarians both here and in the other place advocating that grape juice be brought within the jurisdiction of the Wine Board to enable it to promote the product. In this connection I mention that a working party of senior representatives of the industry- private and co-operative winemakers and grapegrowers under the chairmanship of the Department of Primary Industry is currently engaged in a review of the constitution and functions of the Board, the method of financing its operations and the range of products which might be covered by its charter. In the Government&#39;s view it would be appropriate to await the outcome of that review and then determine, after consultation with the industry, whether grape juice might be included in the Board&#39;s functions. I expect that legislation will come forward in the Budget session covering proposals for the Board&#39;s reconstitution. In summary, the Bill preserves the intention of the Wine Grapes Charges Act and meets the concern expressed by the industry generally that, as a result of changes in technology and in industry practices, action is needed to protect the funding of the Australian Wine Board. I commend the Bill. </para>
          <para class="block">Wine Grapes Levy Collection Bill 1979 </para>
          <para>This Bill is complementary to the Wine Grapes Levy Bill 1979 and is to facilitate the collection of levy imposed under that Bill. Under the Bill levy collection procedures are formalised which follow closely those that have been developed for other primary industry levies. The Bill includes penalty provisions for non-payment of levy, recovery of amounts unpaid and power to call for returns. There is to be provision for self assessment of levy. Additionally, the Bill preserves existing provisions for levy to be paid in two equal instalments at six monthly intervals. I commend the Bill. </para>
          <para class="block">Wine Grapes Charges (Repeal) Bill 1979 </para>
          <para>This Bill is a machinery measure to repeal the Wine Grape Charges Act 1929 which is to be replaced by the Wine Grapes Levy Bill 1979 and the Wine Grapes Levy Collection Bill 1979.

            <para>- The purpose of these Bills is to close a loophole in the existing levy applied on wine, the major purpose of which is to fund the Australian Wine Board in its administration and promotion activities. Because of changing technology in the wine industry a great deal of grape juice can now be held in store for a considerable length of time and then either processed into wine or passed on to another wine maker. Some of the wine processed in this way has been escaping the levy. I think that it follows logically that if the levy is justifiable it ought to be paid by all the people who produce the product. For that reason, the Opposition does not oppose the Bills. The Minister for Primary Industry <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Sinclair)</inline> in his second reading speech in the House of Representatives referred to an inquiry which is presently going on into the operations of the Wine Board. A number of important criticisms have been made of the Board by members and senators from both sides of the Parliament, particularly in the last year. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Douglas</inline> McClelland made such a criticism last September. In view of the limitations on time and the fact that the inquiry to which I have referred is taking place, it is probably not necessary for me to go into much detail about the matter. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>Another matter which ought to be raised in relation to these Bills concerns the possibility of a wine tax in the next Budget and the draft report of the Industries Assistance Commission which was released a couple of weeks ago. If the Government accepts the recommendation of the IAC inquiry into grapes and wine it is likely that a tax on wine in some form or other will be imposed in the August Budget although the Government may decide to wait for the final report before acting. Leaving aside any argument about whether such a tax is justified, serious doubts are again raised about the credibility of the Minister for Primary Industry. Last December in the South Australian Riverland the Minister gave an unequivocal assurance to grape growers that there would be no tax on wine. I quote from an article in the <inline font-style="italic">Australian Financial Review of 20</inline> December. It stated: </para>

          <para class="block">In the horror Budget at the end of May we saw two other unequivocal assurances which had been given by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Sinclair</inline> abandoned, namely his absolute guarantees that the nitrogenous fertiliser bounty would be maintained and that there would be no meat export inspection charges. The growers in the Riverland and other wine producing areas of Australia to which <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Sinclair</inline> referred have every reason to feel very nervous. The absolute guarantees of the Minister for Primary Industry in other instances have been shown to be worth nothing.  His  guarantee to the Riverland wine producers may yet be shown to be equally worthless. I sound those words of warning to wine producers. </para>

            <para>- I wish to point out one or two aspects of the future of the wine industry. Unfortunately, owing to the shortness of time my remarks will be abbreviated. But I want to draw attention to the recent statement by the Industries Assistance Commission in its draft report on grape growing, and to draw attention specifically to the difficulties which the implementation of that report in its draft form would create for the wine industry in South Australia in particular. I draw the Senate&#39;s attention to the specific point that I do not believe that it is possible to consider the brandy industry as an industry distinct and separate from the wine industry. I believe that that difficulty, when traced back to the draft report of the IAC, stands out quite clearly as being one of the blockages in the thinking of people when people consider who try to regulate and tax the wine industry. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>I also draw specific attention to the fact that particular crops-for instance, barley- are grown specifically for beer, for the manufacture of spirits or for other purposes. Those crops can be produced over a 12-month period. The farmer putting in those crops can be flexible in the way he approaches his plantings each year. He can choose to put in a grain which is in demand on the world markets and which brings a good price from one year to another. He can choose between wheat or barley or some other grain. Above all, he has only a 12-month commitment. If his crop fails for one reason or another, he has another year in which to attempt to recoup his loss. However, with the wine industry I point out that it takes some six years to bring a vine to maturity. Consequently, during that period the vines need careful tending and their growth needs to be carefully monitored. A very costly investment is entered into. The end result is a very inflexible product. One type of grape is produced, only after a long growing period and a large amount of capital investment. </para>
          <para>In the last eight or nine years there has been a significant market change, but the inflexibility of the wine industry renders it virtually impossible to adapt to such market changes. It is that inflexibility which is at the core of the difficulties of the grape growing industry, particularly, in my home State of South Australia. I believe that the IAC and the Government need to give consideration to the proposition that an element of flexibility should be introduced into the wine industry. I point out the fact that the brandy industry- I link this with my initial statement- is the key to flexibility in the wine industry. As you would well understand, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr President,</inline> in a year of surplus grape production brandy can be made and stored for a number of years in such a way as to soak up the surplus production. In South Australia there is a surplus this year of some 1 8,000 tonnes of red wine grapes. That is quite apart from the fact that in the next year or two we will see a significant upturn in the number of vines coming into production 5 to 6 years after their planting. Consequently a surplus of possibly 100,000 tonnes of grapes will come onto the market in the not too distant future. </para>
          <para>Action needs to be taken now to ensure that flexibility is given to the wine industry. I suggest that the Government should give due consideration to allowing the brandy industry to be considered as an integral part of the wine industry so as to provide that flexibility. In order to do that, it should consider the introduction of a differential rate of brandy excise as compared with the excise that now applies to imported spirits in Australia. I believe that that solution is one that ought to be considered by the Government with all due seriousness in the light of the circumstance that has arisen here. Recently a question asked by the honourable member for Wakefield, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Giles,</inline> in the House of Representatives elicited that in the last 12 months, whereas the Budget was set down to bring in $130m worth of revenue from excise on spirits including Australian brandy, the likely outcome for the financial year ended 30 June 1979 is less than $100m worth of revenue. So there will be a shortfall of some $30m in respect of that excise. That follows a rise of some 80 per cent in the excise on brandy in the last financial year. I believe that in light of those particular matters and in light of the need to consider the flexibility of the wine industry, so that it can adapt itself to the needs of the future, the reintroduction of a brandy differential in excise ought to be a major part of the Government&#39;s consideration. </para>

            </talker>
            <para>-I rise to say only a few words on the same subject. I believe that the wine industry is in real difficulties, simply because of the excise that was placed on that industry in the last Budget. It is true that the brandy industry is an integral part of the whole wine industry. It employs many people. The Treasury will not receive the $130m it expects from the extra excise and what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Messner</inline> failed to say is that there are people in that industry who are unemployed and that is of no benefit whatsoever to this nation. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>I am concerned that this Government is thinking about putting an excise on wine. I believe that this would completely destroy the industry. I will agree with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Messner</inline> that this industry cannot take sudden changes. If there is to be any adjustment in the industry, the change has to occur over at least a five or six-year period. The wine industry is the most vulnerable industry of all the agricultural industries. This has not been taken into consideration in the past. In 1 970 an excise of 8.3c a bottle and approximately 25c a flagon was placed on wine, but the actual price of the wine went up by 12c to 15c a bottle and by 35c to 40c a flagon simply because of State taxes and other expenses involved. In that same year, the wine industry had a growth rate of 10.7 per cent. After the excise was placed on the wine in 1970, this figure fell to minus 0.3 per cent. The same thing would happen today. In the last Budget the excise on brandy was increased massively from 10.2 lc a litre to 1 8.75c a litre. The industry now has a large surplus of brandy that it just cannot get rid of. It has over 13 million litres of brandy in stock and there is simply no way of getting rid of it. Anyone who goes to the grape growing area will see tonnes of grapes rotting on the vines, and I believe that that situation is quite intolerable. </para>
          <para>It is estimated that 22 1 million litres of wine, with a value of approximately $330m, will be sold by the end of June. If this Government imposes an excise of 1 per cent on that wine the return will be $3. 3m. But that will not be the case, as it was with wine in 1 970. </para>
          <para>The wine and brandy industries certainly should be given a sympathetic hearing by this Government. I do not believe that the report of the Industries Assistance Commission justifies any increase. If there is to be an increase in excise it should be planned over a long period. Growers should be forewarned. Plantings could be adjusted over a period of five or six years. I believe then that the industry would increase. This industry has had continual setbacks over the years because of successive Government interference. The brandy industry has contributed $136,715,734 in excise in the period 1972-78. In 1977-78 the brandy industry contributed $28,955,560. It is not possible to assess the industry&#39;s contribution this financial year. Possibly it will be much the same because brandy sales have remained static. I do not think the Government will receive anywhere near the revenue it is seeking. A large number of people work in the industry, in the distilling section as well as in the growing section, and I ask the Government to take cognisance of that fact. In view of the time I will conclude my remarks, but I think many other honourable senators would like to say more. </para>

            <para>
              <inline font-weight="bold">- Mr President,</inline>I will be brief. I intend to limit my remarks to the promotion of sales of Australian wines overseas. In the second reading speech the Minister for Science and the Environment <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Webster)</inline> indicated that the Australian Wine Board is responsible, under the Wine Overseas Marketing Act 1929, for controlling the export of wine and undertaking promotion in Australia and overseas. In the annual report of the Australian Wine Board for 1977-78 we see, on page 10, that exports to the United Kingdom in 1976-77 were as low as 528,000 odd litres. In 1977-78 only 485,000 litres were exported to the United Kingdom. There was a drop of 8 per cent. By comparison, in 1960 almost five million litres were exported, ten times more than the latest result. The Board then gives quite extraordinary reasons for why sales of Australian wines have dropped. Some of these reasons I agree with; some of them I cannot agree with. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>Overseas, particularly in the United Kingdom, if one looks at the wine list in restaurants one sees wines from practically all countries, European Economic Community members and others, except Australia. 1 feel this is an area where the wine board has failed in promoting Australian wines overseas. If we look further into the report, we will see that the wine centre in London is mentioned. About three weeks ago I wanted to buy a couple of bottles of wine and 1 went to that centre. I am not very familiar with London but I must say that when I went to Soho where the centre is I was quite perplexed to find the kind of shops that are next to the Australian Wine Centre. A younger person or a lady would not be tempted to go to that street because there are sex shops, one next to the other. I was looking at what was going on in that street where the Australian Wine Centre is - </para>

              <para>- Perhaps it is, but the fact is that it is hidden where no one can find it. In London, we have many premises in more important avenues where this centre could be located. It is said that the Australian Wine Board operates a gift centre which enables people under the scheme to send Australian wines to their friends in the United Kingdom. I have never seen the scheme advertised anywhere in Australia. I wonder how many people know about the scheme which enables people to send Australian wines to their friends in the United Kingdom. </para>

          </continue>
          <para>I would like to know why Australian wine centres are not established in other countries such as Italy, Greece and Yugoslavia. There are many migrants in this country who would like to send Australian wines to their friends but they cannot. I feel that the promotion of Australian wines is absolutely negligent or ridiculous; it does not exist. Net expenditure on overseas promotion- and this does not relate only to the United Kingdom-in 1976-77 was $91,087 in Australia currency. In 1977-78 it was $66,274. That is the total net expenditure by the Board on overseas promotion which receives $ 1 m from the levy. I wonder how far $66,000 goes towards covering the market overseas. </para>
          <para>What does the Wine Board do about the quality of Australian wines? The April issue of the very prestigous magazine called <inline font-style="italic">Gourmet</inline> contains an article about the Indian-Pacific train which runs between Sydney and Perth. The article reads: </para>

            <para>- I will not speak for very long on these four wine Bills now before the Senate but it would be remiss of me if I did not again say that it is disturbing to find right at the end of every session that the Government sees fit to bring in for debate Bills dealing with primary industry. I do not know whether it is deliberate or not, but it does curtail debate. It can be seem from the House of Representatives <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> that the second reading speeches on these Bills commenced in the other place on 22 March and here we are in the dying hours of this session having to curtail our remarks on these Bills. It is now three months since they were introduced into the other place. This is just not good enough. I invite honourable senators to have a look at the position in respect of the other Bills that we have had to deal with today including the livestock Bills as well as the wool industry Bills yesterday. All of those Bills dealing with primary industry should be reviewed by this Senate. This is a House of review but, as I have often said, it is really not a House of review. I will not go into that at this time; the people who sit opposite know my views on that subject. It is a tragedy that we have to deal with these Bills, which are so important to primary industry in Australia, right in the death throes of a session. I hope that when we come back for the Budget session the Government will see fit to bring on primary industry Bills early in the session so that they can be given due consideration. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Messner</inline> said that one could not separate brandy grapes and wine grapes. He mentioned that the Government expected to get $ 1 30m- I think he said- from the brandy excise it imposed in the Budget and that there was a shortfall of $30m. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Messner</inline> will recall that when there was a lengthy debate about that brandy excise we on this side of the chamber, along with the grape growers of Australia, warned the Government that that very thing would happen. </para>

What <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Sinclair</inline> said- and I quote it from his own telex- is that the Government is not thinking of introducing an excise or tax on wine &#39;at this time&#39;. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr President,</inline> you know as well as I do the ramifications which the industry suffered when <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Gorton,</inline> the then Prime Minister, put on a wine excise. It created havoc in the industry. In view of the fact that the Opposition is supporting these Bills, I will not say any more at this stage. </para>

            <para>- I support what has been said about the urgent situation that faces the wine industry and the fact that the Government should not contemplate doing anything in the Budget to damage it further at this stage when it is faced with tremendous grape surpluses. I just reiterate what I said recently in the Senate. I made these points also to the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Malcolm Fraser).</inline> The Government has to bear in mind the loss of tax revenue that would follow an inevitable downturn in the wine sales, which has been borne out by the lower revenue that we have received as a result of the imposts on potable spirits; the costs associated with carry-on finance that would be needed by disadvantaged growers as a result of such an imposition; the loss of revenue due to downturn in activity for small businesses and service industries in grape growing areas; and the increased unemployment benefits that would be the inevitable result if any further impost were placed on the industry at this stage. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>I also support what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lajovic</inline> said about the need to promote our wines overseas. The purpose of these Bills is to provide money for the Australian Wine Board. I believe that the Wine Board should pay due regard to the need for a professionally organised market survey of countries such as America and Japan. In America there is growing awareness of the pleasures associated with the drinking of Australian wine. I believe that that is a very fertile market which could be explored by the Wine Board to our advantage. I support exactly what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lajovic</inline> said about that. I have pleasure in supporting the Bills. </para>

Honourable senators from both sides have shown restraint in their speeches. I know that they would wish to speak at length.

          <para class="block">Customs Tariff Amendment Bill 1979 </para>
          <para>The Customs Tariff Amendment Bill 1979 now before the Senate proposes amendments to the Customs Tariff Act 1966. The Bill, which contains 14 schedules, is necessary to enact tariff changes made by Customs Tariff Proposals Nos. 1-15 (1979) which have been introduced into the House of Representatives at different times since February this year. Also included in the Bill are changes of an administrative nature. In the main, the amendments give effect to decisions by the Government in respect of the following reports by the Industries Assistance Commission: </para>

          <para class="block">Honourable senators will recall that when the Tariff Proposals were introduced a summary in respect of each of the Proposals was circulated setting out the nature of the change in duty rates and the origin of each change. A consolidation of those summaries has been prepared and copies may be obtained from the Records Office. I commend the Bill. </para>
          <para class="block">Excise Tariff Amendment Bill 1979 </para>
          <para>The purpose of the Bill now before the Senate is to enact the Excise Tariff Alterations moved in the house on 27 February and 4 April 1979 by Excise Tariff Proposals Nos 1 , 2 and 3. The first alteration increased the excise duty on naturally occurring liquefied gas to $13 per kilolitre. This follows the announcement by the Minister for National Development <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Newman)</inline> on a package of measures designed to encourage the use of liquefied petroleum gas as an alternative energy source. The second alteration follows determination by the Minister for National Development of new import parity prices for the period 1 January 1 979 to 30 June 1 979 in accordance with the Government&#39;s decision that all Australian produced crude oil should be priced to refineries at import parity levels. </para>
          <para>The third alternative is complementary to alterations to the Customs Tariff Act 1966 contained in the Customs Tariff Amendment Act 1979. A new item has been inserted in the Excise Tariff Act 192 1 to provide for the duty free entry of goods, other than alcohol or tobacco, that are, at the time they are entered for home consumption, owned by certain authorities or bodies established for a purpose of the Commonwealth by or under an Act of the Commonwealth. This is an interim measure pending examination by the Government of which, if any, such authorities should receive exemption from Customs or excise duties. I commend the Bill to honourable senators. </para>

            <para>- I will outline the procedure which the Opposition will follow. These Bills are being debated cognately. We are not opposing the Customs Tariff Amendment Bill. We will be moving an amendment to the second reading stage of the Excise Tariff Amendment Bill. I will speak only briefly. Those who noted the comments of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Hurford</inline> in the House of Representatives with respect to the Customs Tariff Amendment Bill will have seen that he suggested that some sort of parliamentary committee ought to replace the present unsatisfactory practice under which changes in tariffs and excise which have already occurred are retrospectively validated by the Parliament without any real examination. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>The purpose of the two Bills is to validate changes in tariff and excise which occurred up until the early part of May this year. The Customs Tariff Validation Bill and the Excise Tariff Amendment Bill (No. 2) which appear at the bottom of the business sheet will provide provisional validation for subsequent changes in tariffs and excise. I refer now to the Excise Tariff Amendment Bill. Since it is a component of the Government&#39;s crude oil pricing policy which has been the subject of strong, sustained and justified criticism by the Opposition for a long time, I move: </para>
          <motion>
            <para>At end of the motion add &#39;, but the Senate is of the opinion that the Government&#39;s crude oil pricing policy has imposed a severe burden on the Australian public by way of rapidly increasing petrol prices and through its adverse effects on Australia&#39;s inflation and unemployment rates and should be reviewed &#39;. </para>
          </motion>
          <para class="block">The Government&#39;s oil pricing policy has been to some extent reviewed. I repeat that under this Government the price of petrol at the bowser will have, by July or August of this year, doubled in three years. The 1978 changes to the earlier crude oil pricing policy are directly responsible for inflation running at higher levels now than it was a year ago and will be responsible almost certainly for inflation running at higher levels over the next 1 2 months. The Government has recognised in its horror Budget changes some of the weaknesses of its policy and it has modified it. But is has not modified that policy to the extent which we believe it should have. Consequently, we have moved our amendment. </para>

            <para>-That is acceptable. As the Minister probably knows, we do have amendments in respect of two of those Bills which we propose to move at the second reading stage. I will speak only briefly on this package of five Bills. The two Bills to which the Opposition will move amendments are the Bounty (Books) Amendment Bill and the Bounty (Rotary Cultivators) Bill. The purpose of the amendment we propose to move to the Bounty (Books) Amendment Bill is to reduce from 1 ,000 to 500 the minimum print run which qualifies for the bounty. The amendment we propose to move to the Bounty (Rotary Cultivators) Bill expresses concern about the Government&#39;s failure to give a satisfactory explanation of the move it is taking in introducing that legislation, in particular of why it has not implemented the full recommendations made by the Industries Assistance Commission when it reported on the matter. We do not oppose the other three Bills. I move the following amendment to the motion for the second reading of the Bounty (Books) Amendment Bill 1979: </para>

          <quote>
            <para>At end of motion add &#39;, but the Senate, whilst supporting bounty assistance for local printers, is of the opinion that such assistance should be provided for minimum runs of500 copies instead of the present 1,000 copies in order to aid smaller, more specialised printers who have previously been encouraged to invest in facilities through, for instance, the investment allowance, and who must be encouraged to undertake structural adjustment in more equitable and less costly and disruptive ways&#39;. </para>

            <para>- Again I will be very brief. These two Bills, neither of which the Opposition is opposing, authorise some changes in tariffs and excise which have already taken place from about 10 May onwards. They will also authorise changes in tariffs and excise which may take place between now and about the middle of November. The legislation seeks to authorise those changes within a six months period. As I said, the Opposition does not oppose either of these Bills. </para>

            <para>-The Opposition is opposing this Bill which seeks to implement the decision announced during the 24 May horror Budget to impose a tariff of 2 per cent on nearly all imports previously free from tariff. The Bill, as it now stands somewhat amended, is less obnoxious than the original Bill which was introduced in the House of Representatives on 24 May. That Bill was amended by the Government after debate on it had almost been completed in the Committee stage which is a testimony to the hasty and ill-considered nature of the legislation. Last year&#39;s Budget, of course, was rewritten more times than most people can remember and now we seem to have the same spectacle with this mini-Budget or horror Budget. It will be recalled that the excise Bill which implemented the new crude oil levy arrangements also had to be redrafted at the last minute. Of course, the Ministers responsible for this legislation have had a number of other things on their minds in recent times. It is just as well there is no more primary industry legislation in the pipeline. This, of course, is a case of desperation move after desperation move by a desperation government. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>The principal reason we are opposing the Bill is that it will unquestionably be inflationary. In its original form the Government estimated it would add $80m to the cost of imports which would add directly about 0.15 per cent to the final consumption expenditure and it could be expected to add something considerably more than 0.15 per cent to the consumer price index over the next 12 months because of its indirect effects on production costs and also because it is likely to lead to price increases among competitive domestically produced goods. It applies to an enormous range of goods, from raw fish to aeroplanes. The reason given by the Government for the change is the Florence Agreement to which Australia is not a signatory but the terms of which evidently the Government feels obliged to honour. A number of commodities to which the Government originally proposed that its 2 per cent import tariff would be applied are exempt under the terms of that agreement. </para>
          <para>This draws attention again to the hastily and ill considered nature of this move, this further desperation move by a desperate government. It makes Australia also look hypocritical- not that there is anything unusual about that these days. A week before the statement of the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Howard)</inline> was made on this matter the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Malcolm Fraser)</inline> was grandstanding in Manila, lecturing the rest of the world about the virtues of removing barriers to trade. When he returned to Australia he did the opposite. As has so often happened with this Prime </para>

              <para>- Yes, deception. If it is not conscious deception then it is certainly deception. In the joint communique issued with the  President  of the Philippines on 1 1 May, the Prime Minister said that it was of critical importance to achieve significant reductions to barriers in world trade. Yet as soon as he returned to Australia we find his Treasurer and his Government announcing another new tax which imposes a further barrier to world trade. At this rate the Prime Minister&#39;s credibility will be as low abroad as it is at home, if it is not already. </para>

              <para>- The last time I checked his credibility it showed about 20 per cent of the people believed the things he was saying. I imagine after the last few weeks the number will have declined to single figures. Probably it will be even lower than the inflation rate. The Opposition opposes this Bill for the reasons I have stated. The Bill is a desperate measure by this desperate Government. It was searching around for any means possible to raise additional revenue. Obviously inadequate thought was given before the Government implemented it, evidenced by the fact the Government had to amend the items which are covered. As with virtually all the changes made in the 24 May horror Budget, it will add to inflation, the containment of which has been the declared primary objective of this Government ever since it came to office; an objective initially in which it had some success but in which it is now failing. That completes the total pattern of failure of this Government under this Prime Minister. </para>

            <para>- I wish to express my very grave concern that the Attorney-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Durack)</inline> should have tried to lay the blame in regard to this document that is before the Parliament upon the Senate Records Office. The honourable senator should be ashamed of himself for trying to shed the blame to somebody else when it is the Government&#39;s responsibility. Certainly, the people in the Senate Records Office were efficient in having this document prepared, but they would not have prepared it had they not had previous advice from the Government that it would not give any consideration at all to the two amendments that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Walsh</inline> moved to the previous Bills, and would not even take into consideration that we would be opposing this Bill. It is all very well for the Government to try to get itself off the hook and blame the Senate Records Office. Any Minister who is prepared to shed the blame, and place it upon his staff, does not deserve to occupy the position of Minister. </para>

So, in its own way, the name of Odgers has taken its place, with us, in the context that the Erskine May image holds in the minds of students of the Westminster system of parliamentary democracy. </para>
          <para>Although all honourable senators may not share all of his views on the proper role of the Senate, we are all indebted to him for the many developments that he has fostered and guided throughout his service in this chamber. Following a grant to study the functions and procedures of the American Senate and its committees in 1955, his report laid the groundwork for our Standing Committee system. He was Secretary to the committee appointed by Government senators in 1964, the report of which provided the basis for the &#39; 1 965 Compact &#39; which has since determined the division of items between the two categories of Appropriation Bills. Time does not permit me to refer to all his achievements but, as honourable senators will be aware,  Her  Majesty the Queen bestowed the Honour of Commander of the Order of the British Empire on him in 1968. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Odgers</inline> has dedicated himself to the Senate and to the institution of Parliament for over 40 years. I am sure all honourable senators will join me in wishing him a long and happy retirement. Our very good wishes and thanks go also to <inline font-weight="bold">Mrs Odgers</inline> who has served with her husband during the period of his work in the Senate, with all the strain on her patience and understanding which the sitting hours of this place impose upon wives and families. I ask <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Odgers</inline> to take back to his family our own admiration and respect for the work that he has done.  His  great contribution will be, and is, a living monument to him. That is not always available to all men. </para>

            <para>- I wish briefly to support the remarks of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Carrick.</inline> I would perhaps go one stage further than saying that Jim Odgers, as we know him, is something of an authority. I think it is fair to say that he is an authority in the area of procedure, particularly in this chamber, and we have been indebted to him over the years. The quite monumental work that he has prepared and updated, <inline font-style="italic">Australian Senate Practice,</inline> is a unique work. It is a curious work, I suppose, because for us in this chamber it is a mixture of the Bible and the Koran, and the thoughts of Chairman Mao I suppose could be thrown in as well. That might account for the red cover. There is no doubt that without that book all of us would have been lost at sea on many occasions. This would also apply in the years ahead. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>It is the custom to refer to &#39;Odgers&#39; for our guidance in the way in which we conduct the very complicated procedures and overcome the difficulties in which we find ourselves. It is appropriate that we place on record the indebtedness of our parliamentary system to that which Jim </para>
          <para class="block">Odgers has contributed. I do not think there is anyone amongst us who would take a different view. May I also say that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O</inline> &#39;Byrne, who had to leave earlier today, as the longest serving member of the Senate was hoping to be here this evening so that he could say a few words. Unfortunately he is not here. I just want it recorded that he would have liked to have been here in order to say a few words. My only advice to Jim Odgers is that during the course of his retirement the best place that he could spend it in is Tasmania and if he gets the time I can assure him that he would be most welcome down there. </para>

            <para>-Honourable senators, I wish warmly to endorse the sentiments expressed by the Leader of the Government in the Senate <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Carrick)</inline> and the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Wriedt).</inline> I feel that there is no more laudable attribute in anyone&#39;s character, and in fundamental good citizenship, than personal integrity and loyal and dedicated service to the causes to which the person is attracted. These attributes mark our worthy <inline font-weight="bold">Clerk, Mr J.</inline> R. Odgers, CBE. He is indeed a man of absolute integrity, a man of outstanding ability and judgment, who has been completely dedicated to the wellbeing and strengthening of the institution of the Parliament and of the Senate in particular. He has always pursued his duties selflessly, impartially and fearlessly, never deviating from the course which he set to serve the best interests of the Parliament. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>He has served the Parliament for 42 years, the Senate in particular for 37, of which 14 years have been as Clerk. His is a distinguished publicservice for just under 50 years since entry to the Public Service in Adelaide in 1930. The monumental work <inline font-style="italic">Australian Senate Practice</inline> will ever remain a vital book of reference, not only here but also in parliaments throughout the world. The fifth edition of his book will ever keep the name of Odgers remembered here, as has been that of Erskine May in the British tradition. I trust that we shall see a sixth edition of his great work. I wish to express my sincere thanks to him for his quite magnificent assistance to me in my office as  President.  He is indeed a good and loyal friend, tried and true, to whom, together with his good wife Jean, I tender on behalf of all honourable senators best wishes for health and happiness in his retirement. </para>

            <para>An evaluation of the pilot phase of the program (JulyDecember 1977) was carried out by the Department of Education and the report was published in November 1978. While the report was essentially a descriptive account of the program in its developmental stage, there were however some encouraging results. Although EPUY was not a job training program in the same way as other employment training programs such as SYETP, 28 per cent of students who returned questionnaires which were sent to them after they had completed courses had obtained work. Another encouraging result was that seven per cent of students who began courses returned to formal education on course completion. </para>

          <quote>
            <para>At UNCTAD V in Manila the Prime Minister stated that Australia will be fully supporting the Fund&#39;s first window operations and that we will make an &#39;effective&#39; contribution to the Fund &#39;s second window. I am not yet able to advise when the precise level of our contribution will be announced. While the developed country members of UNCTAD have undertaken to make assessed contributions to the first window of the Fund to a total of SUS218 million the exact details of how this sum is to be apportioned between the countries concerned has not yet been agreed. </para>
            <para>We have also proposed that there should be some broad agreement on an equitable burden sharing approach for contributions to the second window and this question has still to be discussed. </para>
            <para>It seems unlikely, therefore, that a decision by the Government on its contribution to either window will be possible until further negotiations in the Interim Committee of the Negotiating Conference which meets in September to draft the Articles of Agreement for the Fund. </para>

            <para>Yes, in certain circumstances. It has always been a provision of the Tertiary Education Assistance Scheme (TEAS) that a student who has undertaken one course at the tertiary level may be assisted for a second course if it is at a higher level than the first course, or for the number of years by which a second course at the same level exceeds the duration of the first. For example a student who has completed a three year teaching diploma may be assisted for a postgraduate diploma course or for the fourth year undergraduate diploma or degree course. </para>
            <para>Prior to 1979 it was possible for a student who had completed a first course of teacher training such as a Diploma of Teaching to receive assistance from the commencement of a degree course in a field related to teaching, e.g. a BA. This concession was introduced in 1973 to enable teachers to upgrade their qualifications. </para>
            <para>In the 1 978 Budget context it was decided that the special concession relating to teaching courses should be phased out from the beginning of 1 979. The Student Assistance Regulations were amended in October 1 978 to give effect to this decision. </para>
            <para>In deciding to phase out the teaching concessions, the Government considered it could no longer justify special arrangements in relation to training for the teaching profession while no such arrangements apply to training for other professions such as Engineering or Medicine. There is no longer a need to give special encouragement to people to undertake teaching courses, and there has now been reasonable opportunity for teachers who undertook the shorter training courses years ago to upgrade their qualifications. </para>

Most country newspapers, however, are eligible for posting under the registered publications service and qualify for Category &#39;A&#39; postage rates which are about one quarter of the postage rates which would apply if full postage were payable. Furthermore, many publishers of registered publications had their postage costs substantially reduced in October 1 977 following the transfer of some publications from Category &#39;C to categories &#39; A &#39; or &#39; B &#39;. </para>
          <para>About one third of the articles posted under Category &#39;A&#39; are country newspapers and on this basis the average subsidy on this mail financed by other users of the service is the equivalent of 1 2.8 cents per newspaper. </para>

              <para>and (b) The Australian Government received a communication from the United States Government in March 1979 in which the United States Government advised that it was prepared to espouse the Dillingham Corporation &#39;s claim for compensation and that, if the different views existing between the two Governments could not be resolved, it was willing to have the matter decided in an international forum. </para>
            </item>
          </list>
          <para>The Government gave careful consideration to this communication. In response, it advised the United States Government that, while it did not agree to a United States proposal to refer the matter to arbitration, if the matter were to be referred by the United States to the International Court of Justice, Australia would not insist on the normal requirement that Dillingham Corporation first exhaust any legal remedies in Australia. The Australian Government would not invoke the United States reservation to the compulsory jurisdiction of the International Court of Justice, as it would be entitled to, in order to challenge the Court&#39;s jurisdiction in this case. </para>
          <para>The Australian Government made it clear that it would be prepared, if it was thought that this would assist in resolving differences of opinion, to engage in discussions with the United States Government with a view to explaining the reasons for the Australian Government&#39;s position. </para>
          <para>The Government had earlier made an ex gratia offer of $4m, determined on an after-tax basis, to the DM Minerals partnership through which the Dillingham Corporation had an interest in mining on Fraser Island. The offer had regard to the loss of expected profits for the year 1977, and extraordinary costs incurred by the partnership in the closure of the enterprise. An offer on the same basis to another company engaged in mining on Fraser Island was accepted. The Government was informed in March that DM Minerals would not accept the ex gratia offer. </para>
          <para>The Australian Government remains of the view that no compensation is due to Dillingham, either under Australian law or international law. </para>

          <quote>
            <para>In his statement on 9 May 1979 to the Fifth Session of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development the Prime Minister said that he believed individual governments of developed countries should be prepared to allow increased market access for imports from developing countries. The Prime Minister pointed out that Australia had been doing this very effectively for more than a decade. Over this period the percentage of our imports coming from developing countries had nearly doubled and the rate of increase in recent years had been nearly 35 per cent per annum. </para>
            <para>Unlike in most other countries elements of the Australian tariff are regularly reviewed through the Industries Assistance Commission inquiry process and this will continue. In overall terms there has been a significant reduction in duties over the last five years. </para>

Will the Minister establish whether Telecom has given consideration to installing vandal-proof telephones of the sort widely used in the United States of America? </para>

          <para>The Minister for Post and Telecommunications has provided the following answer to the honourable senator&#39;s question: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>Telecom Australia assigns a high priority to the repair of public coin telephones known to be out of order. Regular checks on the condition of public telephones are carried out but for the most part the Commission is necessarily dependent on reports from the general public to learn that units are unserviceable. Telecom believes that in many instances, and particularly where there is another public telephone nearby, a faulty unit may not be attended to for some dme simply because it has not been reported out of order. </para>
            <para>To provide early information back to the service centre on faulty public coin telephones, Telecom is currently introducing newly developed fault detection equipment which will automatically monitor the performance of public telephone equipment in all capital cities and suburban areas. The data provided by this new equipment enables staff at the exchange to quickly identify public telephones which are faulty and prompt repair action can then be taken. </para>
            <para>Insofar as the introduction of sturdier public telephone facilities is concerned, a seven-year program to modernise the public telephone service was commenced in 1976. As part of this extensive program, all older type vandal prone instruments are to be replaced with a particularly strong and more vandal resistant instrument. This instrument, called the CT3, is one of the strongest and most advanced of its type, lt was selected from world-wide tenders and is manufactured to the exacting requirements of Telecom to suit Australian conditions. </para>
            <para>It is considered that the wider installation of the CT3 telephone and public telephone monitor equipment will significantly alleviate the problems which have been experienced in the past with regard to both the incidence of public telephone faults and delays in restoring affected installations. </para>

          <para>The Minister for Productivity has provided the following answer to the honourable senator&#39;s question: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>Technological change has become, potentially, a very divisive issue in recent months and an issue about which much uninformed comment has been made. The use of emotive terms such as &#39;the impending computer holocaust&#39; add nothing to informed debate on the central issue of the effects of technological change on people. </para>
            <para>Suggestions by some groups that Australia should simply forgo new technology is, I believe, totally unacceptable. Our competitors in international trade will continue to embrace new technological developments and our whole economic system and our standard of living would suffer if we did not follow suit. </para>
            <para>Technology in the form of new products and manufacturing processes arising out of industrial research and development will generate new employment prospects and could well form the foundation for whole new industries. </para>
            <para>This is not to suggest that the economic and social consequences of new technology should be ignored. The impact of technology is an issue on which the community at large is seeking information and guidance from the Government. It was with this in mind that the Prime Minister on 1 December 1 978 announced the establishment of an independent Committee of Inquiry into Technological Change in Australia (CITCA). </para>

The Treasurer has provided the following answer to the honourable senator&#39;s question: </para>
          </talk.start>
          <quote>
            <para>The question is based on a false premise, as there has been no general increase in housing loan interest rates as was suggested by the honourable senator. Bank housing lending interest rates are generally now one percentage point lower than at the beginning of 1978. </para>
            <para>Home loan interest rates charged by Permanent Building Societies have very recently increased in New South Wales and the Australian Capital Territory only. However, prior to that adjustment, rates in these regions were at the lower end of the range of rates charged by Societies across Australia; the very recent adjustment, in broad terms, returns rates in NSW and ACT to the levels prevailing prior to January 1979, which are below the peak levels of 1976 and 1977. In the other five State, loan rates charged by societies are generally up to a percentage point lower than at the beginning of 1978. </para>
            <para>While the Government shares the honourable senator&#39;s concern for the position of the genuinely unemployed, it would not be an appropriate means of assistance for the Government to issue directives to housing lending institutions of the kind suggested. </para>
            <para>Experience shows that most lenders, who are in the best position to assess the situation of individual customers, give sympathetic consideration to requests fora rearrangement of repayments from borrowers in financial hardship. </para>
            <para>Finally, it should be noted that if the criterion were solely whether the income-earner of a family unit were unemployed that would not take into account the overall income position of the family unit and hence not necessarily be closely related to the extent of any need. A criterion based on family unit income would be difficult, if not impossible, to administer and would lead to anomalies. It seems preferable that individual cases continue to be considered on their merits by mortgage lenders. </para>

            <para>There has been a tendency in some quarters to understate the degree of competition that does exist between banks in Australia with 25 private, Government and trustee banks providing trading or savings bank facilities through, in most cases, extensive branch networks. In addition, there are three specialist banks- the Commonwealth Development Bank of Australia, the Australian Resources Development Bank Limited and the new Primary Industry Bank of Australia Limited. There are also other types of financial institutions that actively compete with banks in providing at least some of the facilities offered by banks: these include finance companies, money market corporations, building societies and credit unions. </para>
            <para>It should be emphasised that there is no policy bar to Australian interests seeking to establish a new bank in Australia. The position is that there is provision in the Banking Act for corporate bodies to apply for new banking authorities that may be granted unconditionally or with conditions. Any application by Australian interests proposing to incorporate and establish a bank would be considered by the Government on its merits. Obviously the applicants would need to demonstrate a standing and financial strength commensurate with the responsibilities involved in operating an authorised bank. </para>
