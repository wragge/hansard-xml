            <para>That recipients of Supporting Parents Benefit are discriminated against compared to widows and divorcees who have the care of dependent children. </para>
            <para>The main area for concern is their ineligibility for issue of the Pensioners Health Benefit Card. This card enables recipients and their children to receive free medical care, pharmaceutical benefits and optometrical benefits which are a vital necessity to the well-being of these families. The lack of this entitlement can cause extreme financial hardship and suffering from lack of necessary treatment and medication. </para>
            <para>Your Petitioners therefore humbly pray that in this International Year of the Child all Australian children be considered an equal part of this country's wealth and that the Health Act be amended so that Pensioners Health Benefit Cards can be issued to those receiving Supporting Parents Benefit.

            <para>Lithuania, a nation of over 3 million people, is deprived of human freedom and those national and individual rights which are deemed sacred in Australia today. </para>
            <para>In 1940, Lithuania was occupied by the USSR in coalition with Hitler Nazi Germany. Lithuania, with a history of seven centuries as an indentifiable State and also twenty-three years as a modern republic, now represents a compelling case study of the violation of human rights by the Soviet Occupation Regime. The Lithuanian nation accepted Christianity in 125 1. By 1386 most of the Lithuanian State had accepted Christianity and Western European culture. </para>
            <para>Those who have the courage to speak out in defence of national and human rights in Lithuania are dealt with by the Moscow government in a manner which is abhorrent to every freedom- minded person in Australia. </para>
            <para>In recent times the following Lithuanian dissidents have been imprisoned in concentration camps: Viktoras Petkus, Balys Gajauskas, Nijole Sadunaite, Algirdas Zypre, Petras Plumpa, Sarunas Zukauskas, Vytautas Kavoliunas, Povilas Petronis, Ona Pranckunaite, Petras Paulaitis, J. Matulionis and many others. </para>
            <para>We ask you to condemn the following methods which the Soviet Regime makes use of to silence dissidents- prison camps, psychiatric institutions, drug therapy and exile in Siberia. We further ask you to intercede on behalf of the above mentioned Lithuanian dissidents in order to free them from their imprisonment. </para>

            <para class="block">To the Honourable the  President  and Members of the Senate in Parliament assembled. The petition of the undersigned respectfully showeth that the sales tax as applied to articles handmade by artisans is unfair. </para>
            <para>An artisan is a handcraftsman or handcraftswoman who exercises a non-agricultural activity, revolving around the transformation of materials with his own handwork or that of his family. On craft, above all, the accent must be on design, practicability and quality, where the craftsman must perforce pay highly for his raw materials and time must not be a conditioning factor in the making of an article. </para>
            <para>This petition seeks the objective examination of the existing Sales Tax Acts in respect to persons seeking to earn their living by the labour of their hands alone. </para>
            <para>Every day skilled artisans are being forced out of their livelihood, not by the competition of machine made goods, not by the high price of materials, but by the injustice of antiquated sales tax laws. The artisan, thus taxed out of his living, will then go onto unemployment benefits, or worse still, to prostituting his craft by sacrificing his professional integrity, forcing him to lower his standards of workmanship in order to conform to existing laws. </para>
            <para>Your petitioners most humbly pray that the Senate in Parliament assembled, should immediately create a sales tax exemption for all hand crafted articles. </para>
            <para>We also request that the current exemption limit of $ 1 ,400 and $1,000 respectively referred to in items 100-(1) and 100-(2) of the Sales Tax (Exemption and Classifications) Act 1935-1967, be immediately raised to a realistic figure, in line with current living standards and from then on to be periodically reviewed so as to keep pace with the Australian standard of living. </para>

        <para>To the Honourable the  President  and Members of the Senate in Parliament assembled: The Petition of the undersigned respectfully showeth: </para>
        <para>That in spite of numerous measures taken by various governments, unemployment in the country has not significantly declined. </para>
        <para>As a result, supplies of both goods and services have declined; human resources are wasted capital resources are not used and natural resources are left under-developed. </para>
        <para>Both local and overseas experience shows that prosperity is encouraged when taxes, which penalise production are replaced by taxes which provide incentives for productivity. These also provide disincentives to idle speculation such as that which results in so called 'windfall profits' from land price increases. </para>
        <para>The reduction of Income-tax, Sales-tax and Payroll tax is known to reduce the costs of production and to stimulate demand. </para>
        <para>It is also known that when Land Tax or Council Rates are raised on the unimproved site value of land, then the development of vacant land and under-developed slum areas is stimulated. </para>
        <para>It follows then, that the gradual replacement of taxes on production with taxes on non-production will create new employment, reduces the costs of production, reduces the rate of interest, the cost of housing and stimulates all industries. </para>
        <para>We wish to point out that the replacement of production penalising taxes is a very practical proposal. According to official Municipal Valuations, it is estimated that unimproved site values have increased from $37,000m in 1973-74 to $67,000m by 1976-77. This represents $30,000m so called windfall profits' which was completely unrelated to productive improvements. </para>
        <para>Your petitioners most humbly pray that the Senate, in Parliament assembled, should act to relieve unemployment by a Taxation Reform to replace taxes on production with taxes which provide incentives for the increased supply of both goods and services. </para>

        <para>That in spite of numerous measures taken by various governments, unemployment in the country has not significantly declined. </para>
        <para>As a result, supplies of both goods and services have declined: human resources are wasted, capital resources are not used and natural resources are left under-developed. </para>
        <para>Both local and overseas experience shows that prosperity is encouraged when taxes, which penalise production are replaced by taxes which provide incentives for productivity. These also provide disincentives to idle speculation such as that which results in so called 'windfall profits' from land price increases. </para>
        <para>The reduction of Income-tax, Sales-tax and Payroll tax is known to reduce the costs of production and to stimulate demand. </para>
        <para>It is also known that when Land Tax or Council Rates are raised on the unimproved site value of land, then the development of vacant land and under-developed slum areas is stimulated. </para>
        <para>It follows then, that the gradual replacement of taxes on production with taxes on non-production will create new employment, reduces the costs of production, reduces the rate of interest, the cost of housing and stimulates all industries. </para>
        <para>We wish to point out that the replacement of production penalising taxes is a very practical proposal. According to official Municipal Valuations, it is estimated that unimproved site values have increased from $37,000m in 1973-74 to $67,000m by 1 976-77. This represents $30,000m so called windfall profits' which was completely unrelated to productive improvements. </para>
        <para>Your petitioners most humbly pray that the Senate, in Parliament assembled, should act to relieve unemployment by a Taxation Reform to replace taxes on production with taxes which provide incentives for the increased supply of both goods and services. </para>
        <para>And your petitioners, as in duty bound will ever pray,  by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lewis.</inline></para>
        <para>Petition received. </para>

            <para>- I have not seen the publication of the Australian Manufacturing Council. Such a prediction would be based upon a series of assumptions. The Government would not support the concept that year by year the unemployment numbers will grow. On the contrary, there are signs, which I think even the Opposition has acknowledged, of a sturdy start of recovery in the community. </para>

            <para>- I direct a question to the Minister for Social Security. I draw the Minister's attention to the name presently given by her Department to the benefit payable to the senior citizens of this nation; that is, the age pension. I submit that this name has discriminatory overtones and smacks of charity rather than the just entitlement to which a person has contributed during a lifetime of endeavour. Therefore, I ask the Minister to consider an alternative name which would remove this charitable syndrome and any suggestion of discrimination. Perhaps the Minister would consider the name 'retirement benefit' as an alternative. </para>

            <para>- I can understand <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bonner's</inline> concern if he feels the term age pension' has discriminatory overtones. I have not had this matter raised with me to any great extent. In fact, I do not recall it being raised before. If there were widespread concern about it, it is something that could be considered. It is perhaps interesting to recall that the term 'old age pension' was used to describe the present age pension from 1908 to 1947, when the various benefits were then consolidated into one Act. It was considered at that time that the name change to age pension was more in keeping with modern usage and with the reason for the benefit. Since the term 'age pension' was adopted in 1947 it seems to have been acceptable but I take the point from <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bonner,</inline> that he believes the terminology should be considered. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>The term 'retirement benefit' which the honourable senator mentioned as an alternative could have some problems inasmuch as there are retirement benefits, such as, for instance, the Defence Force retirement benefit, and there are people who retire on grounds other than age. It has been felt that the name age pension indicates that a pension has, for eligibility, a certain age. As I have said, if there seems to be any interest in reconsideration of the term, I will be responsive to that. </para>

            <para>-The honourable senator, I expect, refers to a reference given to the IAC on grapes and wine. It was sent to the IAC on 9 August 1978 for report by 31 July 1979. The honourable senator, coming from South Australia, reflects some of the concern that is felt in that State relating to the surplus of wine grapes. I understand that there were early estimates of a likely surplus of some 80,000 to 100,000 tonnes. Following more recent estimates that estimate now appears to be severely pessimistic. I am informed that in many areas yields are unlikely to be as high as predicted, due to unfavourable seasonal conditions. There have been very buoyant sales of white wines, rose and, to a lesser extent, fortified wines, creating additional demand which should more than offset any decline in the demand for grapes resulting from the loss of brandy sales. I understand that wineries in the Mumimbidgee Irrigation Area have agreed to take in all available grapes and growers have agreed to accept reduced prices. In South Australia there has been an increase in the volume of sultanas dried. Some wineries have agreed to accept doradillo grapes in lieu of sultanas, and sultanas displaced in this manner will be dried. I inform <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Jessop</inline> that current thinking in the industry is that there may be a surplus of 30,000 to 40,000 tonnes. The final surplus figure will largely depend on the extent to which the likely 40,000 tonnes surplus of red grapes can be used in white wine production. The honourable senator will understand from my earlier comment that we will not expect a report from the IAC until July. </para>

            <para>- My question is directed to the Minister representing the Minister for Employment and Youth Affairs. I refer the Minister to the continuing increase in the number of unemployed throughout Australia, and in particular to the increase in the Mount Gambier area in South Australia. Further, I refer the Minister to the commendable proposal put to the Government by the Corporation of the City of Mount Gambier, wherein it has offered to match the Federal Government in a $50,000 contribution to provide employment-creating projects in the area. I ask the Minister: Would not such a proposal have the effect of creating greatly needed employment opportunities in the Mount Gambier area? As a consequence would it not also have the effect of saving the Federal Government money which would otherwise be spent on unemployment benefit? Finally, I ask the Minister: Will the Government review its firmly held opposition to schemes such as this one, in view of the critical state of the employment market? </para>

            <para>- I am not aware of the proposal envisaged by the Corporation of the City of Mount Gambier. I will draw the attention of the Minister for Employment and Youth Affairs to the proposal if it is submitted to me. I would certainly want full details of it before I would do that. So, if the honourable senator wishes to promote that scheme, I request him to submit further details to me. However, I should like to say generally in relation to his question that these schemes for a special type of job creating- in many cases artificial job creatingwhich the honourable senator is now espousing, are ones which, of course, the Labor Government had espoused in its Regional Employment Development scheme which it decided to wind down. The policy of the present Government is to reduce inflation and thereby to stimulate economic activity in the community generally, and to create real jobs and real demands for employment. There are now signs that this policy is working. There are many indications. There are increases now in notified vacancies. In recent months there have been increases each month in total civilian employment and there is an air of confidence in the business community. I can assure the Senate that these policies that the Government has pursued have much more prospect of solving the unemployment problems of this country than the schemes that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Elstob</inline> is espousing. </para>

            <para>- My question is directed to the Minister representing the Minister for Primary Industry. I refer the Minister to the recently approved project with two Japanese firms by the Federal Government and the governments of Victoria and South Australia which involves 12 Japanese squid jigging vessels operating in waters adjacent to South Australia and Victoria to determine the feasibility of developing a squid fishing industry in the area. Is this feasibility project to last for three years? If not, for how long? Is it anticipated that there will be any squid left in the area after 12 vessels have fished in it for three years? What limitations will be placed on these vessels to ensure that they do not take fish other than squid from the area? In what way will Australian fishermen participate in the project? </para>

I ask the Minister whether he recalls a statement by former <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cotton,</inline> as spokesman for the Treasurer in this chamber on 18 August 1976, in which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cotton</inline> said that 'there is now a strong recovery in new investment in plant and equipment'? Does the Minister also recall his saying that 'economic recovery is beginning throughout the Australian scene. It is beginning as would be expected, that is, in an uneven form' and that the employment position will improve very greatly'? I ask the Minister whether we can give greater credence to his predictions of improving economic conditions in Australia than we could to those of his counterpart <inline font-style="italic">2Vi</inline> years ago? </para>

That is not a prediction. </para>

              <para>-I heard that laughter from a Queensland senator. Motor car and station wagon registrations have strengthened. The growth over the whole calendar year was 4.8 per cent. The growth rate in the second half of the year, including the period in which the sales tax cuts have applied, has been more rapid. Seasonally adjusted, average monthly registrations during this period were nearly nine per cent higher than during the corresponding period of 1977. In fact retail sales, motor car registrations and housing indicators have shown an upturn. There is no laughter now. Funding for housing by the major lenders grew strongly in the second half of 1978- by 16.7 per cent. Lending in the December quarter was 23 per cent higher than the corresponding period in 1977. Private dwelling approvals rose by 5.6 per cent in December to the highest monthly levels since January 1977. They increased by 12.6 per cent in the December quarter. </para>

          <para>Retail farm product rose by 17 per cent in the September quarter and the prospects now are for a very substantial rise in farm incomes. Income per farm in 1 978-79 is forecast by the Bureau of Agricultural Economics to increase by 80 per cent in nominal terms and 66 per cent in real terms. Real investment in plant and equipment rose at the annual rate of 2 1 .4 per cent for the six months to September 1978. New capital expenditure by private enterprise rose by over 24 per cent over the year to the September quarter. Similar rises are expected to be shown in the figures for the December quarter. Several recent company announcements have foreshadowed significant new investment projects in Victoria, New South Wales and Western Australia. Civilian employment, seasonally adjusted, has risen consistently throughout the first five months of 1978-79, reversing the declining trend. Recent surveys of business activity have reported strengthened performance. In a lesser vein, but as evidence, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Hayden</inline> says that we are showing signs of significant recovery. </para>

            <para>- My question is directed to the Minister for Science and the Environment. I refer to the Antarctic and the successful 'proving flight' of late January when a Hercules aircraft landed for the first time at the Australian base at Casey. Will the Government now press on to ensure regular flights to Australian Antarctic bases during the summer periods beginning from the next season? Also, what operational costs may be estimated for regular flights and is there advantage for Australia in exploring joint arrangements with New Zealand and the United States of America in respect of the provision of these flights? </para>

            <para>-The honourable senator can be assured that the Government intends to press on to improve the communications system in regard to such bases. The Senate would be aware that following a visit I made to the Antarctic in 1977 I negotiated with representatives of New Zealand and the United States of America the integration of our transport system with the transport system that they had arranged. It was necessary for that to be done because up until now it has not been possible to get to our continental bases other than by ship. Indeed, former <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Devitt</inline> was one of the first members of the Senate to take the opportunity to go to one of our Antarctic bases by ship, and that was to his credit. Honourable senators will be aware that on this occasion the  chairman  of the Senate Standing Committee on Science and the Environment accompanied me, thus opening the way for future flights to take place. It can be said that communication by way of Hercules CI 30 aircraft will now take place during the summer months. An example may be cited that this year in exchange for four-wheeled Hercules Royal Australian Air Force flights from Christchurch to McMurdo, which is a distance of about 3,800 kilometres, the United States, with ski equipped Hercules aircraft, took flights across the continent, which is a distance of about 2,200 kilometres, to our Casey Base. I expect that that arrangement will continue in the coming year. I have asked the Antarctic Division to make sure that we make the most economical use of the aircraft and that will be achieved by getting scientists quickly onto the field and taking appropriate action in regard to any logistical arrangements that are needed. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>The honourable senator raised the matter of costs. When this was planned originally it was estimated that the two flights would cost Australia some $55,000. My recollection is that the allocation for this year was an amount of $95,000 which the Department of Science and the Environment would make available to the Department of Defence for its part in this matter. I would expect that amount not to vary very much in the forthcoming years. </para>

            <para>- My understanding is that the Australian Wool Corporation is the licenser of the registered trade mark, that is, Woolmark, which is promoted internationally as well as in Australia, basically through the International Wool Secretariat. The honourable senator draws attention to the fact that for some time Australian wool textile manufacturers have been discussing with the Australian Wool Corporation the use of a purely Australian wool emblem which the manufacturers propose to use in a promotional campaign for Australian-made wool manufactures. My understanding is that the Corporation has made available to manufacturers, for their free and exclusive use, a wool mark previously used by the Corporation and for which it held the copyright registration. The emblem comprises a stylised ram with a map of Australia superimposed upon it. The Corporation is unable at present to assist the proposed campaign with any funds but I take into account the honourable senator's comment in relation to that. I will put to the Minister for Primary Industry that he should give this matter some attention. </para>

              <para>- If the Opposition would like me to have a guess, I certainly would be glad to do so. Knowing the honourable senator, I imagine that he speaks with some knowledge of this particular building. I imagine that the Bellevue Hotel in Brisbane, which I believe I have seen and which has some historic links with Brisbane, could well be the subject of an heritage report. I am unaware of whether the report has been prepared or whether the Queensland Government has lodged an objection, but I will obtain the information from the Minister whom I represent. I think it is the Minister for Home Affairs. </para>

            <para>- In answer to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Walters'</inline> question as to whether we have any indication when the Williams Committee of Inquiry into Education and Training will come to hand, my understanding is that the Committee completed its report within recent days or weeks. It is now shaping in manuscript form. I take this opportunity to draw the attention of honourable senators to the fact that the Committee recently put out a Press statement as a result of an article in the <inline font-style="italic">National Times.</inline> The Committee refuted the various allegations made in that newspaper. The Committee stated that it had reached a unanimous report. I think that it is to be congratulated on that. My understanding is that the report will be in manuscript form and available to the Federal Government, and no doubt the State Governments, within the weeks ahead. It ought to be in printed form by next month. I think that all educators in Australia will look forward to it. </para>

            <para>- My question is directed to the Attorney-General. The Attorney-General would be aware of the collapse of Associated Securities Limited, which perhaps appears likely to leave many tens of thousands of shareholders and investors without effective redress- certainly without their money. He would also be aware that the commonly advanced reason for the failure was the disintegration of the real property market some years ago. Can the Attorney-General indicate any steps which the Government has instituted in response to this collapse or does it simply regard the failure as an unfortunate, likely happening within our present economic system? Will the Attorney-General seek an early meeting of the Standing Committee of Attorneys-General to ensure that proposed State legislation to deal with the securities and finance industries includes provision for the requiring of disclosure of the difference between book and market values of interests in land? In the absence of State action in this matter will the Attorney-General consider introducing legislation into this Parliament, similar to that introduced by former <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Murphy</inline> in his Companies and Securities Industry Bill 1974, to ensure that shareholders and investors are given a true picture of the value of real property held by corporations? Finally, does the Attorney-General agree that, quite apart from legislative command, directors of finance companies, and indeed other companies, would do well to present realistic valuations of property by way of self-regulation of their industry? </para>

            <para>- This question really should be directed to the Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs. As I represent him in the Senate I will respond to the question in general terms. I will refer the details of the question to the Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs. I am aware of the 'collapse', as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Tate</inline> calls it, of Associated Securities Limited. I am aware of the reasons that have been advanced publicly for that failure. The position as the law stands, as I understand it, is that at the moment the question of any action that should be taken would be a matter for the appropriate State law. But, as the Senate is aware, the policy of the Government since gaining office has been to reach agreement with the States for the establishment of a national securities and corporations commission in which all the States would participate. It would be a co-operative scheme. There would be uniform laws in the companies and securities fields. Negotiations have been going on with the States for a long time and they have reached a very satisfactory stage. Legislation broadly has been agreed upon and will be coming into the Parliament in the coming months. We believe that, by implementing that scheme, the laws and controls that will then exist in Australia to deal with matters of this kind and the various detailed matters that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Tate</inline> has raised will be improved greatly. </para>

I take it that the honourable senator is suggesting that the Australian Heritage Commission should give its attention to listing the building she mentioned. It is my understanding that the Heritage Commission is a statutory authority which reports to the Minister for Home Affairs. </para>

            <para>- It is not within my power to say yes or no to the release of the report. That matter does not come within the ambit of the Minister for Science and the Environment. As far as I know, the report would go to the Minister for Transport, but I will check that point. The comments the honourable senator has made are in accordance with my understanding. It is of interest to note that in the United States today it has been put to the motor industry that it should re-think completely the design of the motor car, and I think that relates to whether niters for lead should be fitted or whether there should be other devices, which of course have been bringing about greater fuel consumption, as the honourable senator suggested, and less efficiency in the standard engine produced today. The honourable senator's questions are pertinent and I will put them to the Minister. </para>

He might recall that I asked him a question on 24 November last concerning certain alleged illegal ticketing and dispatch practices which might have involved Qantas Airways and on which the Minister promised to let me have a reply. Is the Minister able now to say that it is correct that on or about 24 November last year an International Air Transport Association inspector discovered a number of passengers travelling to Damascus on tickets showing another destination and that the baggage of those passengers had been tagged 'Damascus', presumably by Qantas counter staff? Is it also a fact that connecting flights on a Saudi Arabian airline shown on the tickets either did not exist or did not operate on the day indicated? Is the Minister able to advise whether any of the tagging of baggage for final destinations other than those shown on the tickets was carried out by Qantas staff? Is he able to say whether there is any evidence of any breaches of the Air Navigation Regulations? If so, what corrective action, if any, has been taken by the Department? What further action is intended? Finally, can the Minister clearly indicate what role, if any, Qantas Airways Ltd or its staff have had in this incident? </para>

          <para class="block">I am informed that on 24 November last year an International Air Transport Association inspector did find that a number of passengers were ticketed to Damascus with connections to a point beyond Damascus. The Senate is probably aware that Qantas Airways Ltd is the only airline that provides scheduled services from Australia over Damascus. It is therefore possible that Qantas staff in Australia could have been involved in the tagging of baggage for these passengers at the start of their journeys. This in itself does not necessarily indicate that anything improper was done or that passengers were not intending to travel beyond Damascus. It was subsequently found that the connecting flight beyond Damascus was not operating as ticketed. I am advised by the Department of Transport that it is awaiting further information on this aspect. At this stage it is not possible to know where the fault lies. The Department is investigating the whole circumstances of the matter with a view to determining what would be an appropriate course of action. Pending the outcome of this investigation, I am not in a position to give any further details. </para>

            <para>- The statistical returns from the schools showing the actual enrolments for 1979 are not due to be received in the office of the Australian Capital Territory Schools Authority until today, I think. So a precise answer cannot be given yet. But from the preliminary evidence available to the Authority the indications are that, with the removal of the automatic allowance for beginning teachers from the staffing of high schools and the adjustments to the level of staffing in secondary colleges, the ceiling of 2,772 will be adequate to staff Australian Capital Territory government schools in 1979. That is the view that was expressed by the Government and by me last year. As soon as more specific information is available I will provide it to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Knight.</inline></para>

            <para>- I direct to the Minister representing the Minister for Transport a question relating to what are believed by many Western Australians to be two areas of discrimination against Western Australians in regard to air fares. The internal air fares which are set advantage short flights and disadvantage long flights by an unrealistically low flagfall and a correspondingly high cost per kilometre charge. In regard to international flights, the Perth to Sydney portion of an international flight costs about four times the charge for the Sydney to Perth section of an international flight. Will the Government endeavour to correct those anomalies or do what the United States Government has done recently in removing government involvement from the industry altogether except in matters of safety? </para>

            <para>- One of the two matters raised by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Thomas</inline> was raised in the Senate in a question asked yesterday by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bishop.</inline> I said at that time that the question reflected interest in a number of States including Western Australia and South Australia. The first part of the question asked by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Thomas</inline> relates to the question of local air fares. At the moment domestic air fares between Perth and the eastern States are calculated according to the same formula as all major domestic network fares. That formula consists of a flagfall plus a cents per kilometre component. So there is direct relationship between the distance that is travelled and the amount of fare. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>The domestic review of air transport policy last year recommended the introduction into the formula of two components for distance to reflect the lower costs associated with long distance services. The review recognised that these changes would have to be phased in over time and it is this change, I think, that is being sought by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Thomas</inline> on behalf of Western Australians. These matters are currently being discussed with the domestic airlines and it is hoped that there will be some progress. I should add that it is only comparatively recently that there has been a number of changes relating to domestic travel between Perth and the eastern States and there is now the full range of concession fares such as group travel, ofT peak, APEX- the advance purchase excursion- and stand-by. But we have yet to achieve the further change that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Thomas</inline> is seeking. </para>
          <para>As far as international air fares from Perth are concerned, it would be known to all honourable senators that the new air fares are negotiated on a point-to-point basis so that for international flights leaving Perth the fares have been reduced and there are special fares available on flights from, say, Perth to London. As far as international routes are concerned, the problem arises where the point-to-point flights end in, say, Sydney or Melbourne, as of course is likely to be the case in respect of the great bulk of routes because of the concentration of population in the southeast corner of Australia. The Government, as I made clear, understands the problem and is in fact actively consulting both Qantas Airways Ltd and the domestic airlines to ascertain whether it is possible to introduce cheap domestic add-on fares for people travelling internationally. The Government is, in fact, committed to the principle of cheap add-ons and is pushing these discussions as a matter of urgency. </para>

            <para>-Does the Minister representing the Prime Minister recall that in the 1975 election campaign the Prime Minister, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Fraser,</inline> promised to provide jobs for all? Does the Minister also recall that in the 1977 election campaign the Prime Minister forecast that unemployment would fall from February 1978 and then keep falling? In view of the fact that the number of registered unemployed has increased by 230,000 since the Fraser Government has been in office and that the number is now 6 1 ,000 above what it was in February last year, does the Minister agree that in 1975 and in 1977 the Prime Minister misled the people of Australia? </para>

              <para>- It is worth knowing that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Button</inline> is laughing at this situation. The fact of the matter is that these statements are factual. We had a good track record. It was destroyed by the injection of an unfortunate government, the Whitlam Government. But it would be well to know that yesterday the <inline font-style="italic">Australian Financial Review</inline> in a major article analysing the figures for unemployment, pointed out that the absolute level of unemployment, both before and after allowing for school leavers, had ceased to rise. That is important. The article went on to conclude that the economy may be entering the recovery phase after the cycle I have mentioned. We are now settling into a recovery phase, the obverse of the cycle of the Labor Party. I thank the Opposition for the opportunity to remind the Australian people of the facts. </para>

            <para>- When <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Justice</inline> Staples was overseas he did send back from Canada- I think it was only from Canada but I am not sure- some reports on what he had found there. After he returned to Australia and just before the meeting of the Standing Committee of Attorneys-General in Hobart in January, he wrote me a letter in which he set out a number of his views on the way in which Australia should deal with matters of human rights and in which he indicated that he thought that we ought to be looking at the European method of attacking the problem rather than at the international covenant. He made many other suggestions. He wrote to me in those terms because he was aware of the fact that discussions were to take place in Hobart shortly after that time. However, I did not regard that letter and the material he sent to me then, or the material he had sent from Canada, as amounting to a report in the sense that the Government expected to receive a report about the work that he had been doing and that he had been engaged upon over the 12 months or more that he had been overseas. He has had consultation with officers of my Department and I have written to him asking for such a report. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>I do not propose to table anything that I have received from <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Justice</inline> Staples until I receive a full report in the sense in which I expect to have it. I am hopeful that I will obtain such a report. Presumably that report would contain all the material, ideas, views and so on which he has expressed already but it would be in a form which I would regard as proper for tabling. However, I do not want to give the impression that there is anything secret about the material which I have received from <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Justice</inline> Staples. As I said, I just do not regard it as being in a form which is a final and full report. At this stage I have not had any response from <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Justice</inline> Staples as to when I might- or if I might- expect to receive a report as I have requested. So at this stage I am waiting to see what happens. If in due course no further material is provided- I do not expect that will be the case- it may be appropriate to table the material I have received. I shall certainly have no objection to doing so. </para>

            <para>- I direct my question to the Minister representing the Minister for Primary Industry. My question arises from a report in the business section of today's Melbourne <inline font-style="italic">Age,</inline> headed 'Banks soak up money spill' and Reserve neutralises that wheat boom'. I now ask the Minister: Can he confirm that the Reserve Bank of Australia will coerce the trading banks into funding some $250m of the first advance payment on the 1978-79 wheat harvest? Will the Australian Wheat Board be paying about 1 1 per cent interest on money borrowed from the trading banks, as against an interest rate of 9 per cent to 956 per cent if the money were borrowed in the traditional manner from the Reserve Bank's rural credit department? If the Minister cannot provide an immediate answer will he undertake to endeavour to provide an answer before the suspension of the sitting of the Senate for dinner this day? </para>

            <para>- I direct my question to the Minister representing the Minister for Transport. I refer to my question of 29 May 1978, relating to the apparent erosion of air safety standards in Australia. In reply to that question <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Carrick,</inline> on behalf of the Minister for Transport, stated:  . . Government policies on capital and current expenditure will not be permitted to erode air safety standards. </para>

          <para class="block">I ask the Minister, firstly, is he concerned by recent reports of a number of near air collisions, and what investigations has he made as to the allegations of deterioration in Australia 's air safety record? I ask, secondly, whether the lack of adequate government funding has led to an insufficient number of air traffic controllers being employed in Australia and to an inadequate level of air safety equipment being provided at a number of airports. What action does the Minister plan to take in an effort to rectify this serious situation? </para>

            <para>-The Minister for Transport has provided me with some information on the matters raised by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Missen</inline> in his question. I am aware, of course, that there have been reports of so-called near air collisions and allegations of deterioration in Australia's air safety record. I am advised by the Minister for Transport that all reports of incidents are fully and carefully investigated by the Air Safety Investigation Branch of his Department and that, if it is found necessary, appropriate action is taken by the Department of Transport. Some of the more recent reported incidents are still under investigation. The Department is continually monitoring Australia 's air safety position. There has been publicity recently on our radar facilities. I am advised that the present radar system is not out of date in any way. The equipment is continually updated and replaced as it nears the end of its service life, and it compares favourably with systems in use overseas. The present system provides operational capabilities commensurate with Australia's traffic densities, and the Department has an ongoing plan to provide additional capabilities to cope with traffic growth and complexity. For example, systems will be provided at Sydney, Adelaide and Perth airports in 1980 to display aircraft altitude and identity, and these will be followed shortly after by upgraded systems at Melbourne, Brisbane and Canberra. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>Unions involved in the aviation industry have recently stated that immediate attention should be given to the installation of the T-VASIS visual approach guidance system at Melbourne runway 27, Sydney runway 07, Albury, Gladstone, Hamilton and Grafton. The Department is well aware of the value of the T-VASIS system. It was designed in Australia and adopted internationally. There is an ongoing program in which 85 of these systems are already in operation, and a further 46 are presently planned. Early installation already had been planned at each of the airports mentioned by the unions. </para>
          <para>Considerable publicity has also been given to the introduction in November 1978 of revised traffic information procedures in uncontrolled air space. When announcing the new procedures, the Department stated that experience might show modifications to be desirable. Minor variations were made as recently as 14 February, following a meeting between the Department and the Australian Federation of Air Pilots and agreement by other sections of the industry. The traffic information service provided in uncontrolled air space in Australia is of a quality and comprehensiveness not attempted in any other country with busy air space. </para>
          <para>I make these points to emphasise that the Department of Transport and the Minister are concerned to ensure that Australia's high standard of air safety is maintained at the highest level and to illustrate that continuing discussions with the aviation industry are taking place on these matters. </para>

            <para>-Senator Messner refers to the country disadvantaged areas program. The program has been continued and in 1979 a sum of $4.6m has been allocated to the program. Under the program, 16 areas have been selected throughout Australia on the basis of their relative poverty, their special need for improved educational provisions and outcomes, and their lack of opportunities for employment and further training of young people. All schools in the declared areas, government and non-government, share the services and facilities provided through this program. Broadly-based State and area committees support and stimulate rural communities in their search for new and improved ways of providing education for their children. The program seeks to encourage them to identify and use what they already have in their communities and to use the special funding to supplement or mobilise these resources. There were 389 schools and 56,626 students participating in the program in 1978. </para>

Will the Minister consider making a statement to the Parliament at the earliest possible opportunity on the situation which has arisen from the events in Iran, both insofar as the energy resources of the world are affected by the events in that country and also the political significance of the resurgence of Islamic militancy in Iran, as in other parts of the Islamic world? </para>

              <para>I think it is now generally agreed that this incident at the Coonjimba Billabong was considerably exaggerated in the early Press reports. In fact, a flight over the area by staff of the Supervising Scientist on 31 January 1979 indicated that Coonjimba Billabong was clear, and that the silt load was indistinguishable, visually, from much of the Magela system; parts of the system remote from any works were more heavily coloured than Coonjimba. Indeed, turbidity in the Magela may vary naturally by a factor of 10 during flood peaks. In effect, the silting at Coonjimba was transient, and no damage of a permanent nature occurred. </para>

            <para>- An important element of the question asked earlier by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Missen</inline> was whether there was a lack of adequate government funding, leading to there being an insufficient number of air traffic controllers. I wish to add briefly to the answer I gave a few minutes ago. It is true that there is currently a relatively small shortage of controllers. However, steps were taken last year to rectify the position by accelerating the recruitment and training program. The situation should be fully rectified by August of this year. I am advised that the controller situation cannot be attributed to an inadequacy in government funding and that the level of funding has been appropriate to the established needs for air safety equipment. </para>

          <para class="block">This matter is of political, social and economic importance and it has, of course, considerable emotional overtones in the community. It involves the welfare of the most vulnerable of our citizens and, probably equally importantly, it also involves their ability to have any faith in this Parliament and in promises made both by parties and individuals in this Parliament. </para>
          <para>The Opposition has taken this very early opportunity to raise the question of the restoration of twice yearly indexation of pensions and benefits under our social security and repatriation systems because of the confusion that has arisen and the expectations that have occurred in the pensioner community as a result of widespread media publicity in the last two months following actions of certain Government supporters. There has also been an awareness in the community at large that a gross injustice has been done to those people in the community who depend on fixed incomes from the Government. I am aware that because of this publicity and because of the claims and counter-claims and the  interpretative sort of articles that have appeared in the Press, many people in the community are confused as to what the Government will do and what this Parliament will do. I believe and the Opposition believes it is important that this matter should be cleared up. </para>
          <para>The Opposition believes that the revocation of the twice yearly indexation of pensions and benefits in the Social Services Amendment Bill in October last year was a breach of a firm undertaking given by both Government parties. We believe it was unjust. We believe that the injustice is widely recognised as such in the community. Only a few feeble attempts were made to justify the action taken by the Government in the Budget. These attempts at justification have in fact been shown to be false in the few short months since they were made. The Government should reverse its decision, and it can do so without causing inflationary damage to the economy. It can do so without putting an excessive burden on the taxpayers of this community. The time has come for the Government to do the right thing- to change this Budget decision or, alternatively, to call on those of its supporters who are doing so to cease their pretence to the pensioners and beneficiaries in this community that they are capable of reversing the Government's decision by actions in this place. </para>
          <para>The Opposition has been consistent on this issue at all times. We opposed the change from twice yearly indexation to yearly indexation. We were in fact supported by one Government senator, by the Australian Democrats senators and by the independent senator. We were also supported at the time, in words at least, by other Government senators and by Government members in another place who expressed dismay at the move that the Government was taking but who felt that they could not support the retention of twice yearly indexation and hence abstained from voting. By doing so they effectively supported the proposal to remove twice yearly indexation. </para>
          <para>Since then pensioners and members of organisations representing the various beneficiaries in the community have pressured Government and Opposition members to correct the injustice. As we know, one Government supporter has announced that he will introduce a private member's Bill to restore the previous position. On Friday last at a large public meeting in Sydney he showed the Bill, or what he claimed was the Bill. He promised that he would introduce the Bill into this Parliament yesterday. He did not do so. Until a short time ago he had not done so today. Members of the executive of pensioner organisations have come to Canberra today as they did yesterday to support this gentleman and still he has not made any attempt to move his private member's Bill. This does not surprise anyone on this side of the House. He has been known to behave before in this sort of way. He promised to cross the floor to prevent the abolition of the funeral benefit and he did not. He promised to cross the floor to support an Opposition proposal to increase the subsidy for apple and pear growers in Tasmania and he did not. </para>

              <para>-I do not believe that I need to name him. He promised to stay away from the Parliament until the <inline font-style="italic">Australian Trader</inline> was restored to the Tasmanian run. It was not restored and he has been here ever since.  His  proposals, his propositions, are part of a stunt to provide publicity for himself and they should be recognised as such. If he is willing to present the private member's Bill, although I question this as a method of achieving the aim, the Opposition will support him. But he has not done so. We have grave doubts that he will do so but we are certain that he will continue to squeeze every bit of publicity out of this matter while he can. This is unfair to the pensioners of this country and to the beneficiaries of this country. It is obvious that the Minister for Social Security <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Guilfoyle),</inline> the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Malcolm Fraser)</inline> and, particularly, the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Howard)</inline> are not in favour of the reintroduction of twice yearly indexation and it is quite clear that sufficient Government supporters are not willing to support such a private member's Bill to enable it to be passed in both Houses. It is unfair and cruel to raise the hopes of the pensioners and the beneficiaries in this country. We do not deny the honourable member's right to introduce a private member's Bill and we do not deny his right to question the Government's decision. We will support him on this but we believe that it should be more than just the publicity stunt it seems to be. </para>

          </continue>
          <para>The Opposition believes that the twice yearly indexation of pensions and benefits is a reasonable and just concept for protecting pensioners and beneficiaries in this country from the effects of inflation. From 1972 to 1975 it was necessary to increase pensions at twice yearly intervals by much more than the increase in the consumer price index to raise them to the 25 per cent of average weekly earnings that we considered at that time to be a reasonable minimum figure for single pensions. In fact in that time pensions rose by 80.4 per cent while the CPI increased by 50 per cent and average weekly earnings increased by 64 per cent. As a result of the introduction of twice yearly indexation in the time the present Government has been in office, pensions have increased at about the same rate as the consumer price index and at a slightly greater rate than average weekly earnings. This will not continue if yearly indexation is persisted with and because of that procedure pensioners will lose each year a varying sum depending on the rate of inflation. </para>
          <para>Prior to the 1975 election campaign the then shadow Minister for Social Security, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Chipp,</inline> now <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Chipp,</inline> promised, as he said with the full authority of both coalition parties, that pensions would be immediately and automatically indexed to the consumer price index. After considerable prompting by both the Opposition and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Chipp,</inline> then a back bencher in the Government, this proposal was partly legislated for at the end of 1976 by the introduction of twice yearly indexation. It was supported by the Opposition. It was pointed out that it was not quite what had been promised but that it was a reasonable proposal and a reasonable method of keeping pensioners up to date with inflation. This change was lauded to the heavens by the Minister for Social Security, by the Prime Minister, by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Baume</inline> and other luminaries in this House as the greatest change in social security provisions since Federation. Day after day we had long speeches of praise for the introduction of this change. </para>
          <para>Before the 1977 election the Minister for Social Security, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guilfoyle,</inline> promised that this policy would continue, as did the Prime Minister and, taking their cue from the Minister for Social Security and from the Prime Minister, as did every government member and supporter who campaigned in that election, lt was a firm promise given to every pensioner and every beneficiary in this community. When suggestions were made by some Labor members- I was one of them- to the effect that if the Government continued with its plan of economic stringency it inevitably would have to do away with twice yearly indexation, we were accused of indulging in fear tactics. We were said to be telling lies. One remembers how vigorously the present honourable member for Denison <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Hodgman)</inline> refuted any suggestion of mine to this effect in the last election campaign. </para>
          <para>The Liberal Party policy issued in 1975 stated that the Government would move towards the protection of benefits and pensions from erosion by inflation through automatically adjusting benefit levels every six months according to movements in the consumer price index. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Chipp</inline> said that the coalition had made the promise before December 1975; that he had promised on television that under a Liberal government pensions would be adjusted twice a year and would be geared to cost of living movements, and that he had made this promise with the full authority of his Party. He said that pensioners were not going to be made a political football but it seems that again pensioners are to be made a political football. In a television advertisement on 5 December 1977, just before the election, the Minister for Social Security said: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>We have altered the legislation so that there is an automatic increase every six months and we accept that this is an increase in the social welfare bill. </para>

          <quote>

          </quote>
          <para class="block">It was not the Opposition which was lying at that time by suggesting that this policy may not be maintained; it was not the Opposition which was knowingly deceiving the pensioners and electors of this community; it was the Prime Minister, the Minister for Social Security and their colleagues in the Government parties. When in the last Budget the Government decided to break its promise, when the Government decided to destroy completely the faith of the pensioners in any promises that were made, when the Government decided to force the pensioners and those receiving benefits in this country to carry the burden of the economic policies of the Government quite out of proportion to their ability to do so, two reasons were given by the Government. The first reason was the reason most frequently given by the Prime Minister- that inflation was under control, that twice yearly indexation was unnecessary and that the rate of inflation would continue to come down. The second reason given was that it was an economic necessity for the welfare of the nation. Other members of the Government attempted to dredge up further reasons. One of the most novel was introduced into this chamber by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Walters.</inline> She explained to us that, because the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Commission had changed from quarterly indexation adjustments for wages to six-monthly indexation adjustments it naturally followed that the Government should change from six-monthly to yearly adjustments for pensions. When questioned she did not go on with that argument for too much longer, realising that she was going to get herself into difficulties with some of the pensioners who were her constituents. </para>
          <para>The latest figures for increases in the consumer price index have effectively torpedoed the first argument that inflation is again under control. It is obvious that inflation will not reach the low figure claimed for it by the Government. It is obvious from world economic trends that we are likely to get an increase in the inflation rate. We are certainly not going to get a decrease in the inflation rate this year. But the argument was not valid in the first place. Pensioners should be compensated for inflation at whatever its level and they should be compensated twice yearly. This has become a bipartisan policy in this Parliament and it had been accepted generally in the community. </para>
          <para>The economic necessity argument does not hold water. The estimated savings this financial year from the changes is $27m and in a full year it is $60m. That is a pittance compared with the economic expenditure in other areas by this Government, such as the proposal to spend $300m on the new Parliament House, $40m on VIP jets and hundreds of millions of dollars on investment allowances to enable firms to take on machinery and shed labour. It is a feeble argument. It was not valid then and it is certainly not valid now. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Walters'</inline> argument that, under some principle that is not understood on this side of the Senate, the Government should somehow index pensions at twice the duration that the Arbitration Commission increases wages is beyond comprehension by anyone on this side of the chamber and I believe anyone on the Government side. These arguments were not accepted at the time of the last Budget. They were not accepted by the Opposition. They were not accepted by the Australian Democrats senators. They were not accepted by the independent senator. They were not accepted by the media. They were not accepted by any expert or commentator on the subject. They were not accepted by the Australian Council of Social Service. They were not accepted by any welfare organisation at all. By their own words the arguments were obviously not accepted by many supporters of the Government. The move was condemned roundly by the councils of social service and it was condemned in both the House of Representatives and the Senate by some Government members. </para>
          <para class="block">Despite protests at the time, despite representations since and despite threats about the introduction of a private member's Bill, the Government does not recognise the injustice of its actions. It is up to this Parliament to attempt to correct the situation. </para>
          <para>The Government's misguided restrictions in some areas of government assistance has meant a long and heavy burden on many people in the community. Supplementary assistance for rent, payments for pensioners' children and payments to injured Commonwealth employees have not been increased for more than three years. Family allowances have not been increased since their introduction in the present form. Their value has depreciated. Families with children have been affected, as has been suggested many times in this Parliament. Services to disadvantaged people in the community have been affected through cuts in assistance to various welfare agencies and groups which assist these people. We are dealing today merely with the income support payments, merely with the payments which in most cases these people rely on completely for their existence. It affects a large number of recipients and it affects them in a particularly harmful way. We have a situation where we firmly believe that the Government's policy was wrong and remains so. We have a situation where most observers in the community believe that the Government's policy was wrong and is still wrong. We have a situation where its own supporters believe that the Government was wrong and is still wrong. We believe this situation should be reversed, which is the first reason that we bring up this motion. </para>
          <para>Secondly, we believe that if the Government does not reverse the situation, if the Government persists with its attitude, and through the weight of numbers in this place we cannot change the situation, then those Government members who maintain the pretence that they can alter this situation should demonstrate to the pensioners of this country that they are not raising their hopes quite falsely by introducing a Bill and putting it to the test of this Parliament. </para>

We will seek to amend it to improve it if that is necessary. This is an important matter. It is too important to be kicked around in the media of this country. It is too important to be used for personal publicity by individual politicians. It is too important to be raised in the manner in which it has been raised in the last two months. It is too important to deceive the people who are being deceived. The Government must make its position clear. The members of the Government who claim that they have the influence to change the Government's view or the Parliament's view should either take the action that they claim will succeed or stop behaving in the manner in which they are behaving. Then and only then will the pensioners know where they are, will the Parliament know where it is and will some justice be done and be seen to be done for these people in the community. </para>

              <inline font-weight="bold">- Senator Grimes,</inline>in moving this urgency motion, said that it was a matter of political, social and economic importance. If one were listening carefully to him I think one could detect that to him his address was more of political importance, notably the importance that he placed on it in regard to the State of Tasmania. I do not argue with that. He is a senator from that State and undoubtedly he wishes to respond to moves that have been made by private members as regards the introduction of private members Bills and things of that sort. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>In response to the motion moved by him I want to say that I regard it as a matter of social importance and economic importance to discuss the matter of the income security system in this country. I do not think anyone would argue that we would not want to see those who are dependent on the income security system receive as great a level of benefit or pension as can be found from the economic resources of this country. In saying that I am not in any way suggesting that we are not dealing with individual problems. I acknowledge that the office bearers of the Pensioners Federation are in the Senate today. They came here yesterday and put their views on behalf of the Federation's members and pensioners generally. They told me about their concern about many individual problems. They did say to me that the people who are without the ownership of a home and who have to pay high rental are in very serious economic circumstances. I think we would all agree that there are differences in the way in which people are able to deal with their retirement stage. </para>
          <para>We cannot look at the economics of the situation without giving recognition to the enormous growth of expenditure on health and welfare. I do not wish to be tedious in the use of figures but it has to be put on record so that there may be some informed debate on it just what has occurred in, say, the last 10 years with regard to income security and welfare expenditure. In the </para>
          <para>Budget for the year 1967-68 the health and welfare allocation was $1.4 billion. It is now $ 10,000m. That is a sevenfold increase in a period of 10 years. I refer to those figures because they have to be recognised as a burden on the economic resources of Australia. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Grimes</inline> spoke of the burden on individual pensioners, and I also give recognition to that. Equally, I give recognition to the growth in the health and welfare expenditure of this country. I have a number of statistics, and perhaps I could refer to some of them. It may also be appropriate to incorporate one particular table which I think is important. </para>
          <para>Dealing with the forthcoming year, our expenditure is expected to rise again through the sheer increase in numbers of pensioners in every category. We have reached the stage where, if our welfare bill is close to $ 1 1 billion, it will represent about $800 for every man, woman and child in Australia. That is the magnitude of the expenditure we are talking about. Another figure which I think indicates relativity is that about 85 per cent of all personal income tax collected in this country is spent on health and welfare. Those are fairly significant figures and we cannot ignore them. In last year's Budget our welfare expenditure rose by about 7 per cent, but unless we give recognition to the numbers of people who are now social security beneficiaries I do not think we gain any understanding of what has occurred in the responsibilities we must accept. If I could refer again to some figures, and I will try to simplify them, about 10 years ago 1,000 people in the work force were supporting 176 people on income security programs. Looking at the figures for the current year, 1,000 workers are supporting not 176 people but 276 people. </para>

              <para>- But we cannot ignore the growth in numbers when talking about the growth we would like to see in the rate people receive. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Grimes</inline> referred to promises that had been made, and I do not argue that promises were not made because legislation was introduced to provide for two increases in each year. The legislation itself shows the promise, the commitment, that was made. It was a commitment that was unable to be sustained because of the increase in numbers and costs in general of the income security system. So again, if anyone wishes to be quite clear about the Government's commitment, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Grimes</inline> suggested, it is in accordance with the legislation that in November of each year there will be an increase to take account of the consumer price index. </para>

The Australian Labor Party has now dropped the abolition of the means test from its platform, and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Grimes</inline> said recently that he was responsible for having it removed. </para>

              <para>- I am taking into account the average weekly earnings for the December 1978 quarter, which I am told were $221.10. The standard rate pension proportion of that amount is 24. 1 per cent and the combined married rate pension is 40.1 per cent. However, 24.1 per cent is the highest rate we have achieved, and I do not think that we can look at the present situation without acknowledging that in October 1972 pensions at the standard rate were 19.9 per cent of average weekly earnings. They moved steadily in 1 973 to 2 1 .4 per cent and then back to 19.9 per cent, with further moves to 20.4 per cent, 22. 1 per cent, and so on. It might be appropriate to have this schedule included in the Senate record because I think it shows the achievements of both governments. It indicates achievements, movements, and a commitment to an increase in pensions to the point where they are now at the highest rate that has ever been paid in relation to average weekly earnings.

              <para>- It was some time before <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Grimes</inline> gave recognition to inflation. It is quite misleading to consider the indexation question in relation to pension income separately from inflation levels, as many people attempt to do. It is not realistic to talk about indexation without relating it to inflation. I think everyone would recognise that the greatest difficulty is caused to people on the lowest incomes- our two million people who are receiving income security payments- through a high rate of inflation. They are the people who are hurt the most, and unless a government has the resolve to reduce inflation to a point where pensioners are able, with in some cases their slender other income, to have greater purchasing power, we are not talking constructively about the purchasing power of the pension simply by relating it to twice yearly indexation. Figures could show that the loss that would arise through a 12 per cent inflation rate with two indexation increases a year would be the same as the loss through a 6 per cent inflation rate and one increase a year. </para>
            </talk.start>
          </continue>
          <para>Our objective relates not only to pension income recipients, although we regard them as a special category. Our aim is to achieve low inflation for everyone in this country. To suggest that we can isolate one sector of the community in our economic policies is to overlook the fact that our economic policies affect those people perhaps more seriously than they affect anyone else. The inflation rates sustained throughout the 1970s, since the period of the Labor Government, have necessitated frequent increases so that people did not suffer from the rapidly increasing inflation. From our point of view, the person who has a small additional income from investment, security or some sort of superannuation from his former employment is the person who wishes to see a low rate of inflation so that that part of his total income has a greater purchasing power. In the three years of the Labor Government the consumer price index rose by about 50 per cent. In other words, the fixed income, the other income, that a pensioner had was halved in real terms. That is the thing we need to avoid when looking at the real benefit we are able to give to pensioners in the future. We have to ensure that there is greater economic stability, lower inflation, and a commitment in the legislation to annual increases. </para>
          <para>It has been said that pensioners are confused and that there is no faith in the Parliament because of what has occurred. I must refer to the introduction of a private member's Bill, which has been canvassed publicly, because I think it is confusing to people to be told that a private member's Bill is a way of changing government policy, particularly government policy that requires expenditure. Every member of parliament knows that the management of the economy is the responsibility of the Executive, that the management of expenditure is the responsibility of the Executive. This is a very fundamental principle that it is governments which introduce Bills which require the expenditure of public money. I think everyone is aware of the procedure of the message from the Governor-General and the support of the Parliament for the legislation. I wish to make it perfectly clear that a private member's Bill, even if it were passed by both houses of Parliament, would in the case of a money Bill still require government initiative to provide the funds. To suggest otherwise I think is confusing. </para>
          <para>It ought to be firmly stated that it is the Government which would introduce any changes to legislation. I think the Senate is particularly aware of money Bills and the way in which the whole system works. I believe that no one in the Senate would be deluded into believing that someone talking of the introduction of a private member's Bill would be able to achieve any change in Government policy or direction. That needs to be said and I think it needs to be said quite strongly. </para>

              <para>- If people are to accept the way in which the parliamentary system works, the way in which the system of government by which we live works, they have to accept that it is the Cabinet, the Executive, which introduces the Bills. We know of the message which must come, we know of the support of Parliament which is required. I just want to make that perfectly clear in case it is not clear. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Grimes</inline> said that we do not wish to see the pensioner population made a political football. I agree with that statement in every way. I agree with it to the extent that legislation which provides for an annual increase is the legislation which needs to be explained. It needs to be shown that the Government did change the legislation; that there was an amendment to the legislation which removed the May increase. I would do whatever I could to make perfectly clear that that is the way in which increases would be provided. They will be increases that will be provided at each November payment.

              <para>- The Prime Minister has made that commitment. The Government has changed its legislation. The legislation which is in existence is to provide for that November increase. If we are really serious about talking of what has been promised and what has not been promised I should say that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Grimes</inline> made some note of the fact that supplementary assistance has not been increased and that the family allowance has not been indexed. I acknowledge that the child's allowance has not been increased but I refer to the alternative Budget which <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Hayden</inline> brought in last year in response to our Budget. He made no arrangements, no commitments. There was no allowance in his figures for the raising of pensions in any way other than the twice yearly indexes. He made a commitment to increase unemployment benefits for persons without dependents and he made a commitment for twice yearly indexes. He made no commitment with regard to additional pensions with regard to children, he made no estimate to show that he would give a greater allowable free area of income to pensioners. Do not let us make comments without showing what our own responsibility would be if we were in the position of having an opportunity to do some of these things. </para>

              <para>- If one of the Opposition members would read what was said by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Hayden</inline> when presenting his alternative Budget- after all, we would have to accept that Budget as being party policy- we would see that other than the commitment for twice yearly increases and the indexation of unemployment benefits and, at that time the restoration of the family allowance which was later changed by the present Government, he made no commitments for further expenditure. I believe that he understood the magnitude of the welfare bill, he understood the impossibility of making rash promises greatly to increase the rates and other benefits that are paid. I think the figures that I mentioned should also receive some consideration. I mentioned the sorts of figures that indicated the number of people who are being supported by a thousand people in the working population. But I doubt whether anyone in Australia realises that we pay pensions to over 2 million people- according to the figures that I have for December 1978, 2,146,000 and some others- and that we have 1.3m age pensioners. In 10 years that figure has doubled. It has doubled from 600,000-odd to 1,300,000. That is the sort of problem into which we are reaching and it is the sort of problem which I think has to be stated at a time when we are talking about what is able to be done and how we can help the people of Australia with their personal tax. </para>
            </talk.start>
          </continue>
          <para>We do not have contributory schemes with separate entitlements to any of these benefits. It is from our taxing of the working population that we are able to provide this income security system. As a proportion of the residentially qualified population of age pension age, the age pensioners represent almost 80 per cent. In other words, of those who reach age pension age, about 80 per cent are receiving an age pension. If we are to look at these figures with a further refinement we find that a very high proportion of them receive a total pension. In other words, they have limited other income; they have arranged their affairs for their retirement years to be almost totally or very significantly dependent on the pension income. The proportion of the national Budget that is spent on income security, on welfare and on social security, is 27.8 per cent. In broad terms that is the commitment that we have as a priority to this area of government responsibility. </para>
          <para>There are those who tell us that another dollar a week or something of that sort would help very greatly to ease hardship. I am sure that in many individual cases this would be so. But if we are to have a system of standard rates of pensions and if we are to recognise the number of people who receive them we should know that in a full year a dollar a week increase would mean about $1 16m extra to find. It was stated in many of the petitions that were presented in the Senate today that one of our objectives should be to increase all pensions and benefits to 30 per cent of the estimated seasonly adjusted average weekly earnings. I am sure that there are those who present petitions or sign petitions with high hopes but I would have to say that to increase all pensions and benefits to that level of 30 per cent instead of the 24.1 per cent that I mentioned would cost an additional $ 1,490m. They are figures of magnitude; they represent enormous commitments. This year the cost of restoring six-monthly pension and benefit increases would be about S80m for the full year. It was in some way to restrain the growth that we needed to look at the over 70s with a means-test-free pension. We needed to look at the way in which we were indexing or increasing pensions to have some reality and some recognition of the burden on those who have to pay the funds to provide for these increases. As well as having a policy on the indexation of pensions we also had a policy on the indexation of personal taxes so that they would not automatically rise with inflation. We went to great lengths to achieve that but we were unable fully to sustain that in this year. I suppose that in looking at social security we probably had to take a decision on whether to uphold our commitment to full tax indexation or whether to find $500m from the family allowance scheme. The Government, in its wisdom and, I think, with the great support of the Australian people, decided to maintain the family allowance scheme. But in rough terms we needed another $500m from personal taxes, so that burden was spread right across the tax paying population. </para>
          <para>Although I would agree with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Grimes</inline> when he says that pensioners, the people who are aged, invalid and sick, are the most vulnerable, I also need to recognise the needs of families- the single income family with several small children, the family with commitments to purchasing a house to give security to the family and the family with a woman who is unable to work and who has commitments at home to her own children and a desire to be at home with them. I feel that these people with a disposable income also are sometimes very vulnerable. There is within the responsibility of government a need to look at responsibility for all. I think that we have shown that we give very high priority to the income security system. We have shown, with the greatest of intent, that we will maintain the income security system. We have shown through our legislation that, having reached the highest figure that pensions have ever reached in comparison with average weekly earnings, we can look to the future for those increases to be made on an annual basis. </para>
          <para>That is my response to the matter of urgency raised by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Grimes</inline> in regard to the restoration by the Government of twice yearly indexation for all pensions. I hope that I have been able to explain the Government's policy, the effect of the legislation and the inoperable effect of any private member's Bill which may be gaining support through petitions or in another way. The whole system, the whole structure of our </para>
          <para class="block">Parliament and of our government system, is not able to operate other than through the Crown, through requests to Cabinet for the money. To suggest that there is any other means of appropriating money is simply to make the system difficult for people to understand and I think that would provide an opportunity for people to become confused. </para>
          <para>We are strongly aware of the needs of ageing people. I was interested in the question asked by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bonner</inline> today. He felt that to describe a person as an 'age pensioner' was discriminatory. I think that is something on which we could have discussion. If we are looking at what is required by aging and frail people we will know that the need for hostel and nursing home beds and projects is important. I think that in the past three years we have been able to do a good deal but we still have an enormous unmet need in respect of hostels and nursing homes. We have been able to approve personal care subsidies for about 16,000 people in hostels. I think that in general the whole range of things that is being done is providing more comfort and more security for a greater number of people each year. But unless we understand the real responsibility of government in regard to the management of expenditure and unless we are prepared to look at the increases that are occurring in the number of pensioners as well as in the rates we are not being realistic. I do not think that any government could run away from its real responsibility to maintain the income security system, in some ways and at some times to be able to improve it, and, above all I think, to see itself in the position of having total responsibility for the raising of funds as well as the disbursal of them. </para>
          <para>
            <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Grimes</inline>said that the Government's policy could be reversed without inflationary effect. I believe that what I have said in regard to the growth in numbers and the changes in the rate of inflation since the time when the Labor Government was in office would lead people who understand the facts as they are to reject the motion moved by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Grimes.</inline></para>

            </talker>
            <para>- I support the motion moved by my colleague <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Grimes.</inline> Before I move into the arguments I have prepared for my contribution to the debate I would like to make one or two comments on what the Minister for Social Security <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Guilfoyle)</inline> has just said. I am sure that we in the Senate, the pensioners and the beneficiaries of pension benefits generally will be grateful for the very lucid explanation the Minister has given us on the place of a private member's Bill on this subject, and also for pinpointing very clearly the group which holds the responsibility for the decision in this matter and for the allocation of funds. I am sure that the pensioners will realise clearly that in future they must direct their comments to the Executive and any change which comes must come from that group. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>I am surprised and perhaps a little mystified at the Minister's exercise in semantics on whether the discussion we are having is political, economic or social. I find that any matters we deal with in this place are political. I find it difficult to define otherwise. Perhaps the Minister was looking rather in terms of motivation and was suggesting there was some political motivation behind the motion moved by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Grimes.</inline> I think that the record of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Grimes</inline> in this place and the record of his party speak for themselves.  His  motivation in moving this motion is based quite clearly on his knowledge of the needs of pensioners and the beneficiaries of pensions, and his compassion for them. I wonder whether the pensioners, in particular the age pensioners, throughout Australia who are cold and hungry would appreciate the Minister's economic argument, one which she put with such skill. I supose it demonstrates quite clearly the different approach of the two parties. Labor's concern in the area of social security quite obviously is for need, as it is in the area of education. We do not accept that we give pensioners what is left after we have bought VIP aeroplanes, after we have built High Courts and after we have given subsidies to people who do not need them. Rather we see that in matters of social security the need of the pensioner is the criterion, not what happens to be left over. </para>
          <para>I could not appreciate the logic behind the Minister's reference to the Hayden Budget. The Minister admitted that the Hayden Budget included six-monthly adjustments. She also admitted that it included the indexation of the unemployment benefit. Then in some way she justified her own action in not continuing that policy by saying that Labor did not do more. That is extraordinary logic for a woman with the Minister's background. </para>
          <para>My contribution in this debate will deal with the special problems faced by pensioners in the Northern Territory, particularly the age pensioners- those who qualify for benefits under the pensioner medical service; that is, those who are without other income. I refer to these people only because it is a graphic illustration of the effects of Government policy, of which annual indexation is one aspect although what I will have to say in this area applies to all pensioners and beneficiaries. There are several general factors that I might mention. Firstly, there is the high living cost in the Northern Territory. I am unable to give clear figures on this because despite the fact that I have asked for them on several occasions the Government says that it has no money to provide consumer price index figures for the Northern Territory. It says that it has no money for staff or expenses. However, it has been recognised in the district allowance paid by government and industry that there is a difference in the cost of living in the Northern Territory. There are different allowances for different areas but the cost of living is a significant part of the district allowance and, of course, pensioners get no district allowance. </para>
          <para>Prices are high in the Territory because there is little local production. When people try to produce locally the big stores insist on buying from the south because they maintain that they can have a firm supply for the 12 months. This also adds to the cost of living. Freight is a solid component of the cost of living in the Northern Territory and basically all of the goods used in the Northern Territory come from the south and are subject to freight charges. There is no recognition of this fact in the rate of pension or in the indexation of benefits. </para>
          <para>The next point is the steady increase in costs. Again, I can give no figures because we have no CPI figures. But quite obviously, we do have the effect of inflation on costs, including freight, all of which accumulate. I do not think that there would be any doubt that there is a steady increase in costs. Since this is the theme of the debate, I will not dwell on the point but will come back to it later. I wish now to raise a number of other matters. </para>
          <para>I would like to look at the specific areas where the pensioners of the Northern Territory are disadvantaged- Firstly, they are disadvantaged by the high costs of goods and services. I have already referred to this matter. I will not dwell on that point as I think that that is accepted by those people who have knowledge of the situation in the Northern Territory. Pensioners in the Northern Territory are disadvantaged also by the lack of concessions or assistance from either the Territory Government or the Federal Government. I commend the Territory Government for setting up a board of inquiry into welfare needs, which will look at the problems of pensioners and other people with needs. Of course, until its report becomes public and the information it is going to give us is known to us we must assume that what exists at the moment will continue to exist. Too often people have missed out by anticipating what might come out of a board of inquiry. Nevertheless, I do commend the Government for doing this. </para>
          <para>Another area in which the pensioners in the Northern Territory are disadvantaged is that of accommodation. It is common knowledge that housing is in short supply in the Northern Territory. Because of the normal market situation of supply and demand costs are high. Rent is high, the cost of buying a house is high and the cost of maintaining a house is high. Unfortunately, there is insufficient subsidised accommodation in the Territory. So many of the pensioners and beneficiaries live in single rooms. It would be disturbing to honourable senators to know that a pensioner in the Northern Territory might pay $35 a week for a single room without any cooking facilities- just a place in which to lay his head. The Australian Council on the Ageing has added to this picture by reporting that people sleep on the floor after they have found accommodation because they have not sufficient money to buy furniture after paying their rent. What an indictment of our community that is! What reward is it to give those people who have pioneered the Territory a chance to sleep on bare boards because they cannot afford to buy furniture after they pay rent? </para>
          <para>The cost of subsidised accommodation in the Northern Territory is comparable with that in the States but the charges are not. In the States and in the Australian Capital Territory concessions apply which do not apply in the Northern Territory. I think it is important to look briefly at some of them. In the Northern Territory there is no concession for electricity, which everyone needs when living in an urban area. The charges are high and they are increasing. Water, sewerage and local government rates obviously affect those people who have their own homes or those who rent homes, but as well as that it would be a component of the rent paid by people who rent rooms or flats. </para>
          <para>In New South Wales the concession given is that it is mandatory to write off 50 per cent to a maximum of $120 on general rates and 50 per cent to a maximum of $60 on water and sewerage rates. Indeed, some councils in New South Wales provide additional concessions. South Australia offers a concession of 60 per cent with maximum reductions and these reductions are very liberal. In the Australian Capital Territory a 50 per cent concession applies simply on the production of a pensioner card. In the Northern Territory no concession whatsoever applies. It must be admitted that the city council tends not to sue for payment and it has some discretion as to whether it will allow the debts to build up and be taken from the estate of the person concerned. But there is no firm policy and the council acts on the discretion of an individual officer. So it is fair to say that basically there is no concession. </para>
          <para>I turn now to car registrations, which is an important matter. A group from the Combined Pensioners Association of Victoria who came to see us in late 1978 spoke of the great need that pensioners have for cars. They spoke of some pensioners having to pick up others to go to meetings and having to take shopping the people who could not drive or were incapacitated, or simply of pensioners getting out of the house, which is the only luxury that these people have. But surely we are not going to question the right of pensioners and beneficiaries to have a vehicle. </para>
          <para>I deplore the sort of antediluvian approach which states that it is some sort of crime to be on a pension and that in some way it is a person's own fault that he is on a pension and in receipt of some benefits. I deplore the concept of a pension being seen- apparently it was seen by the Minister for Social Security <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Guilfoyle)</inline> as this- as some sort of largesse which is handed out by the state. I prefer to see it as moneys being repaid; moneys which are paid in during a lifetime of contribution being paid back to a person who needs them later. I make a side reference to the great advantages that the national superannuation scheme suggested by the Australian Labor Party would have in this sort of situation. </para>
          <para>Let us look at the concessions that apply to vehicle registration. In New South Wales a 90 per cent motor vehicle tax concession applies. In Victoria the totally and permanently incapacitated receive free registration. In Queensland a remission of half the motor vehicle registration fee applies. In the Northern Territory no concession at all applies. Again, I have called on the Government to introduce such concessions for the Northern Territory and honourable senators who sit in this place have heard me make this call on the Government. The Government says that it is considering the matter, but as yet, after over 1 2 months, I have not heard of a decision- I have received no reply. </para>
          <para>Let us look at the area of transport. In the Northern Territory pensioners and beneficiaries receive free travel on local buses. I commend the Government for that. It is a hangover from the days when the Commonwealth was responsible for the Northern Territory and this was allowed by the Commonwealth Government. For interstate travel the Commonwealth makes available half fares between capital cities, but of course charges for meals, sleepers and so on still have to be paid. Unfortunately, there are no trains in the Top End. We had a railways system- the North Australian Railways- which was cut out by the government of the day, the present Government. The only connection we have with capital cities is out of Alice Springs. As we all know, the bulk of the Territorians live in the Top End. McRobertson Miller Airline Services, to its credit, allows a 50 per cent reduction in fares in the off-peak season. But a pensioner's fare is not paid automatically every two years, as is the case for other people in the Territory. It has been agreed that this two-year fare is necessary for the health of the people who are working. How much more necessary is it for those people who perhaps are not as healthy as the people who are working because they are approaching the end of their lives? It is worth noting that both government and private employers have accepted the proposition concerning a two-year fare. </para>
          <para>I think I have said enough to demonstrate the special and specific disadvantages suffered by Northern Territory pensioners. Let us look briefly at the consequences of these disadvantages to these people. The situation has developed where pensioner associations and other groups have had to provide meals for pensioners because they cannot afford to buy them. I refer to the Pensioners Association and the Meals on Wheels organisation. They provide meals at a nominal charge of 80c and 50c a meal. I am advised by a field officer for the Council on the Ageing that for some people this meal represents their only meal for the day; their other two meals consist of, as he said, 'tea and bickies'. As far as I am concerned, this sort of approach of voluntary groups going out and seeking money and contributions of food and then of getting voluntary help to prepare meals looks good and the people who do the work are to be commended but it is not the sort of philosophy we want to see being adopted. It is rather reminiscent of the old soup kitchen philosophy. I find it anathema to what we call our affluent society. </para>
          <para>I refer again to a report from the field officer of the Council on the Ageing in which he told me that he sees the pensioners when they become down and out'. What does he mean by 'down and out'? He means people who have lost their dignity; people who have found, because of the problems that face them, an inability to cope. He means people who are in despair, people who are sick. He said that they are people who need preventive medicine. I should say that they have come after that stage; that they have come when they can no longer cope. He told me that more of these 'down and outs' have approached him in the past two years than previously. The more astute honourable senators on the other side of the chamber will say that that would not be the result of government policies because this system of indexing pensions has been introduced only recently. The whole point of what I am trying to say in my contribution is that the present imposition is just one more factor. </para>
          <para>The field officer reported to me an increase in illness among these people, particularly illnesses resulting from vitamin deficiencies and slow malnutrition.  His  comments are supported by the dietician at the hospital. There are answers to the particular problems faced by the Northern Territory pensioners. Obviously among them is the introduction of a district allowance and the provision of a set of rebates and concessions by the Northern Territory and local government, perhaps including concessions in regard to charges for rent and electricity. Since food forms the greatest part of a budget, what I see is needed is the provision of some sort of district allowance to compensate for high food costs. </para>
          <para>Mentioning the cost of food brings us back to the terms of the motion before us. The simple fact is that the age pensioners in the Northern Territory who qualify for pensioner medical cards are living below the poverty line and the introduction of 12-monthly indexation will simply exacerbate the situation and ensure that these people live further below the poverty line. Some might say that the pensioners should just move out of the Territory. Many have done so because they cannot afford to live there. What an insult to our pioneers, to ask them to build our Territory for us, to get it ready for us and then to move out. It seems to me that this is the height of selfishness. Of course, many people would say that they cannot live in the south, that they must live in the tropics for their health. </para>
          <para>I have run out of time so I finish up with the following comment: I have said much in this place about territorians being the poor cousins of Canberra. If we in the Territory are the poor cousins, on the whole, then pensioners are the forgotten ones, the fringe dwellers of our society. I call on the Government to recognise the contribution our pioneers have made and to show both justice and compassion towards their needs. I think that all of us in this place should support the proposition put forward by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Grimes</inline> not only on moral grounds and in justice, but also because of the simple, old truism: 'There but for the grace of God go I'. </para>

            <para>- The Senate is debating a matter of public importance which the Opposition has brought forward, namely: </para>
          </talk.start>
          <quote>
            <para>The restoration by the Government of twice yearly indexation for all pensions and benefits under the social security and repatriation systems. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">This relates not only to age pensioners as there are a variety of others to which I shall refer in a moment. Not many speakers have referred to those yet. </para>
          <para>Before I begin, on this occasion I thank the Leader of the Government in the Senate <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Carrick)</inline> and the Government Whips for including myself on the speakers list. I also wish to thank them on behalf of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Harradine,</inline> in his absence. I approached the acting Opposition Whip before and he said that his list was full. I am not complaining about that because the Opposition has been remarkably kind to members of the Australian Democrats since we got into this Parliament. I am just raising in passing the fact that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Mason</inline> and I, as the two Australian Democrat senators in this chamber, represent about one million voters. In fact, more people voted for the Australian Democrats than for the National Country Party of Australia. One in every eight Australians voted for our Party. I do not know what formula we can use so that we can have members of the minority parties and the independent honourable senator speaking in debates, but as we received over twelve per cent of the votes one would think that one-eighth of the speaking time would be reasonable. I raise this objection in principle. It does not seem right that we should be dependent on either of the Whips for the right to speak in this chamber. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr President,</inline> we should be dependent on your call. Therein I immediately recognise the difficulty under which that places you because for the Senate to function in an orderly manner you have to have lists in front of you. After consultation with the two Whips it may be that we can regularise the situation and when we do get a formula that might help you in this dilemma, we will come to see you. </para>
          <para>In my policy speech in 1977 it was announced that the Australian Democrats policy was clearly not for the restoration or maintenance of six-monthly indexation of pensions but for quarterly indexation of all pensions. We stand clear and unequivocal on that indexation as part of our policy for reasons I shall mention. I support the statements of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Grimes</inline> and of other speakers on this side of the Senate when they say that there is an even more serious aspect to this matter. That is a breaking of an overt promise by a Prime Minister. On the basis of that promise he wooed hundreds of thousands of people to vote for the Liberal Party and for the National Country Party. There is no question that this matter of indexation of pensions is one of the biggest things weighing in pensioners' minds, and it is one of the biggest things which influences them on how to vote at election time. </para>
          <para>To illustrate that situation let me go back to something about which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Grimes</inline> reminded the Senate and that was the part I played in the changing of Liberal Party thinking in 1975. When the Liberal Party was reforming its policies in those days I was the spokesman or shadow Minister for Social Security. Under <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Snedden</inline> and subsequently under <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Fraser</inline> we formed a committee, of which I was  chairman.  The way in which my committee operated was not necessarily to go only to bureaucrats to find out what was wrong with the social structure but to go out to the people actually in the field of social welfare. After all, they are the people who know the problems of people in society. In determining our social welfare policy we went to organisations such as the Catholic Family Welfare Bureau, the Brotherhood of St Laurence, the Australian Council of Social Service, the Victorian Council of Social Service, various other social service councils around Australia, the society for the aging, the society for the crippled and pensioners associations. We really went into the hearts of people who were affected by social welfare. </para>
          <para>The significant thing was that every one of the organisations on which we called was unanimous as to the number one social reform needed in this country, and that was to index pensions to take the fear of the future out of the minds of pensioners who are totally or substantially resting on the Government for their livelihood. No organisation came up with any other proposition as a number one priority. Therefore, it was included in the policy speech made by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Fraser</inline> at the time of the 1975 election. The words that he used were the words that I had written for him and which had been approved unanimously by a party meeting of Liberal and National Country Party members and senators. The words were that the Liberal-National Country Party would bring instant and automatic indexation of pensions in line with the consumer price index. I think the words 'instant' and 'automatic' are fairly easily understood in the English language and to my mind, even by stretching one's imagination one could not believe that that means once each year, which is now the situation. In fact, it is worse than once each year because in most cases pensioners have to wait up to 16 months before the increases in the consumer price index are reflected in their incomes because of the time lag. </para>
          <para>The reason these organisations said that this was the number one priority was that pensioners feared two things. This fear is a constant companion of all age pensioners. The two components of this fear are death and their future security, their future income support. To take away that priority after promising it is a matter which we regard as reprehensible. That is what is being done, notwithstanding a firm promise by the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Malcolm Fraser)</inline> at the last election on which he must have won hundreds of thousands of votes- possibly millions of votes. To the Australian Democrats to break that promise is an act that is not to be commended. Let me give some figures as to the number of people affected. I have just taken out these figures today, and I am surprised at the numbers. There are 1.3 million age pensioners in Australia and an additional 30,000 wives of those pensioners are affected by this move. If I have erred on the side of conservatism in relation to those on unemployment benefits who might be affected it is because the junior rates are not indexed, so I say a quarter of a million people on unemployment relief are affected by this move. There are 485,000 repatriation pensioners affected by this move and 188,000 service pensioners. A grand total of something like 2.5 million human beings in this country were resting on an assumption that when <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Fraser</inline> and his Government were re-elected they would continue indexing those pensions at least once every six months. It was a fair assumption because the Prime Minister said that he would retain that indexation. Now, that promise has been broken. Out of 7.4 million voters, 2.3 million is a substantial number to be affected by a broken promise. My thoughts and those of the Australian Democrats on this matter are well known. As I have said, it was in our policy speech that quarterly adjustments should be implemented. </para>
          <para>I want to refer to a matter which I believe is even more significant than has been mentioned so far in this debate. We are supposed to have in the Parliamentary Press Gallery the doyen of political journalists in the country, and I believe we have. But I have said many times that I think it is a bad thing that journalists are allowed by their newpapers to remain here too long, because after they are here for a certain time they, too, accept the cynicism that is Canberra. They accept the farce that is Parliament. When an event happens that threatens the very power of this democratically elected institution- the Parliament- they do not even notice that it has occurred. Such an event occurred last week. I should like to put it on the record. </para>
          <para>The Liberal and National Country parties considered at a party meeting a statement printed by the three most responsible Australian newspapers. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Fraser</inline> was reported as saying to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Goodluck,</inline> the member for Franklin, who gave notice that he intended to introduce a private member's Bill the purpose of which was to restore six-monthly indexation: 'Even in the unlikely event that you get a majority to pass your private member's Bill, the Government will not fund it'. I have never before heard such a statement come from a government leader in any of the Western democracies. Certainly no Prime Minister of this country has ever issued such a statement. What does it mean? It means that the head of the Executive Government in this country has said: 'I do not care what Parliament does. You can pass as many Bills as you like but we, the Executive, will have the final say'. But not one of these political pundits in this Press Gallery picked it up. I have not heard any member of any party pick it up. That is one of the most significant statements I have heard. </para>
          <para>I have listened to and read speeches in the Senate and in the House of Representatives delivered by members of parliament who were seeking genuinely and sincerely to uphold the rights of the Parliament. The speeches have been fairly uniform in their content. They have said that the traditions of our Westminster system are protected by three sources of power in our country- the judiciary which interprets the laws, the Executive which frames the laws, and the Parliament which passes the laws. Every  speaker  on this subject says that these three sources of power must always be kept distinct so that one can have a check and a balance on the others. I have heard some magnificent speeches in this Senate which claims its independence from the Executive. Those speeches state that once the Executive gains control of the Parliament it will be the end of the Westminster system as we know it. </para>
          <para>What did the Prime Minister say? At least in philosophical terms he was guilty of contempt of the Parliament, because what he, the Prime Minister, said was this: 'I do not care what Parliament passes. I do not care what a majority of the democratically elected representatives of the people say by way of vote. That does not mean a damn to me or to the Executive. The only thing that matters in this country, the only thing that will pass in legislation is what I, the Prime Minister, and what we, the Cabinet, agree to. ' I sometimes wonder what is wrong with us as parliamentarians because we go through this charade of coming to the Parliament as the elected representatives of the people and we allow the head of the Executive Government to make a statement such as the one to which I have referred. </para>
          <para>So to compound the error, I issued a Press release on 13 February. It was placed in every Press box in the Press Gallery. I think the case 1 have enunciated is unanswerable. The Prime Minister did say on this question of indexation of pensions that he did not care what Parliament said. Yet, to my knowledge, not one newspaper in Australia picked it up or printed it. Having made that additional point which is pertinent to this debate, I repeat that we of the Australian Democrats pledge ourselves to support the Australian Labor Party in any moves it might want to make in conformity with the Standing Orders in an effort to force the Government in some way to honour the promise on which it won millions of votes in 1977. </para>

            </talker>
            <para>-I rise in this debate concerned that a government whose mismanagement has allowed the deficit to blow out by around $ 1,000m should be trying to retrieve the position by squeezing the people in need of government care and protection. In those areas where government should be using its powers to protect and to sustain those whose circumstances have placed them in a vulnerable position, this Government is pushing people further and further into the quagmire of extreme poverty. Merely paying lip service to the idea of pensions is not enough. One has to look at the real needs, the real justice, behind the whole idea of paying pensions to certain sections of the community. Although in many ways when one talks about pensions one thinks of elderly people, pensioners in our community today are of all ages. They all have human needs. They all need food, for instance. The elderly need good food to prevent illness, to prevent degeneration. Women who are chronically anaemic need good food and proper nutrition. Children need nourishing fresh food for their mental and physical development. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>Yet at a time when pensions have effectively had a stopper put on them, we notice that the consumer price index shows that in the December quarter there was a 10 per cent increase in food prices. The pensioners who will have to buy food at that increased price will not receive an increase in their pensions until November 1979. One cannot help wondering how people will manage in these sorts of circumstances. For the elderly, in some areas, there are such organisations as Meals on Wheels to provide assistance. But when one remembers that the Government has cut the subsidy to Meals on Wheels and prevented its expansion in many areas, one has no alternative but to imagine that large numbers of our pensioner population will start to degenerate because they will be unable to eat properly. They will not be able to buy nourishing food to sustain themselves. </para>
          <para>Right across the community, insufficient money to buy proper food means an increase in ill health, which means additional cost. We used to have Medibank to assist people in ill health, but this Government has destroyed Medibank. Now pensioners have to take out private health insurance, and that means more expense. Elderly pensioners in some areas will be lucky to be able to take out private health insurance because many of the health insurance funds have stopped offering health insurance to elderly people. They have said that the risk is too great; that they cannot afford it. So the pensioners are left with only their pensions, without the prospect of their being increased and with mounting expenses. </para>
          <para>Families with young children make up a great part of our pensioner population today. Anybody who has had children, anybody who has any imagination, realises that when there are young children in a family the need for health care rises dramatically. Everybody knows that families have high expenses in this area and everybody knows that many pensioners are now left with the burden of covering the gap between the standard health benefit that they can claim and the actual fees that doctors charge. They cannot afford to pay high insurance premiums on a fixed income because the money runs out. So the health of these people deteriorates even more. There are, as I think all members of parliament will have realised by now, increasing numbers of people in our offices complaining bitterly about the fact that their pensions are being reduced; they are being reviewed and reduced. They are complaining more because it is becoming much more difficult for them to manage on what is left. It becomes more obvious to them that what they see as a reduction in their incomes has taken place, and they literally cannot manage. </para>
          <para>All sorts of people need shelter, as has been said in this debate. People and families have to have a roof over their heads, and whilst every little ratty room in Australia has its rent increased every time there is a pension rise, there is no increase in the amount of decent and cheap accommodation into which pensioners can go. In Victoria the Housing Commission has been the body that has assisted pensioners with housing. It now has the policy of having its rents meet market-related rentals, which means, of course, that they will all be lifted substantially. The Commission has already started to lift its rents substantially and while its rents go up to the market value people stay on fixed levels of pensions. Somebody is going to have to suffer to cover that gap. How will a government which insists that pensions need only one cost of living rise a year 12 months after the costs have risen guarantee that people will have shelter? Yet at the end of last year in the debate on the Housing Assistance Bill <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Carrick</inline> said: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>This Bill reflects the Government's firm view that the housing of Australians is an issue of national concern. It conforms with our basic policy objectives ... to ensure that every household in Australia is able to obtain adequate housing within its capacity to pay; </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">How pensioners are going to find adequate housing within their capacity to pay is beyond one's imagination at the moment. Already people's standard of living has been drastically reduced. The Victorian Housing Commission, I repeat, has already started on its policy of raising the rents of people who have very little with which to pay them. Only today I had put to me a case of a widow with four children. The Victorian Housing Commission now offers no rent rebates for pensioners. They pay the rent and then apply for a rebate and the Commission decides whether they are worthy of it. This widow on a pension with four children was denied any rebate because one of her boys had just turned 16, could not get a job and was on unemployment benefit. So the amount of money which that woman has to stretch to feed her family has been, of course, reduced. </para>
          <para>There is no more funding from this Government for hostel-type accommodation. All" over the country one finds areas where there are a large number of aged people in the population, -a large number of people on the waiting lists and no money to provide a hostel. There has been a cut-back in the amount of money made available for the sort of care which would keep aged people in their homes and the sorts of care which enables them to look after household repairs and maintenance. There is no more money for that type of assistance and there is no more money for the sort of accommodation to which aged people can go when they can no longer look after themselves or cope with those sorts of difficulties. </para>
          <para class="block">There is no good, cheap accommodation available in Australia for people living on their own or for families living in difficult circumstances. </para>
          <para>There is also no logic in the Government's persistence that unequal pension benefits should be given. We have families on different types of pensions. Some women bringing up families on their own have health care available to them and some of them have no health care; some of them are helped with prescriptions at the chemist and some of them are not; some are assisted with fares and some get no assistance whatsoever; some have assistance with rates or telephones and some have none at all. Yet they all have children to raise in this community. In January 1979 on the occasion of opening the International Year of the Child <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guilfoyle</inline> said: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>This is a rare opportunity to demonstrate that intensified public and governmental awareness of children's needs can lead to concrete action of immense and, above all, lasting benefit to mankind's future- its children. There is no sounder investment than the future of the child and no greater responsibility for the adults of today . . . The great and promising potentials of the International Year of the Child require, deserve and depend upon the unreserved support of governments, organisations and individuals. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">Those are fine words and yet some children on pensions are paid a larger children's allowance than others, some children on pensions receive an education allowance and some do not, and some children on pensions receive the cost of school requisites, fares and other educational expenses. Very many receive none at all. Yet, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guilfoyle</inline> said, the ball is now in the Government's court. It can now take on the greater responsibility of this investment in our future- our children. How can we differentiate between children? As the value of the pension goes down there is less money in these homes for education and so the children get worse and worse educations and a harder and harder start in life. Honourable senators should imagine these people trying to find money for a private education. Yet this Government has said so much about the freedom of choice in education. It is hard enough for these people to pay when they go into our so-called free school system. In the private education area the situation would be absolutely appalling. There has been no rise in the mother's allowance in any of our pension schemes. There has been no rise in the children's allowance in any of our pension schemes. Now we have an increase once a year while the cost of living rises week by week. </para>
          <para>There is one other area that bears commenting upon, an area that I think is absolutely disgraceful. It is those people under 18 years who find themselves unfortunately on the unemployment benefit. They have had no rise at all since 1975. They have existed on $36 a week since 1975. Their parents, we are told, are expected to take the responsibility for them and to keep them. Yet so many of their parents now are on unemployment benefit. So many of their parents are fast approaching or are in fact below the poverty level. Fares have risen, the cost of food has risen and the cost of clothes and rent has risen. Yet all their needs are supposed to be met at the 1975 level of pension with 1979 prices. They bleed too. They need food, they need shelter and they need sustenance. They are a part of the community. They are a part of the unemployed. They are supposed to get up and show that they have some go in them and can find jobs. They are supposed to be dressed decently. They are supposed to ring up employers and to buy newspapers. Yet we expect them to exist on a pension that was set in 1975. Once again all those youngsters who were so good, worked so hard and had such expectations from us are being made the scapegoats by an older society that cannot cope with the problems it faces. </para>
          <para>The Minister for Social Security <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Guilfoyle)</inline> made much of the numbers of pensioners and the increase in welfare payments. She said, 'It does not matter what the increase in numbers is going to be, we will not increase the size of the cake'. But these people will not go away. The number of people seeking benefit will increase. Does that mean that we are going to have even lower pension payments in the future? It seems to me it is time that this Government set its priorities and put people first. People have always understood that a percentage of their taxes will go to social security and in their turn they will claim for social security. I feel that we want less emphasis on welfare in this area and more emphasis on people's rights. </para>
          <para>The cost of providing this twice-yearly increase would be $2 7m this year. One is reminded of how much the Utah company, for instance, has made out of coal in Queensland this year. Yet the Government refused to put a resource tax on the Utah company. If more of the wealth of this country flowed back to the people of this country, perhaps we would have less talk about welfare and more people would live with some decency. As <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Chipp</inline> has said, we have an arrogant Government with an arrogant Prime Minister. Today we heard from a Minister whom I have not found arrogant before but who followed her Prime Minister when she said: 'It does not really matter what private member's Bill is introduced- the Government will not fund it'. I think it is time that the Government took note of the fact that it governs at the behest of the people of Australia. It should listen to them. </para>

            <para>- I rise to take part in this debate with a measure of regret. I would agree with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Grimes</inline> in relatively few areas but I agree with his view that pensions and pensioners should not be treated as political footballs. Therefore I think it is unfortunate that this afternoon, at the behest of the Opposition, we are discussing a matter which on all grounds is an emotional issue. I believe that in one sense it is almost an insult to refer to those extremely valuable members of our community- there are nearly 2 million pensioners- as political footballs. They certainly would not regard themselves as political footballs. They certainly recognise, as we recognise, that they have made a great contribution to the development and maintenance of this country. If at times such as this we suggest in any way that this issue is a political football I think we do a great disservice to the pensioners of this country who, over the period of their lives, have contributed so much to Australia's development. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>I suppose that pensions, like every other area of government involvement, in the last resort must be included in a consideration of priorities. In the current financial year the Liberal-National Country Party Government is committed to spending in the social services area something like <inline font-style="italic">21Vi</inline> per cent or 28 per cent of its total revenue. If we are talking about priorities, who could say that we do not hold the interests of the pensioner group in the community at a very high level of priority when in fact we are devoting almost 30 per cent of our total revenue to the social services area? When one looks at other areas of involvement, such as education, health, defence and communications, one can see that the Government's program is quite immense. I believe that the proportion of funds allocated to the social services area is evidence of the very high priority that we place on the circumstances of pensioners in our community. </para>
          <para>In a sense I think it is a shame that we should spend some hours discussing this matter this afternoon because it seems to me- and I have spoken with and continue to speak from time to time with great numbers of pensioners- that the majority of pensioners have decided that what was judged to be correct by the Government for last year's Budget was in fact a responsible judgment. Of course, when the interval of payment is extended, the first reaction by those who are directly affected will be that that is a bad thing. That was the first reaction. A great many pensioners have examined all the circumstances of this decision and I believe that very largely they are prepared to admit that the capacity of the economy to pay and the direction of the economy- to control inflation above all thingshave been such that what was selected as Government policy for 1978-79 was after all, a reasonably responsible move. </para>
          <para>I turn to the motion which refers in part to: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>The restoration by the Government of twice yearly indexation for all pensions and benefits under the Social Security and Repatriation systems. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">We are in a moving society. Because a certain circumstance exists as a result of the 1978-79 Budget it does not mean that adjustments and changes will not be made at the appropriate time and in the circumstances as they arise. Changes and adjustments will continually be made in this area, just as they will be made in areas such as defence and education. They will be made right across the board of human activity in Australia. That is why I somewhat abhor the constant references to broken promises and broken undertakings, of failing to live up to undertakings. </para>
          <para>I think we should examine the words of the motion with a greater measure of reality. People in every walk of life are constantly making promises and giving undertakings. Indeed, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guilfoyle,</inline> who spoke earlier this evening, indicated that even some of the undertakings and promises of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Whitlam</inline> were not accomplished. People are always making promises and there needs to be genuine concern to accomplish any undertaking. But I believe that people have an equal responsibility to understand that an undertaking cannot always be something of an iron-like or steel-like nature. It cannot be totally and absolutely inflexible. If it were one would have to assume that circumstances never change and that one would not need to consider what is constantly happening around us. Circumstances, emphasis and attitudes change within a month, within a year or within a number of years and Government has a responsibility to recognise this fact. </para>
          <para>At long last the Government is reaching a successful point in the battle with inflation and this is of extreme importance to the pensioner section of our community, as it is to the whole community. During a period of three years we have seen the level of inflation drop from something like 17 1/2 per cent to 7.8 per cent last year- a reduction of more than half. This reduction is probably of more significance to the pensioners of Australia than to any other section of our community. This Government gave a basic undertaking at the last two elections that it would reduce the inflation rate. The Government is being successful in this respect. This fact is recognised around the world. Whether all of us like it or not, industry and commerce inside and outside this country are recognising that economic activity is turning upwards. This point has been emphasised by member nations of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. It has also been recognised and promoted by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. There is a commonly held view that this economy is moving in an upward direction. </para>
          <para>The reduction in the rate of inflation is the most significant contribution that this Government or any government can make for the welfare of all the people- pensioners and all others alike- in the context of our economy and our society. I suggest that no government in a social service based state, such as the one in which we live, would want to make matters more difficult for pensioners. There is no earthly reason why that would be an objective of any government. What a responsible government must do is to see that pensioners enjoy the best possible circumstances within the capacity of the economy. That is what a responsible government must do and that is what this Government has been trying to do and, I believe, has been succeeding in doing. From the best information I can obtain the pensioner group in Australia enjoys a standard of living which is equal to and probably better then the standard in any other country round the world. That is something of which we should be proud and which we should seek to maintain. </para>
          <para>It is mighty hard in a debate like this one not to repeat some of the things that have been said before but again I draw attention to the words expressed earlier by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guilfoyle</inline> when she explained that if an inflation rate is halved there is a good argument for extending the period between changes in pension rates; that is a 10 per cent inflation rate is reduced to 5 per cent, an annual change to pensions would be roughly as effective as biannual change in the former circumstance. Government action in regard to pensions was taken in the 1 978 Budget. I think that it is important to recall why the action was taken and to observe as time goes by whether it remains the most appropriate action or whether changes must in fact occur. Action was taken because the rate of inflation had fallen significantly- from 17.5 per cent to 7.8 per cent in three years. It was projected at that time that that inflation rate may be as low as 5 per cent by the middle of this year. That may or may not be true but that was the projection of the time and that was one of the basic reasons for the Government's action. </para>
          <para>The other point we should remember is that the adjustment of pensions has been maintained as being exactly referable- 100 per cent referable- to moves in the consumer price index. Of course, that is not so in the circumstance of wage adjustments in this country. The cost of biannual adjustment has been referred to before. There was a saving to the Treasury of something approaching $30m in the first case and between $60m and $70m in the case of a full year. I do not think that the extent of the cost to the community of adjustments in pensions is fully and clearly understood. An adjustment of $1 a week over a full year costs the revenue of this country- the taxpayer- something like $116m. To raise the level of pensions by 6 per cent to 30 per cent would cost $ 1.5 billion in a year. I am certain that the circumstances of the pensioners will remain a prime objective of this Government but I am equally sure that the pensioners themselves will recognise in the last resort that their income is related to the total efficiency of the economy. What they receive has to be referable to the capacity to pay of the total Australian community. I close by saying merely that to vote for the motion that is before us this afternoon, regardless of all pertinent circumstances, would have to be an irresponsible act. </para>

            <para>- This afternoon we are debating an urgency motion which has been moved by my colleague <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Grimes.</inline> It reads: </para>
          </talk.start>
          <quote>
            <para>That in the opinion of the Senate the following is a matter of urgency: </para>
            <para>The restoration by the Government of twice yearly indexation for all pensions and benefits under the Social Security and Repatriation systems. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">This motion arose because last year the Government removed the twice yearly indexation of pensions. That removal was embodied in legislation which we debated in this chamber last year. I recall that when we were debating the Social Services Amendment Bill, the Bill which eventually took away the twice yearly indexation provision, something pertinent was mentioned by the  speaker  who then preceded me in the debate. She said- she was speaking from the Government side- that she did not like the legislation. I recall, too, that when I spoke about the legislation I said that for the first time she and I agreed because I did not like the legislation at all. </para>
          <para>Since that legislation was placed in our statute book I have found that the people of Australia have expressed their dislike of the legislation as well. The more knowledge they have of what it has meant for the pensioners of Australia and its effects, the less they like the legislation. They can see certain things in it which should not be seen in legislation affecting the pensioners of Australia. For a start they can see the political implications. They can see the promises that were broken and, despite the comments of the previous <inline font-weight="bold">speaker, Senator Scott,</inline> they were broken. I shall elaborate on these shortly. They see also serious implications for the pensioners of Australia because of the lack of money that they will have at their disposal. They can see a serious erosion of the value of their pensions. Some people also have looked at the economic implications of that social security legislation of last year. They can see that there will be a lack of purchasing power by the pensioners due to the fact that they will not receive the May increase they were expecting. They will have less money at their disposal. They will circulate less money throughout our economy. I think that most people would agree that any extra funds that pensioners receive are usually spent, that they are not saved. The spending of this money helps to create the type of economic climate that we want at the moment. </para>
          <para>Let me mention now the broken promises. As I have said, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Scott</inline> disputed that there were broken promises, but there were. Many of the promises made by the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Malcolm Fraser)</inline> have been broken. But the breaking of the promise concerning pensions was particularly shameful. The removal of the twice yearly indexation, as happened last year, was the most amazing about face and the most barefaced breaking of a promise that I have seen since I have been a member of this chamber. Let us look at the promises that were made. In 1975, in the Liberal Party's policy speech, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Fraser</inline> said: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>The real value of pensions will be preserved. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">He said later: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>These benefits will be protected against inflation. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">That was in 1 975 before the election of that year. In 1977, just before the election which was called 1 2 months early, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Fraser</inline> said: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>We have taken politics out of old age pensions and all other social welfare and repatriation pensions by increasing them automatically in line with inflation. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">The implication was that the system prevailing at that time, which allowed twice yearly indexation of pensions, would continue. The Minister for Social Security, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guilfoyle,</inline> added to that statement during the election campaign in 1977 in an advertisement in which she featured. She was quoted as saying: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>We believed it was important to take politics out of pensions and that's why we altered the legislation ... we said that when we came into government we would have an automatic increase. We've done that and whilst the Act remains as it is there is, every six months, an automatic increase to take account of the cost of living. I 've had lots of people say to me 'You've given us dignity because you do not argue about our rises every six months'. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">We certainly do not argue about our rises every six months now because they are not there. I wonder whether there was a hint of what was coming in that 1977 promise by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guilfoyle.</inline> She said atone stage: </para>
          <list type="lowerroman-dotted">
            <item label=".">
              <para>. whilst the Act remains as it is there is, every six months, an automatic increase . . . </para>
            </item>
          </list>
          <para class="block">But the Act did not remain as it was for very long. It was changed in the legislation which I referred to earlier. It is perhaps significant that that was mentioned in that policy document. The legislation which we faced last year, which we debated and which the Opposition most vigorously opposed, removed the promise on which pensioners in Australia have hung their hopes for their future security. Pensioners do look towards security. They do look towards their financial security after they have worked for a lifetime. </para>
          <para>I wonder whether this Government should so readily cast aside the promises that it makes. Should it not perhaps give a lead to the community by keeping a promise when it is made. We should look at what happens in the home with regard to promises. I know that in my home as- I am sure happens in homes throughout the nation- I teach my children that if they make a promise they should keep that promise. It is something they should live up to all of their lives. I can remember that even at a very early age one of my own children sang a song which began 'If you give a promise then keep a promise'. Throughout all of the homes in Australia people believe this. Should we not also believe it in government? Are we not to expect that the Government should keep its promises just the same as we teach our children in our own homes. Why should this Government continue to breach promises and thus give a sorry lead to the rest of the community? I would like to see a return to honesty in government; a government which once having given a promise will keep that promise. As an initial step to such a return to honesty in government I believe that this Government should immediately announce that it will revert to a six monthly adjustment of pensions because this is what the pensioners of Australia expected after the 1975 and 1977 election campaigns. </para>
          <para>It is well to remember how many persons in the community are affected. The motion that we are discussing this afternoon mentions benefits under social security and repatriation systems. In the time that I had at my disposal before this motion came before the Senate, I had the opportunity of finding out only the number of people who receive pensions and benefits under the social security systems, not the repatriation systems. But even this is worth looking at. There are 1.2 million age pensioners in Australia. There are 50,000 people who are receiving a supporting parent's benefit. There are 140,000 widowed pensioners and 240,000 people in the community who are receiving an invalid pension. A significant number of people were affected by the legislation last year. A significant number of people in Australia are listening carefully to what is being said in this chamber this afternoon. It is well worth remembering that in these groups I have mentioned each person is not a statistic. Each person has the same hopes and the same fears as any other person in the community. </para>
          <para>One thing which has happened since the Parliament rose last year is that an increase in the consumer price index has been announced. Since pensions were increased last November the consumer price index has increased by 2.3 per cent. Pensioners are already behind. They are lagging behind by 2.3 per cent. They now will not receive an adjustment as they had expected in May. Why should they have to wait until November 1979 to receive an adjustment for this 2.3 per cent increase? There will be further increases in the consumer price index between now and November. Do these pensioners not have to buy their groceries, their bread, their milk and their tea or their coffee? Do they not have to buy clothing and pay for the heating of their homes in winter time? Do they not have to provide accommodation? Some of them have to rent accommodation. Of course they must provide these things. Should they not also be allowed to have some luxuries from time to time, at the time of their birthday or at Christmas? Of course they should, but they cannot if the present attitude of the Government of not providing increases to keep in line with the consumer price index continues. </para>
          <para>Last year we were told why the practice of adjustments on a twice yearly basis was discontinued. We were told that there had been a reduction in inflation and that therefore the increases on a twice yearly basis were not required. A number of us on this side of the chamber last year pointed out what a spurious type of argument this was, because inflation was perhaps running at 7 per cent to 8 per cent but in 1971 and 1972 when inflation was running at a rate of about 5 per cent the McMahon Government decided that it should increase pensions on a twice yearly basis. Either the McMahon Government was wrong or the present Government was wrong last year when it announced that there would not be an adjustment on a six monthly basis. Clearly the Government was wrong last year. It put a misleading argument. I believe that the real reason was to save funds. By not providing indexation for pensions last year the Government will save $27m this year. It will save $60m in a full year. I believe that this afternoon when the Minister for Social Security was speaking she clearly suggested that it was mainly an economic consideration; that was the Government's prime motive last year in removing the twice yearly indexation. </para>
          <para>If the Government does not honour its promises as it has not honoured its promise in this area it is misleading the Australian people, just as I suggested earlier this afternoon that it misled the Australian people by its inability to provide more employment in the community. I further believe that if it cannot honour its promises one more step should be taken. This Government should say that it requires a new mandate. It should say to the Australian people, 'We cannot have twice yearly indexation of pensions as we said we would at the 1975 election and the 1977 election. Because we cannot do this we want a mandate from you to have an increase of pensions only on a 12 months basis.' So it should go to the people and ask for this mandate. We in the Labor Party would accept such a challenge from the Government. I am sure that if the challenge was issued and the Government went to the people the Labor Party would win. I support the motion that has been moved by my colleague <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Grimes</inline> this afternoon. </para>

            <para>- Justice delayed is justice denied. That time-honoured legal principle deserves recognition during the current controversy over the indexation of pensions. How often I have used that particular principle in negotiations with employers and before wages tribunals. It has equal force when consideration is being given to the question of indexation of pensions for price rises. No one would deny openly the right of pensioners to have their modest pensions adjusted to keep pace with increased costs as reflected by increases in the consumer price index. The question is: How frequently should the adjustments be made? For years I have made no bones about where I stand on this question. Increases in prices are recorded by the Australian Bureau of Statistics and announced every three months. Pensions and benefits should be adjusted quarterly and the increases paid back to the beginning of the first month of each quarter. The records of the Senate of 27 April 1976 show that I moved a resolution to that effect. Sadly, the records of the Senate also show that my resolution received no support. No other senator was prepared even to second that resolution. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>To be fair, it is a different story now. There is substantial discontent with the annual indexation proposition contained in the Budget last year and subsequently introduced by amendments to the Act. There seems little likelihood of quarterly adjustments of pensions and benefits ever being achieved because of the attitude of both major parties. However, there is hope that twice-yearly indexation will be restored, and so it should be. The bread man, the milk man, the owner of the supermarket, the rent collectornone of these will hang about for 15 months waiting to be paid for their increased prices. </para>

              <para>- Yes, it is 16 months. As at the present moment, pensions and benefits are adjusted every November for movements in the consumer price index for the 12 months ending on 30 June of that particular year. So there is already a catch-up period of four months in addition to the 12 months during which the pensioners have had to pay the increases without compensation. We are discussing this evening an urgency motion which states: </para>

          <quote>
            <para>That in the opinion of the Senate the following is a matter of urgency: </para>
            <para>The restoration by the Government of twice yearly indexation for all pensions and benefits under the Social Security and Repatriation systems. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">It is a matter of urgency. It is a matter of public importance, and I was concerned that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Grimes,</inline> when introducing the matter of urgency, took time out, in my view undeservedly, to take the mickey out of members of the back bench of the Government in the House of Representatives for action that they are taking to achieve this effect. I ask: Did not their action contribute to the urgency of this matter? Did not their action contribute to the heightening of the public importance of this matter? Of course it did, and in my judgment it is totally unfair to chyack these members for attempting to reverse the situation and achieve twice-yearly indexation. It is also not in accordance with the facts. It has been suggested that the honourable member for Franklin <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Goodluck)</inline> will not proceed with his Bill. I have not heard him say that. I suggest that if back bench members of the Government are prepared to stick their necks out on this particular matter they should not be chyacked, they should be supported and wished all the best. I remind <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Grimes</inline> that people in glass houses should not cast stones. </para>
          <para>I again remind the Senate that the resolution I put down on 27 April 1976 taking account of the principle that justice delayed is justice denied was not supported by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Grimes</inline> or by any other senator in this place. Indeed, I found that quite surprising, because similar attempts to mine had been made over a number of years to have pensions made retrospective to an appropriate date consistent with the application to wages of an increase in the consumer price index, which at that particular time which was quarterly. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Tangney</inline> in 1964 moved such an amendment. She moved it again in 1966. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Toohey</inline> moved such an amendment in 1967. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Fitzgerald</inline> moved it in 1968 and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Poke</inline> in 1969. When <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Harradine</inline> moved such an amendment in 1976 it did not get the support of the Australian Labor Party. If amendments which have some merit in them are moved, surely they ought to receive support no matter who moves them, and that is my attitude in respect of the back bench members who are seeking the restoration of twice-yearly indexation. </para>
          <para>If parliamentarians have personal vested interests in legislation they should declare them. On this issue I declare a vested interest in the 51,800 Tasmanian pensioners who are my constituents, 38,085 of whom are age pensioners. In addition, I, along with a lot of others, have a personal vested interest in the matter. I declare that both my parents are age pensioners, and they are typical of most age pensioners who scraped and saved to raise families through the economically difficult Depression, war and post-war years. There were no mod cons in those times. It was the era of scrubbing boards, coppers, bag freezers, and the rabbit trapping and wood carting to make ends meet. They were hard times but happy times. The pensioners are the last to complain but they deserve priority in the considerations and support of the rest of us for whom they sacrificed so much. In any event they have always paid their taxes and they are entitled to a realistic pension, frequently adjusted to keep up with prices. Of course, money is not everything. Consideration, recognition and, indeed, honour is due to our aged loved ones. A civilisation is judged, amongst other tests, on how it treats its aged and infirm. It is for us to ensure that the judgment of history is not harsh when this test is made on our own civilisation. </para>
          <para>I turn to another important point. In periods of high unemployment such as we are experiencing now. positive incentives are required to encourage early retirement of those who wish to phase themselves into the new, for them, lifestyle of retirement. But the pensionable age, the rigid income test, the taking into consideration of moneys received from superannuation funds to which people were obliged to contribute when they worked and now the annual indexation of pensions are disincentives for a person to retire. I support the proposition that this is a matter of public importance, that it is a matter of urgency. I do so on the principle that if we delay justice any further, then justice will be denied for that period of time. </para>

            <para>- This afternoon the Senate has been debating an urgency motion which was moved by the Opposition and which calls upon the Government to restore twice yearly indexation for all pensions and benefits under the social security and repatriation systems. We have had a lengthy debate. The many speakers who have taken part in it have, I think, canvassed almost all of the ground and I certainly will endeavour to avoid going over ground that has already been covered. I want to direct my remarks to one aspect that has not been dealt with as much as I would have liked to have seen it dealt with and that is the fact that ever since 1972 there has been, I believe, common agreement between the major political parties in this country- especially the Labor and Liberal parties- on the question of pensions. The Senate will recall that before 1972 the subject of pensions was one for hot political debate in this country. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>We as an Opposition felt in those years that the pensioners of Australia had not received adequate support in the pensions they received from the governments which had been in office until 1972. In that year we went to the people seeking their vote on the basis that we would increase pension payments to the figure of 25 per cent of the average weekly earnings. The Senate will recall that at that time in 1972 pensions were only 1 9 per cent of the average weekly earnings. In the three years in which we were in office we increased the percentage to just over 24 per cent. We did not quite make the proposed 25 per cent. As the Minister for Social Security <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Guilfoyle pointed out this afternoon in her contribution, this Government has basically continued with the same policy that was adopted by the Labor Government in those three years. The task of the Labor Government was, of course, much more difficult because the pension increase from 1 9 per cent to 24 per cent of the average weekly earnings represented a much greater drain on the Government's resources at that time than would have been the case during the last three years of office of the present Government because in our commitment to lift pensions in this country to 25 per cent of the average weekly earnings we started off on a much lower base than this Government. It started off on a higher base and has essentially maintained that figure of about 24 percent.</inline></para>
          <para>Despite the differences which we may have in some other areas concerning pensions, such as the provision of supplementary benefits and, of course, the important issue which we are debating today, namely, twice yearly indexation for all pensions, a commonality of policy has developed because the relationship between the rate of pensions and the average weekly earnings remains the fundamental issue. If in fact a government is able to maintain pensions at a reasonable percentage of the average weekly earnings then at least it is providing to the pensioners of this country a guaranteed base income. I have no doubt that as time goes by the figure of 25 per cent will gradually be lifted even higher. I hope that when that happens both major political parties in this country will accept this principle. I believe that the fact that this more common ground has been achieved has been generally applauded by the Australian people. There has been a desire amongst most members of the federal parliament to see the position gradually evolve to such a stage. The continual battles and arguments that were so divisive during the 1960s and up until the 1970s in fact divided the Australian community. We have been able largely to overcome that divisiveness. This, of course, does not in any way detract from our concern about the fact that twice yearly indexation has been removed by the Government. </para>
          <para>I believe that what we have seen in the past few weeks is one of the most distressing things that has happened in the Australian political scene in recent years. It is the result primarily pf the efforts in Tasmania of one person, namely, the honourable member for Franklin, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Goodluck,</inline> who for his own selfish political ends, has brought back into the Australian political scene this whole debate about pensions. He has re-introduced the political arguments and created divisions within the Australian community, within his own party and within this Parliament purely for his own selfish political gain. I do not for one moment apologise for what I am saying because he had the opportunity in this Parliament when the legislation went through some time last year to stand up and be counted, as he puts it, and to cross the floor and vote with the Opposition. But he did not do that. I will say that at least one member of the Liberal Party who is sitting in this Chamber tonight- <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Townley-</inline> was prepared to do that. But I must say that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Townley</inline> has not gone about stirring up political divisions in this country in the manner that his colleague, the honourable member for Franklin, has done in Tasmania. I believe that the honourable member is guilty of bringing back into this country divisions which we thought had disappeared from the Australian political scene and that it has been done deliberately for selfish political ends. I believe that he stands condemned for what he has done. </para>
          <para>I do not for one moment dispute that people are concerned about this matter. All of us in this place have been concerned about the decision by the Government to eliminate the twice yearly indexation of pensions. We believe that was a mistake but I do not think that anybody has endeavoured to take political advantage of it as an individual. More importantly, the actions of the honourable member for Franklin and his talk about introducing a private member's Bill has, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Grimes</inline> has said in this place today, raised expectations among hundreds of thousands of pensioners in this country that the honourable member knew before he began that he could not fulfil. He knew before he started that there was no chance of that, as the Minister said in the debate in this place today. He knew, this Parliament knew and everybody who is interested in politics in Australia knew that he could not possibly fulfil what he was undertaking to do. </para>

It is great stuff as the public does not like political parties. We know that they are not perfect and we know that they get a poor response in the community.

            <para>-The past few minutes in the Senate tonight have certainly been very revealing. At last we have found out exactly what the Australian Labor Party was on about in raising this matter of public importance. It did not move the motion before us out of concern for the pensioners in Australia; rather, it moved the motion to raise the question of the honourable member for Franklin, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Goodluck,</inline> and the motion that for some time he has been talking about moving. In particular, this has been done to embarrass <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Goodluck</inline> politically in Tasmania. It is as simple as that. It was a very simple political exercise and had nothing at all to do with the welfare of Australians, least of all the welfare of Australian pensioners. Having said that, I turn to the major concern which we on this side of the House have for the old age pensioners, the underprivileged people of Australia. Since coming to office in 1975 the Government has raised substantially the level of benefits paid to pensioners and other welfare recipients. </para>

          </continue>
          <para class="block">Government came to power. The Opposition is talking about average weekly earnings, so let us look at that. In December 1975 average weekly earnings were $167.50.' Today they are $221.10. That represents an increase of only 32 per cent. So the age pensioner has received an increase of 37.3 per cent and average weekly earnings have increased by 32 per cent. But what about the rate of inflation? We will talk about that. As a result of the disastrous policies in the Hayden Budget in the Whitlam years, the consumer price index rose rapidly in 1976. Its rate of escalation slowed down substantially in 1977 and has slowed down to a very low rate this year. Because of those Whitlam policies, the overall rate of inflation since the Whitlam Government was in office has been 34.7 per cent. That means that the age pensioner has received a substantially greater increase in pension than the increase in the inflation rate. He has also done substantially better than the average weekly wage earner. That is a fact of life. The Opposition apparently does not recognise that. </para>

              <para>- There seems to be some very great concern about that situation. Let us look at it. For the benefit of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McLaren</inline> let us compare December 1970 with December 1978. We find that the age pension has increased in that period by 243 per cent whereas the average weekly wage earner's income has increased by only 168 per cent. During that time the rate of inflation has increased 126 per cent so that, in effect, the age pensioner has done twice as well when we look at the rate of inflation. That measures the total improvement in the position. Let us follow that up with one or two other small items. </para>

              <para>-In 1975 it was just on 23 per cent. What is it today? Under the Fraser Government it is 24.1 per cent. Let us look at the logic of the Opposition's argument. Opposition members are trying to say that the pensioner has not been given proper consideration in the community because of the so-called negligence of the Fraser Government. But, in fact, there has been a substantial increase in real terms in the percentage of the pension when compared to the average weekly earnings. What is more, there has been a substantial drop in the rate of inflation in the last three years which means that the rate of adjustment is not so necessary. Let us consider the plight of the pensioners during those Whitlam years with inflation at 20 per cent per annum, when we found that, in fact, every time pensioners turned around in the supermarket the prices had gone up again. No wonder the pensioners needed the indexation which was brought in under the Fraser Government in 1976. The need is not there today, with inflation brought under control by this Government. Consequently, we find a very substantial difference by virtue of the superior management of this country under the Fraser Government. </para>

            <para>- The Senate is debating an urgency motion moved by my colleague, the shadow Minister for Social Security, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Grimes,</inline> on the matter of twice yearly pension indexation. I want to say a number of things about <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Messner</inline> who has just sat down. I can remember debating the Social Services Amendment Bill in October of last year when I mentioned that the majority of people, and particularly those on low incomes, measured the inflation rate in the market place, that is in the supermarket, in the butcher shop, when the telephone bill came in- if they were lucky enough to be able to afford a telephone- when the electricity bill arrived and on all those occasions when it was necessary to suddenly spend some money out of a restricted budget. At that time <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Messner</inline> interjected on my speech and said that that was a lot of rubbish. He said that we do not measure the inflation rate in the supermarket. I assure the honourable senator that hundreds of thousands of people on low incomes- that is those on pensions and in receipt of government benefits- do measure the inflation rate when they go to buy tea, coffee, a loaf of bread or a pound of butter. These are the essential things. With the Government's proud boast of the reduction in the inflation rate we have not seen a decrease in the prices of goods to the consumers. In fact we have seen a very large increase in the profits being made by a very few people. </para>

                <inline font-weight="bold">- Senator Walters</inline>mentions the price of eggs. I remind the honourable senator of her speech on the Social Service Amendment Bill last year when she suddenly became very conscious of the increase in the price of a loaf of bread. Obviously she is no longer concerned with the increases in the price of bread or the cost of the provision of electricity or essential services. She is not concerned that many people in our community are on such a strict budget that they have to limit the number of letters that they write. People have to limit the number of bus trips they make because not all pensioners in all States are lucky enough to be provided with free travel. A lot of people rely on <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Walters,</inline> as they rely on me, in this place to put forward their case. Frankly, I do not think she is doing a very good job of it. </para>
            </talk.start>
          </continue>
          <para>Some very important statistics come out from time to time and they raise questions in my mind, perhaps because I am conscious of the needs of people. I do not believe that this Government is conscious of those needs. I was very concerned when I read in this week's newspaper that Australia has one of the highest suicide rates in the world. One has to ask: From which group of people in our community do those in the high suicide rate come? Are these people low income earners, pensioners, rich people or poor people? Are they people who do not have adequate housing or are they people who have too many responsibilities and the Government is not recognising their needs? What sort of people are they, and are they people who have a need for governments to care for them? Is the situation that this Government is so preoccupied with the needs of this disastrous economic situation and with bringing down the inflation rate that it no longer cares for people? If that is the situation then it is time this Government stood up and was counted, as Government senators in this place should stand up and be counted. It may be interesting to know that the suicide rate in Australia is higher than it is in the United Kingdom, Japan, New Zealand, Canada and other comparable western nations. In fact, until recently the suicide rate in Australia was even higher than that in the United States. </para>

              <para>- I do not have the capacity for research because the Government has limited the number of people I can employ and how much research my office can cope with. The Government does not provide me with adequate facilities, with room or with staff to conduct all the research that I would like to conduct. Nor does it provide the Opposition with enough staff. Very many children are involved when we are talking about low income earners. When we are talking about pensioners' benefits we are also talking about children. These are children of parents who are in receipt of unemployment benefits or who are in receipt of benefits of some sort from this Government. I remind all honourable senators that this is the Year of the Child and there are many children in Australia who are hungry, who do not have adequate housing and who do not even have adequate clothing. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Walters</inline> may smile. I hope that people listening to this broadcast are aware that she is smiling because I do not believe that her attitude is one which expresses the concern that should be felt by a person who has been elected to this place to cater for the needs of the people of Australia. </para>

              <para>-As I have already explained, the Government is a little bit mean, not only in relation to the recipients of benefits but also in relation to members of parliament. I am simply saying that in this International Year of the Child there are in Australia many children who are hungry and who are not being housed or clothed properly because their parents happen to be in receipt of pensioner benefits from this Government. We have seen a dramatic increase in the cost of living over the last two to three years. We have seen a gradual reduction in benefits payable, and we have seen that people can no longer afford to provide their families with the positive things that they need. When I say 'positive things' I include housing, food and clothing. </para>

            <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Messner</inline>said that age pensioners had had their benefits increased at a rate faster than that of inflation. That is a big deal, and I am sure that the pensioners will appreciate <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Messner's</inline> contribution to this debate. I did not, because I did not think he made a contribution at all. I think that his arguments were spurious. The arguments that he raised were less factual than those that should have been raised in this place and in a debate such as this. I believe that the present Government does have a responsibility to stand up to the pre-election promise that it made in 1975, namely, that it would maintain twice-yearly indexation of pensions. That promise was repeated in 1977, and it was one of the first of the promises to be broken by the Liberal and National Country Party Government after it was elected. </para>
          <para>Honourable Senators opposite may not agree with all of the comments that I have made. That is their prerogative. I do not believe all of the remarks that they have made, and I certainly do not agree with them. Nevertheless, the fact of the matter is that we have a great many pensioners in the community who rely on us as their elected representatives to look after their needs, and this Government is not catering for the needs of people. </para>

          <para class="block">Coleman by way of interjection that when we have inflation prices rise. That is what inflation is all about. It is a matter of limiting those rising prices to a moderate rate and keeping inflation under control. If prices were falling we would not have inflation. Surely <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Coleman</inline> can understand that. It is not a difficult concept to follow, even for a member of the Labor Party. It is a simple proposition. At one stage during the Labor Party's administration, over a period of 6 months, prices were rising at the rate of 19 per cent per annum. </para>

              <para>-That is right, in 1974. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Coleman</inline> made it perfectly clear that she does not understand what the arguments are about. Then she had the audacity to say at the end of her speech that children in this country are not clothed and are going hungry because their parents are in receipt of pensioner benefits from this Government. Let us look at what the Labor Party did. The maximum rate of benefits given to pensioners in Australia by the Labor Party was granted in the quarter ending 1 2 June 1 97 5 when the standard single rate pension was 23.2 per cent of average weekly earnings. For the quarter ending 9 December 1978, under the present Government the standard single pension benefit was 24. 1 per cent of average weekly earnings. It is perfectly clear that pensioners are receiving more money in real terms under the present Government than they did under the Labor Government. Yet <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Coleman</inline> has the audacity to say to the people of Australia that there are children in this country who are hungry and unclothed because their parents are in receipt of pensioner benefits from this Government. What did the Government of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Coleman's</inline> political persuasion do for the people. Inflation ran at a rate of 19 per cent, which absolutely destroyed the savings of so many pensioners in this country. It sent them broke. These people had for many years saved their money and banked it in order to secure their future. Their savings were destroyed by that Government in only three years. Honourable senators opposite should never forget that, because the people of Australia will never forget it. </para>

          </continue>
          <para>It is quite misleading for the Opposition to be talking in this debate about indexation questions apart from inflation levels. During this debate Labor Party senators have been talking so much rot about all this. What is the meaning of indexation? What we are talking about under indexation is applying the consumer price index to pensions. Let there be no doubt that many pensioners do not spend much money- in fact, some of them do not spend any money at all- on a number of items which are included in the consumer price index. For instance, pensioners get free public transport, but that is not taken into account when their pensions are indexed. However, such items are taken into account in the consumer price index. So pensioners gain a benefit to that extent. </para>
          <para>The Conciliation and Arbitration Commission has appreciated this position in regard to the consumer price index so far as wage earners are concerned. As honourable senators would well know, frequently the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission has not passed on to wage earners the full consumer price index for the particular period under consideration. Under the present Government pensioners are receiving every year the full CPI increase. That is far better than the Labor Government ever did. The Labor Government had the opportunity to take similar measures for three years- let there be no doubt about that- but it did not get around to doing anything. Under the present Government the pensioners in Australia are being given the full CPI increase every year. There is no doubt that they are far in advance of the wage earners of the country because they are receiving full indexation. </para>
          <para>I am not saying that I would not like to see their pensions indexed every six months. Maybe that should be the situation, but we have to achieve a balanced position. When the Ministers put forward their budget bids for the 1978 Budget, the Government was faced with the prospect of having a deficit of $6,000m. So it started to economise. It tried to cut down on government expenditure in as many areas as it possibly could. Ultimately it reduced its expenditure to produce a deficit of $4,500m. That is an enormous deficit. The taxpayers of Australia have to find this money. Opposition senators are always willing to spend money. They never find an opportunity to balance the economy and to come to some reasonable arrangement. When the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Howard)</inline> was faced with this situation of suffering a deficit of $4,500m the taxpayers of Australia faced a burden of finding about $ 1 ,600m extra in revenue. We did not do  that by increasing inflation. We did not print the money. The taxpayers were told that this additional tax was to be imposed on them and that they would have to find the extra money to fund these benefits for the people of Australia. Opposition senators want to spend another $80m on the pensioners. They want no mucking around. They just want to spend another $80m on the pensioners of Australia. That would give the pensioners of Australia an advantage which they would be the first to acknowledge they do not need. </para>
          <para>So long as this Government keeps inflation under control the pensioners are quite happy with their pensions being indexed annually. I have spoken to many pensioners and they have confirmed that view to me. So long as the Government of Australia keeps the inflation rate under control there is no need for pensions to be indexed other than annually. All that members of the Opposition have done today is to try to raise a political issue to embarrass a couple of fellows in Tasmania who have a personal belief about a particular matter with which the Government disagrees. When honourable senators opposite were in power none of them had the courage to say anything contrary to their government. I wanted to talk about what we could do in relation to the inflation rate and the - </para>

        </motion>
        <para class="block">I move this motion because of several interesting aspects of this report this year and because of its importance to many former government employees who are being paid compensation for injuries received while at work. The first thing that worries me is the qualifications made by the Commissioner in the introduction to his report concerning the nature and the collection of statistics relating to payments under this Act. In recent years one has not seen such a reference. Quite suddenly this year, the Commissioner, in the introduction to his report, is expressing his concern at the difficulties he has had in collecting proper statistics. I quote from page 1 : </para>
      </motionnospeech>
      <quote>
        <para>In many cases . . . departments and authorities have omitted to include weekly payments under sub-section 45 (2a) in their returns. </para>
      </quote>
      <para class="block">Incidentally, these are payments of compensation during the first 26 weeks of incapacity. He cites another case as follows: </para>
      <quote>
        <para>In the case of one of the larger statutory authoritieswhere statistics are recorded by computer- serious problems arose. The authority's initial return was obviously incorrect. Inaccuracies occurred through: failure to refer all accident statistics, in certain areas of the authority's administrations . . . failure to vary the total incapacity rates fed into the computer when national wage case increases occurred; failure to record statistics for cases that were determined outside the authority's administration . . . </para>
      </quote>
      <para class="block">Finally, in his introduction he heavily qualifies the statistics available in this very important area. On page 4 the Commissioner reflects some of the concerns which are expressed by many of the unions whose members are being paid compensation under this Act and whose lawyers are trying to assist them under this Act. He refers to the delays and to the staffing difficulties which he has because of the very small staff directly involved in the office of the Commissioner. He says that although part of the staff are engaged in compensation work, he has no direct control over them; that most of the departments and authorities do not engage full time compensation officers; and that officers responsible for processing claims are not very experienced and delays often occur. Here we have the Commissioner admitting that the statistics are not too good and that things are not too good with the staff of the office and in the administration of this legislation. </para>
      <para>All this is aggravated, if I may say so briefly, by another factor to which he refers. On page 8 he refers to the fact, which is well known to all unions with public service members, that the rates for employees paid under the Compensation (Commonwealth Government Employees) Act 1971 have not been increased since 1 September 1976. Despite inflation and despite previous Administrations increasing the sums annually, these people who are paid compensation for an injury or for the death of a spouse and who frequently have only a small amount to live on have not had an increase since September 1976. The Commonwealth rates are the second lowest in Australia. The only rates that are lower are in Victoria and the Government of that State is about to increase them, probably because there is an election in the offing. So the Commonwealth is paying very low rates which have not been increased since 1 976, the office is not working efficiently and the statistics are not accurate. I believe that this is not a very satisfactory situation. It is not a very satisfactory way to treat injured employees. It is not a very satisfactory report at all. I believe that at some time we should have debate and a proper investigation into this matter when we can look at the report properly. I seek leave to continue my remarks. </para>

        <para class="block">I say at the outset that it is not my intention to speak at length on the report because I have not had the opportunity to study it in detail in the time that has been available to me. I know that the  Chairman  of the Silver Jubilee Commemorative Organisation, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Harry</inline> M. Miller, has about one million other worries concerning him at the moment which are far more important and greater to him than the Silver Jubilee Commemorative Organisation. We all know that in addition to this job that he has been performing on behalf of the Government he has been retained by the Government as an adviser for the Australian bicentenary celebrations, which are to take place in 1988, that he has been appointed by the Government as a member of the board of Qantas Airways Ltd and that he has also been appointed by the Government as a member of the Australian Meat and Livestock Corporation. In view of the multiplicity of tasks that he is performing on behalf of the Government in addition to his own private interests, perhaps he has bitten off to much. . </para>
        <para>Although only a short amount of time has been available for me to read this report I regret to say that frankly I regard it as a bit of a joke. It reads like a third class primary school essay. However, as I have only quickly perused the report, I will not dwell on that aspect of it. For a few laughs and a bit of a giggle I would suggest that honourable senators look at some aspects of it. Having made that brief comment, I say that I am more concerned with aspects relating to the financial arrangements that have been set out in the report. For instance, the following statement is made on page 1 of the report: </para>
        <quote>
          <para>Establishment of the Organisation was announced by the Prime Minister in a Ministerial statement to the House of Representatives on 23 February 1977. He said the Government was pleased to have secured the agreement of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Harry</inline> M. Miller to serve in an honorary capacity as  Chairman  of the Organisation, and added: ' <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Miller</inline> is admirably suited to this task, being a leading theatrical producer and an outstanding personality in Australian business and cultural life'. </para>
        </quote>
        <para class="block">If we turn to the preamble to the report we see that the report is addressed to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Chaney</inline> in his then capacity as Minister for Administrative Services and is signed by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Harry</inline> M. Miller, the  Chairman  of the Organisation. The third last paragraph from the bottom of page 2 of the report states: </para>
        <quote>
          <para>The Federal Government authorised an allocation of $500,000 from the' Department of Administrative Services' vote to enable the Silver Jubilee Organisation to undertake its nation-wide activities. This sum is roughly equivalent to 0.035 of 1 cent per head of population. </para>
        </quote>
        <para class="block">Nowhere else in this report is any other figure of expenditure referred to. When one reads this report one assumes that the whole activities of the Silver Jubilee Organisation involved the expenditure of a mere $500,000. Over the two years since the establishment of the Organisation in February 1977 my colleague <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McLaren</inline> and I have engaged in a study of this Organisation during sittings of the Estimates committees. </para>
        <para class="block">If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Chaney</inline> likes to refer to the explanatory notes that were sent to us during sittings of the Estimates committees and if he likes to ask the Parliamentary Library to conduct a survey of the expenditure of this Organisation, as I requested the Library to do today, he will find that in 1976-77 the administrative expenses of the Organisation were $45,058, that the expenditure in the program of events was $75,000, that there were additional administrative expenses amounting to $14,594 and that there was a Commonwealth contribution to the Silver Jubilee Appeal of $2m. In 1977-78 the administrative expenses were $278,102, the expenditure on the program of events amounted to $425,000 and the additional administrative expenses amounted to $283,549. Also there was an expenditure on Silver Jubilee Medals of $61,578 in 1976-77 and $1,759 in 1977-78. All told there was an expenditure of $2,196,230 in 1976-77 and an expenditure of $988,410 in 1977-78. There was a total expenditure of $3, 1 84,640. The report has the audacity to suggest that a mere $500,000 was all that was involved so far as expenditure was concerned. </para>
        <para>If we turn to page 10 of the report we see the following statement under the heading 'The Silver Jubilee Train': </para>
        <quote>
          <para>Agreement was reached with the Premier of NSW, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Wran,</inline> and the Minister for Transport, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Cox,</inline> for the NSW Public Transport Commission to undertake the extensive work necessary to refit the coaches, an operation carried out at the Commission's Everleigh Carriage Workshops in Sydney. </para>
        </quote>
        <para class="block">When one reads that one would think that this work was done gratis by the Public Transport Commission of New South Wales. However, I want to draw the attention of the Senate to an answer given to me by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Chaney</inline> on 27 September 1978 in response to question No. 130. In his reply <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Chaney</inline> said: </para>
        <quote>
          <para>The Royal Silver Jubilee Exhibition train was specially fitted out by the Public Transport Commission of New South Wales to meet specifications of the Silver Jubilee Commemorative Organisation. The Organisation has paid to the Commission the sum of $250,000 in respect of the fitting out costs and running costs. Other amounts totalling $146,841 have been paid to the Queensland Railways, Victorian Railways, Australian National Railways and Western Australian Government Railways in respect of running costs incurred on those rail systems. </para>
        </quote>
        <para class="block">That answer involves a sum of nearly $500,000, which is practically the total amount that the Organisation tries to give the impression was the cost to the Australian taxpayer to organise things. Frankly I think it is a bit of a scandal that a report of this nature should be presented to the Australian people in this manner. All told, on the figures that I have worked out and those which have been provided to me by the Parliamentary Library, it cost $3,184,640 to run the organisation over those 2 years and the appeal that was launched collected a total of $5,400,000 of which the Commonwealth itself contributed $2m. When one takes into account the amount that was paid by the Commonwealth to the railways authorities throughout Australia one finds that the total expenditure- on my mathematics- is not $500,000 as is set out in this report but $3,571,480. 1 regret to say that I think that the exercise was nowhere near as successful or as popular as this report makes out and whilst it is said by the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Malcolm Fraser)</inline> that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Miller</inline> gave his services in a voluntary capacity the fact is, from the unhidden figures alone, that it has cost the Commonwealth and the Australian taxpayers considerable amounts of money. If ever there were reports that should be referred to a Senate standing committee for investigation and report to the Senate, I suggest that this is one of them. I view this matter with some concern and I make those comments because I think it is important that if any of these organisations are being set up by the Government, ultimately to report to the Parliament, they should contain factual information. I seek leave to continue my remarks. </para>

          <para>-by leave-I had intended to speak on the subject in any event in a slightly different vein from <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McClelland</inline> because I was a little critical of the report but I must say that since listening to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McClelland</inline> my heart feels a little lighter. I am particularly gratified to hear of the substantial sum of money that was spent by the Government for the Queensland railways and others, presumably for providing substantial employment by government expenditure. I think that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McClelland</inline> probably has laid out a quite impressive case for why the Silver Jubilee celebrations were quite beneficial to this country.

Miller's stewardship. As one reads on I think it becomes clearer that we are getting an account of his stewardship but not in the first person. I took the trouble to do something I do not normally do. I read through and looked for the trivial aspects of this report and I found that in the first five pages Harry M. Miller is mentioned nine times. Throughout the report he is in fact mentioned 19 times. The areas in which he is not mentioned are interesting in themselves. I would like to know from the Minister whether this is a report from <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Miller</inline> on <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Miller</inline> or whether this is a report from the  Chairman  of the Silver Jubilee Commemorative Organisation, as the frontispiece would seem to indicate, on the Silver Jubilee Commemorative Organisation. If it is a report on the Organisation I find it slightly obnoxious because it has actually been used for <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Harry</inline> M. Miller. I draw the attention of the Senate to page 1 which states: </para>

          <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Miller</inline>is mentioned three times on the first page. That is the sort of thing that makes me curious about whether this is a report by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Miller</inline> on the Organisation or a report by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Miller</inline> on <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Miller.</inline> I think that we probably need a report from the Organisation given the fact that government funds were involved. If it is a report from the organisation. I suggest that this is not the sort of report that ought to come to Parliament and that should be pointed out. It is certainly not the sort of report on which public funds should be spent for printing. </para>
        <para>It is quite interesting to glance through the report. One finds some rather curious quirks in the references to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Miller.</inline> For a few pages after page 1 he is referred to as <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Miller.</inline> He is referred to in very favourable terms and undoubtedly he did a good job. At page 3 the report states: </para>
        <quote>
          <para>While the Royal party was in Australia <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Miller</inline> held a number of discussions with the Queen's Private Secretary, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Martin</inline> Charteris, about the Organisation's plans. <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Martin</inline> promised to help wherever possible and his subsequent assistance was of great benefit. </para>
        </quote>
        <para>As one reads on through the report one finds that it was very beneficial that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Miller</inline> established this sort of rapport with <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Martin</inline> Charteris. But if one reads on a little further one finds something that sounds a little more in the interests of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Miller</inline> than the interests of the Silver Jubilee. At page 4 the report states: </para>
        <quote>
          <para>
            <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Miller</inline>led the Organisation's staff in the planning and arrangement of each of these projects, all of which required a great deal of conceptual and administrative work. </para>
        </quote>
        <para class="block">Further down on page 4 the report refers to a subject of greater controversy which has been raised in the Senate on previous occasions. It states: </para>
        <quote>
          <para>As a number of its major projects involved the need for assistance by authorities in the United Kingdom the <inline font-weight="bold">Chairman, Mr Miller,</inline> decided to make a brief visit to London. </para>
        </quote>
        <para class="block">That visit has been the subject of some questioning in the Senate over a period of time with some questions being raised about expenditure and so on. I have not participated in that questioning but I doubt the wisdom of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Miller</inline> writing a report on himself in which he gives the sort of outline of his activities that he has done. It sounds a little bit like a justification in reply to questions that have been raised concerning the cost of that visit. At page 5 we are told: </para>
        <quote>
          <para>In a visit lasting nine days, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Miller</inline> held discussions with officials of the Royal Household and the British Government relating to the proposals for the Royal Silver Jubilee Exhibition train and the Royal Coaches Exhibition. In addition, he and his officers set up plans with Capital Radio, London, for the series of Jubilee radio broadcasts to Australia, had a number of meetings with senior officers of the Central Office of Information and representatives of the London Celebrations Committee for the Queen's Silver Jubilee, investigated numerous aspects of the British Jubilee program for possible adaptation in Australia, and represented the interests of the Australian National Queen's Silver Jubilee Appeal Committee at meetings convened by the United Kingdom Appeal Organisation. </para>
          <para>While in London <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Miller</inline> also held a major news conference at Australia House during which he outlined the Organisation 's plans to representatives of the British and Australian media. </para>
        </quote>
        <para class="block">That is good because that give some sort of indication of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Miller's</inline> stewardship. The context in which it is given is not so good. It would have been more helpful if, when following up all those points, this report was not quite so glowing in its praise of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Miller's</inline> individual and personal involvement in a way which one suspects has a considerable bearing on <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Miller's</inline> business future in this country and his prospects of success in other areas. The report then goes on for a number of pages. First of all it deals with Operation Jubilee Bonfire and this takes up a number of pages. There is no mention of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Miller</inline> so perhaps he was not involved in that. At page 8 under the heading 'Radio Broadcasts' we find reiterated:   . . during his visit to London <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Harry</inline> M. Miller- </para>

        <para class="block">The content of the report comes across to me as just a little strange. Frankly, as a report from an organisation to Parliament it sounds altogether too much like an advertisement for <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Miller.</inline> Once or twice he is referred to as the <inline font-weight="bold">Chairman, Mr Harry</inline> M. Miller, but generally he is referred to a <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Miller</inline> or <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Harry</inline> M. Miller or sometimes just Harry M. Miller when he could quite easily be referred to as the  Chairman.  I find that when one reads the report the impression that is given is not of a straight report to Parliament but of a public relations exercise. I have no objection to any of the projects that were mounted for the Silver Jubilee. I think that probably our Silver Jubilee celebrations were quite encouraging, indeed very successful, and I think Australians generally supported them. I am a loyalist, not a republican. I declare my interests there. But if this is the sort of report that it appears from its front cover to be, I do not find it satisfactory. </para>
        <para>I just draw one further particular point which is part of this subject to the attention of the Minister. Again <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Miller</inline> does not receive a mention under 'Operation Jubilee Salute', the 'Silver Jubilee National Essay Contest', 'Community Events' or 'Sporting Activities'. But under the heading 'The Silver Jubilee Appeal for Young Australians' we find these words: </para>
        <quote>
          <para>Several events in the Jubilee Organisation's program were conceived and arranged specifically to assist the Appeal. Among them the most important were the Royal Variety Performance at the Sydney Opera House and the Countdown Silver Jubilee Australian Top 20 Album, an LP record containing music by Australia's leading pop groups and singers. </para>
        </quote>
        <para class="block">At the end of the report you are not very surprised when you find that the two most important events under this heading were produced by Harry M. Miller. The Royal Variety Performance, we are told, was 'produced by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Harry</inline> M. Miller and directed by Peter Batey'. I smile at that point because there appears to be some doubt as to whether Peter Batey is a mister or not whereas there is no doubt at all about <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Harry</inline> M. Miller. The other event, the Countdown Silver Jubilee Australian Top 20 Album, is said to be 'an enterprise supported and assisted by a large section of the Australian entertainment industry and conceived by the Jubilee Organisation', etcetera. </para>
        <para class="block">The document further states: </para>
        <quote>
          <para>The idea was developed by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Harry</inline> M. Miller and Ian Meldrum, the talent co-ordinator for the Australian Broadcasting Commission's national TV program 'Countdown'. </para>
        </quote>
        <para class="block">What I have been saying might all have sounded a little trite, a little trivial, but frankly, when I received the report I was a little worried about the sort of report that was being introduced into the Senate. If it is the report that it appears to be, a report from the  Chairman  on his stewardship, I suggest that he might have used the first person I' instead of modestly using <inline font-weight="bold">'Mr Miller'</inline> or Harry M. Miller'. If it is in fact a report from the Silver Jubilee Commemorative Organisation then I think it really gives altogether too much notoriety to one individual when it is quite clear that many people, including officers of the Department and of the Government, made a major contribution. Their contribution is not detailed in this report. </para>

            <para>- It was to do with <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Harry</inline> M. Miller. He is the person who is the subject of the debate tonight on this report. As <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Chaney</inline> 's colleague, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Martin,</inline> pointed out, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Harry</inline> M. Miller's name predominates the report. It mentions how he was elected to serve in an honorary capacity. As <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Chaney</inline> said to me in his answer, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Harry</inline> M. Miller was serving in an honorary capacity. What the senators here tonight want to know and what the public at large wants to know is what expenses did this person incur while serving in an honorary capacity during the term that he was looking after this matter. That is what we want to know. There is nothing in that final report to show how much <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Harry</inline> M. Miller received in out-of-pocket expenses. </para>
          </talk.start>
        </continue>
        <para>I would like to know, as well as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Douglas</inline> McClelland and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Martin</inline> and the public at large, how much of that $3m of public funds did <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Harry</inline> M. Miller incur in out-of-pocket expenses. I pointed that out in my question to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Chaney</inline> on 21 November. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Harry</inline> M. Miller incurred expenses of $4,500 for a weekend in Paris. Yet <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Chaney</inline> said to me in his answer that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Harry</inline> M. Miller was serving in an honorary capacity. I would not mind serving a government department in an honorary capacity if I could get my fare to Paris and return paid and whilst there be able to incur expenses of $4,500. 1 would not be able to spend it but obviously <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Harry</inline> M. Miller was able to. This is the concern of the people who have spoken here tonight. It is not only Labor senators who are questioning this. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Kathy</inline> Martin is also. </para>
        <para>She went on to say that she was rather pleased when she read the report to find that funds had been made available and that facilities had been made available by State governments for this </para>
        <para class="block">Jubilee Train. She was pleased about the employment that it would have created. I am sure that the people who were engaged in manning the Jubilee Train would not have got a minute percentage of the funds that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Harry</inline> M. Miller did. </para>
        <para>I do not think I need to say any more because I am sure that when we consider the supplementary estimates we on this side will pursue this matter again if we have not been given a detailed account of the expenditure incurred by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Harry</inline> M. Miller. My colleague <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Douglas</inline> McClelland has pointed out that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Harry</inline> M. Miller seems to be the hot favourite of this Government for being appointed to just about every vacancy that occurs on any board, whether it be Qantas Airways Ltd, the Australian Meat and Livestock Corporation, the Silver Jubilee Commemorative Organisation or whatever else. The Government goes first to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Harry</inline> M. Miller for his expertise. Of course, if we have read the Press in recent days I think that most of us would believe that he does not have much financial expertise. I am one person who objects to the use of public moneys by a person like <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Harry</inline> M. Miller. </para>
        <para>
          <inline font-weight="bold">Senator CHANEY</inline>(Western AustraliaMinister for Aboriginal Affairs)- by leave- I would hate to think that this debate is the final washup of the Silver Jubilee Celebrations because it would leave one with a very bad impression of what they were about. I would like to refer briefly to the statement which was made by the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Malcolm Fraser)</inline> in February 1977. This statement led up to the celebrations and finally to this report which we have before us. The Prime Minister said at that time that the Government had considered a number of proposals for special events. He detailed other things that were happening, including the establishment of a national appeal, which incidentally explains the $2m that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Douglas</inline> McClelland was talking about. It was a donation to the national appeal. It was established quite separately from any organisation with which <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Miller</inline> was associated. In any event, having outlined things that were being done by the Government and stating the desire of the Government for a visit by royal personages and all the rest of it, the Prime Minister went on to say that he was pleased to announce that the Government had secured the agreement of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Harry</inline> M. Miller to serve in an honorary capacity as  chairman  of the organisation. The Prime Minister continued: </para>
        <quote>
          <para>
            <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Miller</inline>is admirably suited to this task, being a leading theatrical producer and an outstanding personality in Australian business and cultural life. He has generously placed his talents at the service of this and preceding governments. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Miller</inline> will be assisted by a small team of skilled personnel to help to plan and arrange selected activities. It is the Government's earnest desire that  Her  Majesty's visit to Australia and the Silver Jubilee year commemoration be a happy and memorable one for the Queen and for all Australians. </para>
        </quote>
        <para class="block">I remind the Senate that I think that objective was achieved. In fact, in a remarkably short time a substantial program of celebratory events was organised around Australia. They are detailed, to the extent that they were the obligation of this organisation, in this report. I remind honourable senators opposite that most of the events provided for participation by the great mass of Australian people. Items related to the monarchy were displayed around Australia. That explains the story of the trains that was raised by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Douglas</inline> McClelland. That was not just for the high and mighty of this country; it was an attempt to expose to the people of Australia some of the historic memorabilia of the monarchy. I remind the Senate of the massive participation by Boy Scouts and Girl Guides in the bonfire exhibition. It was quaint and old fashioned; perhaps it was just the sort of thing people did in Drake's day. I would have thought it was a rather notable way to involve young people with the Silver Jubilee celebrations. I think that these sorts of things, promoted by a show business personality like <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Miller,</inline> were remarkably successful. They were enjoyed by the mass of the Australian people. I believe that we should all be acknowledging, with some gratitude, the fact that he brought some flair and talent to the celebrations. </para>
        <para>I would say to honourable senators opposite, and indeed to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Martin,</inline> that perhaps they have become too used to reading reports written by public servants, including the reports to which they sometimes append their own names. The dry as dust terminology that we have learnt to use and read is not the terminology you are going to get when you ask for a report from a leading theatrical producer. I suggest that the one thing on which the Senate can be quite clear is that this is genuinely a report from the person from whom it purports to come and that is a very welcome change. </para>

            <para>- If I could proceed without the assistance of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Grimes</inline> I might be able to sit down a little more quickly. The financing of the Silver Jubilee commemorative program where it was under the direction of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Miller</inline> was by means of a trust account established under section 62aa of the Audit Act and financed by appropriations in 1976-77 and 1977-78 for a total amount of $500,000. Moneys received from the revenue-raising events were also credited to the trust account. Expenditures to be made from the trust account, after authorisation by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Miller,</inline> were processed in accordance with the provisions of the Audit Act and finance regulations and directions. Moneys to be paid to the trust account in respect of the revenue-raising events within the program were also processed in accordance with the provisions of the Audit Act and finance regulations and directions by the staff of the Department of Administrative Services. Details of all trust account transactions- this is a matter that perhaps honourable senators would be interested to know- are held by the Department of Administrative Services. So there has been proper and normal accounting of the trust account transactions. No doubt that detailed information is available although I do not have it with me in the Senate this evening. </para>

        <para>The point made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Douglas</inline> McClelland on an item of $2m is very simply explained. A quite separate organisation was established under the name of the Queen Elizabeth Silver Jubilee Appeal which was under the chairmanship of <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Ian</inline> McClennan. That was to establish a commemorative trust, and as I understand the position, although I do not have the detailed figures before me, that $2m was the Commonwealth's contribution to the trust and was not related at all to the activities of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Miller.</inline> With respect to the other items of expenditure referred to by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Douglas</inline> McClelland, for example, expenditure on trains, which I earlier indicated was related to carrying items around Australia for public exhibition, it is not known to me at the moment whether that came from the trust fund and was reimbursed from receipts. That is a matter which can be ascertained. </para>

            <para>- I am not doubting it. What I am saying is that it is not known to me tonight whether those funds came from the trust fund and were partly reimbursed by receipts from income-earning activities or whether they were funded separately by the Government in some other way. That is a matter which can be ascertained quite easily and I will follow it up. I think that in this matter it ought to be noted tonight, when there has been significant criticism both of the report and by implication, of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Miller,</inline> that as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Withers</inline> pointed out to the Estimates Committee on 2 May, the fact is that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Miller</inline> did not receive a salary for his work. He undertook a program which had to be organised on relatively short notice and he succeeded in organising a wide range of events that involved a great number of Australian people in the celebration of the Jubilee. It would be a pity if this debate overlooked those very important facts. </para>

          </motion>
          <para class="block">The purpose of this Bill is to provide for certain antitrust judgments of foreign courts not to be recognised and not to be enforceable in Australia. This is not the first occasion that efforts to enforce the antitrust laws of other countries have led to the introduction of a Bill into this Parliament. Honourable senators will recall that in 1976 the Foreign Proceedings (Prohibition of Certain Evidence) Act was passed to prevent Australian-based evidence from being used in foreign legal proceedings to which there was objection from the Australian point of view. That Act is not confined, as the present Bill is, to antitrust proceedings. However, as my predecessor, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Ellicott,</inline> explained in introducing the 1976 Bill, the need for it had arisen out of legal proceedings that were being taken in the United States of America under the antitrust legislation of that country. Those proceedings related to arrangements alleged to have been made in 1972 for the marketing of uranium. The proceedings included a grand jury inquiry and civil proceedings by the Westinghouse Corporation claiming some $7 billion from 29 United States and foreign uranium producers, including four Australian companies. </para>
          <para>
            <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Ellicott</inline>'s second reading speech in relation to the Foreign Proceedings (Prohibition of Certain Evidence) Bill also explained that in the proceedings I have just mentioned claims were being made that the antitrust and related laws of the United States had a greater extra-territorial operation than that generally conceded in international law, and beyond what other countries were prepared to concede in the proceedings. That was the reason for the enactment of the Foreign Proceedings (Prohibition of Certain Evidence) Act 1976, under which orders may be made on the basis of non-compliance by a foreign court with international law or comity, or on a need to protect our national interest. Two orders were made under the Act, and remade following the enactment of certain amendments to the Act. Both the orders related to the uranium marketing arrangements I have mentioned above, and were based on the need to protect our national interest. The orders have been effective in preventing the Australian-based evidence from being used for the purpose of the United States proceedings. </para>
          <para>I am pleased to be able to inform the Senate, moreover, that the grand jury inquiry into the uranium marketing arrangements has been concluded and that no proceedings by the United States Justice Department have been instituted against any Australian company in consequence of that inquiry. The civil proceedings in which the Westinghouse Corporation was claiming treble damages from the uranium producers are, however, still pending. In those proceedings nine non-United States defendants declined to enter appearances: They did this because they considered there were jurisdictional objections to the proceedings against them and that they might be taken to have waived those objections if they were to enter appearances: The effect of their not entering appearances has been the entry by the United States court of a default judgment against them. The amount of the judgment still has to be determined, but there are indications that that could be done in the near future. It can be assumed that the Westinghouse Corporation will then take whatever action is available to it to enforce the judgment. </para>
          <para>Whether a judgment of a foreign court is entitled to be recognised and enforced in Australia is, of course, a matter for Australian law. In general, two procedures for this are available. One is provided in the common law; the other is the subject of State and Territory legislation. At common law a foreign judgment cannot be directly enforced by execution, but, subject to certain qualifications, it may be recognised and found an action which could result in a judgment able to be so enforced. For that purpose, there is no requirement of reciprocal rights in the foreign country in respect of Australian judgments. </para>
          <para>Under the State and Territory legislation certain classes of foreign judgments may be registered in the State or Territory, and then directly enforced as if they were judgments of the local Supreme Court. However, with the exception of the South Australian legislation, the applicability of their provisions in relation to a judgment of a particular country is dependent on an order in council being made upon satisfaction that substantial reciprocity is assured from that country, and no such order in council has been made in respect of the United States of America. The </para>
          <para class="block">South Australian legislation provides for the court of a foreign country to be proclaimed as a court of reciprocal jurisdiction, but such a proclamation is not essential to the operation of the legislation, which is based rather on the rules of private international law and comity. </para>
          <para>Whether at common law or under the State or Territory legislation, the recognition and enforcement rights for foreign judgments are not unlimited. For example, judgments in proceedings in which the foreign court did not have jurisdiction are not recognised; nor are judgments that are contrary to public policy or of a penal nature. It would, however, be unsatisfactory that the defendants to the Westinghouse treble damages judgment should have to rely on those grounds in order to resist enforcement of that judgment. By the action it has already taken under the Foreign Proceedings (Prohibition of Certain Evidence) Act 1976, the Government has made clear its views that the Westinghouse proceedings are against our national interest. That being the position, it is desirable that legislative and executive action be taken which will leave no doubt that the judgment will not be recognised or enforced in Australia. </para>
          <para>Whilst the immediate need for the present Bill arises out of the default judgment the Westinghouse Corporation has obtained, the Bill does not in terms refer to that judgment. As in the case of the Foreign Proceedings (Prohibition of Certain Evidence) Act, the Bill provides for the making by the Attorney-General of orders. Such orders are to be in respect of particular antitrust judgments, and before making an order the Attorney-General is to be satisfied that there has been inconsistency with international law or comity or that his action is desirable to protect the national interest. I inform the Senate that when the Bill has become law it is my intention to make an order in respect of the default judgment of the Westinghouse Corporation to which I have referred, and to do so on the ground that such action is desirable to protect the national interest. Any order that is made under the proposed legislation will have to be tabled and it will be subject to disallowance by either House of Parliament. </para>
          <para>The Senate will recall that on 14 September last year, in answer to a question by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Young,</inline> I reported on the outcome of certain consultations that had just been had in Washington with the United States Attorney-General and representatives of his Department concerning the extraterritorial application of antitrust laws. I then indicated that the consultations had covered civil as well as criminal proceedings and that I was looking forward with some optimism to the prospect of an agreement being reached within six months. That allowed for a period during which the heads of agreement on which the consultations took place could be considered in detail by the Department of Justice and other United States departments involved. The present position in relation to those consultations is that we are still awaiting the response of the United States authorities on the proposed heads of agreement. I expect that we will receive that response very soon. </para>
          <para>The response will not, however, render the present Bill unnecessary, because the proposals we are exploring with the United States authorities will be applicable only in respect of future marketing arrangements. They will not be applicable to the Westinghouse proceedings. It is to be hoped that it will prove possible to obtain a better understanding with the United States authorities in relation to the enforcement of their antitrust laws. For its part, the Government will certainly be pursuing that objective. In the meantime, however, there is a clear need for us to take whatever steps are available to us to protect the Australian national interest. That is the essential purpose of the present Bill. I commend the Bill to the Senate. </para>

          </para>
          <para>The purpose of this Bill is to modify the five year expenditure profile of Commonwealth funds provided to assist the States with urban public transport improvements. It has become necessary following decisions to defer a portion of the funds available in 1978-79 and 1979-80 in the light of wider budget considerations. As honourable senators will recall, the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Malcolm Fraser)</inline> announced in his election policy speech last November that the Commonwealth would initiate a new program for urban public transport. The program would provide $300m over five years to assist States with upgrading their urban public transport systems. It was to follow on from the earlier program. Under the Urban Public Transport Agreement between the Commonwealth and the States, about $ 190m of Commonwealth funds had been provided to assist the States with urban public transport improvements over the five years to June 1978. </para>
          <para>The States Grants (Urban Public Transport) Act 1978 honoured our election policy commitment. As was pointed out in the second reading speech, the principles of the new legislation had been the subject of extensive discussions between my colleague the Minister for Transport <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Nixon)</inline> and his State government counterparts, as well as between officials. The 1978 Act included provision of $200m of Commonwealth funds at the rate of $40m per annum over the period 1978-79 and 1982-83, with allocation between States as set out in the Schedule to the Act; and provision under section 8 of $ 100m, available at the rate of $20m per annum, for allocation between States on the basis of needs. </para>
          <para>I would like to remind honourable senators that the Commonwealth funds of $300m provided under the 1978 Act represent an increase of more than 50 per cent over the funds provided by the Commonwealth to the States under the previous Urban Public Transport Agreement. The 1978 Act therefore reflects this Government's support for urban public transport improvements. As honourable senators are aware, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Nixon</inline> has notified the States of the 1978-79 approvals. Whilst these approvals cover more than one year for some States, approvals have been restricted to the level of funds set out in the Schedule to the Act. It is the Government's intention to maintain the total urban public transport program at $300m to 1982-83. However, decisions have been taken in the light of budget requirements to defer the allocation of $25m out of the full $40m otherwise available under section 8 in 1978-79 and 1979-80. The Bill before the Senate provides for the deferred $2 5 m to be included in an amended Schedule to the Act for the final three years from 1980-81 to 1982-83. The Commonwealth allocation by Schedule thus will be increased from $200m at the rate of $40m each year to $225m with yearly allocations as follows: 1 978-79-$40m; 1 979-80-$40m; 1980-8 1 -$45m; 1 9 8 1 - 82 -$ 50 m; 1982-83-$50m. </para>
          <para>The total amount to be provided by way of Schedule allocations to each State over the five years to 1982-83 is as follows: </para>

          </para>
          <para>The purpose of this Bill is to introduce new citizenship provisions into the Cocos (Keeling) Islands Act 1955 to extend Australian citizenship to any person, not already an Australian citizen, who was ordinarly resident on the Cocos (Keeling) Islands immediately before their transfer to Australia, who is now ordinarily resident in Australia or an external territory and who wishes to take up Australian citizenship. The Bill is an integral part of the Government's comprehensive program for the advancement and welfare of the Cocos people. This amending legislation was foreshadowed in a statement issued jointly by the Minister for Home Affairs <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Ellicott)</inline> and the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr MacKellar)</inline> on 6 July 1 978. </para>
          <para>Under the existing legislation persons who were over 2 1 years of age at the time Australia accepted responsibility for the Islands on 23 November 1955 had a choice of making a declaration to become an Australian citizen in a period of 3 years and 6 months from that date. This provision expired on 23 May 1959. Persons who were under 2 1 years of age at 23 November 1955 were able to make a declaration to become an Australian citizen two years after that person attained or attains the age of 21 years. The value of this provision expired on 22 November 1978. Persons born in the Cocos (Keeling) Islands after 23 November 1955 are automatically Australian citizens. The present Cocos Malay population on the Cocos (Keeling) Islands is about 270, of whom about 140 will become eligible under the proposed provisions. In addition, approximately 180 Cocos Malays now resident in Western Australia and Christmas Island would become eligible. The interim Cocos Malay advisory council has been consulted and supports the proposal. I commend the Bill to the Senate. </para>

          <para>This Bill is part of the Government's program for the future well-being of the inhabitants of the Cocos (Keeling) Islands. The Bill will allow the Cocos (Keeling) Islands to establish its own postal and philatelic services similar to those conducted by Norfolk Island and Christmas Island. The Cocos (Keeling) Islands will obtain revenue from these operations, primarily from philatelic sales, and the revenue so derived will be retained on the islands for the welfare of the inhabitants. It is proposed that this Act should take effect on a date to be fixed by proclamation which will be the date when the ordinance establishing the postal service takes effect.

            <para>- The Senate at long last has before it the Poultry Industry Assistance Amendment Bill 1978. 1 would be remiss if I did not express in the Senate tonight the concern of the Australian poultry industry at the long delay on the part of the Government in bringing this Bill to finality tonight. In looking at the time span- and concern has been expressed to me on many occasions by many people in the industry- we find that the Bill was first presented and read a first time in the House of Representatives on 16 August last year. The Bill passed through that House on 17 November last year, a span of three months. The Bill came to this place and was read a first time on 21 November. It is now 21 February 1979. That is an additional span of three months during which the Bill has been in this place. Six months elapsed from the time this Bill was introduced until the Government finally brought the Bill before the Senate to have it passed. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>I think that shows the very little concern that the Government has for the Australian poultry industry. It would appear from the time that has elapsed since the Bill was first introduced into the Parliament that the present Government puts the poultry industry right at the bottom of the ladder so far as primary industry matters are concerned. I want to express my very sincere concern on behalf of all those people in the industry who have approached me about the long delay in reaching finality on this Bill, and it is a very important Bill. Just before the Parliament rose for the Christmas recess I expressed my concern in the Senate at the delay and I asked the Leader of the Government in the Senate a question on the placing of business. He said to me: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>I am advised by the Minister for Primary Industry, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Sinclair,</inline> that the non-passage of the Bill will cause some delay in payments particularly in the industry promotional area. However, every effort will be made to minimise this effect and to ensure that payments are not unduly delayed. The passage of the Bill is expected early in the autumn session of 1 979. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">The Bill is now before the Senate. I hope that the industry has not suffered financially because of the long delay. I hope that the industry has received funds during the time that this Bill has been waiting to come before this House tonight. Earlier this evening we heard some criticism of the long delay in the presenting of reports to the Senate and I had occasion to refer to the delaying of reports pertaining to the poultry industry. I spoke about that in this chamber on 7 November 1978 and drew the matter to the attention of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Webster.</inline> He said that he would have a look at the remarks that I made. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Webster</inline> wrote to me on 15 November 1978. I will not hold up the Senate by reading out the answer that he gave about the delay in the presentation of those three reports.

              <para>- No, I do not find any objection. I accept the reasons that were given. I know the complexities of the poultry industry, particularly in the research area. The other thing that I want to place on record tonight is that the poultry industry in Australia has never sought or received a production subsidy. Being an ex-egg producer myself I am well aware that the egg industry in particular- and I am assured that this applies to the chicken meat industry also- has been able to look after its own marketing affairs. It has never had to come cap in hand to governments, State or Federal, seeking a production subsidy to enable it to market its production. I want to say that in my view both facets, the egg industry and the chicken meat industry, are very efficient and on the marketing side they are also very efficient. </para>

          <para>There have been many great problems over the years going back into the early 1960s and the late 1960s, particularly about the marketing of eggs. We had what we termed parasites in the industry, those people who wanted to evade their responsibility under the egg marketing boards which were set up under the laws of the various State governments. I do not carry any torch for those parasites because I look upon them as one would upon a person who will not take a ticket in a trade union. They are scabs. They want to get all the benefits but they do not want to contribute to the industry. Those people are despised by the majority of commercial poultry farmers. </para>

              <para>- You cannot have a conscientious objector in an orderly marketing system set up under the law of the land. I would not carry any torch for people who claim that they are conscientious objectors. If they are conscientious objectors to the marketing of their products under a marketing board they ought not to be in the industry at all. They are only dragging down the people in the industry who are efficient and what is more they are putting on the market a very inferior product. The poultry industry, of course, at large is very concerned that the consumer who purchases the product, whether it be a dozen eggs or a broiler chicken, buys the best quality he can get. The only way the consumer is assured of getting quality is by buying the product- this applies particularly in the egg industry but not so much in the meat bird industry- which is marketed by the appropriate marketing boards which are set up in every State. </para>
            </talk.start>
          </continue>
          <para>The reason I have spoken about these people is that in his second reading speech the then Minister for Administrative Services <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Chaney)</inline> said that the funds being sought under this legislation are being used for research in the control of diseases, for work on nutritional studies and in particular for investigation of egg quality aspects. This Bill will mean that the industry will have available to it $300,000 which is an increase of $ 100,000 over the existing amount that is available. So an additional amount of $50,000 will be provided by the industry itself and this amount will be matched by the Federal Government. So out of that total of $300,000 the industry itself will provide $150,000 and the Commonwealth Government will provide the other $150,000. </para>
          <para>I want to mention the egg quality aspect and to talk about those people who want to trade outside the egg marketing boards. Many of us who take an interest in the industry will recall that last year there was a great upheaval in the Australian Capital Territory. Many Press reports claimed that the Victorian Egg and Egg Pulp Marketing Board was selling eggs in the Australian Capital Territory and undermining the local producer to the tune of about 20 per cent of the local market- there is only one main producer in the Australian Capital Territory- and because of this the producer had to market 20 per cent of his eggs in New South Wales. I want to put the record straight because in talking to people in the industry I have found that the person who was able to get all of this publicity in the local Press in Canberra and was trying to lay the blame at the feet of the Victorian Egg Board was in fact the first offender; the Victorian Egg Board marketed eggs in the Australian Capital Territory as a retaliatory action. </para>
          <para>The firm I am talking about is Parkwood Eggs Pty Ltd. It is owned by Bartters Enterprises of Griffith in New South Wales. I well recall that when the firm first moved into the Australian Capital Territory- and I had contact with many people well up in the industry- some people said that the firm moved to the Australian Capital Territory because it thought at that time that the Australian Capital Territory could be an outlet and it would be able to evade its responsibility under the Council of Egg Marketing Authorities of Australia plan. That plan was embodied in legislation brought into the Parliament by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Adermann</inline> when he was the Minister for Primary Industry. The legislation imposed a levy on the keepers of hens. Any person who had in excess of 20 hens over the age of six months had to pay a levy. That was the only way to catch these people who were evading their responsibility under the egg marketing authority of each State. Birds could not be transferred across the border every day when they wanted to lay an egg in order to evade section 92 of the Constitution relating to free trade between States. </para>
          <para>The only way we could overcome that problem was to impose a levy on the hen. I was a poultry farmer then and I well recall the politics of the situation. They went on for years. Every State in the Commonwealth except South Australia agreed to implement appropriate legislation. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr David</inline> Brookman, who was then the Minister for Agriculture in the Playford Government, stood fast and would not agree to such legislation. I well recall 1968 when <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Frank</inline> Walsh became Premier and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Bywaters,</inline> the then member for Murray, became the Minister for Agriculture. Within a short span of time he had agreed to support the Commonwealth Government in the implementation of the CEMAA plan. He did it to his detriment as he lost his seat in Parliament. We lost government over the issue. On many occasions <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Bywaters</inline> has told me that if he were put in the same position again he would take the same action. He agreed to the legislation and the people in the electorate of Murray in South Australia vilified him so much that in the 1968 election he lost his seat and the Labor Government was defeated in South Australia. That all happened over the humble egg. But <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Bywaters</inline> stood fast and his decision has stood the test of time. The egg industry in Australia today is on a very stable footing. I think that we have to give a lot of credit, firstly to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Adermann</inline> for having the courage to introduce the legislation and, secondly, to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Bywaters</inline> for having the courage to put his political career in South Australia on the line to ensure that the legislation was implemented. </para>
          <para>When the legislation became law we found that Banters of Griffith thought that they would find a loophole in the Australian Capital Territory, buy up poultry farms there and set up a monopoly. They thought that in this way they would be able to evade the CEMAA levy. But that was not to be. We now know that the firm of Banters, which is now known as Parkwood Eggs here in Canberra, is virtually a monopoly producer in the Australian Capital Territory, producing 90 to 95 per cent of total production in the Territory. The action by the Victorian Egg Board of selling in the Australian Capital Territory is really in retaliation against Banters' actions in selling eggs in Victoria from the Griffith farmnot eggs from the Australian Capital Territory, but the same company that operates in the Australian Capital Territory was marketing eggs over the border into Victoria under section 92. This has been upsetting the orderly marketing system of the Victorian Egg Board. </para>
          <para>I have figures which I collected last year. I was prepared to speak on this legislation last year before the Parliament rose. I do not know what Banters are doing now, but last year they were believed to be supplying at least one million dozen eggs annually to Victoria. As I have said, this upsets the Victorian market and also results in an evasion by Banters of the contributions which each producer should make to cover the cost of export disposal. Only the imposition of a higher hen levy, which cannot legally be evaded, could rectify this situation. I hope that we will be talking about that matter later this session when the Government introduces legislation to increase the hen levy. At present, therefore, the Victorian producers are paying for the cost of the disposal of the Victorian eggs displaced by Banters' eggs. The disturbance of the Victorian market has been so marked that the Victorian Minister for Agriculture has expressed the view that the Victorian hen quota legislation should be discontinued unless there is an increase in the hen levy maximum to $2. 1 hope that we will see the passage of legislation to effect that increase before the Parliament rises for the winter recess. </para>
          <para>Further to that, and getting back to the few words in the Minister's second reading speech I mentioned earlier which indicated that some of the research is to be into egg quality aspects, we find that last year there was an export into Victoria of contaminated egg pulp from Banters which did serious damage to public relations and to the confidence that had been built up by the Victorian Egg Board with its consumers. In November 1977 a Press report disclosed that the New South Wales Health Commission had closed down a factory in Griffith, New South Wales, belonging to the Bartters, which had been sending contaminated egg pulp into Victoria. The pulp in question was reported to have massive salmonella contamination and other bacterial infections. Large quantities of the pulp were seized and destroyed. The contaminated pulp had been traced as a result of the detection of a number of cases of food poisoning, culminating in admissions to hospital of people with quite serious illnesses. </para>
          <para>So it is quite evident that the other side of the story had to be put at the first opportunity. Tonight, with this legislation before us, provides the first opportunity I have had to do this. Many people in the Australian Capital Territory are under the impression that the Victorian Egg Board, because of the publicity it was given last year, is doing its best to undermine an industry here in the Australian Capital Territory which, it is claimed, employs about 50 people. But these people do not know the other side of the story. They do not know of the damage that these eggs were doing and of the pulp that was sent to Victoria by the same company that is in the Australian Capital Territory, which has a farm in Griffith. I think I have stated the facts outlining why the Victorian Egg Board had to send its eggs into the Australian Capital Territory as a retaliatory action. I hope that in the future this does not happen because there is no room in a primary industry of any description for producers to pit their products against each other. </para>
          <para>We have to have an orderly marketing system, not only for the benefit of the producers but also for the benefit of the consumers. We can be assured of satisfaction when we have a proper, orderly marketing system, with experts marketing our eggs, where the eggs are looked after in a proper fashion in cold storage and where an egg board is responsible for them. I might say that any woman who purchases an egg with an egg board stamp on it and finds it is not up to true quality has the right to go back to the retailer and to say that she had so many crook eggs in the carton. The retailer is then duty bound to replace those eggs and is then reimbursed from the egg board in whatever State. We cannot do that when people are selling unstamped eggs, as these interstaters do. I have been through all that because, as I said earlier, I was in the industry when we fought out all these issues. </para>
          <para>I am not going to say any more on this because time is getting on and I know that other honourable senators want to speak on other legislation. I again want to emphasise my concern and the concern of the industry at the long delay in introducing this legislation. I hope that when the legislation to increase the hen levy is brought into the other place we will not have to wait six months before it is brought into this chamber and is then passed into law. The Opposition supports this legislation. That is all I need to say on the matter. </para>

            <para>- I thank the Opposition and in particular I thank <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McLaren</inline> for his comments on the Poultry Industry Assistance Amendment Bill. The Poultry Industry Assistance Act of 1966 currently provides for an annual maximum total of $200,000 to be spent on research in a financial year from matched industry-government contributions. That has been unchanged since 1966. The main purpose of that provision was to support a technical and biological research program. The Council of Egg Marketing Authorities of Australia has offered to increase industry contributions to egg industry research by up to $50,000 annually providing a matching contribution is made by the Commonwealth. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>I noted <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McLaren's</inline> comments and thank him for them. He claimed that delay with this Bill was embarrassing the poultry industry and he referred to remarks made by my colleague, the Minister for Primary Industry <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Sinclair).</inline> The honourable senator may note that the Minister in his remarks was referring to problems that had arisen within the poultry industry in certain States in efforts to obtain consensus on the need to strengthen funds for stabilisation purposes. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McLaren</inline> may note that agreement has since been reached on the stabilisation levy and that legislation to effect the wishes of the industry is being introduced in another place. </para>
          <para>The Bill which is before us relates to research. More money is needed principally to provide for marketing and economic research projects. Some marketing and economic research projects have already been initiated and are designed to form a basis for determining the future direction of marketing research. These preliminary studies were funded from economies achieved in the financing of technical and biological projects. The effectiveness of the existing program has also been eroded through monetary inflation. As I indicated the existing financial limits have remained unchanged since the passage of the original Act in 1966. Because a ceiling is still imposed on annual research expenditure care will have to be maintained in the arrangement of priorities for research, which honourable senators will understand is particularly important. Of course the allocation of funds to support the most worthwhile of the projects must be provided. Industry expenditure on research is matched with Government contribution in other rural industry trust funds. </para>
          <para>There is little more to say about this Bill. I think it can go to the Committee stage. So that the honourable senator knows I point out that projects to expend the enlarged funds will take effect in the coming financial year; that is, 1979-80. The time-table will be adequately met by the passage of this Bill in this session. </para>
          <para>Question resolved in the affirmative. </para>

          <para class="block">The second reading speech of the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Chaney)</inline> who in this chamber represents the Minister for Transport <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Nixon)</inline> stated that this Bill will modify the existing legislation which was passed in 1978, and in which the Government agreed to provide sums of money to the States for improvement of urban transport generally. That legislation was passed by the Parliament even though it did not match the promises that had been made by the Government at the time of the 1975 and 1977 elections, where it is on record that the Minister for Transport had, in fact, agreed to provide a very substantial sum of money- something like $300m- over a five year period for the purpose of putting into effect the Government's policy. Of course, the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Malcolm Fraser)</inline> in his speech pledged to assist the States to modernise their public transport systems. He stated that the Federal Government would be happy to assist State governments to provide car parking at suburban public transport terminals to encourage increased patronage of such services. </para>
          <para>In the policy speech the Prime Minister went on to say that a Liberal-National Country Party Government would encourage the States in the development of a rapid transport system. So not only did the 1978 legislation not put into effect the promises that were made by the Government in 1977, but also now the Parliament is being asked to modify the modified version of the Government's policy which was presented for Parliamentary approval in 1978. In so doing it is reducing the sum of $25m, allegedly- to use the words of the Minister- in the light of wider budget considerations. Of course, that opens a real Pandora's box as far as this Government's general approach to the economy is concerned. I think we ought to reflect upon the fact that it is just as well we did not have Fraser-type governments in the 19th and 20th centuries when it was essential to establish a public transport rail system in our country, else we might never have been able to move from Sydney to Melbourne or from Sydney to Bathurst, Wagga Wagga, Broken Hill and other major centres. If governments of that day had taken the short-sighted approach that has been taken by this Government since it has come to office then we would never have built our transport infrastructure which has played such an important and significant part in the development of our industries and of our economy in the last 100 years or so. </para>
          <para>The period of great growth in this country can be shown in different epochs, whether it be the latter part of the last century, the early part of this century, after World War I and in particular in the period after World War II when Australia's population almost doubled because of migration and other factors. Of course, it is relevant to point to the fact that we can see that in the process of that growth there has been a decay, a decline, a deterioration in the whole urban public transport system. Contrary to what this Government is doing, it ought to be spending and allocating the sort of money to which it committed itself, through its Minister for Transport and its Leader, in both the 1975 and 1977 elections. It is no wonder that the Australian people are losing faith in political parties and in governments when election promises can be broken so glibly as though they have no value. Within a year- within a matter of months- we find the Government bringing in a further Bill which amends a Budget consideration, endorsed by the Parliament after consultation with State Ministers for Transport, and which seeks to spread the money over a longer period of time and, in fact, on a yearly basis reduces the amount of money. Of course, this flies in the face of all the experiences of anybody concerned with sociology, demography and the proper development of balanced economic growth. It ought to be understood- although it is not by this </para>
          <para class="block">Government- that an urban public transport system is an integral part of any growth and development program, particularly as it is related to urban growth. </para>
          <para>In the post-war years we have seen a tremendous development of our major cities and of our urban areas. As all planners will say, and as all people who concern themselves with urban matters will say, an urban transport system is the very hub, the very focal point, and the very link between all that happens in a modern community, whether it be industrial or commercial activity. The success achieved in the movement of people, goods and services and in the matters of education and leisure depends upon a proper functioning urban public transport system. It was in recognition of this fact that the Whitlam Labor Government, when introducing its legislation in 1973 for the very first time, allocated $500m, at 1973 values, over five years, with compensatory escalation provisions to maintain the basic purchasing power of original grants. So, whatever the inflation rate, whatever the value of money, the Whitlam Government for the first time in the history of Australia accepted proper responsibility in respect of the urban transport system. </para>
          <para>It is not often that credit is given. Certainly none has been given in this place by members of this Government to these important steps which were taken in the Whitlam period. However, at least there is on the public record a Press release which was issued by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Milton</inline> Morris, the Liberal Party Minister for Transport in the New South Wales coalition Government. That Press release dated 19 February 1973 reads: </para>

            <para>The important thing is that the public transport system of Sydney will be transformed and I give full marks to the Federal Transport Minister, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Jones,</inline> for the part he has played. He is the first Federal Transport Minister in the history of Australia to have obtained Commonwealth assistance for public transport: </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">When we read all of the debates which have taken place in the intervening years, we find that no recognition is given to this pioneering work of the Labor Government in developing for the first time, a national conscientiousness and a national concept of the need for the Federal Government to become involved in upgrading and improving our urban transport system. </para>
          <para>Of course, we are contrasting the action of a Labor government with the inability of a conservative government to put into effect its own policy and program. The present Government said in one of its official documents: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>In 1 978-79 we will expand existing programs to provide a total of $60m annually for the next five years to improve urban public  transport </para>
            <para>We will also undertake a five year program to upgrade critical sections of the national railway network. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">But what is happening? This piece of legislation to which the Senate is asked to consent will in fact reduce further the allocation of funds, reduced as they were in comparison with what was promised in 1977. All of this is done in the mistaken belief that by spending such public funds the Government would be contributing to some sort of decline in Australia's economic situation. Of course, that epitomises the approach which has been taken by conservative governments in the post-war years, namely, that the private sector should be given unfettered rights to funds and resources in this country. In fact, the record of the dismal Menzies epoch- those long 23 years- shows that public transport, public education, public health and public services generally in Australia deteriorated to a marked degree. It was not until the late 1950s that the parents and teachers in the various States took up the cudgels and agitated to such an extent that finally even <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Menzies</inline> was forced to take cognisance of the change in the public opinion and to begin to accept some responsibility for Federal funding for education. </para>
          <para>Nothing was done about public transport until 1973, despite all the activities by the railway unions and by State governments of all political complexions. I give credit to both the Labor Government in New South Wales and the Liberal Government in Victoria which raised very sharply with the conservative national Government which was in power prior to 1972 the need for the Commonwealth to become involved in the herculean task of making funds available to improve our urban public transport system. No member of this Senate can travel throughout Australia and not be ashamed of the neglected state of our urban transport system in every State, no matter what the political complexion of the State government. The same neglect would be found in Queensland after long years of conservative government as would be found in Tasmania after long years of Labor government. I remember during an election campaign visiting the railway workshops in Launceston and being ashamed of the fact that public facilities had been allowed to deteriorate to the extent to which they had. </para>
          <para>As we all know, public transport has become the principle cost factor in all State Budgets. It is the area that costs the States most money. The resources of the six individual States are insufficient to finance the sort of modernisation and improvement needed in urban transport systems. It was the recognition of this fact that prompted the Whitlam Labor Government, in its perception of what the needs were for urban transport in this country, to make $500m available over a period of five years. The Whitlam Government considered it its responsibility and obligation to recognise all the areas of neglect that existed throughout the public sector in Australia. We make no apologies for the fact that the Whitlam Government allocated funds and gave encouragement to the State governments so that public services throughout Australia could be provided in order to improve the living conditions of people in the major cities. We recognised that 87 per cent of the Australian population lived in the urban environment. It was the Whitlam Government's intention to make improvements, whether it be to the sewerage program, to education, or, as in this particular case, to the urban public transport system. </para>
          <para>It was in pursuit of that sort of objective that we changed the face of Federal-State financial relationships. We made large sums of money available to the States in order that they could improve their public facilities and, as in this case, to improve public transport. We were traduced and we were criticised. We were maligned by people in this place and by the leaders of the private sector, who dominate the whole of our economy. They said we were bringing about a better allocation of resources in this country. We make no apologies for that, because the present Government in its policies has pledged itself to make the necessary changes and to allocate the necessary funds to bring about the objectives which the Whitlam Government had set itself. In pursuance of that objective certainly we came into a deficit situation. But it is suggested that by the spending of money on urban public transport, on building schools, on building better hospitals or better sewerage schemes or even housing the Government was going bankrupt. Providing permanent public facilities is the sort of business acumen in which the private sector engages. </para>
          <para>Indeed, as <inline font-weight="bold">Sir William</inline> McMahon and William Wentworth have said from time to time, we were providing assets. Correcting the deficit was only a matter of making an adjustment to a financial arrangement between income and expenditure. If, in fact, assets were being provided for the Australian people, it should not be regarded as a deficit. In a previous debate, we heard even <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Messner, Senator Lewis</inline> and others talk about the dreadful deficit that we had when we were in government as a result of providing money to improve the living conditions of the people in our cities, suburbs and country towns. </para>
          <para>We criticise this Government because it believes that by not providing this sort of money it is going to solve the malaise that exists in the economy of this country. It says that it is because we placed great emphasis on public works and public sector expenditure that we are in this awful mess with the economy. </para>
          <para>What is the comparable position about public sector expenditure in respect of the gross domestic product? Are these factors that can be borne out by comparisons with other countries? For example, in 1 970 we in Australia were spending on the public sector only 24 per cent of our national income, which figure was lifted to 32 per cent when the Labor Party was in office at the end of 1975. Let us look at a comparison with other countries whose transport systems leave ours for dead, are modern, run on time and are clean and efficient and whose public services generally would leave ours for dead. In a whole range of activities the people of Europe are able to enjoy decent community facilities. Canada spends 39.4 per cent of its gross domestic product in the public sector. West Germany spends 44 per cent. I had the opportunity to visit that country last year, to travel on its trains, and to see the improved conditions that people are able to enjoy in that country's public transport system. In the Netherlands the figure is 53.9 per cent, which is almost double what we were spending in about 1973. In Sweden the figure is 51.7 per cent and in the United Kingdom it is 44.5 per cent. In the heartland of capitalism, the United States of America, the place of the big corporations where the private sector is so sacrosanct that one is not even allowed to think about the public sector, 35.1 per cent of the gross domestic product is spent in the public sector. Yet in 1975, the peak year of the Labor Government, we were spending only 32 per cent. </para>
          <para>I wager that as a result of the inadequate policies of this Government that 32 per cent has dropped, because this Government is wedded to a concept that all it has to do is leave everything to the private sector and everything will come good. That, of course, is one of the great myths of the thinking of not only this Government but also those who control the media and try to develop the consciousness of the Australian people to support that point of view. Of course, it is a fallacy. It will not work. The private sector is concerned only with maximising its profit. Wherever it can make investments, whether it be in Singapore, Taiwan, the United States or in any of our own cities, it will concern itself with the objective because that is what it believes in. It ill becomes a government charged with the responsibility of a balanced development of a country to take the view that the public sector has to be reduced to the paucity it was in during those dim and dark days of the 1950s and 1960s when public sector activity virtually stood still. This Government has ignored the fact that planning means that when cities develop and grow, it is an essential part of that growth that there be an adequate public transport system. The Government's own political documents, its own programs, pay tribute to the fact that one must have an improvement in the public transport system. We have this absurd position of workers now living at such distances from their place of work that it takes them an hour and a half or two hours to travel there from their place of residence. It is not within the province of the State instrumentalities to do anything to improve that system to any marked extent because of the tremendous costs involved and because, as I said earlier, of the great brake that transport places on State finances. </para>
          <para>In pursuit of a wider budgetary consideration the Budget strategy makes urban public transport another casualty, just as Medibank and reduced taxes have been a casualty. Interest charges have risen; they are another casualty of the Budget. Another casualty is the minor credit squeeze which, it seems, was reported in the news this evening. Promises were made so glibly by this Government in relation to a whole variety of taxes which it said were going to come down; but we know that they have gone up. Interest rates were going to go down; they are now rising. We know that inflation is continuing to go up and not down. Whether it be in respect of public housing or public urban transport, funds are being decreased and decreased to a point where they lose their significance in respect of any capacity of a State government to plan for any improvement in its urban transport system. </para>
          <para>Of course, as we know, this is an issue with the Australian people. It has been proved to be an issue in the last two elections in New South Wales. I do not know whether <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Peter</inline> Baume is smiling at my reference, but he must surely recognise that one of the features of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Wran's</inline> victories in the last two elections in the State has been his determination to improve the urban public transport system as far as the available money would allow. In fact a great deal has been done, at the expense unfortunately of other public activities and responsibilities, to improve the urban public transport system. It was in recognition of that need for improvements in urban transport that seats were won in the election before last in the key areas of Gosford and the Blue Mountains, which brought about the defeat of the conservative government. Because we in New South Wales have persisted with our responsibilities to improve the system as far as is practicable with Federal and State funds, some significant improvement has taken place in New South Wales. I can talk about the situation in the other States, including South Australia, where there is great disquiet as a result of the Commonwealth 's attitude in respect of the transport system there. The State having handed part of it over, the Commonwealth now is applying the squeeze and, of course, the same problem has developed - </para>

              <para>- That is right. It is an indictment of this Government that it should follow so glibly and so blindly the false premise that all it has to do is reduce public sector spending and the whole economy will be back on an even keel. In fact if it studies the experiences of other countries it will see that that is not borne out at all. In Japan, the countries of Europe and other modern and industrialised countries there has been an improvement in the urban public transport systems as a result of a national government accepting its responsibilities. We make no secret about and are not ashamed of the fact that we have moved an amendment condemning this Government for again attempting to modify and reduce the amount of funds available for urban public transport. We would hope that honourable senators opposite might give some mature consideration to our point of view or at least have the courage to stand up and say what the Government is endeavouring to do in respect of this Bill and so many other money Bills we have been concerned with in recent times and justify the drastic cutback in public sector spending. </para>

            </talker>
            <para>-The Senate is debating tonight a Bill introduced earlier this evening which is entitled a Bill for an Act to amend the States Grants (Urban Public Transport) Act 1978. The Bill deals with a number of matters in terms of amendment. It looks at the Government's policy on federalism and on State relations. Also it draws attention to the situation of urban transport in our society. Urban transport and urban public transport are not only financial matters or federal matters but are also of some social consequence and importance. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>First of all, let me look at the Bill and in particular refer to the second reading speech which was made in the Senate a little earlier this evening. As the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Chaney)</inline> has said, the Bill seeks to modify a five-year expenditure profile. This five-year expenditure profile deals with Commonwealth funds that are provided for the States in relation to urban public transport programs. As the Minister has pointed out, the Bill has become necessary following decisions to defer a portion of the funds- and that completely denies the arguments which have just been put forward relating to promises and the availability of funds to the States-available for 1978-79 and 1979-80. This deferment has been made in the light of wider Budget consideration. </para>
          <para>The Senate, of course, will very well recall that the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Malcolm Fraser)</inline> announced in his election policy speech that the Commonwealth would initiate programs for urban public transport and that these programs would provide something like $300m over five years to assist the States in upgrading their urban public transport systems. I think the Senate should be reminded that this $300m provided under the 1978 Act represents an increase of more than 50 per cent. An increase in any terms is, of course, to be applauded and is appreciated and approved, but I think we should draw the attention of the Senate to the fact that in this case the increase is more than 50 per cent over the funds provided by the Commonwealth to the States under the previous Urban Public Transport Authority. </para>
          <para>It is important to point out that the 1978 Act reflects very markedly the Government's support for urban transport improvements. It is the Government's intention to maintain the total urban public transport program at $300m to 1 982 and to 1 983. This, alongside the considerable percentage improvement, is a significant development in the Government's interest in and maintenance of the urban public transport systems of this country. The Bill maintains the Government's long term support for urban public transport and at the same time, in terms of good housekeeping, it meets the current need for financial restraint. </para>
          <para>The background to the measure goes back a number of years. As was indicated earlier tonight the Commonwealth became interested some years ago in this field and commenced its assistance to the States in 1973 and 1974. Under the States Grants (Urban Public Transport) Act 1974 the Commonwealth met two-thirds of the cost of approved urban public transport projects in the States. I suppose it is a fairly obvious follow-on that the major projects have included the acquisition of new rolling stock for train, tram and bus services as well as provision for ferries and the upgrading of certain railway systems. </para>
          <para>The matter is not only one of public and urban transport. It is not only a matter of States grants or indeed of national economics. The matter of public and urban transport relates to a social situation that has some complexity and, indeed, some significance. It affects a wide range of people in a wide range of circumstances. It has a whole range of impacts on land development, suburban development, population movements and things of that kind. Australia is one of the world's most urban societies. We are the most urbanised community on earth in spite of our size. Therefore we need to look very carefully at the development of transportation if our lifestyle and our quality of life are to develop in any sensible way so everyone has a good opportunity and so that there is an incentive for people to develop not only their business and their commerce inclinations but also to enjoy life. So the matter of public transport and urban transport is something that needs to be taken very seriously into account. I suggest that the funds which the Commonwealth is setting aside are a response to this need. </para>
          <para>Australia has a very heavy record of car ownership and car use. We are really not noted for our use of public urban transport. I think much of this springs from our geographical situation, the size of our nation, the scattered nature of our population beyond the urban areas and generally our attitude to transport, our attitude to travel and our attitude to the transportation of goods and services. I think that more than anything else we like to be at the wheel of our own vehicles. I suppose this gives us a feeling of authority and power. Certainly it gives us a feeling of independence. We are not dependent on the movement of public transport and we are not dependent on or subjected to timetables or things of that kind. Whilst this may sound to be an interesting situation I think we have to remember that the people of our society are not always conveniently located to public or urban transport. I suppose this one of the vicious circles in which we as a society are placed. We do not use public transport and as a result public transport does not become available to people in a great many areas. So to a certain extent our society runs the risk of being disadvantaged in some ways. </para>
          <para>As we develop as a nation and a society and as we face up to certain inevitable developments that appear to be taking place in the world I think the whole of our society at government and enterprise level has to look very seriously at urban transportation. This not only applies to a Commonwealth or national government in respect of the funding processes; it also very much applies to State governments and local authorities as they seek to work out the most suitable areas in which urban public transport might be related or directed and, indeed, might be used so that it provides a service for the people on the one hand and an economic and soundly managed unit on the other hand. </para>
          <para>A city- and of course there are a number of cities in Australia in which most of our people live- is a dense distribution of people where social and economic activities are monitored, structured and controlled by the way the land uses are developed and by the way the transport facilities are worked out. The interaction between the two, of course, provides that which we know as traffic because the land use of a city can not provide traffic on its own nor can the transport facilities provide traffic on their own. In Australia over the past three decades our State capitals have virtually doubled their populations and our national capital in Canberra has increased its population fourfold. Over those decades we have tended to place millions of people in a kind of low density sprawl around the perimeters of our major cities such as Sydney, Melbourne, Adelaide and Brisbane. We sometimes wonder why public transport simply cannot service those people. The melancholy truth of this fact is that we are in company, of course, with a great number of car dominated cities throughout the world. </para>
          <para>I suppose one of the keys to the urban public transport situation and urban transport policies lies in the question of whether man wants to move himself or whether he wants to move himself and his automobile too. The answer is not easy. It is a complex situation, as I have indicated. We have to try to find a way to provide for the individual a choice between private and public transport systems. In all affluent urban communities in which virtually all the adults have access to a car the choice becomes very much one sided in favour of the car. But having said that I think that we have to remember that there are what I have seen described as captives of public transport. These are people such as school children, elderly people and appreciable numbers of citizens who, for one reason or another, do not wish to own or drive a motor car or automobile. Any policy on public transportation must therefore include what I would describe as a public service. The Minister for Aboriginal Affairs, when speaking earlier tonight, was wise to draw to the attention of the Senate the fact that the Bill which is before us maintains the Government's longer term support for urban public transport and takes into account this balance whereby public transport is efficient and economic while at the same time providing for those people who desire and need, for one reason or another, to use it. </para>
          <para>As the second reading speech points out, the Bill, in providing longer term support for urban and public transport, also meets the need for financial restraint on which the Government has placed so much emphasis and in which it has achieved so much success. Urban transport involves not only an extension of lines and roads but also the upgrading of services and facilities. We must have a very serious look at timetables and the use of appropriate, comfortable, effective and efficient vehicles. But I suggest that we are in a position whereby there could very well be some danger and some difficulty as far as our urban transport situations are concerned. We need to place a renewed emphasis on the fact that we are vulnerable to imported fuels. Indeed our situation is such that this vulnerability as far as the importation of petroleum and other fuels is concerned places our whole effective transport system within the cities in some difficulty and possibly even in some jeopardy. Only if petroleum and fuel supplies were cut off would the full capacity of public transport finally be needed. We need metropolitan transportation systems which can efficiently handle what I think can be described as a mass motorised society. Australia has such a society at present. In dealing with this society we need to be able to switch relatively rapidly to a reliance on public transport in the event of a serious fuel shortage. </para>
          <para>I do not think that it is stretching the point too far when I make the assertion that we need cities which can handle both situations. At present we have cities in Australia which can do neither. The best strategy to cope with this uncertain future is to develop a network of efficient urban public transport routes so that most areas of a given city or a highly developed population centre are within reasonable walking distance of some form of public transport- a train, a tram or a bus route. I am critical of the present situation in </para>
          <para class="block">Australia as far as urban public transport is concerned. There is fragmented planning in Australian cities, with different authorities each concerned with one or another aspect of public transport. I think that all forms of public transport should be considered together in a system of integrated planning, taking into account land uses, population developments and trends as well as bearing in mind the scattered nature of our Australian population. </para>
          <para>Whilst the Bill defers the provision of a certain amount of money it also draws the attention of the Australian people, indeed of the Australian Parliament, because it provides opportunities for extension and support of urban transport. The allocation of funds may be welcome but more research is needed. I suggest that we need to educate the publics' attitude towards public transport. We must develop a sympathetic understanding of public transport and perhaps an attitude in favour of urban public transport so that the various issues relating to energy, commerce and the social wellbeing and convenience of the people may be effectively geared. </para>
          <para>Even as one may make these kinds of observations the unresolved question is whether urban transport should be regarded totally as a business proposition paying its way or become a kind of social service in which facilities are provided. As a strict business operation it may very well be that in certain situations the transport system may have its limitations as far as services to the people are concerned. But I think that it is equally true to say that the community must be protected from providing vast sums of money for great transport systems that travel the various lines and roads and rails with no customers, no passengers no response and no income. The great transport systems of some countries which have been constantly held up to us as being of very great value may look very fine as we see them. They may be very fine as they service visitors. But a heavy taxation burden is demanded of the people so that those systems can be maintained. In any study of urban public transportthe community needs to give this further study- we have to balance the need for an effective paying operation on the one hand against a social situation on the other so that a community may be able to be effectively served and at the same time public money wisely spent. I support the measure. </para>

            <para>- I rise to second the amendment to the State Grants (Urban Public Transport) Bill so ably moved by my colleague <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gietzelt.</inline> Before addressing myself to the Bill I would like to make one or two observations. It has become clear to us on this side of the Senate that when it comes to election time the Liberals have no peers as promisers. I am reminded of Lloyd George who went to the polls in Great Britain as Prime Minister on the promise that if he was re-elected he would hang the Kaiser. We all know, as history reveals, that Lloyd George won the election but the Kaiser died peacefully in his bed 20 years later. Throughout the years, since Lloyd George's time and to the present time, we have seen the Liberals establish a record of broken promises unequalled by any other political party. We on this side of the Senate know them to be people who change their minds every full moon. They twist and turn and change their minds at the drop of a hat. I have used the quotation I am about to read before but it is worth reminding Government senators opposite of it again. Somebody once wrote about them: </para>
          </talk.start>
          <quote>
            <para>A merciful providence fashioned them hollow on purpose that they might their principles swallow. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">It is equally true of them today as when it was written about them previously. In 1977 the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Malcolm Fraser)</inline> promised in his election policy speech to provide $60m annually over five years for urban public transport in all States. In other words, a total of some $300m over five years was promised to assist the States in upgrading their public transport systems. An Act was to provide payments to the States at the rate of $60m a year, of which $40m was to be allocated to the States in fixed guaranteed amounts with the remaining $20m to be allocated annually on the basis of needs and priorities assessed in the light of proposals submitted by the States themselves. In fact, honourable senators will recall that even at that time the States were unanimous in their opinion that the annual amount offered to them was barely adequate to sustain existing public transport services and facilities. </para>
          <para>I refer now to what is happening at present. This year the needs component has been dropped altogether. The reason given is the difficult budgetary situation that existed in 1978 and still exists in 1979. It is a case of another broken promise, of another promise being repudiated by the Government. One of the great faults that we on this side of the chamber see with the new urban public transport scheme is that the escalation provision incorporated in the 1973-78 assistance scheme introduced by the Labor Government has been dropped completely. </para>
          <para>Despite all the claims and the horrendous unemployment policies of the Federal Government over the past three years, the rate of inflation was in double digit figures until quite recently and, most importantly, it is still running at between 8 per cent and 9 per cent per annum. Between 1971 and 1975 it averaged 10 per cent. Despite all the talk, the Federal Government has made little impact on the inflation rate. Consequently, the value of the limited transport grants is being whittled away during each year of the five-year scheme. Obviously, the less granted in the early years the less value there is in the scheme. It needs to be recalled that the original offer by the Labor Government in 1973 was quite generous. lt was $500m in 1973 dollars, spread over five years with compensatory escalation provisions. All the State Premiers of the day hailed it as a massive breakthrough. It is a matter of some relief that the scheme is being continued at all by the scrooge-like coalition government, which seems dedicated to paralysing the community. </para>
          <para>The Prime Minister conned the electors in his 1977 policy speech when he made the grandiose promise to undertake a five-year program to upgrade critical sections of the national railway network. The gloss soon wore off after the election. It transpired that only $70m was to be made available over five years, averaging out at $ 14m a year to be split between the States. This year the $ 14m is back to $3m for all the States, which is hardly enough to buy more than a few sleepers. We are now in the position where, our forebears having built the railway stations that we have today, we are having difficulty in finding enough money to paint them. That was said in the other place by the honourable member for Hughes <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Les Johnson).</inline> How true it is. It also transpires that the present $3m for central railway works is to be in the nature of a loan to the States and not a grant. It will be up to the States to pay the interest on such a loan. So much for the Commonwealth's concern for the country's railway system. </para>
          <para>The whole situation has to be considered against the background that the Commonwealth still commands the major taxation resources of this country. One has only to look at the $300m ripped off the motorists in 1977-78 by the 10c a gallon world parity crude oil levy and the even more horrendous 16c a gallon levy imposed this year to yield $676m from the same source. Despite the claims of the  Deputy  Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Anthony),</inline> levies of this kind have proved worldwide not to be fuel conservation measures. They are a naked tax on the motorist pouring millions of dollars into the Commonwealth coffers. We on this side feel that there might be some justification if the money were channelled into areas that would promote fuel conservation by the construction of adequate road systems, the funding of oil research programs or improvements to alternative public transport facilities. Unfortunately this is simply not happening. </para>
          <para>Let me turn my attention closer to home. What is happening in Queensland? A prominent person in Queensland said firstly that increases from the Federal Government would have to be across the board before he would be satisfied. Similarly, he is far from happy about the matter of cost escalation and the Federal Government's barefaced withdrawal from the commitment made under the Labor Government to support automatically cost escalation. Secondly, he has publicly stated that the electrification of railways, the wider urban public transport issues and the expenditure on roads should be coordinated rather than separated as they are now. As a result of the separation we sometimes find the thought and purpose behind the policy running in contrary directions. Honourable senators may well ask me this evening who was the author of those words. Was it the Leader of the Labor Opposition or a prominent Labor front bencher? No, it was none other than the National Party Minister for Transport in Queensland, the Honourable Russell Hinze, a man everyone will agree not renowned for his Labor Party sympathies. </para>
          <para>It appears to me that for the ratepayers of Brisbane the two issues which we are discussing this evening are of particular importance. After all, the Brisbane local authority which is Australia's largest is the only capital city authority responsbile for public transport. For those who live and work in the metropolitan area, a large proportion of the cost of local authority road maintenance as well as maintenance of the public transport system is carried by the local ratepayer. From the point of view of protection of the public interest, we all agree that it is eminently sensible that Brisbane's metropolitan bus services are provided by the City Council. </para>
          <para>The 2 1 aldermen of the Council are directly responsible to their constituents for the nature and standard of the bus service provided in that area. While on the one hand it can be readily and undeniably demonstrated that Brisbane's bus service is best administered by the City Council, it is most difficult to justify the Council's having to bear from the general rate the majority of costs associated with providing this fundamental service. If it is accepted that the provision of unprofitable bus services in Brisbane is a legitimate metropolitan function, then it is difficult to understand why that should be funded from general taxation and duties. No other capital city in Australia funds its public transport services from property taxes. Every metropolitan public transport undertaking in other States and the suburban passenger division of the Queensland railways derive their funding support from the Consolidated Revenue accounts of their respective States. </para>

            <para>Most private health insurance funds apply a pre-existing illness exclusion in relation to supplementary (i.e. non-basic) benefits tables. The tables in question operated by Medibank Private are supplementary tables. Pre-existing illness exclusions have a long-standing history in private health insurance and have applied to supplementary insurance since the advent of such insurance in 1975. Exclusion provisions in respect of pre-existing illnesses have been permitted to protect the funds from abuses. To a large degree, such exclusions assure the funds of continued financial viability. Since the advent of supplementary health insurance, the funds have been allowed latitude for innovation and flexibility in respect of such insurance. They have been given a degree of freedom to determine the nature and extent of supplementary benefits provided, and the terms and conditions applied in the payment of those benefits. </para>
            <para>The above arrangement in relation to supplementary insurance has operated quite satisfactorily over the years. This is because the funds generally have interpreted their rules in a compassionate and sensitive manner. It was only recently that it came to the Government's notice that one fund was applying its rules relating to supplementary benefits to discriminate against chronic sufferers. Legislation was enacted to protect the rights of contributors whose claims for benefits are refused by funds on the grounds of improper discrimination in relation to: chronic or particular conditions; the age of a person; frequency of rendering of medical services; the amount or extent of benefits paid or payable or any other matter prescribed by regulations. </para>
            <para>I am examining the application of funds' rules in the light of this legislation. </para>

Whilst the union has in mind the heavy losses incurred in providing this service, it has made representations to the Australian Telecommunications Commission asking for a review of what seem to be very heavy charges and for some added measures to be taken to publicise renewed services. I ask the Minister whether he would be good enough to request his colleague to consider the representations that have been made by the Union about whether some modest increase might be applied and whether some review of services could be made urgently. </para>

            <para>I am advised by Telecom Australia that a marked decline in the use of Australian public telegram and lettergram services has occurred over a number of years. This decline has been accompanied by a growth in telephone and telex services, however, the Commission is most concerned at the annual losses consistently being incurred by the telegram service. </para>
            <para>In 1977-78, after allowing for tariff increases and cost reductions, the public telegram service recovered only SO per cent of its costs from telegram users. The subsidy, therefore, paid by telephone customers to maintain the telegram service was $9.00 per telephone service. Had charges remained at 1974-75 levels the subsidy would have approximated $ 1 2.00 per telephone service. </para>
            <para>Further tariff changes were introduced from 1 October 1978 in order to reduce the extent to which the service was subsidised. </para>
            <para>Under the new system there is a fixed charge, which reflects the underlying costs incurred in handling each telegram, plus a charge for each word contained in the message with a minimum of 12 words. The word rate remains unaltered at 1 5 cents. For ordinary rate telegrams to a street address the fixed charge is $1.50 and telegrams attracting this charge are delivered by the fastest normal method available at the office of destination. A lower fixed charge to 50 cents applies where the sender addresses his telegram for delivery by telephone or to a telegraphic code address. If addressed for delivery by telex or mail there is no fixed charge component and the charge for the message is calculated solely on the word rate. </para>
            <para>Although lettergrams were a little cheaper to handle than telegrams, the revenue per word derived from lettergrams was much lower than that from telegrams and consequently the service was most uneconomic. In view of the unfavourable economic position of the service and the fact that demand had so declined that it was being utilised by very few of Telecom's customers, it was decided that the service would be replaced, from 1 October 1 978,. by the mail delivery telegram service. </para>
            <para>This financial year a loss, on average, is still being incurred on each originated telegram and, consequently, any successful action by the Commission to promote the use of the telegram service, as suggested, would only result in an increased loss in this area of its operations. The Commission has an obligation under the Telecommunications Act to cover its operating costs and provide at least 50 per cent of its capital needs from revenue. Any increased losses, therefore, could only be covered by the Commission raising the charges for its other telecommunications services. The Commission believes that any such promotional action would not be in the best interest of its users overall. </para>

            <para>Because of differences in (a) the basis of collection and ( b) workers' compensation laws, the statistics are not uniform between States and cannot be directly combined to give national totals. However the Department of Productivity, in consultation with the Australian Bureau of Statistics and the State Departments of Labour, produces estimates of the national situation. </para>
            <para>The following estimates are based on statistics of claims finalised during 1973-74 under workers' compensation insurance and on special extractions compiled by the Australian Bureau of Statistics from data supplied by the States. Unfortunately the estimates for 1973-74 are the latest available from the Department of Productivity, and even these can only be regarded as approximations. For 1973-74, fatalities are estimated at about 300, temporary disabilities involving the loss of one or more working days or shifts are estimated to be 360,000 and working time lost from disabilities of one day or longer, 1 ,0 1 0,000 man weeks. </para>

            <para>Has the Minister's attention been drawn to reports in yesterday's Brisbane 'Telegraph' that a Liberal Federal Minister and a Liberal back bench member of the House of Representatives declared a holiday for the Everton Park State Primary School in Brisbane? Has the Minister's attention also been drawn to the comment from the Queensland Education Department that Federal members of Parliament, including Cabinet Ministers, had no right to go around handing out holidays to Queensland school children? In view of the distress caused to pupils and the relief of many mothers when the holiday did not eventuate yesterday, will the Minister lay down guidelines to his Liberal colleagues in relation to the granting of such holidays? </para>
          </quote>
          <para>The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>I now have information from all State education authorities. The situation is that the granting of holidays in State schools is strictly governed by regulations. Although these vary from State to State, visiting Federal Parliamentarians have no rights to grant holidays. In all cases, the prior approval of the State Minister would be required, together with the concurrence of the school principal and school council. As State authorities are anxious to restrict the number of additional holidays granted, it would seem that approval to grant a holiday should be sought only in exceptional circumstances. </para>
            <para>Some State authorities have also commented in more general terms on the question of school visits by Federal parliamentarians. Although there are no formal procedures laid down, it is very clear that all States would like normal courtesies to be observed on all occasions. When visits are planned without specific invitations from schools, members of Parliament should contact the office of the State Minister to seek approval, and ensure that principals and school councils are informed. </para>
            <para>When invitations to visit are issued to members direct by individual schools (eg for national flag presentations), it can usually be assumed that the school has undertaken to notify the appropriate authorities. In such circumstances, however, it might be desirable also for members to notify the office of the State Minister. </para>

            <para>Australia Post has assured me that it is very conscious of the communications problems of people living in remote areas of Australia. </para>
            <para>While mail is delivered to as many station properties as practicable there are some stations where delivery services are not provided. Mail is only one of the commodities for distribution in outback areas and is generally so small in volume that it is rarely practicable for Australia Post to provide a transport service purely for mail conveyance. Mail deliveries to station properties in these areas are provided generally where they can be associated with an existing transport service for the carriage of passengers or goods. The establishment of mail delivery services is thus determined largely by the overall transport needs of the area and the transport services available. </para>
            <para>Whilst no provisions exist under postal legislation which would provide relief for outback families where children are being educated by correspondence, the Government does provide correspondence allowances under the Assistance for Isolated Children scheme. This scheme is administered by the Minister for Education. </para>

Has the Centre Party in Sweden been thrown out of office by the Social Democrats on a pre-uranium issue? Does this mean there is now in office in Sweden a predominantly Labour government dedicated to making Sweden the world 's most advanced nation in harnessing nuclear fission? Is it a fact that the Australian Broadcasting Commission has not reported any of these events?

Have these negotiations been going on for nearly three months. Is it true that the negotiations now seem to have stalled so that Australia is in danger of losing $60m to $80m in offset manufacturing arrangements and may lose the opportunity to acquire some of the most sophisticated air frame manufacturing equipment in the world. In view of the importance of this offset manufacturing to the future of Australia's aircraft industry and defence production capability for the next decade, what steps is the Government taking to ensure that these offset contracts are not lost to the country. </para>

            <para>Early this year, the Government and the Australian aircraft industry became aware that the Boeing Airplane Company was contemplating launching new civil aircraft programs in 1 978. As a result of approaches made, Boeing offered Australian participation in the Boeing 767 project on a commercial basis, as it had already done to the Italian and Japanese industries under long standing arrangements. </para>
            <para>The manufacturing task offered by Boeing was for the sole source manufacture of Boeing 767 wing ribs. Hawker de Havilland Australia Pty Ltd was to be the Australian prime contractor, with a substantial part of the work to be subcontracted to the Government Aircraft Factories. Substantial investment in capital facilities was required. The value of the task was in the order of $50m. </para>
            <para>In the development of an Australian program to meet Boeing's manufacturing requirements, including cost estimates and pricing proposals, Hawker de Havilland worked closely with the Government authorities concerned, primarily the Department of Productivity and its Government Aircraft Factories. The pricing proposal was framed to recover all direct costs of production as well as investment costs; some fixed overheads of the manufacturing organisations (already financed from Departmental appropriations) were not apportioned to the project in the pricing proposal. </para>
            <para>In September and October, Boeing negotiated in US with senior executives from Hawker de Havilland and the Government Aircraft Factories. These negotiations were supported by the Government. However, in the event Boeing did not accept the price offered by the Australian industry and has since placed the work elsewhere. </para>
            <para>The Australian Government and the Australian Aircraft industry are disappointed at losing this contract which would have represented a substantial workload for the industry and a major gain in technology. However, in the Government's judgment the pricing offered by the industry was the lowest that could be made commensurate with the inherent risks associated with a new civil aircraft program. </para>
            <para>The Government recognises offset work such as this to be of major importance to the aircraft industry as a source of workload and technology contributing to our overall defence production capability. Several major US and European aircraft companies have placed offset orders on Australian industry. Indeed Boeing has within the last two months placed further orders valued at about $20m on both Hawker de Havilland and the Government Aircraft Factories for major components for Boeing 727 aircraft, bringing the total quantities ordered to 972 ship sets. I expect that further orders will be placed in Australia in line with the continued world wide orders Boeing is receiving for that extremely successful aircraft. </para>
            <para>Offset work will continue to be sought from overseas companies supplying Australia with major equipment such as, in the aircraft field, civil aircraft for the airlines and military aircraft for Defence. The offset proposals made by suppliers are one of the criteria against which competing proposals are judged. Nevertheless the Government recognises that Australian industry must be cost competitive in bidding for offset work, and there is a limit to the level of support the Government can provide. </para>
            <para>Achievement of offset work requires an energetic and hard working business approach by the Australian industry. So far the Australian aircraft industry has received offsets valued at nearly $120m, and I see no reason why the industry should not continue to win substantial offset orders in the future. </para>

          </talk.start>
          <para class="block">Association. The Treasurer has provided the following information in answer to the honourable senator's question: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>In his Electorate Talk of 29 October 1978, the Prime Minister stated that: </para>
            <para>The facts are clear. Let's look at a taxpayer with a spouse and dependent child on average weekly earnings of $220.38. Under Labor's 1975 Budget tax scales, in January next year, that taxpayer would be paying tax of $49.85 per week. Under this Government, he will be paying only $40.85 a week- and this includes the 1.5 per cent temporary tax surcharge. Accordingly, despite the surcharge, the taxpayer on average weekly earnings is $9 a week better off because of this Government's tax reforms. This figure takes no account of the family allowance scheme which provides mothers with significantly higher benefits than the old child endowment'. </para>
            <para>The amounts of $49.85 and $40.85 are the appropriate PA YE deductions for a weekly income of $220 under the schedules effective from 1 January 1976 (introduction of scale announced in 1975-76 Budget for PA YE purposes) and 1 November 1978 respectively. This calculation accurately shows how much less is paid now by a taxpayer currently receiving average weekly earnings, than would be paid by him if the present Government had not introduced any reforms to the personal income tax system, but had continued to levy income tax on the basis of the Hayden system and rate scale. </para>
            <para>In the leading article of <inline font-style="italic">The Taxpayer</inline> dated 1 8 November 1 978, which is published by The Taxpayers ' Association the Prime Minister's statement is described as being 'misleading' and it is suggested that in fact, the average man is 'more than $7.50 a week worse ofT. The conclusion drawn by the Taxpayers' Association relates to a completely different comparison to that made by the Prime Minister. </para>
            <para>The analysis by the Taxpayers ' Association seeks to compare the real disposable income of a taxpayer receiving average weekly earnings and with a wholly dependent spouse and two children in 1975-76 and 1978-79. In respect of 1975-76 the average earnings level selected is $8819, which is the average level for the whole of the 1975-76 year. In respect of 1978-79, however, average earnings are assumed to be $ 1 1 ,2 10 which is (or is very close to) the yearly equivalent of average weekly earnings for the June quarter 1978. The Budget estimate of 7.5 per cent implies that the level of average earnings for the whole of 1 978-79 will be about $ 1 1 ,700. In order to maintain a consistent approach as to the level of average earnings in each year, the appropriate levels would be $8819 and $11,700. </para>
            <para>To summarise, the conclusion drawn by the Taxpayers Association does not contradict the Prime Minister's statement because two quite different comparisons are involved. Further, the calculation by the Taxpayers' Association uses an inappropriate earnings figure for 1978-79 which produces misleading results. </para>

It was suggested in the question that the minimum amount that might be claimed as a gift could be lifted above the present $2 and that a review be made of the organisations which are eligible for the gifts concession. The Treasurer has provided the following information for answer to the honourable senator's question: </para>
          </talk.start>
          <quote>
            <para>As I understand the purpose of increasing the $2 minimum, it would be to put donors in a position where they could not claim an income tax deduction unless they increased the size of their gifts, possibly substantially. I am not in favour of any such change to the gift provisions. Whether it would lead to greater or smaller giving I could not say without a good deal more research, but one thing is obvious: any increase in the minimum would quite unfairly penalise the donor whose gift has to be small because that is all he or she can afford. </para>
            <para>I am more attracted to the idea of a review of the coverage of the gift provisions which, as the honourable senator has suggested, may no longer be altogether appropriate to present community needs and funding patterns. There could, of course, be losers as well as gainers from such a review, and quite recent experience suggests that the possibility of losers emerging from a review can generate strong feelings. I shall, however, keep the idea in mind. </para>

            <para>The original intention was that the Bill would be debated together with the Fisheries Amendment Bill and the Continental Shelf (Living Natural Resources) Bill. However, the Government decided that the Bill should not be proceeded with pending the outcome of the Inquiry into Whales and Whaling. The Report, which the Government is now considering, will undoubtedly lead to a review of the Government's policy on whaling and it seemed appropriate at that time not to proceed with the Bill until the Report and its implications had been fully considered. </para>

          <para>The Minister for Productivity has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>It is true that, at present, the Commonwealth Government has declined to provide further financial assistance to Pritchard Steam Power Pty Ltd to allow it to continue its tests on the 3 power units already made for the company by the Commonwealth at no cost to the company. The present grant has not been curtailed, nor has the company yet spent all the moneys provided. The present Government position is based on the rather slow progress the company has made in the tests with the money now being provided, its failure to raise the supplementary funds that it undertook to raise when the present agreements were entered into, and the lack of success the company has had in generating any contributing interest in its work on the new power units. </para>
            <para>I understand that the company has recently run into some mechanical problems with the units which are likely to delay progress for a while; I do not have specific details. </para>
