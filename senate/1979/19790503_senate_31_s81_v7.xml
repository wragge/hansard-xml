        <para class="block">To the Honourable the  President  and Members of the Senate in Parliament assembled. The petition of the undersigned respectfully showeth: </para>
        <para>That in spite of numerous measures taken by various governments, unemployment in the country has not significantly declined. </para>
        <para>As a result, supplies of both goods and services have declined; human resources are wasted, capital resources are not used and natural resources are left under-developed. </para>
        <para>Both local and overseas experience shows that prosperity is encouraged when taxes, which penalise production are replaced by taxes which provide incentives for productivity. These also provide disincentives to idle speculation such as that which results in so called 'windfall profits' from land price increases. </para>
        <para>The reduction of Income-tax, Sales-tax and Payroll tax is known to reduce the costs of production and to stimulate demand. </para>
        <para>It is also known that when Land Tax or Council Rates are raised on the unimproved site value of land, then the development of vacant land and under-developed slum areas is stimulated. </para>
        <para class="block">It follows then, that the gradual replacement of taxes on production with taxes on non-production will create new employment, reduces the costs of production, reduces the rate of interest, the cost of housing and stimulates all industries. </para>
        <para>We wish to point out that the replacement of production penalising taxes is a very practical proposal. According to official Municipal Valuations, it is estimated that unimproved Site Values have increased from $37,000m in 1973-74 to $67,000m by 1976-77. This represents $30,000m so called 'windfall profits' which was completely unrelated to productive improvements. </para>
        <para class="block">Your petitioners most humbly pray that the Senate, in Parliament assembled should act to relieve unemployment by Taxation reform to replace taxes on production with taxes which provide incentives for the increased supply of both goods and services. </para>

Before reaching the report itself, I wish to comment on the fact that there have been reports in a newspaper and on a radio program about the fact that the report is to be tabled, together with some comment on its content. I regret that an error on my part gave rise to these reports. Last night I gave what I meant to be a background briefing to two journalists. My intention in doing this was to ensure that the report was given adequate attention in the media on its tabling. I realise now that this was an error of judgment on my part, for which I apologise to the Senate. </para>

            <para>-Senator Wriedt has asked a series of questions about the sale of Hercules aircraft. I have some familiarity with that because the retendering was under consideration in the brief period when I was Minister for Administrative Services. I am advised by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr McLeay,</inline> the present Minister for Administrative Services, who actually saw the matter through, that the successful tenderer was Parmax Inc. which is a Texas corporation. I am not able to advise whether the company has an agency in Australia. I will refer that aspect of the question to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr McLeay</inline> for further information. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wriedt</inline> also asked for the price. I am advised that the tender price was $A10,2 12,000. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>My understanding is that it was not possible to arrange approval of the end user prior to the tendering process. It was necessary for the process to be one which was subject to the subsequent approval of the United States authorities. The stipulation that the sale was subject to the United States Government's indicating its concurrence was a condition of the original government to government agreement covering the initial purchase of the aircraft. Action is being taken to seek such concurrence from the United States Government. As far as I know, that action has not yet been completed and the United States Government has not yet given its approval to the sale to the successful tenderer. </para>

Will the Minister clarify with his colleague, the Minister for Administrative Services, whether a previous contract tenderer had submitted a successful tender or one which would have been acceptable to the Australian authorities, or the Australian department, but which was refused because the end user provisions could not be obtained from the United States State Department? </para>

            <para>- Oil consumption is, of course, rising throughout the world. Even with additional supplies from China, Mexico, Alaska and the United Kingdom, supply and demand will remain extremely closely matched in the foreseeable future. Both Mexico and China have recently emerged as potentially significant suppliers of oil within the next few years. Mexico, with oil reserves which are about 12 times those of Australia and are continuously being upgraded, exports some 700,000 barrels a day, mainly to the United States of America. The United States is likely to remain the major customer. Mexico has announced ambitious plans to increase its oil exports between now and 1985, but without threatening the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries. China is also developing an export potential. Japan is currently the largest customer but has apparently experienced difficulty in obtaining the contracted quantities. </para>

          <para>The present refinery configuration and product mix in Australia are not well suited to Chinese crude, although the position could well change in future. Honourable senators will be interested to know that a cargo of Chinese crude was tested in an Australian refinery some years ago. Naturally it is in Australia's interest to diversify its sources of crude oil supply, particularly if, as expected, our level of self-sufficiency declines over the next few years. An increased number of sellers in the market-place can only be to our advantage. </para>

            <para>- I refer the Minister representing the Prime Minister to recent claims by members of the Australian Petroleum Exploration Association that the oil industry expects to be drilling on the Great Barrier Reef within two to five years. I ask the Minister whether his attention has been drawn to the statement by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Greg</inline> Swindon, the Association's Queensland  chairman,  that people can be convinced within the next five years that the objective of looking for oil on the Great Barrier Reef is not precluded by the preservation of the reef? If so, will he comment on the serious implications of this claim? In the interests of both Australian and world heritage, will the Minister assure the Senate that the Government will not yield to pressure from the oil companies to permit drilling on or in the vicinity of the reef, and will he inform the Senate when the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Act, designed to ensure the protection of the whole of the reef, will be put into active operation? </para>

            <para>- At the outset let me deal with the latter parts of the question. The Government is unqualified in its policy that no harm whatsoever shall come to the Great Barrier Reef from any cause including drilling or searching for minerals, oil or otherwise. That policy is without qualification. Secondly, it is within that thought that the Government took the action to establish the marine national park. I do not know the time-table. I will seek that answer. </para>

I remind the Leader that he indicated that there would be no substantive grounds, or words to that effect, for the  chairman  of the Australian Petroleum Exploration Association referred to by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Missen</inline> to believe that drilling may take place on the Great Barrier Reef. Is it not a fact that during the 1977 election campaign a joint Cabinet submission from the then Minister for National Development and another Minister- I think it was the then Minister for Environment, Housing and Community Development- seeking approval to drill on the Great Barrier Reef was made public? Will the Minister verify in the course of his further inquiries whether such a submission was in fact placed before Cabinet two years ago? </para>

Clearly <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Willis</inline> has simply misunderstood the figures which have been put before the Parliament. Rather than a reduction of 64 per cent to the National Aboriginal Conference, the fact is that the Conference will receive in this financial year $109,000 more than the funds which were originally provided. The expenditure against the original appropriation in December 1 978 was $ 1 82,000 against an appropriation for the year of $505,000, together with $320,000 against the original special appropriation of $7 1 3,000, making a total expenditure to December 1978 of $502,000. In Appropriation Bill (No. 3), $825,000 is being provided to meet the continued costs to the NAC for the balance of the financial year. So, the overall funds provided for the year 1978-79 will be $ 1.327m which represents an increase of $ 109,000 over the $ 1 .2 1 8m originally provided in division 120.5. </para>

          <para>I think this is an important matter.

They will find the relevant section on page 33. 1 hope that members of the Opposition will cooperate with me in assuring the Aboriginal people that it is not an area of cut but an area of increased allocation. I was helped by an interjection from <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cavanagh</inline> who, I think, was wondering why we were increasing it. I refer him to page 34 of the explanatory notes. </para>

            <para>- As I think has been said by the Minister for Employment and Youth Affairs recently, the Government is giving attention to the manner in which the work test is applied to those who are seeking unemployment benefits. There is no contemplated change in the Act for which I am responsible, but the Commonwealth Employment Service in its application of the work test, I think, is seeking to uphold the requirements of the Act, that is, that people who are seeking work are available for work and accept the work that is offered to them. In the meantime, I believe, the Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations is giving attention to this matter in conjunction with my Department through its administrative processes. I assume that if there are to be any changes in the application of the work test at some time in the near future, an appropriate statement will be made. </para>

I refer to the amounts of money that pensioners are able to earn while still retaining full eligibility for pension entitlements. I understand that at present the sums are $34.50 for a married couple and $20 for a single person and that these sums have not been altered since 1972. In view of the fact that wages have increased considerably during that period and that the value of the dollar has been eroded, will the Minister give favourable consideration to increasing these sums when she is giving consideration to submissions from her Department for the forthcoming Budget? </para>

            <para>- In the early part of his question the honourable senator mentioned some figures of allowable free income. Those remarks were correct, except that I should state also that these amounts may be higher when there are dependent children. The amounts that were stated by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Jessop</inline> came into force in October 1972. I do not disagree with him that they have not been increased since that date, but perhaps I could point out that the limits of income at which pension entitlement ceases increase automatically with each increase in the pension rate. For instance, in October 1972 a single pensioner could have had other income of op to $60 a week before the pension ceased. For a married couple the limit was $103.50. We could compare those figures with the present limits which are $126.40 in the case of a single pensioner and $211.90 a week for a married couple. These limits also may be increased if there are dependent children. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>I note the remarks of the honourable senator with regard to pre-Budget discussions and recommendations that may be made. All matters of this nature are considered in the Budget context. I am unable to comment further on that, except to say that raising the free area of income has an expenditure connotation. For instance, if we were to increase the sum from $20 to $30 for a single person with a $20 increase for married pensioners, an estimated $60 m increase in the allocation for pension payments would be required. However, I state that only as an indication of the expenditure which would be required if increases were decided upon in the present Budget deliberations. But I am unable to speculate about those changes. </para>

I have now received advice on the matter from senior counsel. I am giving that advice consideration and will be making a recommendation to the Government. I do not propose to say any more about the matter at this stage, except that I understand that some representations in relation to changes in the method of operation of that body may be coming forward.

            <para>- My question is directed to the Leader of the Government in the Senate as it involves or should involve major government policy. Last year and again last month I raised in Question Time the matter of inadequacies in the siting and construction of a nuclear reactor in the Philippines which, in terms of our contract with that nation, would be fuelled with Australian uranium and hence, in terms of our nuclear safeguards agreement, is or should be a matter of direct and urgent concern to Australia. Has the Government yet investigated the allegations that the reactor is sited in a notoriously active earthquake zone close to five active volcanoes and that concrete of inadequate strength is being used in its construction, and any other matters that might give concern? If the Government has not yet made this investigation, when will it do so? </para>

            <para>- Arising out of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Mason's</inline> interest in this matter, I had sought and obtained information. It was available in reply to his previous question. I now make it available to him in response to his current question. There has been comment and speculation about geological factors at the site of the Philippines nuclear power project. To place these reports in perspective, it should be remembered that a number of nuclear power stations have been built in countries which, like the Philippines, are subject to earthquakes. It seems reasonable to assume that in these cases it has proved possible to meet the concerns of the local authorities, which are responsible for safety and environmental requirements. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>As the Foreign Minister said in the House on 6 April last year, safety aspects are an important matter but separate from the non-proliferation safeguards. Unlike non-proliferation safeguards they are a matter of domestic responsibility and jurisdiction for each country. We expect the Philippines to take such precautions. However, the Government endorses fully the importance of internationally agreed standards in these areas. Australia is participating actively and constructively in international discussions on these matters in forums such as the International Atomic Energy Agency, the Nuclear Energy Agency of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development and the International Nuclear Fuel Cycle Evaluation. </para>

At present the question of renewal of permits for exploration has been suspended pending a government decision on oil drilling in the region following the outcome of the royal commission into exploratory and production drilling for petroleum in the area of the Great Barrier Reef. The transfer of a number of exploration permits from an Australian company to an American company does not change this situation nor does it, as the article suggests, place more pressure on the Federal Government to agree to the Queensland Government's demands to allow limited drilling. At present no drilling is taking place in the area of the reef. In response to an earlier question the Leader of the Government in the Senate indicated the attitude of the Federal Government to this matter and I think the honourable senator can be assured that no action will be taken in that area in the foreseeable future. </para>

            <para>-The answer to the first part of the honourable senator's question is yes, the Capricornia area has not been declared, and there is sound reason why it has not been. The Leader of the Opposition will be aware that few people have recognised the constitutional problems in relation to the Great Barrier Reef area. For instance, it was traditionally held that a three-mile limit was associated with the rights of the State. The recent judgment of the High Court of Australia, as the honourable senator will be aware, actually negated that belief. The Court ruled that from the low water mark out the territory had always been the responsibility of the central government. The honourable senator would know that following a Premiers Conference held some 12 months ago, negotiations were to take place between Premiers and Attorneys-General about the return to the States of certain rights over the seas and submerged lands which are associated with the adjacent State. Constitutionally, the States have rights over seas and submerged lands adjacent to them. That point is generally not considered in any demands upon the Commonwealth as to what it may do about the preservation of the Reef. It is my understanding that islands off the shore of Queensland have been traditionally Queensland territory. That subject may be one for legal dispute, but my understanding is that that is the situation. The reason why the Capricornia Reef has not been declared has nothing to do with the comment made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wriedt</inline> and it has nothing whatsoever to do with exploration in that area, it has been held up purely because discussions are taking place between Attorneys-General and Premiers as to where base lines may be finally drawn in relation to that territory. </para>

              <para>- I acknowledge that this is an important subject. I shall deal with the question in its separate parts. Of course there is no conflict between the answers given by the various Ministers. Clearly running through those answers has been an assurance by the Federal Government that it will do everything within its power to see that no harm is done to one of the world 's great natural phenomena and resources, the Great Barrier Reef. The Federal Government aims to establish a marine national park for that purpose. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Webster</inline> was correct in showing that some constitutional difficulties arise out of the questions of 3-mile and 12-mile limits. They are in the process of resolution. The Senate is well aware that there are divisions of State and Commonwealth powers and that these need resolution. In that light, the Commonwealth's attitude will always be to pursue such policies as will preserve the Great Barrier Reef. </para>

            <para>- I ask the Minister for Social Security a question about the mischievous rumours that were circulated earlier this week following Press and other speculation concerning class B and C widows pensions. Some rumours alleged reductions; others alleged that it was proposed that the pensions be abolished. All this has caused unnecessary anxiety, even panic, among widow pensioners. I ask the Minister: Was she consulted for clarification prior to the original speculation first being published? Is it realistic to expect that in a pre-Budget atmosphere there are any remedies to prevent those who would initiate speculation of this kind with the consequent anxiety in the community? Finally, is the Minister now satisfied that, following her clarifying statements on Tuesday and yesterday, the speculation and distress have been put to rest? </para>

            <para>- A number of questions have been raised. The first question asked whether I was consulted for clarification prior to statements being made in the Press with regard to widows pensions. I can give an assurance that I was not consulted. Had I been consulted the statement would not have taken the form that it took. I believe it is appropriate to say that a State and Federal government task force is looking at lone parents pensions. This task force was set up as a result of the discussion at the last State Ministers meeting, at which the States suggested that there ought to be one single lone parent's pension which would remove the anomalies and disparities between the pensions and benefits which are presently paid. That task force is still considering the matter and putting the facts together. It is hoped that its report will be available for the State Ministers meeting to be held on 25 May. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>The task force need not be regarded as a secret body. It was publicly stated in a Press statement following the State Ministers meeting that the task force had been established. Some comment about the work of the task force must have given rise to speculation about widows pensions. I simply say that it is a mischievous rumour without foundation and I believe that to have that rumour upsetting people and making them feel insecure is irresponsible reporting. There is no reason why a pensioner who has been receiving a widow's pension should believe that the Federal Government is going to change the income security system to the detriment of hundreds of thousands of people. There are over 200,000 people who are receiving either a widow's pension or a lone parent's pension of some kind. I can only say in a pre-Budget context that that is the assurance I can give. I stress that it is an assurance that indicates that there is no reason for people who are receiving a widow's pension to feel endangered or insecure at this stage. </para>

              <para>asked whether I am satisfied that the speculation will be put to rest. If I am to judge that matter on previous years' pre-Budget speculation in the Press, I have to say that I doubt that the speculation has been put to rest, or that needless distress will not be caused in relation to this pension or some other matter which relates to the income security system. I do not know what more is able to be done in a preBudget context because, if we start with one pension or benefit and deny rumours and speculation, we find that each Minister, in respect of every program in his or her department, is subjected to this sort of speculation. I am unable to do more than to say that this Government has given high priority to income security matters. To believe that this Government would irresponsibly change the income security system to the detriment of the people who are dependent upon it overlooks the record of this Government. </para>

            <para>- My question is directed to the Minister representing the Minister for Trade and Resources. By way of preface, I draw the Minister's attention to the fact that there is considerable delay in the supply of the conversion kits necessary to convert Canberra cars and taxis from the use of petrol to the use of liquefied petroleum gas. I also draw the Minister's attention to the fact that LPG is being retailed in Canberra at 10c per litre as against 26c per litre for petrol and there is very little discernible difference in the performance of vehicles, especially taxis. I ask the Minister: Is the Government genuine in its stated policy of conservation of hydro-carbon energy resources, when half of the energy of Bass Strait in the form of LPG is being exported to Japan? Will the Minister have an inquiry made into the reasons for the exorbitantly high cost of conversion to LPG usage? Will the Minister have an inquiry made also into the reluctance of the oil companies to press for more widespread use of LPG and thus conserve our petrol reserves? </para>

            <para>- I am unable to answer the question as to what quantity of seal products is brought into Australia but the general basis of the question has certainly prompted many letters to me from the Australian community in relation to this matter. I believe generally that the killing of any living thing probably causes much concern in the community. Although some people accept being a part of killing in some instances, in certain other instances it upsets them greatly. The information that has been given to me is that, of course, this is specifically a Canadian problem. The harp and hooded seals apparently are not identified as endangered species under the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora. Apparently differences of opinion exist on the effects that culling will have on the numbers and survival of the harp and hooded seals. My understanding is that the catch set by the Canadian Government in this instance is based on scientific advice from the Commission for North- Western Atlantic Fisheries and the Canadian Government departments. Apparently this advice is challenged by some conservation bodies with both national and international connections. I have noted that it has been said that killing by the method that is disclosed to us by way of news reports is the most acceptable method in the circumstances. My understanding is that there is very little importation of those products into Australia. </para>

Whatever the honourable senator's connections are, the fact that he is able to get confidential letters either to me or to the Minister for National Development must be something of concern to him as Leader of the Opposition.

            <para>- I recall <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Baume</inline> 's concern, which was expressed in a question to me several years ago, for the importance of democratic procedures applying to student affairs. I indicated at that time the responsibility of the autonomous institutions in this matter. I also indicated to this Senate and to the people of Australia that I was discussing with vice-chancellors and principals of colleges of advanced education the need for fair and democratic procedures to operate in student affairs. The Senate will recall that I have on many occasions taken that approach in public statements. The Commonwealth Government continued its efforts to improve the conduct of student affairs through discussions with educational institutions. In May 1978 the Prime Minister wrote to State Premiers suggesting that they should legislate to provide for voluntary membership of student associations at universities and colleges to achieve, amongst other objectives, a more democratic situation. The New South Wales Government declined to take this action. </para>

          <para>As to the subsequent parts of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Baume</inline> 's question, I was not aware of the specific situation at the University of Sydney to which he referred. I will arrange for my Department to inquire about the matter and consider whether I should take the action suggested by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Baume.</inline> As I said to him in my previous comment, the Commonwealth needs to ensure that it does not use a heavy-handed approach in these situations. The Government has already made its views very clear to the institutions and State governments. There is no doubt that there has been a substantial moderation in the conduct of student affairs over the past two years as a result of moderate students' assertion of their views. In these circumstances I believe that the Commonwealth should consider carefully the advisability of its seeking to intervene in specific problems at particular institutions. Nevertheless, I believe that we have a role. I am grateful for <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Baume</inline> 's question, which enabled me to make clear to the States, the institutions and to the community our view as to the democratic procedures that should apply and the responsibilities of institutions in that regard. </para>

This move will deny air travellers the comfort and convenience of a much larger aircraft than the replacement DC9s and in conjunction with the withdrawal of the daily Electra freight service, which was the subject of my question yesterday, will very severely restrict the air freight capacity available in Queensland. Will the Minister investigate this matter to ensure that it is not one more example of the airlines colluding to downgrade their services to Queensland? If the reason given for the withdrawal of the Boeings is 'the lack of tarmac and apron facilities at Mackay, Rockhampton and Coolangatta', how have the airlines operated happily and efficiently into these terminals for years with Boeings? If it is true that there are equipment deficiencies, will the Minister undertake to have these speedily rectified so that travellers in the most important tourist area of Australia are not further disadvantaged? </para>

            <para>- I have seen the article relating to a proposal to cut Boeing services which I understand came from the front page of this morning's edition of the <inline font-style="italic">Australian.</inline> The article indicates- this is my only source of information at this stage- that there are two reasons why the airlines propose to use the smaller DC9s. It is partly because of passenger loads and partly because of unsuitable facilities at three of the State's major airports. The article goes on to say that a Trans-Australia Airlines spokesman indicated that DC9s would adequately cater for the loads available, although it is not made clear whether that relates to both human and freight loads or simply to passenger traffic. But to the extent that passenger usage dictates the aircraft that are to be used or passenger numbers indicate that a particular aircraft should be used, I would not have thought that that was a matter for government interference. The facilities at the airports, which are the second area of concern, are obviously a matter of government responsibility. I will refer that area to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Nixon</inline> for comment and reply. </para>

            <para>- My question is directed to the Minister for Social Security and refers to the homeless persons assistance program. Is it a fact that, of some $3. 8m appropriated for the program this year, only about $2m is to be spent? Is it also a fact that, in the last four years, of $ 16.6m appropriated only $6. 8m has been spent? I ask the Minister to comment on the claim by the Council of Homeless Persons in Victoria that in Victoria alone all charitable and religious organisations have projects awaiting funding involving more than $ 1 m and that some of them have obtained bridging finance for salary and equipment subsidies on assurances from the Department of Social Security that they would be funded. If these claims are true, will the Government consider spending the $ 1 .9m which will revert to the Treasury in the next two months if it is not spent? </para>

            <para>- I have had no opportunity to check the accuracy of the figures that were cited by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Grimes,</inline> but it is a fact that each year the funds appropriated for this program that was established to assist chronically homeless men and women have not been spent. The under expenditure has occurred because projects have not commenced when anticipated, due to inherent delays in lead-up work. Additionally, I think it is important to note that very often there are community objections to local government approvals for homeless persons hostels. This has increased the delays considerably. I believe that it is to be regretted that this occurs when applications of this sort are made to establish a homeless persons centre. The funds allocated for projects which have not proceeded as anticipated are made available as the projects mature and as they require the funds. I would anticipate that the funds unspent this year on approved projects would be available in next year's Budget, just as they have been available in each previous year. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>Apart from capital grants for building projects, approximately $l.4m is made available to organisations to assist in the operational costs of centres. 1 will investigate what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Grimes</inline> has said with regard to those organisations that have anticipated approval and have obtained finance for recurrent expenditure pending approval of a capital grant. When the Homeless Persons Assistance Act was introduced the program was to run for three years. It has been extended by this Government to try to fulfil its purpose. It has certainly been shown to me that the program is a most desirable one and one that should be supported. </para>
          <para>
            <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Grimes</inline>mentioned the position in Victoria. It is of interest to note that recently <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Dixon,</inline> the responsible Minister in Victoria, accepted the Commonwealth's proposal that the State Government and the Commonwealth Government should have matching financial arrangements for youth emergency accommodation. The Victorian Government has recently announced, in conjunction with the Federal Government, a program to assist with the establishment of youth emergency centres. I am hopeful that other States will avail themselves of the Commonwealth 's offer of matching subsidies for a program of this kind directed towards youth who are increasingly using the homeless persons centres in large capital cities. </para>
          <para>As far as budgeting this year is concerned, I will be giving support for homeless persons assistance funds. Where approvals have been given and the work has not been completed, I anticipate that those funds will be available next year. I will also be stressing strongly that the recurrent funds for established programs have support in the Budget. </para>

              <para>- The Prime Minister has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question. A series of questions is on the Notice Paper asking each Minister to provide details of the expenditure associated with official travel overseas. Honourable senators will appreciate that, with the passage of years and changes in departmental structure, the clerical work required to find and tabulate the information requested would be very timeconsuming. Therefore, I am reluctant to ask departments to undertake the work involved. </para>
            </talk.start>
          </continue>
          <para>On the assumption, however, that there is some interest in obtaining details of overall costs of visits, including when officials travelled by chartered or VIP aircraft, the Prime Minister has asked his Department to attempt a calculation in respect of visits overseas by the former Prime Minister and the present Prime Minister. The honourable senator will recall also that, in the course of debate in the House of Representatives on 22 February this year, the honourable member for Shortland <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Morris)</inline> asked the Government to state the overseas travel undertaken not only by Ministers but also by associated officials. I refer honourable senators to the House of Representatives <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> at page  281. </para>
          <para>Accordingly, the following information is supplied: Revised figures have been prepared in respect of overseas travel by the Prime Minister and the former Prime Minister on the following bases: Firstly, the national fares of departmental officials have been calculated and subtracted from the cost of the visit when chartered aircraft have been used. Secondly, the cost of an overseas visit has been increased when a VIP aircraft has been used by adding a national cost for the aircraft, based on the hourly rate for the relevant aircraft. The notional fares for departmental officials have also been calculated and subtracted from the actual cost of the use of the VIP aircraft. Thirdly, visits to Papua New Guinea and New Zealand have not been taken into consideration. </para>
          <para>It will be appreciated that all calculations are notional only. In summary, the calculations show: Firstly, during the years  1973  to  1975,  the Prime Minister of the day made  1 1  overseas visits costing, on the adjusted figures, an estimated  $1,292,498-  which at present day prices is  $2,095,067.  He was accompanied by a total of  258  persons, including departmental officials. Secondly, during the years  1976  to  1978,  the present Prime Minister made nine overseas visits costing, on the adjusted figures, an estimated  $782,919-  at present day prices.  $896,185.  He was accompanied by a total of  170  persons, including departmental officials. </para>
          <para>A comparison between the three years of the former Government and the first three years of this Government shows the following: The number of Ministers who travelled overseas, excluding Papua New Guinea and New Zealand, between  1973  and  1975  totalled  130  and, between  1976  and  1978,  totalled  109.  The total number of days absent between  1973  and  1975,  excluding visits to Papua New Guinea and New Zealand, was  2,109,  compared with  1,578  between  1976  and  1978. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr President,</inline> 1  seek leave to incorporate in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> supporting statistical information. </para>

            <para>What action does Australia Meat and Livestock Corporation intend to take to ensure that those abattoirs killing for the Middle East market have the approval of moslem countries? </para>
            <para class="block">Answer </para>
            <para>A number of abattoirs in Australia have been slaughtering stock under Islamic ritual slaughtering requirements for many years. Over the year a substantial trade has been developed with the Middle East and other moslem countries. </para>
            <para>Generally speaking, the importing countries have been satisfied that the ritual requirements have been met and the growth which has occurred in the trade is evidence of this. </para>
            <para>However the arrangements for certifying that the ritual requirements have been met have varied somewhat, as between different abattoirs and different importing countries. Some questions have been raised about the adequacy of these arrangements. </para>
            <para>Accordingly, during 1978, the AMLC proposed to assume responsibility for supervising the performance of Islamic ritual slaughtering and providing the necessary certification. </para>
            <para>It proposed to the Australian Federation of Islamic Councils that a joint committee representative of the Corporation and the Council be established to lay down guide lines and provide overall supervision, that the Corporation employ moslem supervisors on its staff to approve meatworks and slaughtermen for the performance of ritual slaughter and to provide necessary certification. Where it was required by importing countries, the Australian Federation of Islamic Councils would provide additional certification. The Federation of Islamic Councils did not agree and that matter is still to be resolved. </para>
            <para>More recently, the new regime in Iran questioned the adequacy of moslem slaughter procedures in exporting countries. The Deputy Prime Minister immediately issued an invitation for a delegation of appropriate religious and other officials to visit Australia to inspect our procedures. This delegation arrived in Australia within the last two weeks and has since visited some 16 abattoirs which in the last two years have provided over 70 per cent of the Australian meat exported to Iran. The delegation found that the physical facilities were excellent, that the moslem procedures were being correctly followed but in some instances it questioned the  devoutness  of the moslem slaughtermen being employed. </para>
            <para>The delegation is expected to recommend that Iranian supervisors bc located in Australia for a further period to inspect and approve additional works. It is further expected that as a result of the visit, the present obstacles to the continuing meat trade to Iran will be removed. </para>
            <para>The AMLC has participated fully in assisting the Iranian delegation and has offered full facilitation for any further Iranian Officials who might come to Australia for this purpose. </para>

            <para>- During Question Time yesterday <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Button</inline> asked me whether I was aware of and what I could do about providing emergency grants of money to the Nunawading Legal Service, which has had to close a major portion of its services as a result of its having run out of funds. I indicated that I was aware of the matter and was looking into whether some emergency funds could be provided. In fact, two legal services, both in Melbourne, are in the same situation. They are the Nunawading Legal Service and the Tenants Advisory Service, both of which have made applications to me through the Commonwealth Legal Aid Commission. </para>

          <para>I am pleased to inform the Senate that I have been able to approve emergency grants of $10,500 to each of those services to allow them to continue for the time being until their finances can be placed on a more stable footing. Of course, future grants- at what level they will be made available, if at all- will have to be looked at in the Budget context. But this money should enable them to continue for the time being. It is hoped that they will be able to get funds from other sources. At present it seems as if the only way in which they will be able to continue is by getting support from the Federal Government. </para>

        <para class="block">As the record shows, I never said any such thing. </para>
        <para>Let me come now to what I believe to be the breach of the agreement to which I have referred. At the dinner adjournment I told <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Baume</inline> that, after the first reading, 1 would seek leave to move the second reading forthwith. He said that the Government would not agree to that. I then informed him that I would move for the suspension of the Standing Orders so that I could move the second reading forthwith. I said that at the beginning of that speech I would indicate that I would enter into no debate on pensions, and said that I would withdraw immediately my motion to suspend Standing Orders if the Government could give me an undertaking that a vote on the Bill would be taken before the Senate rose for the winter recess. I gave as my reason that that would take the Victorian election politicking out of the debate on my Bill. He said that he would put that proposition to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Carrick</inline> but believed that the answer would be in the negative. I then said that I would invite <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Carrick</inline> to respond by way of interjection in the course of my speech on the suspension of Standing Orders. </para>
        <para>It is my firm understanding that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Baume</inline> then said to me: 'All right, but I think the answer will be no'. From that statement I generally concluded that at that stage I would at least be permitted to speak to the motion. I heard nothing further from <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Baume</inline> from that time until <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Carrick</inline> rose immediately after the first reading had been moved and moved that the second reading be made an order of the day for a future day of sitting and that the question be now put. I believed that a clear undertaking that I could speak had been broken. I still hold that view very firmly. If any misunderstanding occurred between <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Baume</inline> and me, I for my part apologise. But it is my clear view that an undertaking was given and that the undertaking was broken. </para>

          <para>-by leaveSenator Georges says he is up in the air. That is something about which we might talk when dealing with the question of broadcasting. The report of the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal, which has just been brought down by the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Chaney)</inline> is not yet available to members of the Opposition. I have not had the opportunity of reading it. However, I do think that it is important that we note at this stage of the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal 's history that the achievement of all the aspirations of people who have been interested in broadcasting and concerned about standards, particularly in television, seem to have failed. If I might say so, in this Government an articulate Minister seems to be presiding over the greatest mess that this country has ever known in broadcasting. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>One of the signatories to this report of the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal, <inline font-weight="bold">Mrs Janet</inline> Strickland, resigned a month or so ago. In stating the reasons for her resignation, she made it quite clear that as far as she was concerned the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal was no longer serving, to some degree at least, its expressed aim of representing public interest in this country. Looking at the history of the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal, honourable senators will recall that it had its first hearings in Hobart late in 1976. On that occasion objection was taken to the appointment of the  Chairman  of the Tribunal, and objection was also raised in a more tentative way by certain other members to the constitution of the Tribunal. </para>
        <para>I believe that the most significant document on broadcasting in this country in recent years, and there are not many very significant documents, is the document to which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Puplick</inline> referred in his lengthy speech on the adjournment the other night, that is, the Green report on the inquiry into Australian broadcasting. There have been a number of other reports since, such as the report of the Tribunal itself on self-regulation in Australian broadcasting, and various other documents relating to ethnic broadcasting and things of that kind. But the Green inquiry, which was commissioned by the Government and presided over by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Green,</inline> who subsequently became the permanent head of the Department of Post and Telecommunications, really made a very credible attempt to assess the balance of forces within broadcasting in Australia, the future technological developments which were likely to take place, and matters such as the development of frequency modulation radio, the possible development of such technological innovations in this country as cable television, and related matters. </para>
        <para>However, more particularly the Green report laid down a structure for broadcasting which 1 think was basically acceptable to the broad stream of Australian public opinion concerned about balance within the broadcasting structure. For example, the Green report set out to define a role for the Australian Broadcasting Commission, a role which I think has declined in significance because of the same chaotic problems which possess broadcasting in the Australian Broadcasting Commission and are symptomatic of broadcasting generally in this country. There are organisational problems and problems of structure and balance, and the Opposition in the Senate has continually advocated that there should be a royal commission into the management of the Australian Broadcasting Commission, simply because the Commission seems to us to be suffering from a process of hardening of the arteries, a lack of imagination in management, perhaps an excess of fat in certain areas and certainly a drastic leanness in areas of programming and production. These imbalances are quite apparent in the Australian Broadcasting Commission. They are matters which were foreshadowed in discussions in the Green report. </para>
        <para>The other important elements of the broadcasting structure envisaged by the Green report, which as I say is an important and valuable document to go back to, were the need for the quite unique structure of Australian broadcasting, the high concentration of ownership in few hands, the need for certain checks and balances between private interest and public interest and the need to provide a system of public accountability of private broadcasters to a body such as the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal. Those notions which the Green report put forward and which could be regarded as impeccable in a society such as the United States, which has a very strong tradition with which we are perhaps unfamiliar in Australia of the need for public accountability in organisations and areas of this kind-- </para>

            <para>- Yes, and limited ownership, the tradition there being very different. I think the important point was that there should be a method of public accountability provided. The Broadcasting Tribunal was singled out as the vehicle to provide that method of public accountability. The Green report recommended a number of other bodies which would provide checks and balances in the broadcasting system. For example, for a long time there has been an important concern about children's television. There has been concern about the establishment of a broadcasting council. The Green inquiry recommended that. There has been concern about the establishment of a body to which the public could make complaints about television in particular and about broadcasting generally. None of these other bodies which were considered to be complementary to the Broadcasting Tribunal have been established by this Government because of pressure from owners of commercial television and radio stations. </para>
          </talk.start>
        </continue>
        <para>So, the whole system was aborted by the ideological fiat of this Government, right from the beginning. That is why the unhappy Minister for Post and Telecommunications <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Staley),</inline> who talks so glibly on television about it all, at this stage really finds himself in the centre of an unholy mess. Look at the mess he has got himself into now, when four members of the Broadcasting Tribunal, all ex-employees of commercial television, remain on that Tribunal. The only person identified in the public mind as representing the public interests because she was prepared to make a stand on a number of public interest questions, <inline font-weight="bold">Mrs Janet</inline> Strickland, has resigned. One might ask the Minister how <inline font-weight="bold">Mrs Strickland</inline> can be replaced. Does he continue the old form and replace her with another person from the commercial broadcasting sector? Where does he find a person who is prepared to accept the hot seat of standing up for the public interest on the Broadcasting Tribunal, as she manifestly did? </para>

        <para class="block">Tribunal? That is the sort of mess the present Minister has got himself into in regard to that matter. Time and time again one hears criticisms of the Tribunal. More recently, the criticism was not only because of the bizarre private behaviour of certain members of the Tribunal as entertainers rather than as quasi-judicial figures as they might be, but also because of the continued problems of trying to administer the Tribunal and take into account the question of public interest and receive submissions from members of the public about these very important questions of standards, for example, in television programming. </para>
        <para>There has been widespread publicity given to the recent Tribunal hearings in Sydney. They brought discredit on the whole system. Perhaps the system is wrong. If I might adapt an expression I have used about <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Carrick, Mr Gyngell</inline> has the problem of approaching every problem with an open mouth instead of an open mind. </para>

            <para>- It is also appropriate in the honourable senator's case. From time to time <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Gyngell</inline> has off the cuff volunteered certain ways in which this problem might be solved. The question that the Tribunal has to face up to now is whether it will take away the licence of a television channel because of misconduct of some kind. It is totally unreal and absurd to contemplate the licence of a television channel like Channel 7 or Channel 9 being taken away. Those of us who are concerned about the political predilections and economic interests of the owners of television stations will know that, by the very nature of the beasts, they cannot in any sense conduct a television channel which is representative of the public interest as one would hope it to be. </para>
          </talk.start>
        </continue>
        <para>For example, if we were to take a licence away from Kerry Packer, who would we give it to? Would we give it to Alan Bond? He would just run the station less efficiently. There is a tremendous problem in terms of vast resources tied up in television channels. It would be a bold government that tried to take away television licences. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Gyngell</inline> volunteered the view at some party that the best way to deal with defaulting commercial television channels that did not provide programs of adequate standard, was to introduce the notion of 'promise of performance'. In seeking the renewal of their licences the television channels in answer to public submissions would have to say: 'We will improve our programming in this way. We will provide more and better children's television. We will reduce the amount of advertising at particular times'. They would have to give that promise of performance to meet many of the public criticisms. </para>
        <para>
          <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Gyngell</inline>then volunteered the view, for which he obviously has been chastised in high places, that the way to administer the promise of performance would to punish defaulters, if I can put it that way, by fining them a substantial amount such as three months revenue- a few million dollars. This would be the penalty for failing to comply with their promise to provide programs of a certain standard. Of course, that is a very good suggestion which has a lot of merit and which the Government should consider. </para>
        <para>The debate on this matter has become very waffly with members of the public saying: 'We think all this is wrong with television'. The Tribunal then says: 'We cannot take away the licence that these people hold. We will renew the licence and we will pat you members of the public on the head. You can go away and come back in three years time and have the same gripes. We will treat you the same way'. That is the message that the members of the public have received. There is no satisfaction in it for them. </para>
        <para>The Minister for Post and Telecommunications <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Staley)</inline> has to face up to the task of marrying the notion of public accountability to the very important question of administering the system of licence holding. The Government has manifestly failed to do that. The basic reason for the failure is that it has not established the sort of checks and balances on the broadcasting structure which the Green committee of inquiry recommended almost three years ago. The Government has retreated from the brink every time in dealing with the hard issues such as establishing a broadcasting information office, which would make information about broadcasting available to the public. The Government has retreated from the hard issue of establishing a broadcasting council which would be responsible for advising the Government on broadcasting policy. It has retreated from the hard issue of granting public broadcasting licences to ethnic communities so that they can do their own thing, rather than having this ridiculous and absurd Special Broadcasting Service imposed upon them as some sort of Goebbels-like overview body which will supervise ethnic broadcasting in this country. </para>
        <para>Because it has retreated from all the hard decisions in the past under commercial pressure, the Government now finds itself in an incredible bind. It is important that we in the Senate try to point to ways out of that bind. Some of the ways have been referred to in the course of my earlier comments. </para>
        <para>The Broadcasting Tribunal system is in total disarray; it is in disrespect. It has little respect from the commercial operators and little respect from the public. It is a very bad thing for this Government and it is a bad thing for the Minister for Post and Telecommunications. I hope we will have further opportunity to debate these important issues in the Senate. However, it is important to state these matters now when the report of the Tribunal is being put down, and to state them in the context of recognising the significance of past mistakes in the contemporary situation which have resulted, as I say, in an utter mess in the broadcasting system of this country. </para>
        <para>
          <inline font-weight="bold">Senator CHANEY</inline>(Western AustraliaMinister for Aboriginal Affairs)- by leaveSenator Button said that he did not receive a copy of the report in .advance. My understanding of the practice is that statements are provided in advance and that reports of this nature are tabled, although on occasions, as an individual act, Ministers provide them earlier. But I understand there has been no breach of the normal arrangements between government and Opposition. </para>

          </continue><para>That the Senate take note of the report. </para><para class="block">On 2 June 1976 the Senate gave to its Standing Committee on Social Welfare a reference on the evaluation of the adequacy of Australian health and welfare services with four particular subreferences, lt is now my honour to present to the Senate the Committee's report on this matter. It is entitled <inline font-style="italic">Through a Glass, Darkly</inline> and represents the first of two companion volumes which will eventually be placed before the Senate. The second volume, not yet printed, consists of seven specially commissioned papers prepared by experts to cover aspects of evaluation too often ignored by Australian policy makers and not adequately dealt with in submissions made to the Committee. In particular, these include a paper to represent the views and concerns of agencies and another dealing with the problems which face any one of us as clients, as users, of our health and welfare services. </para><para>This has been an exceedingly difficult inquiry to conduct and to bring to fruition. It has required of the Committee that it should encompass a number of concepts of social theory and that it should organise a diffuse subject in a way which would lead to completion of its task. Because of the difficulties, the Committee sought from you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr President,</inline> and was granted, permission to obtain the services of a consultant. Professor Stephen Leeder, Professor of Community Medicine within the University of Newcastle, has assisted the Committee since 3 1 May 1 977 and has made a significant contribution to our deliberations. We thank him and his university for their co-operation. One feature of the inquiry has been the variable quality of evidence from some Federal Government departments and the contrasting excellent quality of evidence from, for example, the Councils of Social Service. </para><para>Evaluation is about knowing. What we have sought to assess is what mechanisms exist within the health and welfare systems in Australia that will enable anyone to know anything about how the various parts of the system work. What we have not sought to assess is how any particular agency or service operates in this <inline font-style="italic">country.</inline> We have not allowed ourselves to become arbiters of a particular program operated by a particular person or a particular agency. It is not known what benefits flow to Australian society from initiatives represented by annual Federal Government expenditures which had been $ 1,900m in 1970-71 and which rose to more than $ 10,000m in 1 977-78. This represented about 38 per cent of total Commonwealth expenditures last year. Although expenditure on health and welfare dominates annual budgeting at Federal Government level, little seems to be known about what effects this is producing. </para><para>Questions we have addressed include the following: On what basis do the health and welfare systems make policy and administrative decisions? Do the health and welfare systems know what needs exist in the community? Do the health and welfare systems know what each is doing, or should be doing, or what each has achieved over any period? These questions are not impertinent. Nor are they improper. They are central to the determination of whether our system or any system is or can be effective or efficient, or whether it is even the right system within which health and welfare services should be developing and operating. Nevertheless, for the purposes of this inquiry we have accepted the present system of health and welfare as the framework within which we examined Australian practice. We have to report to you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Acting Deputy President,</inline> that we are unable to present the answers to those simple questions after three years of endeavour. </para><para>In this report are gathered our Committee's findings. They are sombre and depressing. A committee of six senators cannot claim particular expertise in sociology or social theory, but it does claim a powerful position in seeking information on behalf of the Senate- even information not generally available. In spite of this powerful position, we could not obtain many, if any, of the answers to important questions which we sought- partly because people had not considered them and partly because they are challenging and difficult. We quite deliberately chose the title <inline font-style="italic">Through a Glass, Darkly</inline> to emphasise our concern that too little is known in the human services area in Australia. Too little is known of the working or effects of the Australian health and welfare system to enable proper and necessary decisions to be made for its management. </para><para>It appears that in Australia we do not know with any clarity what are our major needs or what is their dimension. It appears that we do not know the extent to which current interventions are adequate or whether they allow unmet need to remain; and it does not seem clear to us that there is adequate commitment to the regular determination of these needs or of deficiencies in programs allegedly designed to satisfy them. For all we know, in Australia there could be people who are starving or neglected, isolated or frightened, or whose needs are unseen; and Australia as a nation could remain comfortably unaware of any of the problems. There is little active seeking or measuring to guide us. </para><para>While the Committee has expressed its dissatisfactions with the way programs are developed, it is not unaware of the high value placed by consumers on many existing programs or benefits: and we certainly do not believe that serendipity cannot ever be one basis for effective intervention. On the question of needs, their importance and their determination, we must record our concern as a committee at the quality of evidence given on 4 July 1 978 by the Department of Social Security. This is discussed in the report where some verbatim evidence is quoted with disapproval. A supplementary submission by the Department dealt more adequately with the question of need. Foreshadowed in July 1978, it was not received until 9 March 1979, after the report had already been finalised for printing. In order that justice should be done to everyone, I have tabled the supplementary submission of the Department of Social Security and I make clear my view that it presents a more civilised and appropriate response than that given in oral evidence eight months earlier. We are indebted to the Director-General of Social Security for making available recently a publication which recounts some State experiences and approaches in evaluation in the United States of America. Entitled techniques for needs assessment in social services planning, it states: </para><quote>
            <para>The theme and recommendation of this manual is that much of the necessary planning for social services begins with a valid needs assessment. Subsequent decisions regarding which problems are to be resolved (to what degree) by the provision of social services and what methods will be used are best based on a thorough identification of the incidence and magnitude of problems and needs of persons in the State. </para>
          </quote><para class="block">This has been the view of the Committee throughout the inquiry. We are gratified that it is a view which the Director-General of Social Security as well now seems to have endorsed. </para><para>Apart from need, and its determination and delineation, there are other areas of gross inadequacy in Australian practice. Evaluation activity cannot proceed without agreed strategic goals and program objectives, without clearly stated standards, without data adequate in amount and quality, or without evaluation technologies and people trained to use them. All of these components are inadequately available in Australia. It seems inescapable that the health and welfare system has operated without clearly identified policy goals and program objectives, without an adequate system of social indicators, without clearly stated standards of provision or performance, without adequate evaluation technologies, without a pool of people trained to use such technologies as are available, and without resources committed to measurement and to knowing in the health and welfare services. We do not know, generally speaking, where we have been, where we are travelling now, where we should be travelling, or even whether our method of getting there is appropriate. </para><para>The Committee believes that the time is ripe for progress. We have made proposals for better evaluation practice which are low cost but which demand a commitment to better outcomes of programs. We have been careful not to use the non-government sector as a scapegoat for all the inadequacies in the system, but have tried to identify inadequacies in both government and non-government sectors. We have also noted the shortcomings of parliaments, ourselves included, in responding to, in encouraging and in demanding appropriate evaluation activity. Unless parliament plays a major role in encouraging, oversighting and undertaking evaluation activity, there will be very little improvement. </para><para>We have recorded and noted not only the shortcomings of the system but also the recent and increasing commitment of many persons, many agencies, many government instrumentalities and many departments to improving evaluation technology, commitment and practice. While we have addressed the shortcomings of the system, we have been careful not to criticise, at any time or in any way, managers of agencies whose resources have already been committed and stretched to service their clients as best they can. Because evaluation capacity and capability have been improving rapidly world wide in the last few years, we are hopeful that the situation in Australia might improve soon. If this report can serve as some stimulus to and as a basis for better practice in Australia, we shall be well satisfied. Whilst we would all want efficient health and welfare services, what we are seeking more than anything is services that are effective in doing something useful for the community that they have been established to serve. </para><para>The requests, recommendations and judgments contained in this report are not only proper; they are the minimum we could ask of prudent managers utilising enormous resources on behalf of society. If a health and welfare system, whether in the government or the non-government sector, cannot make itself effective and rational, reasonable observers may be led to conclude that the system itself is inadequate for what society expects from it. </para><para>
            <inline font-weight="bold">Mr President,</inline>it remains to me to express my personal thanks to my fellow Committee members for their continued application to a difficult task. The Committee is also grateful for the co-operation and assistance of State governments, of Commonwealth Government departments, of many voluntary agencies and of a large number of individuals who made submissions and gave oral evidence. It is a pleasure once again to thank the Australian Government Publishing Service for its very practical assistance. </para><para>Finally, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr President,</inline> it is a privilege on behalf of the Committee to thank a dedicated Committee staff for a quite monumental job during this inquiry. I commend the report to the Senate. </para>

            <para>- I wish to speak briefly to the motion. I begin by seconding the remarks of the  Chairman  of the Committee in thanking the staff very sincerely for the effort they put into the preparation of this very difficult report and for their tolerance of the rather strange ways of some of the members of the Committee, myself in particular. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>May I also thank the  Chairman  for the statement that he made at the outset of today's sitting, which relieved the rest of us from the obvious suspicion that last night someone had done something with the report that he should not have done. I must say that I do not believe the  Chairman  showed any particular lack of judgment in wanting to ensure that the media of this country had a proper knowledge of what was in the report. I am afraid that he has learned the lesson that a lot of us have learned, that we cannot always expect the media to act in the way in which we think they should under such circumstances. </para>
          <para>The overview of this report contains above it the quotation from Robert Browning, 'Ignorance is not innocence, but sin '. I think it is fair enough to say that the Committee concluded that, in the area of health and welfare and its evaluation in this country, we do in fact live in sin. As the  Chairman  has said, we were unable after three years of examination to reach the sort of answers that, at the beginning of our inquiry, we thought we might be able to reach. It was an interesting exercise to listen to and read the evidence given, lt was interesting in that what we thought were fairly innocent terms of reference were seen as a threat by those who gave evidence on behalf of some of the voluntary agencies and government departments. </para>
          <para>The  Chairman  and other members of the Committee had to spend a fair amount of time convincing witnesses after cajoling them to come before the Committee that their programs were not being evaluated individually and that we were looking at the system as a whole. It was also an interesting exercise in that some of those who took a most critical view of the evaluation of welfare programs in this country were representatives of welfare agency groups- the councils of social service- or of individual agencies. </para>
          <para>The views of those, from both the public and the voluntary sectors, who gave evidence varied from a satisfied complacency that all was well, that they were doing good by the world- some, one suspected, were not interested in the problem at all- to a very real awareness and concern that there was a problem and that, as the  Chairman  has said, we did not know where we had been, were not too sure where we were going, and certainly did not know how to get there. </para>
          <para>It is important to emphasise to those who are involved in the delivery of health and welfare services in this community that no member of the Committee has any desire to flood those who deliver benefits and services in this country with a torrent of bureaucratic red tape, with requirements that would inhibit the effectiveness of their programs. We do not want to surround them with forms and we do not want to force on them unnecessary evaluation, but we do want them to step back and have a look at what they are doing, as we want to step back and have a look at what we are doing, to convince them that the proper methods of evaluation are essential and to get them to recognise that evaluation plays a proper part. As stated on page 3 of the report, if we do not do this- if we do not evaluate properly, if we do not look at programs properly- the consequences can be, and I believe have been in the past, very severe. To quote from the report, the consequences can be:   . . indiscriminate cuts in funds, indiscriminate handing out of funds, continuance of the present ad hoc decision making process, perpetuation of the present inadequacies in the health and welfare system, and a possible lack of alternative solutions to problems in health and welfare. </para>
          <para class="block">We cannot go on in this way. Those of us who have become closely involved in this field have become more and more aware of the fact that with an aging population, with perhaps increasing constant levels of unemployment and with a reduced tax base, we are going to have to evaluate and to account far more and far more efficiently for the money we spend. I say in passing that Labor members of the Committee are certainly not under any illusion that the introduction of proper methods of evaluation or accountability will make unnecessary changes to the distribution of wealth, wages and power in this country, which we see as a basic problem behind the necessity for welfare. We hope that as a result of the report, all people in this country will take a step back and view the system as a whole, question some of the assumptions that we have made in the past which we have considered to be truth beyond question, and learn from the mistakes of the past so that in future the development of our system will treat more fairly those it is meant to help. I hope the report will receive more attention than some Senate reports have received in the past. I hope the response to the report will not be a feeling of threat or a feeling that anyone in the welfare or health community is under attack. I hope the report will be read in a rational and unemotional way, which I can assure members of that community was the way in which it was written. I seek leave to continue my remarks. </para>

            <inline font-style="italic">The statement read as follows-</inline>
          </para>
          <para>On 29 November 1978 the Minister for National Development <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Newman)</inline> announced in a Press statement a number of government measures designed to encourage the wider use of liquefied petroleum gas in Australia. One of these measures was a decision to remove naturally occurring LPG from the application of the Prices Justification Act. The effect of this decision was to bring the price of naturally occurring LPG into line with the price found justified by the Prices Justification Tribunal for exrefinery LPG. Thus the price anomalies which previously prevailed were removed. </para>
          <para>To offset the additional profits that the Bass Strait producers thus stood to realise from the higher prices on the domestic market the excise on all exciseable LPG production was adjusted upward from $12.60 to $13 per kilolitre. My colleague indicated at the time that the movement in the domestic price of naturally occurring LPG would be kept under review. Since that time the Prices Justification Tribunal has found justified further increases in the price for ex-refinery LPG totalling $27 per tonne. The latest increase became effective on 30 April and the producers have advised their customers that they are adjusting the price of naturally occurring LPG accordingly. </para>
          <para>These further increases in the price of naturally occurring LPG would thus lead to additional profits by the Bass Strait producers and the Government has therefore decided to offset this by a further increase in the excise on all exciseable LPG of $ 1 per kilolitre which will increase the rate from $ 1 3 to $ 1 4 per kilolitre. This decision is to take effect from today and my colleague the Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Fife)</inline> will table the necessary excise tariff proposal in this regard. </para>
          <para>The Melbourne price for both ex-refinery and naturally occurring LPG will now be about $ 1 10 per tonne. Thus the domestic price is now approximately the same as the freight on board export price and this should have a significant bearing on the further development of the sales of LPG on the domestic market. This, as honourable senators will know, is an important aspect of the Government's energy policy, especially in regard to the conservation of our increasingly scarce liquid fuel resources. </para>

            <para>- I wish to speak briefly in the adjournment debate. On 22 April- that is, last Sunday week- after nearly five months of dithering over monetary policy, the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Howard)</inline> announced a money package, a crucial and urgent component of which was that the Australian Wheat Board would be asked to sell $300m worth of bills on the commercial market and reduce its overdraft with the Reserve Bank of Australia commensurately. On 27 April, that is last Friday, it was reported that the Board had rejected the Government's request to do this. It stated that if the Government wished the Board to take this action it would have to issue a directive under section 1 8 ( 1 ) of the Wheat Industry Stabilization Act. The Board stated its belief that this was a matter of national economic management for which the Government and not the Board should accept responsibility, and therefore the Government should issue a formal directive. Incidentally, that is a view with which I concur. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>On the next day- that is, last Saturday- <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Howard</inline> announced that the policy would stand. The Minister for Primary Industry <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Sinclair),</inline> who alone has the power to direct the Australian Wheat Board under section 1 8 ( 1 ) of the Wheat Industry Stabilization Act- there is no other Act which gives any other Minister power to direct the Australian Wheat Board- said nothing. If <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Howard</inline> had accurately expressed Government policy, the required response was quite simple and quite clear. The Minister for Primary Industry should have immediately issued a directive to the Board to sell $300m worth of bills on the commercial market and repay the Reserve Bank advance. </para>
          <para>The  Chairman  of the Australian Wheat Board, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Leslie</inline> Price, appeared on the program <inline font-style="italic">National Farm Report</inline> last Monday and reinforced that statement which had come from the Board on the Friday that the Board would require a directive from the Government before it would take any action. Among other things, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Leslie</inline> Price said:  1 don't think the board ever believed that by refusing or not agreeing to comply-- </para>
          <para class="block">That is with the request-  is not an actual refusal because under the act it can't refuse if that is what the Government wishes to do. But it was virtually saying that we can't accept that responsibility on behalf of the growers. </para>
          <para class="block">The words are somewhat confused, but in the last sentence he says that 'we'- that is the Board- 'cannot accept that responsibility on behalf of the growers'. On behalf of the Board, the  Chairman  reiterated the statement made on Friday, 27 April, that the Board would require a formal directive from the Government before it would take any action. </para>
          <para>Yesterday in the House of Representatives, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Howard</inline> was questioned on this matter by the honourable member for Grey <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Wallis).</inline> It was quite clear that he had no idea what it was about, and after an embarrassing silence during which he was briefed by the Minister for Primary Industry, he answered by saying, among other things: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>The honourable member is theoretically correct when he says that, just as with any other bank, once an overdraft limit has been agreed between the bank and the customer it is a breach of that arrangement for the bank unilaterally to withdraw that particular facility. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">The point of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Wallis</inline> 's question was whether the Reserve Bank of Australia had any power to direct the Board to reduce its overdraft. I repeat the Treasurer's answer: </para>
          <list type="lowerroman-dotted">
            <item label=".">
              <para>. Once an overdraft limit has been agreed between the bank and the customer it is a breach of that arrangement for the bank unilaterally to withdraw that particular facility. </para>
            </item>
          </list>
          <para class="block">Looking past the portuous prose, what the Treasurer was saying there was that the Reserve Bank does not have any power to direct the Wheat Board. </para>
          <para>The Minister for Primary Industry was then asked whether he had issued a directive to the Australian Wheat Board and he replied unequivocally no. In doing so, of course, he was tacitly admitting that he was shirking his duty to implement government policy as stated by the Treasurer last Saturday- that is, that the Australian Wheat Board would be required to comply with Government policy. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Sinclair,</inline> as Minister administering the Wheat Industry Stabilisation Act, clearly shirked his duty to direct the Board to comply with government policy in accordance with section 18(1) of that Act. Nobody disputed that this unequivocally gives the Minister power to direct the Wheat Board on any matter concerning its functions and duties. </para>
          <para>Of course, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Sinclair</inline> was waiting for the Wheat Board to cave in, as he knew very well it normally did when subjected to pressure from National Country Party Ministers.  His  judgment, or his gamble, paid off today. It was stated by the Treasurer in the House of Representatives that an agreement had been reached between representatives of the Wheat Board and of the Reserve Bank that the Wheat Board would reduce its advance and sell $300m worth of bills on the commercial market. As I understand it, these negotiations were conducted by the  Chairman  of the Board, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Leslie</inline> Price, and the General Manager, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Williams,</inline> who incidentally on an earlier occasion, to cover up for the Government, lied to the financial Press about the Wheat Board 's funding arrangements, or about the fact that the Wheat Board had suspended payments to growers late in January because it had run out of money. When questioned, the Wheat Board in Melbourne knew nothing about the agreement which the Treasurer told us today had been reached between the Board and the Reserve Bank. This reinforces the prima facie belief that it was an agreement not between the Wheat Board and the Reserve Bank but between the </para>
          <para class="block">Wheat Board Chairman, perhaps the Wheat Board General Manager, and the Reserve Bank. </para>
          <para>Two matters arise from this. I think the treachery to the Wheat Board and the wheat industry by the Wheat Board <inline font-weight="bold">Chairman, Sir Leslie</inline> Price, is mostly a matter for the wheat industry itself to take up, although he is appointed to the position of  Chairman  of the Board by this Minister. One can safely assume that he did not get his knighthood or his appointment as  Chairman  of the Board through making life difficult for Country Party politicians. He has complied to make life easier for Country Party Ministers than it would otherwise have been.  His  apparent treachery is mostly a matter to be discussed within the wheat industry. The other point is that for a whole week a critical and urgent component of the Government's monetary package policy was in limbo while <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Sinclair</inline> shirked his duty, punting on the  Chairman  of the Wheat Board to sell out the Board in these negotiations with the Reserve Bank. In political terms the Minister's gamble finally paid off. The reason he took that gamble was that- given the extravagant and inflammatory rhetoric by members of his party, members of the Liberal Party and by <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Leslie</inline> Price, in 1973 when <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wriedt</inline> issued a directive to the Wheat Board- it would have been highly embarrassing for a Country Party Minister to be seen issuing directives to the Wheat Board or, as <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Street</inline> put it in 1973, exposing the iron fist of authoritarian government. With that sort of inflammatory ludicrous statement from his own colleagues on the record, the Minister was politically afraid to issue a directive to the Board. If there was any way he could get out of it, he would adopt that course. He took the gamble and it has paid off for him, at least in political terms. </para>
          <para>What about the credibility of the Government and what about the credibility of Australia? For a whole week while the Minister punted on the Wheat Board Chairman putting his obligation to the Minister before his duties to comply with the decision of the Board of last week, Australia's growing and well deserved international reputation as a fiscal banana republic was further enhanced. It is not greatly appreciated in Australia, but it is known in the money market and it is known internationally that the Government's credibility has taken a severe belting in this area over the last six months. The Minister's action has seriously aggravated the Government's record of dithering, incompetence and indecision. </para>
          <para>The fiscal problem started in November last year when the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Malcolm</inline></para>
          <para class="block">Fraser) decided that he was the Canute of the fiscal world and could defy market forces and push interest rates down by political fiat. The problem was compounded seriously- this was known as early as January this year- by the question of funding the Wheat Board and the size of the wheat crop. On 22 January or thereabouts, the Wheat Board ran out of money and suspended payment on growers' warrants. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Sinclair</inline> then took the matter to Cabinet and secured a directive to the Reserve Bank that it was to advance the Wheat Board sufficient money to enable the Board to pay out all growers' warrants submitted to it for the season. In the meantime, two or three weeks, no payments were made. As I mentioned earlier, the  Chairman  of the Board, if he was accurately reported, then lied to the financial Press about what had occurred. The Board, indirectly through its grass roots association with the wheat farmers circulated the canard that the computer had broken down. The Board made no public statement to that effect; it preferred to use the rural grapevine to get the false information through. The Board was meekly complying with Government policy- or, rather, it was covering up the situation. </para>
          <para>Prior to a subsequent meeting with the Minister, the Board decided that it would not agree with the Government's request to finance the first tranche of $ 155m through commercial bills. The Minister then met the Wheat Board and skilfully manipulated all but a couple of members so that the Board caved in. It agreed to finance the first $ 144m. I suspect that many of them received a roasting when they returned to their home States and that that was responsible for the Board's subsequent decision- it was announced last Friday- that the Board would not willingly comply with the Government's request on this occasion but would require formal direction from the Minister under Section 18(1) of the Act. I emphasise that that is a direction which the Minister is perfectly entitled to give. I see nothing wrong with the provisions of that section being used and I see nothing wrong with that section being in the Act, so long as action pursuant to that section is taken publicly and properly, as it was by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wriedt</inline> in 1973. The Board's decision has subsequently been made inoperative by the actions of the  Chairman  in the negotiations with the Reserve Bank today. He has <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Sinclair</inline> off the political hook. What really concerns me is the further damage to the credibility, not only of this hillbilly Government, but also of Australia. It has been shown yet again that, when it comes to making a politically hard decision, this Government dithers and procrastinates. It has fiddled around for four months with this monetary issue of the Wheat Board first advance. Its policy was neutralised a week ago by the Wheat Board decision. The action that the Government then quite clearly obliged takenthe action which the Wheat Board expected it to take- was for the Minister to issue a directive. Politically, he has got away with it this time, but in the process he has done a great deal of damage to the credibility of the  Chairman  of the Wheat Board and, of course, to the reputation of Australia both on the domestic financial market and on the international financial market. </para>

            <para>- In view of the time, I will not delay the Senate. I wish to speak on the Industrial Relations Bureau and the mistake that was made in Tasmania, which caused a great deal of confusion in the fruit industry. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>I do not feel that I can add much to the very thorough outline of the problem that was caused by the IRBs decision as put to the Senate by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Tate</inline> on the night of Tuesday,  1  May. However, because of my long experience with the fruit industry through the Tasmanian Trades and Labour Council I would like to remind the Senate that the fruit industry has had its ups and downs not only financially but also industrially. The Australian Workers Union, recognising these difficulties some years ago when it was an affiliate of the TTLC approached the TTLC to obtain a fruit industry agreement. I, as secretary of the TTLC, adopted this suggestion and entered into negotiations with <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Kenny,</inline> the then secretary, and Pat McNally the then organiser of the fruit industry. Both of these men did a marvellous job. The agreement we reached did a number of things to ensure the free flow of fruit during the fruit season. One of these things, of course, involved the question of union membership and the deduction of union dues. I place on record the efforts of the TTLC in that regard which have been carried on to the present day. </para>
          <para>
            <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Tate</inline>called for the total abolition of the IRB from Tasmania. He has called upon <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Street-</inline> and I quote his words- 'to obtain an early withdrawal of the Bureau from Tasmania'. I know that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Tate</inline> does not mean- nor do I mean- the withdrawal of the inspectorate machinery because it is important that this long established machinery be maintained. </para>

              <para>- It is part of the inspectorate but the problem is that it is now part of the Industrial Relations Bureau with all that means to both the trades union movement and to employers. I would like to see the inspectorate machinery revert to the Department of Industrial Relations where it rightly belongs. It would then have conferred upon it, or re-conferred upon it, the respect in which it was held over a long period of years. </para>

I regret that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Chipp</inline> is not present in the chamber at the moment.  1  was able to give notice to his secretary some minutes ago at the beginning of the adjournment debate that I intended to raise this matter and she assured me that my message would be passed directly to him. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Chipp</inline> was hostile in his remarks about me and I think about many honourable senators for what he alleged to be our misrepresentation of his position in a debate on his Bill yesterday. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Chipp</inline> was hostile in particular with regard to an interjection I made during the adjournment debate last night. My interjection represented my view that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Chipp</inline> had misrepresented the Government Whip with regard to the alleged agreement that had been made, and moreover that he had misled the Opposition on this same point. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>This morning <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Chipp</inline> rather grandiosely said that I was incorrect in taking that position. Moreover, he said that this was a constant state of mind on my part not only in regard to this matter but also in regard to other matters. I want to go over briefly the difficulties that arose yesterday, which I still believe were managed by the honourable senator for better Press publicity for himself rather than for enlightenment or for good debate in this chamber. When the first reading of his Bill was considered by the Senate he immediately interjected on the Leader of the Government in the Senate <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Carrick)</inline> and said: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>That is a betrayal of an agreement . . . with your Whip. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">There followed an hour of difficulties in this chamber when we debated whether there had been such a betrayal of an agreement. Some minutes afterwards <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Chipp</inline> said: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>I was clearly under the impression from the Government Whip when I saw him in the chamber before dinner that I would be permitted to move the first reading or my Bill, that I would then be able to ask for leave to move the second reading . . . </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">This impression that he would be able to proceed beyond the first reading of the Bill was, I believe, clearly in everybody's mind, because that was the point in the procedure at which he felt frustrated. On page 1581 of yesterday's <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline><inline font-weight="bold">Senator Grimes,</inline> when referring to this, is reported to have said: </para>

          <quote>
            <para>At no time had any arrangement been made to allow <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Chipp</inline> to proceed to an immediate second reading speech on his private member's Bill. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">In his explanation <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Baume</inline> reiterated that statement a couple of times. This morning <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Chipp</inline> did not differ in any way with any of the statements made in <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Baume</inline> 's personal explanation. So we must see immediately the conflict between his allegation in the substantial debate that he would be able, by some agreement with the Government, to proceed to the second reading of his Bill and his denial of that this morning. That was the very point of my interjection to which he was hostile in his statement this morning. Immediately following <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Baume's</inline> explanation last evening, on behalf of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Georges</inline> said: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>Some discussion took place between <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Chipp</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Baume.</inline> Some misunderstanding arose because of that discussion which spread across to the Opposition. We were told one thing by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Chipp</inline> which obviously was not correct. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">That is the point of view that I also hold and that was the point of my interjection. Immediately following <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Georges'</inline> remarks, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Grimes</inline> reiterated this point.

            <para>I was certainly Icd to believe that there was an agreement between the minority party and the Government. 1 must say that when I was told of this alleged agreement I had a certain amount of difficulty in believing that such an agreement had been made. However. I was convinced--  lt was at that point, following all these earlier statements, that I interjected, I believe correctly, and said: </para>
            <para>You were misled by the minority party. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">In his personal explanation this morning <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Chipp</inline> took issue with that correct interjection and nothing that he said in any substance in his personal explanation this morning denies the correctness of my interjection. Indeed, my whole purpose in making this brief personal explanation to the Senate now is to say that my views are all the more confirmed because of what we heard this morning. In a matter on which we have had an hour and a half of difficulties in this Senate with Press statements, Press coverage, discussion of gags and discussion of agreements being broken, I think it is very much to the disadvantage of this chamber that a gloss has been put on a so-called agreement by the honourable senator. It is because such a gloss was put on it and because the blame for these difficulties was unjustifiably passed over to the Government that I wanted, by this personal explanation, to clarify that I still believe today exactly what I believed yesterday. I regret that the honourable senator made unsubstantiated statements about me in his personal explanation this morning. </para>

            <para>- I think there is a high degree of incongruity in a junior Government senator, who owes his place in this Senate to the votes of pensioners, making a statement such as the one he has just made when last night, on four occasions, he supported motions to prevent this chamber from discussing the broken promise of his Government to index pensions. I think his behaviour is ironic and borders on hypocrisy. I have nothing to add in reply to what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Teague</inline> has just said. So that the record of these proceedings will be complete, I simply ask readers <inline font-style="italic">of Hansard to</inline> refer to my personal explanation made earlier this morning. On that I rest my case. </para>

            <para>The Government is at present awaiting the outcome of a study by a Working Group of officials on the report of the Task Force on the establishment of a domestic communications satellite which was presented to Parliament in September 1978. That group is expected to report by 30 June 1979. </para>

            <para>Recently the Government has announced a decision to lease capacity in the Intelsat international communications satellite for the purpose of extending national television broadcasts to remote areas.

There is a tendency to overlook the fact that the matter of a National Communications Satellite has been open for community comment since the establishment of the Task Force in November 1977. Following publication of the Task Force Report in September 1978, the Government decided that there should be a further opportunity for the community to consider the issues and make submissions to a Working Group of officials established by the Government. The closing date for the lodging of submissions with that Working Group was 31 March 1979.

Secondly, at a lower level, the Minister would know of the case of an Australian on a serious narcotics charge who was given back his passport as he was granted an adjournment of his case to enable him to go to the United States on a business commitment. In that instance would we mark the passport as expiring when the adjournment was to expire or would it be open-ended? </para>

            <para>I am aware of the types of situations in which a person, by assuming the identity of another person, can fraudulently obtain an Australian passport. The Department of Foreign Affairs is currently introducing a fully computerised passports issuing system which is expected to reduce significantly the incidence of passport malpractice. However, as there is virtually unlimited access by individuals to birth records throughout Australia, it will bc appreciated that it is very difficult to prevent an unscrupulous person from obtaining a passport under false pretences. </para>
            <para>Although I am not aware of the specific case to which the honourable senator refers in the second part of his question, normal procedure would bc that the passport of a person on a charge would be held by the Court, not by the Department of Foreign Affairs.
