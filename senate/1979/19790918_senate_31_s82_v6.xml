            <para>- My question is directed to the Minister representing the Minister for National Development. Is it a fact that the Minister for Special Trade Representations said in New Zealand recently that Australia was seeking oil from half a dozen countries, that it would buy it anywhere it could and that availability rather than price was the overriding consideration? Did he say that Australia wanted oil now and not in five years time? </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>I ask whether this rather disparate statement expresses the correct situation with respect to our supply position or was the Minister for National Development, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Newman,</inline> correct when he said in his Press statement of 14 September this year that apart from avgas and distillate distribution problems the 'oil supply situation is satisfactory'? Did <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Newman</inline> also say that there has been a tendency for difficulties in the oil supply position to be exaggerated? Was he referring to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Garland</inline> when he accused people of exaggerating the oil supply situation? </para>

I understand that that statement was made quite recently. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Button</inline><inline font-style="italic">referred to</inline> earlier statements made by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Newman</inline> on this matter. From the account I heard of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Garland's</inline> statement I do not think that there is any reason to believe that there is any conflict in the way in which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Button</inline> says that there may be or is. However, I have not seen the exact statement. I will endeavour to obtain information regarding the exact statement <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Garland</inline> has made. I will refer the general question to the Minister for National Development. </para>

In view of the Government's ban on cigarette advertising in the media, does the Minister consider that it is suitable to feature a smoker on the cover of a government publication? </para>

            <para>-This item of detail in the portfolio of Post and Telecommunications has slipped by me. I apologise to the honourable senator for that. I understand his concern about the cover featuring a man with a cigarette drooping from his mouth. I can only say that whether or not that is good or bad depends on the apparent condition of the man from whose mouth the cigarette is hanging. If the man appears miserable, depressed and obviously wracked by paroxysms of coughing the cover may have a useful, educative effect. If, on the other hand, he is bright-eyed, shining and a general picture of good health, I am sure it will be extremely damaging to the people of Queensland. I will refer the matter to the Minister for Post and Telecommunications, so that he can nip it in the bud- or, perhaps, in the butt. </para>

            <para>- My question is directed to the Minister representing the Prime Minister. Is the Prime Minister aware that the rates of retirement of Public Service officers due to invalidity differ markedly between the Australian States? Is he aware of any reason why there should be any real difference in health status of officers in one State as opposed to officers in another State? Is there any reasonable way of explaining why five out of six officers who retired in Victoria during January to December 1977 did so on the basis of invalidity, while only half of the officers who retired in New South Wales did so for the same reason? Will the Prime Minister undertake to have administrative procedures carefully examined to see whether management in some States or those assessing people for invalidity should review existing administrative procedures, especially as it is argued that there is greater gain to an officer who retires on the ground of invalidity than there is to one who retires on the ground of age? </para>

            <para>- The general terms of the question were brought to my attention, so I have some details. I am advised that there have been differences between States in invalidity retirement rates in the Australian Public Service. A study undertaken by the Public Service Board in 1978 indicated that differences in invalidity retirement rates can be attributed to a number of factors, including age structure, the proportion of ex-servicemen represented, educational qualifications, occupational group, divisional status and sex. The Board cannot pinpoint the reason for the past difference between New South Wales and Victoria, or for that matter between any two States, although statistics do show that the number of invalidity retirees in Victoria from January to August 1979 has declined significantly from the number for the same period in 1978. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>Common procedures are adopted in relation to retirement decisions in each State. Retirement decisions are taken by the Board's regional director following receipt of a report from the relevant officer's department and a medical examination being conducted by the Commonwealth medical officer. The Board, in conjunction with the Department of Health, the Department of Finance and the Australian Government Retirement Benefits Office, has completed an examination of procedures for reviewing an officer's fitness for duty. As a result of that review, it is proposed to introduce some changes to current procedures to provide departments, examining Commonwealth medical officers and the Board with additional information to assist in determining an officer's fitness for duty and whether invalidity retirement or other action, such as redeployment, is appropriate. Consultations about the new procedures will be held with peak councils of staff organisations on Thursday of this week, that is, 20 September 1979. Details of the new procedures are contained on page 50 of the Public Service Board's annual report for 1979, which was tabled on 12 September. </para>

            <para>- I am advised by the Minister for Health that, following reports in the media, the Minister for Health wrote to his then South Australian counterpart requesting, on a confidential basis, a copy of the report of the study group. On 1 August, the South Australian Minister replied by letter giving some details of the study. So far as the Minister for Health is aware, no report of the study has been released by the South Australian Government. To honour an undertaking given to the South Australian Minister, the Minister for Health is restricting his comments to aspects of the study already mentioned in the Press report. There are a number of well-established cases of lung cancer amongst miners and it would be important to exclude these before it could be inferred that the excess mortality has been due to radiation. It is very doubtful whether the study would have any application to present day uranium mining. </para>

            <para>-It is a fact that the 1979-80 Budget estimates make no allowance for increases in the price of crude oil which may occur during the course of the year. The magnitude of the price increases which occurred during the first half of 1979 is not necessarily any guide to price increases which may occur later this year or in the first half of 1980. At this stage the Government does not have any reliable estimate of the magnitude of possible price increases, if any, which may occur. Consequently, any assessment of revenue impact would be extremely uncertain. Clearly, if any additional revenue were to accrue to the Government there would be a reduction in the size of its Budget deficit, other things being unchanged. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>The claims which the Government will need to make on the financial markets to fund its deficit would be correspondingly less and consequently the pressure on domestic interest rates would also be reduced. Whether interest rates would rise or fall would depend on a number of other factors and would be determined ultimately by the market. Clearly it is the view of the Government that continued large deficits are undesirable. It is for this reason that the Government has pursued its objective of reducing the size of its Budget deficit during the last 3Vi years to reduce the pressure on interest rates and to dampen the inflationary expectations. </para>

            <para>- I understand that the announcement in the Budget by the Minister for Health referred to the provision of health interpreter and translator services and that this may involve the training of some personnel. I am advised that the Minister for Health has written to the health authorities in each of the States and the Northern Territory advising them of the terms of the Commonwealth's offer and inviting each State and the Northern Territory to submit proposals for the employment of additional health interpreters and translators. The Ministers have also been advised that Commonwealth funds for this purpose would be made available to the States and the Northern Territory by way of a specific block grant allocation within the community health program. In the year 1979-80, $940,000 will be made available at a 100 per cent level of funding, and for two years thereafter at a 75 per cent level. This will equal the $2.4m mentioned by the honourable senator. As with all other projects approved for funding through the States under the community health program, the States and the Northern Territory health authorities will have responsibility for detailed administration and supervision of the additional health interpreters and translators, and the Commonwealth and State health authorities will have a joint responsibility in relation to ongoing project appraisal and program effectiveness. </para>

            <para>- I do not recall the article in the <inline font-style="italic">National Times.</inline> Therefore I cannot authenticate, or otherwise, the figures that the honourable senator has mentioned. The Government has indicated that it takes seriously various, fairly widespread, attempts in the community to avoid taxation. Such tax avoidance comes not only from traditional areas. One of the widest fields of tax avoidance comes from people who receive cash payments. Today the magnitude of that field is unidentifiable. </para>

            <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Elstob</inline>will know that it was because of the difficulties of legislating against tax avoidance that so many European countries moved towards a value-added tax as one of the few taxes that they believed could ensure a blanket responsibility for taxation of the citizen. I am bound to say that in this matter the Government is taking all of the steps that it can devise, and is getting the best possible advice from experts. We will continue to pursue tax avoidance wherever we can legislatively do so. I remind the honourable senator that the former Labor Government was a little slower in acting in the matter and that in the light of that performance its supporters have nothing to complain of now. </para>

In every country where it is heard it seems to have an enthusiastic listening audience and provides a service of which Australia is entitled to be proud. Our exporters will no doubt take note of the fact that if one gets one's product into a country that has a decent size market, an obvious result flows therefrom. </para>

I will refer the detailed matters to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Staley</inline> and seek information.

Is the Minister aware that for a single income family the first $3,893 only is tax-free, whereas the first $7,786 is tax-free where husband and wife work? Does the Leader of the Government agree with the Treasurer's recent admission in Brisbane that single income families were disadvantaged in the Budget?

            <para>-Senator McAuliffe will know that one of the main actions of the Fraser Government has been to relieve upwards of 500,000 people on the lowest incomes from the need to pay tax at all, so the Government has been acutely aware of the need to provide relief in that regard. It is true that the traditional tax scales, tax deductions and tax rebate systems which have evolved over the years and which both the Whitlam and Fraser governments have adopted in various modifications, tend to disadvantage single income families. That cannot be gainsaid. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>Many people are arguing that there ought to be quite major changes in the whole approach to taxation and tax deductibility so that that disadvantage is overcome and help is given to the family. That is a major policy issue. I know that the Government is taking a keen interest in it. I cannot say whether the Government would look to apply additional income, if it received it, to that point of policy. That is a policy matter, but I will draw the attention of the Treasurer to it. </para>

Can the Minister explain how such a small cut in the Government's spending is cost effective, given the high cost that industrial accidents impose on Australian productivity? </para>

            <para>-! am personally aware, and I am sure all other honourable senators are, of the quite terrible incidence of industrial accidents which result not only in fatalities but also in serious as well as minor injuries. I think that in the first place one should look at their impact in terms of the family and the community before looking at the effect on productivity. It is true that industrial accidents are a major cost to industry. I have to accept that. At both the State and Federal levels there have been enormous efforts made over the years- through the various departments of labour, safety factors and all sorts of codes- to mitigate these circumstances. As to the item of money, this is one of the many factors involved in the whole situation. I am not aware of the basis for the Treasurer's thinking in this regard. I will refer that part of the question to the Treasurer and seek a response. </para>

I ask whether the Minister is aware of the remarkable claims which have been attributed to this plant in terms of its being one of the viable answers to the world energy crisis, as well as being a substitute for whale oil? If that is so, can the Minister indicate what research on this plant has been carried out by the Australian Government and whether the Government will consider making special grants to firms interested in developing such projects under current energy development programs or, alternatively, to progressive State governments such as that in South Australia for such purposes? </para>

            <para>- I refer the Minister for Education to the proposed introduction of fees for overseas students, which I am sure the Minister will be disconcerted to hear is now becoming known in certain sections of the community rather unsympathetically as the 'blacks tax'. I ask the Minister what information his Department has on the average family income of those students whom it is proposed to make pay fees of $1,500 to $2,500 a year? Can the Minister confirm or deny the accuracy of the reported survey of the Overseas Students Service that the average family income in question is of the order of only $A8,000 to $A9,000, and will he agree that if this is the case- or if he cannot deny it- the proposed fees represent an unjustifiable order of magnitude? Finally, how much further delay can be expected before the full details of this scheme are announced to this Parliament and, indeed, to those thousands of students whose careers are very substantially hanging on those details? </para>

            <para>-I take it that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Evans</inline> deprecates the invidious title 'blacks tax'. Of course, his own  deputy  leader said that the Labor Party would not be opposed at all to taxing foreign students who could afford it. So, I take it that the Labor Party would not be opposed to imposing a 'blacks tax' if the blacks were affluent. I do not think it does anybody any good to use those invidious kinds of words in this chamber. In fact, every Western country that I know of charges fees. I take it that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Evans,</inline> by inference, feels that there is some kind of racism in what they are doing. If he does not, then why did he put the first part of his question? Was it to get a quick trick? If so, it has rebounded because his own Party has made it clear that it has no objection in principle to the idea of charging fees to foreign students. That fact ought to be understood by people. I cannot say whether the alleged survey is reliable. I have not seen it but I doubt whether it could be reliable. Anyone who undertakes these surveys of family incomes will know the difficulties involved. As I said in reply to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Button</inline> on, I think, Thursday evening, it is the ordinary practice adopted by all governments in Budget sessions to announce a policy in principle and in due course during the Budget session to make known in particular what the policy is. That approach will be taken to the question of foreign private students as will be the case in all other matters. </para>

Firstly, is the Minister aware that the Sydney share market key indicator has reached an all-time record of 663.58 points and tops the record mining boom of January 1970? Secondly, is the Minister aware that this record is reported as having been influenced by the Government's 1979-80 Budget which has brought about an influx of overseas capital enabling development of Australian industry and providing increased employment? Thirdly, is he aware of the prediction by Wall Street and the financial world that Australia will weather the energy crisis better than most countries? In view of these developments, does the Minister agree that these factors should give confidence to Australian industry and to the individual and bring about a realisation that the Opposition's criticisms of the 1979-80 Budget lack perception? </para>

              <para>-lt is a fact that the Sydney share market key indicator reached an all time record and that the mining shares in particular have reached high levels on the indicator. It is also a fact that the business, industrial and commercial indicators have reacted most favourably to the Australian Budget handed down in August. It is equally a fact that Wall Street, pointing to the very favourable position in terms of low inflation and interest rates in Australia in contrast with countries of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, has indicated a very great future for investment, development and employment in this country. It is equally a fact that Wall Street has commented that Australia has the capacity to survive the energy crisis as well as or better than most countries. When all these matters are taken into consideration, plus last Saturday's very wise decision of the electors, they indicate that the opportunities for Australia in development and for increasing real incomes and living standards for the people are unprecedented provided we keep on the course that this Government has set. </para>

Does the Minister for Transport, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Nixon,</inline> intend emulating the example set by the Government of the United States of America and utilise the provisions of our Navigation Act in order to ban Liberian flag tankers which have a shocking record of maintenance, bad navigation and poor crewing? </para>

            <para>- I do not think there is any thought in the mind of the Government to ban all Liberian tankers, which I understand is what the honourable senator suggested in his question. I am advised by the Minister for Transport that an inspection of the tanker <inline font-style="italic">World Encouragement</inline> by officers of the Department of Transport revealed no reason why any action should be taken against even that vessel. In that case the spillage was caused by the vessel being holed during an operational mishap while berthing and not by any continuing defect which might have given rise to criticism. I am further told that an investigation currently is under way by the Department of Transport and the New South Wales Maritime Services Board which will indicate whether any special steps are necessary to avoid such mishaps in the future. </para>

I do not have the detail, but I will ensure that it is provided to the honourable senator. I am also not aware whether a smaller, less expensive telephone is being designed. I do know that there are difficulties in designing telephones which are too small and too inexpensive because of the constant problem of vandalism. It is necessary for them to be of a robust design which will withstand ill-treatment, which unfortunately they get on occasions. Once again, this is a matter on which I will see that the honourable senator receives more detailed information. </para>

            <para>- Of course the change of government in South Australia will have a most dramatic effect on the encouragement of minerals exploration and development in that State. From time to time we have discussed in the Senate the position with the Roxby Downs deposit, and there are others, one of which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Young</inline> has mentioned. The position is that as a result of the change of government and the very fundamental change in policy and attitude to mining uranium, planning for the development of these projects will be able to go ahead with some confidence. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>Of course, many aspects of government policy will have to be considered and met. Environmental considerations and requirements will have to be satisfied. In some cases foreign investment guidelines may have to be considered. Matters may have to be referred to the Foreign Investment Review Board. The Government's uranium export policy will also have to be met. The important thing is that people now will be able to go ahead with their planning, which includes, of course, the means of satisfying those requirements. Things are now very different from the blanket policy under which there was no sense in people making any planning for development because they knew that they would not be allowed to proceed. They now know that provided these requirements which I have mentioned are complied with the development will be able to proceed. Therefore, they will be able to plan with confidence for the future. </para>

            <para>- My question of the Minister representing the Minister for Health follows my question last week requesting an investigation into the rate of use of the drug Valium. Is it a fact that 9, 1 1 8 prescriptions were written last year under the national health program for Valium in the form of a paediatric syrup for use by young children? Will it extend any inquiry it is making to include an urgent survey of the rate of prescription of Valium to children, the reasons for such prescription and their justification? </para>

If there are facts which I can place on record I will be happy to do so. I am unaware of the status of any application from the organisation to which the honourable senator referred, but there is a program under which the Federal Government and the State Government jointly are supporting the establishment of some refuges or emergency care centres for children. It could be that the application to which the honourable senator referred is one of those made under that project. If the question is placed on notice I will see that an answer is given shortly. </para>

Does one of the stated reasons for that proposal relate to cost? Is it a fact that the fortnightly mail and supplies transport by helicopter is operated at a cost of $60,000 per annum? Were tenders called for the provision of that service? If not, why not? Is it a fact that the servicing could be provided by a suitable large fishing boat for less than half that amount- that is, for less than $30,000 per annum? Will tenders be called next time? Will the decision to withdraw manning of the lighthouse be reviewed in the light of any lowered cost and also in the light of the unique importance of that lighthouse as a manned meteorological observation station and a warning relay station in an area of heavy fishing, poor radio reception and extraordinarily bad weather? </para>

It is a vast deposit; that has been established. Its size and the full development of it have not <inline font-style="italic">yet</inline> been fully determined. I agree with that. I imagine that that is one of the points made by the officer of the Western Mining Corporation. However, the fact remains that under the policy which was adopted by the previous Labor Government in South Australia in relation to the development of uranium, which policy is the same for the Labor Party generally, there would have been a halt to the development of this resource.

Whilst recognising and indeed supporting the Government's decision to provide 3,500 tonnes of rice to alleviate immediate starvation problems in Kampuchea, is the Government aware that there is an equally urgent need for milk powder and antibiotics in that country?

            <para>- The Government is acutely aware of the very great suffering and starvation of the people of Kampuchea and, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wriedt</inline> indicated, has acted to make a significant contribution of food. The Government is also having discussions with other agencies and other countries with the aim of ensuring that whatever we give goes to the people most in need. Without knowing precisely, I would expect that in conditions such as those in Kampuchea there would be a shortage of both antibiotics and milk powder and that milk powder would be an essential need because of its content of protein and other minerals. I am not aware whether the Commonwealth Government has given thought to the provision of these items or whether other agencies and other countries have undertaken to do so. Because the matter is of concern to all Australians I will refer the specific question to the Minister and seek a reply. </para>

            <para>- I think 1 understand the general thrust of the question. Perhaps the honourable senator should amend some of the names that he used. He referred to the Housing Liabilities Insurance Co., but I think that should be the Housing Loans Insurance Corporation. I am unaware of the proposal that the honourable senator has mentioned. I know of no Government lobbying on this matter. If the senator wishes an answer to the question and puts it on notice, I will see that it comes to him. </para>

              <inline font-weight="bold">-Senator Keeffe</inline>asked me a question regarding Mary Ellen Eather and her detention in India. I am advised that Miss Mary Ellen Eather, an Australian citizen, was arrested in India on 9 July 1976 with a group of people in connection with the alleged robbery and murder of several people in India. On 9 August 1976 Miss Eather was granted approver status, that is, a state witness in several criminal cases involving Charles Shobrai.  Her  trial commenced on 4 July 1977 and since that time Miss Eather has appeared in court on numerous occasions. Hearings have been postponed on occasions, when a new judge was appointed, and one of the cases resumed on 1 1 April 1 979. Further hearings were scheduled during April and May, and officers of the High Commission in India attended most of them. A charge concerning the use of a false name was brought against Miss Eather in February, although this information was not made known to the Australian High Commission in New Delhi until May. Further postponements have occurred due to nonavailability of witnesses, illness of the judge and absence of defence lawyers. The Indian Ministry of Foreign Affairs has been told of our concern at the delay in finalising the trial of Miss Eather, and the matter has also been brought to the notice of the Indian High Commission in Canberra. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keeffe</inline> mentioned certain matters relating to essential conditions and amenities with regard to the holding of Miss Eather. I am not aware of those. I will bring them to the attention of the Minister concerned. </para>

Although the report is not yet finalised and has not been released it has definitely proved that since I960- a matter of only 19 years- 59 per cent of those who worked underground at Radium Hill over a period of at least two years died of cancer, lt is not a complete report, but it shows that deaths as a result of cancer were four and a half times the Australian average. They are figures from South Australia where 19 years has elapsed since we mined uranium. </para>

With the change of government it may be that the report will never be released. These deaths have to be assessed in comparison with deaths of other miners from cancer. We can give no value to figures for cancer-caused deaths of uranium miners unless the figures are greatly in excess of those for other miners, such as asbestos miners. I do not think we have a satisfactory basis for evaluation. </para>

          <quote>
            <para>In recognition of the problems of availability of distillate being encountered in Cairns the Government, in conjunction with the oil industry, arranged an additional shipment of 3,800 tonnes of distillate to arrive in Cairns on 15 September. This volume was chosen on the basis of advice received at a public meeting in Cairns on 4 September, which was attended by officers of the Department of National Development. This, together with the other scheduled shipments, should ensure that all distillate users in the area have access to product. I am advised that one oil company has recently acquired a cargo of approximately 30,000 tonnes of distillate from the Mediterranean which should arrive in Australia in mid-October, lt will be available to supply any areas which are experiencing supply shortfalls at the time, wherever they may be occurring, including Cairns. If at the time it arrives there are more serious problems in other parts of the country then these will receive a higher priority. </para>

            <para>Expeditioners who are to winter in the Antarctic and members of summer field parties who arc to operate away from the Antarctic stations are expected to attend a 4-5 day field training camp conducted by the Division at Rocky Valley in the Victorian Highlands.

The expeditioner who lost his life near Casey attended the 1 978 camp at Rocky Valley. </para>
            <para>Both wintering and summer personnel arc required to attend an orientation week which is held before departure. The program consists of formal lectures with slides and films. All aspects of Antarctic operations including survival techniques, health, first aid and management of cold injuries, are covered. </para>
            <para>All  expeditioners  are issued with manuals which detail safety procedures and precautions to be taken in Antarctic conditions. First aid and management of cold injuries are also covered. These manuals are under constant revision and new field and first aid manuals are presently being prepared. </para>
            <para>A large proportion of  expeditioners  are also instructed in the resuscitation procedures of external cardiac massage and mouth to mouth respiration by an instructress from the National Heart Foundation. </para>
            <para>Selected  expeditioners  carry out a three day course in first aid supplied by the St John's Ambulance Brigade. Certificates of proficiency are issued. </para>
            <para>When in Antarctica ad hoc instruction in safety, survival and first aid procedures is given by those men with previous experience in these areas. </para>
            <para>Before any field journey a formal briefing is given to the leader and his party and strict search and rescue procedures are detailed. Regular schedules of radio communication are laid down between the party and the station. </para>
            <para>The matter of improving the training and techniques for survival in future has been referred to the Safety Committee of the Antarctic Division for consideration. Already a series of one day pre-embarkation lectures has been planned to ensure that any  expeditioners  such as round trip personnel who do not attend the training outlined above, also receive basic instructions in survival. </para>

          <para>- by leave- The copy of the report which the Auditor-General has transmitted to the Senate in respect of the 1978-79 financial year is, as required by section 53 (3) (a) of the Audit Act, accompanied by a copy of the annual financial statements prepared by the Minister for Finance pursuant to section 50 (4) of the Audit Act. The form of the statements differs from that presented in previous years as a direct result of one of a number of important amendments made by the Audit Amendment Act 1979, which was assented to on 7 March 1979. The amendments affect the statements in two basic ways, both of which reflect the greater emphasis now given by the Audit Act to the responsibility of permanent heads for the financial management of their departments. First, the information on receipts and expenditure has been rearranged so that the basic classification is by department rather than by fund. All relevant transactions of a department whether from the Consolidated Revenue Fund, the Trust Fund or the Loan Fund, are shown under the departmental heading. In accordance with the definition now contained in the Audit Act, 'Department ' in this context includes a branch or part of the Australian Public Service in relation to which a person has the powers of a permanent head. Honourable senators will, I am sure, find this form of presentation much more useful than the format followed for very' many years in the previous statement of receipts and expenditure which accompanied the Auditor-General's report. Summaries of total receipts and expenditure from the various funds, however, continue to be shown in tables similar to those used in previous years. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>The second basic change results from the requirement of section 50 (3) of the Audit Act for certain information to be furnished by permanent heads. Prior to the recent amendments, the Auditor-General was obliged to explain in full the statement prepared by the Minister for Finance. That requirement has been removed; instead, it is now the responsibility of each permanent head to provide explanatory material in respect of his own department. In particular, the Act requires that the explanations include the following details not previously reported to the Parliament: The total number and aggregate value of act of grace payments made during the year under the Minister's authority; the number and aggregate value of payments due to the Commonwealth, recovery of which has been waived during the year under the Minister's authority; and particulars, in summary form, of amounts written off during the year in respect of losses or deficiencies of moneys or stores, irrecoverable revenue, irrecoverable debts and overpayments. </para>
        <para>In redesigning the statements to incorporate these basic changes, a number of improvements have also been made to the format. Some of the summary tables have been changed to give more information. Honourable senators will note that additional detail is given on the transactions of individual trust accounts within the Trust Fund. On the other hand, we have omitted some of the tables previously included in the Auditor-General 's explanations where that information is available in other Budget papers. I should also add that, earlier this year, there was an exchange of correspondence on the form of these statements between the department of finance and the Joint Committee of Public Accounts. As a result of that, an undertaking was given to the  Chairman  that these statements would be discussed with the Committee following their presentation and, if necessary, revised in the light of the Committee's views. </para>

          <para>- by leave- The report of the Committee on Australia's Relations with the Third World is a lengthy document which I have certainly not had time to digest in detail. It is a longawaited report and it is one which would need considerable study. From what chance I have had to look at it, it gives the impression of being a mixed bag. The statement of the Minister for Foreign Affairs <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Peacock)</inline> points out that the Committee was set a formidable task because of the very broad terms of reference it was given. To its credit, it has attempted to grapple with some of the terms of reference and it has produced a document which contains about 400 pages. It will be a very valuable reference document for the future. Certainly I would not be doing it an injustice if I indicated that the comments that I make are not necessarily the conclusive views of the Opposition. As is usual in these situations, we need to study these reports in some detail. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>There are some matters which I wish to place on record. Firstly, I want to refer to the lecture given by the Minister for Foreign Affairs last evening, some of which was reported in the media this morning. He delivered a lecture entitled 'Australia's Future: A Premium on Enterprise'. In that speech he expressed views on issues touching on trade, protection and restructuring which seem to diverge very considerably from those of the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Malcolm Fraser)</inline> and other members of the Government. This was most noticeable to anyone who read the Press reports this morning. Since it has been in office, the Government has steadily increased the level of protection against imports even in the face of some very severe criticism that has emanated in particular from the member countries of the Association of South East Asian Nations. This has led to a gradual deterioration in Australia 's relationship with those countries. </para>
        <para>Only recently the International Monetary Fund cited more than 20 examples of how Australia has acted against foreign imports in the last year. It went on to point out that, of the 134 member countries, only the United States of </para>
        <para class="block">America, India, Pakistan and Columbia had more adjustments to and instituted more rules on trade than Australia in the past 12 months. Although the Prime Minister has advocated lower protection in some of the world's forums, such as at the recent United Nations Conference on Trade and Development held in Manila, Australia 's domestic policies have been directed at an increasing level of protection to the extent that the Government has now adopted a 2 per cent import duty on goods previously imported duty free. This duty was actually criticised in this report. Obviously, the duty has not gone unnoticed in the countries which constitute the Third World and, in particular, the Association of South East Asian Nations. </para>
        <para>It is true that the Prime Minister has attempted to buy his way out of this problem with special bilateral deals such as the one we recently saw in the agreement with the Philippines on uranium. But he has been unable to stem the tide of criticism from other nations or to prevent the deterioration of our relations with those countries. No doubt, in an attempt to redress the imbalance, the Minister for Foreign Affairs has come out strongly in support of much greater liberalisation of trade and substantial restructuring of the Australian economy. In doing so, he has put himself completely at odds with the Prime Minister. This must create considerable uncertainty as to the Government's intentions at home and abroad. This issue is one of the central factors in our relations with the Third World. One can only imagine that almost certainly the Government's response to the Committee's report will be terribly confusing. Although essentially a conservative document, the report is critical, both impliedly and directly, of both present and past government foreign policies, particularly those which affect the Third World. </para>
        <para>In bringing down the report, the Minister has been quite direct in pointing to the criticisms of the Government's policies. He has made no attempt to hide those criticisms, no doubt because he is in substantial agreement with the criticisms made by the Committee. The report attacks the paternalistic and short-sighted attitude of Liberal governments, particularly during the 1 960s, and suggests that those policies which are inappropriate at the time should be abandoned altogether. More importantly, it criticises very strongly some of the Government's actions in relation to foreign affairs. It is quite scathing in its criticism of the Government's inability to coordinate its actions pointing out that its ad hockery or case by case approach confuses these issues. </para>
        <para>In making that point the Committee is particularly concerned with the deterioriation of our relationships with South East Asian nations which have borne the brunt of these ad hoc arrangements, particularly in such disputes as we have seen recently regarding air fares and certain  trading  matters. The report is also critical of the Australian Government in taking one approach internationally yet adopting another front domestically. This can be taken only as a direct reference to the policies of the Prime Minister whose double standards are increasingly bringing us into disrepute with the nations of South East Asia. It is critical of our attitudes to trade with developing countries and with the level of aid provided to those countries. As such the report represents a substantial criticism of the major features of government policy in this area, despite the fact that the Minister is obviously taking a markedly different view from those which have been expressed by the Prime Minister over the last two or three years. This point should not be lost. The Committee is making its own criticism, quite substantially in parts, of the policies which have been pursued in the past two or three years and with which the Minister for Foreign Affairs obviously disagrees. </para>
        <para>These criticisms must be given considerable credibility because the document is extremely important to us and, as I have said, will be a work of reference to which we will need to refer for quite some time in the future. If one could make a major criticism of the report, and I point out that this criticism is made after I have had only a brief opportunity to look at the document, having received a copy from the Minister before Question Time, it is that the report will give the Government and the public a very biased opinion of our attitudes towards the Third World. It is based on a narrow perception of the way in which Australia "s interests are affected by the Third World. The Committee points out that the World Bank has calculated that some 800 million people- approximately 40 per cent of the Third World- live in conditions of absolute poverty, which has been defined as lacking the basic requirements for a decent life. Yet the whole tenor of the report seems to ignore many of the expressed interests of the Third World countries or it is critical of them. In this respect, the report may do the Government a disservice as it fails to pay adequate attention to the views of the Third World countries, particularly those with which we are now and in the future will be having very close relations. </para>
        <para>We saw the failure of UNCTAD V, which virtually signals a major decline in the notion of a new international economic order and a marked change in the economic debate. At that conference, Western industralised states continued to argue that the general economic condition was quite satisfactory and denied that the world economy was undergoing any crisis. The Eastern bloc, that is, the communist bloc,  -argued that the  economic position was fraught with crises and that the blame could rest on the transnational corporations, private capital, and so on. But the Third World countries took quite a different view. They argued that the world economy was in a state of crisis as a result of profound structural changes affecting development and international relations. They also claimed that the present international economic position was incapable of effectively resolving the most acute questions, which they saw as the problems of development caused by the widening gap between developing and developed countries. </para>
        <para>It is true that there is an enormous difference between the nations generally of the Third World and other countries, but it does seem that the Committee has taken insufficient account of the problems of the poorer of the developing countries. For example, many people in the world obviously are facing starvation. In 1970 the World Food Conference announced that the fight against hunger and underdevelopment could be won, but at that time the cereal shortfall in the Third World countries was about 16 million tonnes. By 1978 the shortfall had gone to 7 1 million tonnes, and that in itself is an indication that the problems of the poorer developing countries are not only great but also are growing. Because of this highly suspicious perception of the Third World, the Committee focuses on Australian interests in the narrowest sense of the word. It argues that the most important of our strategic interests in relation to the Third World is that instability and conflict in that area should not be allowed to endanger Australia's security. Starting from this premise, the Committee expresses concern about the impact of superpower conflicts on the Third World, and in particular in key areas such as the Persian Gulf, the Indian Ocean and the general Korean area. In some respects it appears to be overly concerned with the possible impact in these immediate regions of what might be generally termed revolutionary movements, et cetera. </para>
        <para>Although critical of past Liberal-National Country Party governments for their short term ideological responses and somewhat praiseworthy of previous Labor governments because of their more outward-looking approach towards the United Nations and the Third World, the </para>
        <para class="block">Committee can still maintain a short term approach to many strategic interests. On the question of trade with the Third World countries, the findings will give rise to considerable debate in the community. The Committee quite rightly points out that the balance of trade has not been favourable to the Third World and comes down very firmly in favour of a much more liberal trading pattern. It goes on to argue that Australia's industrial structure must be much more outward looking and, in this, it should be rememberd that it is supported by the Minister for Foreign Affairs. In view of the ambivalent response to the Crawford report on the part of the Government and its maintenance of the 2 per cent import duty, it is unlikely that the Government will come to grips with the Committee's recommendations on this issue. But if the Government fails to deal with the problem it can expect a deterioration in its relations with Third World countries and in particular the five members of the Association of South East Asian Nations, which will be able to point to this report whenever the Prime Minister adopts special pleading to avoid having to live up to his stated views on the level of protection. </para>
        <para>The Committee's report on our relations with ASEAN countries must not be ignored by the Government. To some degree these relationships will be strongly affected by the trading patterns in the future; but the Committee's timely criticism of the Government's ad hoc approach to issues which affect foreign policy must be responded to. The running down of the Department of Foreign Affairs must not be allowed to continue and the Government must be prepared to think more seriously about the implications of its actions before embarking on courses such as the air fares issue which brought Australia into some notable degree of conflict with the ASEAN countries. </para>
        <para>Many matters which the Committee has raised are important and must be dealt with at length. I will deal with three other brief matters in respect of this report. As has been recognised by the Government, Australia's aid to underdeveloped countries has been declining steadily since the Fraser Government took office. This Government has a commitment to increase aid to Third World countries. We have had a commitment, I think, nationally- certainly the Opposition has for some years- to increase our aid to 0.7 per cent of our gross national product. In the current Budget the estimated aid level will be 0.42 per cent of GNP. In 1978 it was 0.45 percent and in 1975 0.6 per cent. Under the present Government the level of aid has been cut back quite substantially from that maximum level of 0.6 per cent to 0.42 per cent. Under those conditions Australia will not be believed in Third World countries when it postures about the new international economic order and the Common Fund when its contribution to the welfare of those nations declines year after year, as it has done. The Committee rightly points out that the amount of aid is inadequate and the Government should set a target date by which time aid should reach the suggested United Nations level. </para>
        <para>The Committee seems to take a critical view of the role played by the Third World in the United Nations. Its report carries an implication that the usefulness of the United Nations is declining because of the increasing political power of the Third World in that body. This criticism could mean only that the Committee has found most of the changes forced on the United Nations by the Third World countries as unacceptable and, if that is so, its response to Third World values and ideals will be inadequate. </para>
        <para>One last point I wish to mention is the reference of the Committee to Antarctica. The report raises very seriously the question of internationalisation of Australia's Antarctic territories and highlights the two approaches open to the Government. In this respect, the Committee poses the dilemma for the Government. This may lead to an improved level of debate on this question. This matter has been raised in the Senate on many occasions. I believe it to be to the advantage of the Parliament and certainly to the people of Australia that the Committee has seen fit to raise what, in fact, is one of the most important issues that will face Australia and its attitude towards Antarctica in the immediate years ahead. </para>

        <para class="block">I wish to make some brief remarks about the tabling of the statement. As I have had a copy of the statement for only half an hour and it consists of 100 pages plus 50-odd pages of tables, I have not been in a position to read it. But I wish to congratulate the Department of Social Security on producing this year at least an interim annual report in September, before the consideration of the Estimates. Last time the Department's report did not arrive until 24 November. I wish also to congratulate the Department on the improved quality of the printing of the report this year. The copy of the report I received last year was printed back to front and upside down and it has now become a collector's item in my collection of reports. </para>
        <para>The third matter on which I remark is that I was informed that the reason for producing an interim statement such as this was that an annual report could not be produced until the Auditor-General's certificate on the Department's report had been received. One assumes, therefore, that the Auditor-General's certificate has not been received. One wonders why the Auditor-General's certificate on the report of the Department of Social Security this year has been delayed. I am told that the reason for tabling an interim statement was to assist us in our consideration of the Department's estimates. I suggest that it is very difficult to use a statement of this size in the consideration of the Department's estimates when one receives a copy of it only about one hour before our consideration of those estimates. I dare say that we will try to get answers to those sorts of questions during the hearings of the Estimates committees. But being, as always, thankful for small mercies, I am grateful for the receipt of even an interim statement so early in the year. I seek leave to continue my remarks later. </para>

But looking beyond that, I am hoping that if this matter appears on the Notice Paper we will have an opportunity to discuss it. That might occur at a time when we have completed our consideration of the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation legislation and a small backlog of deferred citizenship applications have been dealt with. At that stage I will outline my views on the matter. I seek leave to continue my remarks later. </para>

            <para>- As yet I have not been able to obtain an explanation why these are an interim statement in one case and an interim report in the other case. It may be that the recommendations of the Senate Standing Committee on Finance and Government Operations in relation to the presentation of interim reports where final reports could not be made available within a reasonable time are being followed. If so, those responsible are to be commended. However, if interim statements are presented because there is some difficulty in presenting final statementsfor instance, because the Auditor-General is not satisfied with the statements which have been prepared or for some other reason- I believe that it would be desirable that the Minister presenting them should make to the Senate a statement giving the reason why they are interim reports and not final reports. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Chaney</inline> made it clear that the report from the Australian Electoral Office is a final report, except for the fact that it is not in final form because it will take several months to print. That seems to me to be a commendable case of making information available to the Senate before it deals with the Estimates so that the information can be taken into account. </para>

        <para>As opposed to that, if it is a similar sort of report to that which we had last week relating to the Australian Wheat Board report in which there was a situation where an interim report was presented, without any explanation and without financial statements, but at the same time there was published an annual report not stated to be interim, and in a completely different and glossy form made available apparently to others but not to the Senate, and again still without explanation, then I believe there are matters which require some further investigation. What I wanted to say was that these interim reports are a matter for either commendation or investigation. Until I have the opportunity to see them and discuss them with the committee, I am not sure which it is. I wanted to make the point that they have not been overlooked. We would like to have the opportunity either to commend or to investigate. </para>

          </para>
          <para>On 14 April 1976, my predecessor the  Hon.  Ian Viner requested the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Aboriginal Affairs to report on the alcohol problems of Aboriginals. I wish now to report to Parliament on the findings of that Committee, and on action taken by my Department in relation to the report. The terms of reference suggested by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Viner</inline> for the report were: </para>
          <para>To examine the impact of alcohol on Aboriginal communities. </para>
          <para>To examine the social and other causes of the excessive use of alcohol in some Aboriginal communities. </para>
          <para>To examine the advantages which might be gained by Aboriginal communities which face problems associated with alcohol from the experience which other communities have gained in successfully dealing with similar problems. </para>
          <para>To examine the operation of laws including liquor laws in Australia in relation to the impact of alcohol on Aboriginal communities. </para>
          <para>To consider the adequacy of Australian law in tradition-oriented Aboriginal communities, and possible ways to assist them to develop approaches to alcohol created behavioural problems based on traditional strengths and methods of control. </para>
          <para>To recommend ways of assisting Aboriginal communities to overcome problems associated with the excessive use of alcohol, and of reinforcing Aboriginal initiatives in this regard. </para>
          <para>The Standing Committee lodged an interim report on Northern Territory aspects of the Aboriginal alcohol situation in September 1976, and on 1 November 1977 tabled its final report in the House of Representatives. </para>
          <para>In relation to the first term of reference, that is, the impact of alcohol on Aboriginal communities, the Committee concluded that Aboriginal people with low socio-economic status in metropolitan areas and on reserves near or on the fringes of country towns often have serious alcohol problems. The Committee noted that a large proportion of these people are very poor, and that their drinking patterns often reflect those of non-Aboriginals in similar circumstances. Different situations occur in traditional Aboriginal communities. For example, outstation communities, or small kinship groups which have moved back to their traditional lands, were found generally to have fewer alcohol problems than large multi-tribal communities. </para>
          <para>Passing to the second term of reference, the Standing Committee considered that a number of psycho-social and environmental factors cause alcohol problems in various Aboriginal communities. These factors include, and I quote, 'low socio-economic status', 'a lack of motivation and purpose', 'stress and frustration resulting from cultural conflict', 'expression of group solidarity', and the 'expression of equality resulting from racial prejudice and discrimination'. </para>
          <para>In its examination of possible initiatives to deal with alcohol problems based on the experience of other communities, the Committee received little evidence of punishments inflicted under traditional law on persons affected by alcohol. The Committee therefore decided to widen this third term of reference to encompass alcohol prevention and treatment programs which concern Aboriginals. These programs, which include Aboriginal-run alcohol rehabilitation centres, drop-in centres, sobriety groups, Aboriginal Alcoholics Anonymous groups and community-based alcohol counsellors, were supported by the Standing Committee. Most of these activities are funded through my Department. </para>
          <para>The Committee's conclusions are varied on the operation of liquor and other laws as a means of controlling the sale of alcohol and alcohol abuse. The Committee found that a number of communities have experienced considerable difficulty in successfully opposing liquor licences affecting them in deleterious ways. Other communities have not found licensing legislation to be sufficiently flexible to enable community control over such factors as hours of opening, and types of alcohol to be sold. </para>
          <para>As the question of possible recognition of Aboriginal customary law was referred to the Australian Law Reform Commission in February 1977, the Committee did not report on its fifth term of reference, the adequacy of Australian law in traditional communities. The Commission's report should be invaluable in providing examples of the operation of traditional authority systems and dispute solving mechanisms, and ways in which these systems can be reinforced by non-Aboriginal legal authority. </para>
          <para>In making its recommendations on ways to assist Aboriginals to overcome problems associated with alcohol abuse, and to reinforce Aboriginal initiatives in these matters, the Committee divided its comments into four areas. These were prevention, treatment, co-ordination and other measures. The Committee recommended that emphasis in the development of Aboriginal alcohol programs be given to preventive measures and suggested a range of measures to counteract the psycho-social and environmental causes of alcohol misuse it perceived. These measures include continued improvement of environmental conditions, support for outstations, increased support through Commonwealth and State law for Aboriginal communities wishing to limit their alcohol consumption, support for alcohol education programs, and alternative methods for the payment of social security benefits. In addition, the Committee recommended that laws prohibiting the sale of alcohol to intoxicated or under age persons be more rigidly enforced. </para>
          <para>As regards treatment programs, the Committee recommended continuing support for Aboriginal-managed alcohol rehabilitation, counselling and related support services, subject to governmental evaluation of their effectiveness. As regards co-ordination, the Committee recommended that there be adequate consultations with Aboriginals and that they participate fully in all matters affecting them. It also recommended that the Aboriginal alcohol situation be overseen by Aboriginal-controlled co-ordinating committees which should be established in all States and in the Northern Territory. </para>
          <para>Other measures recommended by the Committee were .that the effectiveness of decriminalising drunkenness in the Northern Territory be assessed, and that initiatives be taken by the Commonwealth in relation to the collection of statistics on Aboriginals. </para>
          <para>The Committee's recommendations have been the subject of detailed examination by my Department and other Commonwealth Departments in a series of inter-departmental meetings in 1 977, and subsequently in relation to the preparation of a submission to Cabinet on the Final Report. </para>
          <para>I now turn to action which has been taken on the recommendations of the Report. </para>
          <para>Sixteen of the 28 recommendations made by the Committee relate to policies or programs being carried out by the Department of Aboriginal Affairs in conjunction with other Departments. (Recommendations 1, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 13, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 24, 25, 27, 28.) In relation to prevention, my Department has been providing substantial financial assistance for some time to State and local government authorities and Aboriginal communities and organisations to improve the environmental conditions of Aboriginal people. Assistance is also given by my Department and others to improve non-material aspects of the environment- employment, education and recreation facilities for example. Support is also given to Aboriginal communities wishing to simplify their lifestyle by moving to outstation communities away from large settlements or missions. </para>
          <para>My Department in conjunction with the Australian Foundation on Alcoholism and Drug Dependence and the National Committee for the Prevention of Alcoholism also promotes the attendance of Aboriginal people at seminars on the prevention of alcoholism in Aboriginal communities and in the wider society. Finance for this purpose is provided by my Department and the Department of Education. </para>
          <para>Emphasis in my Department's alcohol program has so far been given to the establishment of Aboriginal-run alcohol rehabilitation centres, follow-up programs and to the development of Aboriginal-controlled alcohol coordinating committees. In December 1977, an additional $750,000 was provided by my Department to establish alcohol projects in each of the States. These projects include treatment centres, community support services aimed at prevention aspects, and sponsorship of postrehabilitation support groups such as Aboriginal groups following the Alcoholics Anonymous philosophy. Funding was also provided to Aboriginal alcohol co-ordinating committees in South Australia and Western Australia. In 1978-79 my Department provided $I.8m to a total of thirtyfour Aboriginal alcohol projects. </para>
          <para>Recommendations 2 (concerning cultural sensitisation programs for Government officers) and 6, 10 and 1 1 (concerning the use of law to support decisions of Aboriginal communities to prohibit or limit alcohol consumption) require both Commonwealth and State examination. In respect of Commonwealth consideration recommendation 2 will be referred to the IDC on </para>
          <para class="block">Co-ordination in Aboriginal Affairs and I have raised recommendations 6, 10 and 1 1 with the Minister for Transport and the Attorney-General. In respect of State consideration these recommendations together with 9, 22, and 23 (concerning licensing provisions) and 28 (concerning statistics about Aboriginals) were referred to the May meeting of the Australian Aboriginal Affairs Council (AAAC). In addition it is proposed that the Government should draw to the attention of State Governments these eight recommendations, while inviting them to have regard to the general content and spirit of the Report. </para>
          <para>Some of the issues involved in the Committee's recommendations concern the manner of payment of Social Security benefits. There is a scheme in operation which provides for bulk payment of unemployment benefits in some communities. In some other communities Community Development Employment Programs administered by my Department have displaced the need for unemployment benefits. I am discussing with the Minister for Social Security options in relation to the wider application of these schemes. </para>
          <para>Recommendation 26 on the effectiveness of decriminalisation of drunkenness in the Northern Territory has not been implemented as support services which were to have accompanied the legislation have not yet been provided. Since 1 July 1978 the Northern Territory Government has assumed responsibility for these matters in the Territory. </para>
          <para>In concluding I would like to make some general comments in relation to the Aboriginal alcohol situation. </para>
          <para>Firstly, I wish to point out that alcohol abuse is not unique to Aboriginal society. It is, as the members of this Chamber are aware, increasingly being recognised as a problem of substantial proportions in our so-called advanced society. The Report of the Standing Committee on Social Welfare entitled 'Drug Problems in Australia- An Intoxicated Society' has made this point clearly enough. It is only in recent times that any concerted effort has been made at Government level to approach the problem in the general community. </para>
          <para>Alcohol problems among Aboriginals obviously include complexities not encountered in the non-Aboriginal situation- I have already referred to the conclusions of the Committee in this respect. Because of these complexities the involvement of Aboriginal people and communities would seem to be necessary in all aspects of </para>
          <para class="block">Aboriginal alcohol programs: in defining the exact nature of the problems, in developing suitable policies, and in planning and implementing effective programs. </para>
          <para>I have indicated that until now, the main concern of my Department has been to provide rehabilitation facilities of a kind acceptable to Aboriginal people with alcohol problems, and that expenditure through my Department for these projects in 1 978-79 was approximately $ 1 .8m. </para>
          <para>While these figures reflect substantial effort by those involved it must be acknowledged that the approaches adopted are still quite experimental. In addition, the effects are not always clearly evident and in some cases organisations have encountered various operational difficulties. Thus it is difficult to fully evaluate the effectiveness of Government expenditure on Aboriginal alcohol programs. </para>
          <para>A final aspect which adds to difficulties in administering programs in this area concerns the institutional arrangements that have arisen in recent years. These arrangements have resulted in a complex and in some respects confusing framework of responsibilities. There is therefore a need to examine and improve organisations. Areas in which greater co-ordination is seen to be needed are consultation, the development of preventive and treatment projects, the formulation of policy, and the administration and financing of programs. My Department is examining these issues. </para>
          <para>I make no claim that we have found adequate solutions to the problem of alcohol which besets many communities. A number of relatively recent initiatives will take time to evaluate, e.g. the Northern Territory legislation which anticipates special licensing conditions being imposed in particular areas in response to community demand, and the legislative initiative in Western Australia which will permit a couple of isolated communities to make by-laws including laws relating to alcohol. Many of the Aboriginal organisations working in the alcohol field are comparatively new and I anticipate that their skills will improve over the next few years and they will achieve greater results with the support of my Department and other agencies. We cannot ignore, however, that some communities are being decimated by alcohol to an extent which makes it difficult to remedy the problems which might be seen as the cause for drinking. Accordingly, I have asked the Council for Aboriginal Development and the National Aboriginal Conference through its State branches to give this problem early consideration in the context of the </para>
          <para class="block">House of Representatives Committee report but not to feel limited by the recommendations contained in that report. I also welcome further views and suggestions from members of this Parliament, many of whom have taken a close interest in Aboriginal affairs generally and in this aspect in particular. </para>
          <para>I have prepared a statement which lists each of the Standing Committee's recommendations and the current position concerning those recommendations. Copies of this statement were distributed to honourable senators when it was tabled by my colleague in the House of Representatives. Further copies are available in the Senate Records Office. </para>

            <para>- On this question of the resumption of the debate being made an order of the day for the next day of sitting, I am very much in the dark on that point. This is one of those instances where apparently the House of Representatives has set up a committee which has tabled a report with several recommendations. On every other occasion when a Minister has indicated what he intends to do with recommendations from a committee, at least they have been read to the Parliament. If there is anything of importance in the report or the recommendations which necessitates some immediate action or consideration, someone can get up straight away. In this case we could refuse <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Chaney</inline> leave to continue his remarks and the matter would have to be debated. No one knows what the Government is doing. I am only a backbencher, but I can only assume that someone with responsibility on the Opposition side knows the Minister's intention in relation to this question and has decided on this procedure. I do not want to interfere, but in view of the procedure that has been adopted I would ask that the resumption of the debate be after a very short period, when we have had a look at the document. Some consideration should be given to the Opposition as to the time of bringing it on as it may be essential for it to be brought on in the next day or so. </para>

            <para>- I think it is important to respond to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cavanagh.</inline> My understanding is that the report was made available to the Opposition in the normal way. I think <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cavanagh</inline> 's point is a very reasonable one, that that should have taken place. However, the difficulty facing Ministers is a real one. In the case of the committee of which I am  chairman,  if a report is brought down which relates to the Minister for Health, we would expect that the response from the Government would come down to this chamber, since the Senate committee made the report. But obviously the Minister for Health in another place would want it to be presented there because it related to his portfolio. I think the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Chaney)</inline> has taken the course of action which is most appropriate for the Senate. The report has been put down in another place in response to a committee of that place, and it has been put down here to make sure that this chamber has the information. It was made available to the Opposition in the usual way. </para>

There is no simple solution to these problems but following extensive engineering investigations, a broad plan has now been developed to improve reception by establishing a number of translator stations in the UHF band. </para>
            <para>Initially translators arc scheduled for construction at North Head and Kings Cross to serve areas of eastern and central Sydney, and northern Sydney where television reception at the moment is unsatisfactory. The commercial translators, which will bc operational ahead of the national translators, are expected to commence within the next twelve months. The provision of translators in further areas is under investigation and will be established as soon as resources permit. </para>
