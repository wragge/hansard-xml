          <para>- Ellis Lawrie was not a man to seek acclaim for his successes in public life, though they were very many. He deserves much wider credit for his considerable contribution to the documentation of evidence placed before the inquiry into relieving the community of the burden of estate duty. It was a fight which he pursued doggedly for many years, as we who served with him in the Senate will recall. I also recall that he was one of the signatories to a dissenting report when the Senate Standing Committee on Finance and Government Operations presented its report on death duties in 1973. He stood firm in his opinion that the Committee&#39;s report did not go far enough towards total abolition. He would have received great satisfaction from the Commonwealth&#39;s decision to end that tax, which was taken after he retired from the Senate in 1975. </para>

        <para>
          <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lawrie</inline>was involved in the beef industry all his life, and was involved with the affairs of the Rockhampton district. He was a member of the executive of the Central Coast Graziers Association and of the United Graziers Association of Queensland. He served for many years in community life including some 13 years on the Fitzroy Shire Council, six years on the Rockhampton Harbour Board and three years on the Rockhampton Hospital Board. He held most positions of office in the Queensland Country Party, including four years as its State  President.  During this time he travelled widely throughout his State and became a very familiar figure in even the most remote parts of it. He was familiar with the problems of Queensland and its people and during his time in the Senate he voiced them to very good effect in this Parliament. </para>
        <para>He served on the Senate Select Committee on Air Pollution, the Senate Select Committee on Securities and Exchange, the Senate Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances, the Senate Standing Committee on Finance and Government Operations and a number of other committees. He was a member of the panel of temporary chairmen of the Senate who support you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr President.</inline> Ellis Lawrie was a quiet man. He was totally loyal to his friends and to government, but above all he was a stalwart to his State, to his political party and to rural communities. He lived respected and he died regretted. </para>

After his election to the Senate in 1964 he was prominent in the activities of the Senate. For six years I sat with him on the Senate Select Committee on Securities and Exchange and I know the work that he put into that Committee. As <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Webster</inline> said, he was a very gentle man. He was a very big man physically. I often heard it said around the chamber that the only way Ellis Lawrie could hurt anybody would be by sitting on him. I have no doubt that the personality of Ellis Lawrie will be missed, as we have missed him these past three years or so since he was with us. On behalf of the Opposition I indicate our regret at his passing. </para>

I join, as do all my colleagues, with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Webster</inline> and the Leader of the Opposition, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wriedt,</inline> in paying tribute to Ellis Lawrie and in extending our sympathy to his widow and family. </para>

          <para>-I join with those honourable senators who have spoken to pay tribute to Ellis Lawrie. After I came into the Senate, in due course I was elected as a member of the Senate Standing Committee on Finance and Government Operations. I came to know Ellis Lawrie very intimately in the activities of that Committee because one might say that we were handed a hot potato in dealing with the fairly emotional issues that grew up at that time concerning estate duty. I came to appreciate the quality of Ellis Lawrie as  Chairman  of that Committee. Subsequently, with a change of government, I succeeded him in that position. I think the most important part of the processes of that Committee was the manner in which Ellis Lawrie sought to reach some measure of agreement between members of the Committee. In those circumstances I learned a little about the man and about the way in which he approached his obligations as a member of this Senate. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>I think that he possessed a rare quality insofar as, whilst he was a member of a political party, he gave some recognition to the rights of others to present a point of view. He did all in his power to make sure that the Committee considered all aspects of death duties and the other matters that had been referred to it. He was a very tolerant person. He was a very tolerant Chairman and subsequently a very tolerant rank and file member of that Committee. He showed a degree of compassion which so often is lacking in this place. Of course, even in this place he showed a degree of fairness in debate. I think it must be said that he never indulged in personalities. I would have to concede that he was a good party man. Nevertheless he was prepared to debate the issue rather than the personalities and to that degree he will be sadly missed. One thing that I had in common with him was that we were both members of local government. That might have meant that we had a bond that extended across party lines. </para>
        <para>I endorse what has been said by the Leader of the National Country Party <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Webster),</inline> the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Wriedt)</inline> and the Leader of the Government in the Senate <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Carrick).</inline> I think we are poorer when people such as former <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lawrie</inline> leave this place. Now that he has passed on the least we can do is to pay tribute to his work in this place with regard to his public duties and to express on behalf of each side of the chamber a feeling of deep loss at his passing. I extend to his family my condolences on the loss of a person who faithfully served this chamber, this Parliament and also his party. </para>

As <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Webster</inline> has said already, he was not only a gentleman but also a gentle man. He was a quiet man, a man whose friendship knew no bounds. If one made a friend of Ellis Lawrie one certainly had a friend for life. He was warmhearted and generous in many ways. I served with Ellis here both in government and in opposition and I believe that he contributed very much to the Parliament as well as being a very worthwhile representative of the State of Queensland. I knew both him and his wife, Margaret. To her and her family I wish to express my deepest sympathies and my hope that, whilst they have lost him in this life, his memory will be a great comfort to them and to those who knew and loved him. </para>

          <para>-I also join my colleagues in this chamber in expressing condolences on the death of former <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lawrie.</inline> I took his place here representing Queensland. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lawrie</inline> was a big man in every way. He was big in stature and big in heart. That has been adverted to already. He saw Australia as a big country with a big potential. For that potential to be realised Australia needed men with a big vision. Ellis Lawrie was such a man. It also needed men who could husband the earth and manage its herds and flocks. Ellis was a man of the land and, as has been intimated already, he associated himself early in his life with the United Graziers Association of Queensland and the Central Coast Graziers Association. He sensed that the land and the people who worked it- those who farmed it- were going to play an increasing part in the government and development of this country. He was interested in public life not just because country people needed representation- they did then and they do now- but also because he felt that people who were reared in the country had something to offer this nation. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>As <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Webster</inline> has said, he involved himself very much in public life, but all the time he found himself drawn inexorably to the world cf politics. In 1 945 he joined the then Australian Country Party He served on many of its councils with distinction. From 1961 to 1964 he was its State  President.  Then he was a member of the Australian Country Party in the Senate for 10 years. In 1976 he received his party&#39;s highest reward in the form of life membership. </para>
        <para>Ellis, with all his humility, mixed well. He could not dissolve easily into a crowd because he stood tall and his broad shoulders made him very easy to pick out in a crowd. He liked people and, more importantly, people felt quite at ease with him whenever they wanted to discuss their problems. He was a quiet man and an unpretentious man, but his quiet and unpretentious manner hid a very sharp and alert mind. He served well on committees of the Parliament. When I first came into this chamber the officers of the Senate ever so gently reminded me of the person in whose footsteps I trod. Honourable senators on both sides of the chamber who served with him on committees also reminded me, not quite as gently, of him in whose footsteps I trod and the part that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lawrie</inline> played in his own quiet manner in the Parliament. He was no headline seeker. If headlines came his way, he accepted that and he just got on with the job that he was put in the Parliament to do. I join with the other senators in their expressions of condolence to his wife Margaret and the family. </para>

          <para>- As a fellow Queenslander I would like to be associated with this expression of condolence to <inline font-weight="bold">Mrs Lawrie</inline> and her family, as Ellis Lawrie was one of the first Federal politicians I met. As other senators have said, he was a typical country man. He was big and suntanned, he had a rolling gait and a ready laugh, and he ate with gusto, as I am sure all honourable senators would remember. I can remember the way in which he, as  President  of the Queensland Country Party, as it then was, could in his quiet and persistent way settle disputes with a refined use of just plain horse sense. I was very proud to learn from him. He paid unflagging attention to his electorate; he attended meetings everywhere. He was seen at his best at places such as Dingo, Duaringa and Anakie. I have very many fond recollections of meetings held in those places. Surprisingly in this permissive day and age, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lawrie</inline> was a whizz in his dealings with members of the Young Country Party or the Young National Party as it is now. He was ably helped by his wife Margaret who had a great affinity with Aboriginal children and with other children. She made a particular study of the languages of Aborigines and of Islanders. He and his family made a politically active unit  in the area. I pay tribute to them for their contribution to public life. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>When I first became a member of the Senate with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lawrie</inline> we were experiencing stirring times. One double dissolution had just taken place and we were heading for another; we had in power a reforming government and, of course, the numbers on both sides of the Senate were equal. It was unfortunate that during that time the first manifestations of his illness became evident. I pay tribute to him for his courage, his fortitude and his loyalty to the Party during that particularly difficult time for him. He always kept the good of his party in the forefront of his mind. Those honourable senators who remember the circumstances surrounding his retirement will remember that in the end it was once again his plain horse sense that allowed him to find the right answer. He was a life member of the National Country Party. It is a privilege to have known him, a privilege to have worked with him and a privilege to have learned from him. I am proud to share in this expression of condolence to his wife Margaret and the family. </para>

        </subdebateinfo>
        <para class="block">To the Honourable the  President  and Members of the Senate in Parliament assembled. The Petition of the undersigned respectfully showeth: </para>
        <para>That in spite  of  numerous measures taken by various governments, unemployment in the country has not significantly declined. </para>
        <para>As a result, supplies of both goods and services have declined: human resources are wasted, capital resources are not used and natural resources are left under-developed. </para>
        <para>Both local and overseas experience shows that prosperity is encouraged when taxes which penalise production are replaced by taxes which provide incentives for productivity. </para>
        <para class="block">These also provide disincentives to idle speculation such as that which results in so called &#39;windfall profits&#39; from land price increases. </para>
        <para>The reduction of Income-tax, Sales-tax and Payroll tax is known to reduce the costs of production and to stimulate demand. </para>
        <para>It is also known that when Land Tax or Council Rates are raised on the Unimproved Site Value of land, then the development of vacant land and under-developed slum areas is stimulated. </para>
        <para>It follows then, that the gradual replacement of taxes on production with taxes on non-production will create new employment, reduces the costs of production, reduces the rate of interest, the cost of housing and stimulates all industries. </para>
        <para>We wish to point out that the replacement of production penalising taxes is a very practical proposal. According to official Municipal Valuations, it is estimated that unimproved Site Values have increased from $37,000m in 1973-74 to $67,000m by 1976-77. This represents $30,000m so called &#39;windfall profits&#39; which was completely unrelated to productive improvements. </para>
        <para>Your petitioners most humbly pray that the Senate, in Parliament assembled, should act to relieve unemployment by a Taxation Reform to replace taxes on production with taxes which provide incentives for the increased supply of both goods and services. </para>

        <para>That on the 10 December 1948, the General Assembly of the United Nations adopted and proclaimed the Universal Declaration of Human Rights which declares that, &#39;Everyone is entitled to all the rights and freedoms set forth in the Declaration . . . &#39;(Article2)that&#39;Everyonehastheright to take part in the government of his country, directly or through freely chosen representatives . . .

        <para>Elections for Senators meet all requirements except one. Senators are elected periodically, by secret ballot, with universal franchise, and the quota-preferential method of proportional representation ensures that the vote values within states are equal as nearly as can be. </para>

I ask him: Does the Government propose putting down a statement in the Parliament of its views of the current dispute in South East Asia? If so, will the statement include a detailed account of all actions and initiatives taken by the Government especially to reduce tension in the area? Will the statement also include the Government&#39;s view as to the causes of the present conflict in Indochina and its future policy in respect of the area? </para>

            <para>-Senator Wriedt very properly at the outset touches upon the issue of our immediate time, and that is the conflict which has arisen in Vietnam. My understanding is that the Government proposes within the coming days or week to make a detailed statement on the matter. I will draw the attention of the Prime Minister and the Foreign Minister to the points that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wriedt</inline> asks might be incorporated, and see whether we can accommodate him and the Senate in this regard. I think all honourable senators would want to see Australia as working for one common objective, and that is the lessening of the tensions and a movement towards a just and dignified peace. I will certainly take this to the Prime Minister. </para>

            <para>-My question, which is directed to the Minister for Social Security, concerns matters aired in the 3 February issue of the <inline font-style="italic">National Times.</inline> Whilst anxious to avoid any mention of matters which might be sub judice, I ask the Minister: First, was her Director-General quoted substantially correctly in relation to reasons he advanced for placing the word &#39;Greece&#39; on placards included in certain photographs and also in relation to the view attributed to him- and I quote the newspaper article- that &#39;the criminal law is stacked to give the defendent the benefit of the doubt- even if someone is found innocent they could be guilty &#39;? Secondly, if he was correctly quoted, can the Minister advise the Senate whether these statements are consistent with her previous assurances to the Senate on 3 May and with the policies and practices of her Department? Thirdly, can she specifically assure the Senate, in spite of anything that her Director-General might say, that those found not guilty of any offence will be so regarded by her Department? Fourthly, and finally, can the Minister comment on assertions in that article that some former beneficiaries living in Greece have had to wait nine months or more for appeals against benefit cancellations to be heard? </para>

            <para>- A very long and detailed question has been asked by the Government Whip. I hope that the Senate will bear with me as I deal with the matters raised. The first matter raised by the Government Whip related to an article in the <inline font-style="italic">National Times</inline> which quoted an interview with the Director-General of Social Services. I believe that this matter related to the placing of the word &#39;Greece&#39; on placards. I take this opportunity to refer to a discussion that we had in this place at the end of the last session during which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Grimes</inline> mentioned the matter of the placement of the word &#39;Greek&#39; on placards used by police. At that time I advised him and the Senate that it had been alleged that some people were photographed holding placards bearing the word &#39;Greek&#39; and I said that the Commonwealth police advised that the word Greek&#39; did not appear at all. The Commonwealth Police brief stated the allegation in these terms: </para>

            <para>Some of those charged were photographed holding placards bearing the word &#39;Greek&#39;. </para>
          </quote>
          <para>The response in the brief read: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>Prior to being charged the offenders were photographed holding a sign board nearing their name. (Section 353a of the New South Wales Crimes Act, in conjunction with Section 6 of the Commonwealth Police Act, provides the requisite authority.) </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">The police went on to say in the brief provided to me that the word &#39;Greek&#39; did not appear at all. This is the case. The word &#39;Greek&#39; did not appear and this was the matter I referred to. I have subsequently found that I was misadvised to the extent that the word &#39;Greece &#39; was used in respect of five people to indicate the country of origin. The police have so advised and I believe that that was referred to by the Director-General in the article in the <inline font-style="italic">National Times.</inline> As far as the comment of the Director-General is concerned, I think it ought to be understood that it was not the Director-General who authorised the use of the placard by the police and I certainly say that the Government does not justify the action. The explanation given by the police was that it was to indicate the country of birth of the person and the date of birth. As far as I am concerned it is not appropriate in a multi-cultural society such as ours to place that indicator on any sort of placard and I certainly do not believe that it would be condoned. The Government is of the view that this should not have happened and action is being taken to ensure that it does not happen again. </para>
          <para>
            <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Baume</inline>also asked me whether the Director-General was correctly quoted with regard to the comment he made concerning the policies and practices of the Department to the effect that even if a person is found innocent that person could be guilty. I understand from the Director-General that he had a very long interview with the journalist concerned and that he explained in detail the application of the law. He has the impression that the quote that was attributed to him was a travesty of the very careful explanation that he gave, both orally and in writing, during that particular interview. That is probably a matter for judgment by someone else, but if I am asked whether that comment is consistent with my assurances about the activities of my Department I assert that it is not the role of the Department of Social Security to determine guilt. It is the role of the Department of Social Security to determine eligibility for pensions and benefits and to ensure that they are paid to all those who are eligible to receive them. </para>
          <para>I think I was asked also whether I could assure the Senate, despite anything that might have been said in the article, that those found not guilty would be so regarded by my Department. I certainly am able to assure the Senate that if people do not have charges sustained against them, through the processes of the courts, it is not the role of my Department to have any different view. As far as my personal view is concerned, I have consistently asserted in this place that in the present instance it is the role of the courts to determine the facts and to bring down a judgment on the matter. </para>
          <para>With regard to the last part of the question, which I think related to the length of time for the hearing of appeals in Greece, may I say that this is something that is of concern to me. It has been a long time since the original allegations of ineligibility were made and it is now known that medical advisers went to Greece to give an opportunity for appeals to be heard. I may say that this was the first instance in which the Commonwealth had taken steps to allow people to have an appeal heard in another country with regard to a pension which had been taken to that country under the portability arrangements. It did take some time for appeals to come through. They filtered through into the Department over a matter of months and when it was determined that a team should go to Greece it took even longer than I had hoped to make the necessary arrangements. The doctors have now returned from Greece and determinations are being made. I hope that the whole matter will be concluded without further delay. </para>

            <para>- My question, which is also directed to the Minister for Social Security, follows upon the question just asked by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Baume.</inline> The Minister has said that she remembers my making an allegation in this place towards the end of last year that some people charged in connection with the alleged frauds had claimed that they had been photographed by the police with the word &#39;Greece &#39; written on a placard underneath them. The Minister will remember, no doubt, that she said at the time that she had been advised that this was not so. The word &#39;Greek&#39; was the word I used but the Minister now admits that they were photographed with the word &#39;Greece&#39; written on a placard. I ask: When the Minister answered me at that time was she aware that these people had been photographed with the word &#39;Greece&#39; written on a placard? If she was aware of this, why did she indulge in such matters of semantics in denying the fact that they had any name written on a placard underneath them? With regard to other allegations which I made at the time and which were also denied with equal vehemence by her, has she checked to see whether they were true, particularly those involving phone tapping, those involving the entering of premises without warrants and those involving the use of only Commonwealth Police interpreters instead of independent interpreters, which allegations I believe were also denied by her at the time on advice from her Department and the Commonwealth Police? </para>

At that time I read from a Commonwealth Police brief which told me that the word Greek &#39; did not appear at all. I had no further information from the Commonwealth Police at that time. I was not indulging in an exercise in semantics about the word &#39;Greece&#39; and the word Greek&#39;. I accepted the police brief that I held. I accepted it to be the only information which was known about this matter. As I said at that time, I was advised that the word &#39;Greek&#39; did not appear. I have since been advised that in, I think, five cases a placard bearing the date of birth with the word &#39;Greece&#39; following it was used when the police were taking photographs. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator</inline></para>

I also said that the Government is of the view that this should not have happened and that action is being taken to ensure that it does not happen again. That is the considered view of the Government, now having knowledge of the fact that this word indicating the place of birth was used by the police when photographing those who were charged under the Act. </para>

I ask the AttorneyGeneral whether his attention has been drawn to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Brown&#39;s</inline> statement that the manner in which the Crown had conducted its case represented a fundamental denial of the defendants&#39; rights and, in particular, his contention that the defendants &#39;stood in the same uninformed position&#39; regarding charges against them as they had 10 months ago, when first charged. Whilst in no way seeking any comment from the AttorneyGeneral on the truth or otherwise of the charges, or on any matter at issue in these prosecutions, I ask the Attorney-General whether he can say why the defendants in these cases were not provided with reasonable particulars of the charges laid against them and indicate what steps have been taken to remedy the situation. </para>

            <para>-I am glad that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Missen</inline> has expressed awareness of the sensitivity of a matter which is, of course, sub judice. He asked about the request for particulars of charges which have been laid against a large number of defendants in what has become known as the social security frauds matter. The position is that the Crown case is being conducted by the  Deputy  Crown Solicitor, who has briefed a team of counsel in Sydney, led by a Queen&#39;s Counsel. The task of preparing the case, marshalling the evidence and so on, is a very large one indeed. When the case came on for mention before the magistrate in September last year he indicated that committal proceedings would commence in March of this year but that the matter would be mentioned again at the end of January. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>At that time counsel also indicated that particulars would be delivered by 15 January, if possible, and that if that was not possible advice to that effect would be given by 1 5 January. It is a matter of concern that particulars were not delivered- I hesitate to say &#39;as undertaken&#39; because, as I interpret it, counsel had indicated that they would use their best endeavours to provide particulars by that day. They did advise just prior to that day that it was not possible to meet the promise that had been made. Particulars were provided subsequently in a large number of cases- I am not quite sure whether they were provided in all cases- and the issue has now arisen as to whether or not those particulars are sufficient. On 3 1 January the magistrate declined to order any further and better particulars and some defendants have now taken proceedings in the Supreme Court of New South Wales seeking further and better particulars. That matter is before the Supreme Court of New South Wales, and I do not think it would be appropriate for me to make any comment on a matter which clearly is sub judice. I am sure that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Missen</inline> would not expect me to do so. </para>

            <para>-The Minister representing the Minister for Transport will no doubt remember that on several occasions I have asked questions relating to the upgrading of Hobart Airport in such a manner that it would be suitable for international nights from Tasmania to New Zealand. Irrespective of the outcome of discussions to be held on 27 February with the New Zealand Government concerning a bilateral air agreement relating to flights from Tasmania to New Zealand, will the Government urgently consider the upgrading of the runway at Hobart not only for additional safety at Hobart but also so that when wide bodied aircraft are introduced into Australia- which should be soon if we are to have low internal air fares- it will be possible for those aircraft to land and take off again with a full payload? Will the Minister ask the Minister for Transport to examine whether the present runway should be extended or whether another runway should be built running approximately east-west which would avoid the hills in the area of Hobart? </para>

It relates to recent statements made by the Minister in a radio program in which he made some observations upon the relevance of teacher training to the world of commerce and industry. I ask: Does the Minister recall the recommendations pf the Senate Standing Committee on Education and the Arts in its report on the Commonwealth&#39;s role in teacher education? I have no doubt that the Minister will recall that he was a member of that Committee. Is the Minister aware that some of these recommendations called for the integration of course subjects, education subjects and practical teaching and called upon the Australian Universities Commission and the Australian Commission on Advanced Education to encourage the establishment of integrated courses? Have some of these recommendations been neglected? Will the Minister examine the report in relation to his own statements and endeavour to .recover the ground which seems to have been lost through an apparent neglect of the Senate Committee &#39;s report? </para>

            <para>- I recall the report very well. I was very happy to have some part in its preparation. The comments which I made on this matter are part of an overall concern on the part of all persons connected with education in Australia about the problems of transition from school to work. It was part of the concern that the students in the school should be given on the one hand a balanced education and on the other hand proper vocational equipment and, just as importantly, the capacity for advice from teachers in the form of vocational counselling. My remarks, which in no way reflected on teachers themselves, were directed at the fact that in the nature of the evolution of a student to a teacher and beyond most had little or no opportunity to understand or interpret the outside world and therefore did not have, in many cases, the capacity for vocational guidance. The Australian Education Council has been interested to pursue this matter of developing vocational guidance. The Council and I, as the Commonwealth Minister for Education, are looking at ways in which we can perhaps provide inservice training for existing teachers as well as pre-service training in the teacher training colleges so that teachers concerned shall have a detailed overview of the nature of commerce, industry and tertiary industries themselves. I believe this is of great significance indeed. Equally I remind <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Davidson</inline> that recently we set up the Auchmuty Committee to conduct a national inquiry into all aspects of teacher education. That Committee will be looking at these matters and so that there cannot be any question of oversight I will refer the report of the committee chaired by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Davidson</inline> to the Auchmuty Committee for study. </para>

I further refer the Minister to the Liberal and National Country Party policy in the 1975 and 1977 elections which states that &#39;the cost of safeguarding the environment from damaging intrusions by man is a cost, properly incurred in producing goods and services, which must ultimately be met by the producers of those goods and services and reflected in the price&#39;. I ask the Minister how, having regard to those statements, he reconciles his own recent announcement as the Minister for Science and the Environment that he was sympathetic to the view that Government decisions on environmental questions are often inappropriate intervention and that business has lost out in the bargain. </para>

Is the Minister aware that the Tasmanian rural economy, hard hit over the years by the effects of the New Zealand-Australia Free Trade Agreement, has received a major compensation from the development of the poppy growing industry for legal drug production? Is it a fact that the Australian Government has now succumbed to pressures from the United States to curtail the already relatively small- in world production terms- Tasmanian industry? If so, what percentage cut in the Tasmanian production is to be agreed to? Is this attack on this important Tasmanian industry really likely to have any effect on the control of illicit drugs around the world?

In the event of the Australian Government providing a licensing system for foreign trawlers to operate in our 200-mile offshore fishing zone, will the Minister insist that there be an Australian observer on every vessel to see that those vessels do not plunder our mammals? Secondly, will he insist also that the new super apron net invented by the United States will be used?

It has implications in relation to Australian fishing limits. My understanding is that the destruction of marine mammals is not a problem in waters off Australia as they do not aggregate within the target tuna species and that it is not necessary to require the use of the super apron nets developed by the United States National Marine Fisheries Service. Whilst it is most unlikely that marine mammals will be taken by foreign fishing vessels operating in the 200-mile Australian fishing zone, the matter which the honourable senator has raised will be kept under review and, wherever possible, government observers will be placed on foreign fishing vessels. If necessary, conditionsincluding restrictions on the type of fishing gear to be used- will be applied. </para>

            <para>- My question is directed to the Minister representing the Minister for Transport and refers to the recently negotiated excursion air fares for people travelling between Australia and the United Kingdom and between Australia and the United States of America. I think that the Minister will be aware that a number of representations have been made to the Minister for Transport, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Nixon,</inline> about the discrimination against South Australia in respect of travel to and from South Australia because presently Qantas Airways Ltd has to apply the ruling domestic fare for such travel. As <inline font-weight="bold">Senator</inline></para>

          <para>Chaney knows, these arguments have been put to the Minister for Transport and have been supported by petitions and representations made as recently as January and, before that, by correspondence in October and December of last year with the responsible State Minister. Although the Minister for Transport has been sympathetic, the matter which is the subject of those representations is unresolved. Can the Minister give any indication as to whether the matter will be determined favourably? </para>

              <inline font-weight="bold">- Senator Bishop</inline>has raised a matter which is of great interest to people not only in South Australia but also in Western Australia, Queensland and other places which are not served by the direct point-to-point fares which have already been negotiated for international travel. On 24 January the Minister for Transport made a statement pointing out that he was committed to the principle of lower add-on fares than are currently available in Australia for people who want to connect with those flights. The Government remains committed to that principle and at the moment negotiations with the airlines are pressing on as a matter of urgency. It is hoped that there will be some finalisation of the arrangements in the near future. I cannot give the honourable senator a precise date, which from his question I think he wanted, but I can assure him that around Australia the interest that he has expressed is felt in regard to the negotiation of these fares. </para>

            <para>- My answer to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Thomas&#39;s</inline> question must be in very similar terms to the answer I just gave to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bishop.</inline> He has raised a matter which is of considerable importance to his constituents because of the very obvious overcrowding during large parts of the day at Perth Airport. As he said, there is a committee at the moment working on this matter. It is a Commonwealth-State committee and it is at the moment considering the final draft of its report. The best I can say to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Thomas</inline> is that it is expected to report very soon to the Government. This is a situation where the problem is not so much the runways as the facilities for passengers and baggage handling. These areas are not really adequate to meet the current needs. It is likely, therefore, that some early action will be taken on the report, even if for the time being that is merely a re-arrangement of some of the facilities. </para>

            <para>- My question is directed to the Minister representing the Minister for Administrative Services, but it may well relate to the period when he was in fact the Minister for Administrative Services. I refer to a statement made by the Prime Minister on 1 October 1976 which sets out the present Government&#39;s purchasing policy and I specifically draw the Minister&#39;s attention to the direction given by the Prime Minister that Australian firms be given every opportunity to do business with the Federal Government. Did the Government take this stand in the interests of employment opportunities in Australia? Has the Government&#39;s policy on these matters changed in recent times? If it has not, can the Minister advise the Senate why the official Senate diary for 1979 was printed in Hong Kong, whether Australian firms were given the opportunity to print the diary, whether the Government&#39;s own printing service was given the opportunity to quote and what were the circumstances that led to the decision to print official government publications in a foreign country? Further, is it contemplated that other government publications similarly will be printed in cheap labour countries? </para>

            <para>- As far as I am aware, there has been no recent change in the purchasing policy which was announced by the Government in 1976, but there certainly was some public announcement about a change in the emphasis of that policy at some time between 1976 and 1978. I cannot tell the honourable senator precisely when that was, but it was some time ago. That is a matter about which I can find out and let the honourable senator have additional information. I have no familiarity with the circumstances that he has raised in respect of the Senate diary, and the fact that it was printed in Hong Kong. I do not know who was responsible for placing that order, but again I will make inquiries and let the honourable senator know. I would suggest that it is very likely, however, that the contract was let there for reasons of price. </para>

            <para>- As to the newspaper reports, I will get for <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lewis</inline> and for the Senate precise details of any action which the Government may have taken so that we can all be on common ground. Those who know <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Arthur</inline> Tange will know that he has been a very distiguished public servant of all governments and has acquired special skills over a period of time. It would be natural, therefore, whatever may be the quality of others coming forward, that his services, particularly in these difficult times, would be sought. I do not think it reflects at this moment a paucity of people coming forward to be trained. I think that the promotions to the top ranks of the Public Service in recent years have shown that there is a very high degree of skill and particularly of dedication amongst public servants. Nevertheless, I will take the question in terms of the philosophy it puts forward. I could not argue against the idea that we should be encouraging talent to come to the top. Of course, where there may be some stringencies, they should not get in the way of such promotion. I will refer the question to the Prime Minister and to the Minister for Defence. </para>

Can the Minister tell the Senate the amount of the Federal Government&#39;s allocations to Tasmania in block grant funding for pre-schools in 1978-79? What was the amount allocated to Tasmania by the Commonwealth under the new federalism, as a percentage of personal income tax revenue for 1978-79? Is it true that the Tasmanian Government is entitled to make a special application for funds to the Commonwealth Grants Commission if it can demonstrate hardship in funding pre-schools in the State? If so, has the Tasmanian Government made an approach to the Commonwealth Grants Commission? </para>

Those parts which dealt with the share of income tax and with Grants Commission applications are not within my departmental responsibility, and I suggest that they be directed to the Treasurer or placed on notice for his attention. With regard to the pre-school block grant that is made to the States, and in particular to Tasmania, for the year 1978-79 the total Commonwealth block grant for pre-schools is $32.75m, which is divided among the States in proportion to the number of four and five year-old children attending pre-schools in each State. Based on information which is presently available, Tasmania&#39;s allocation has been provisionally determined as $1,054,000. This amount is subject to review when information is received from all of the States, but it is not expected to vary greatly. The Tasmanian Government may distribute these funds to the individual pre-school services according to its assessment of priorities. As would be understood, State governments also fund pre-schools, and the Commonwealth grant is a contribution to pre-school education. I think that in one instance we are still awaiting details of the number of children attending pre-school so that we can make the final grant. As I said, the figure for Tasmania is more than $ 1 m. </para>

I refer to the assessment that she has just given, namely, that this year- to date anyway- the Tasmanian grant for pre-schools and child care will be $1,054,000, and to the Budget allocation as shown in Budget Paper No. 7, at page 187 of the Budget Papers, which was $1,665,000 and represented a fall of $400,000 on last year&#39;s allocation to Tasmania for pre-schools and child care. Are we to assume now that Tasmania is to receive this financial year $lm less than last year&#39;s allocation for pre-schools and child care, which in effect will mean a 50 per cent cut in the allocation to Tasmania? </para>

              <para>- The figure about which I am speaking is the pre-school block grant to Tasmania. It is not one that includes any grant made via the State for child care, so I am unaware whether the figure <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wriedt</inline> cited includes a child care component. The figure I mentioned, $1,054,000, is the provisionally determined grant. It is subject to review when information is received from all States of the children in the four years and five years age groups who are actually attending pre-schools in each State. I think only one State is holding up that final distribution. When that figure is in we will then be able to give the final figure for the year. In regard to the Budget, if what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wriedt</inline> is reading from shows a figure of $32.75m as the total, then that is the pre-school figure. If it shows a total higher than that then there is an inclusion of some child care components. </para>

            <para>- I direct a question to the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs. A media report in Darwin states that unalienated Crown land in the Northern Territory subject to Aboriginal land claims, such as a recent claim on the island Dum-im-mime in the vicinity of Darwin, is owned by the Northern Territory community. The Northern Territory Attorney-General has said that there is a positive duty to examine each claim to determine whether and to what extent the public interest will be thereby affected. This would then be a guide for future action, either opposition or support. It was also reported that claim books had not been lodged by applicants to indicate on what facts their claims rest. Is the Minister in a position to clarify this situation? </para>

            <para>-I saw a report in Northern Territory newspapers outlining the facts which have been put before the Senate in that question. I can advise the Senate that there is no question that unalienated Crown land in the Northern Territory is Crown land held in right of the Northern Territory; in other words, that it is no longer Commonwealth Crown land. The exception to that is in respect of land in the Alligator Rivers region which is still Crown land held in right of the Commonwealth. However, provisions of the Aboriginal land rights Acts, particularly section 3 sub-section 6, apply to Crown land which is held in the right of the Northern Territory, so claims can be made by Aboriginal traditional owners in respect of unalienated Crown land held in the right of the Northern Territory. The Commonwealth Government supports the view whch has been put forward by the Northern Territory Government that the latter Government has a responsibility to ensure that matters of public interest are represented before the Aboriginal land commissioner. </para>

          <para>With respect to the claim books which were referred to in <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Kilgariff&#39;s</inline> question as not having been lodged, in effect these are statements of evidence which are produced by land councils in support of claims which are made. These books are not required to be lodged at the time of application but, in fact, the Aboriginal land commissioner issued practice directions last year which make it clear that where practicable they should be lodged before the hearing of an application so that they are available to those who are appearing at the application. The hearing dates of the various claims which have been lodged have yet to be determined as the land councils are continuing to compile the necessary evidence in relation to these claims. That is a matter which, on my information, is being actively pursued by the land councils. </para>

            <para>- I direct a question to the Minister representing the Minister for Defence. It relates to the armament said to be proposed for the Royal Australian Navy&#39;s 15 new patrol boats now under construction. According to a Press report in the Sydney <inline font-style="italic">Daily Mirror</inline> of last week- on 1 5 February, to be precise- each boat will carry a range of small arms, machine guns and one small cannon. Since the vessels will be much larger and faster than the Attack class boats they will replace- they might well be, at a cost of $7m each-I ask the Minister whether that report was a correct account of the total armament to be provided in these ships? If so, in view of the fact that in the past there have been successful missile attacks by fast patrol craft against more heavily armed naval craft, why are our patrol boats not being equipped with some form of ship-to-ship missile? Will the Government, as a matter of policy, urgently consider adaptation of these ships to missile capability so that they can play a role which is more commensurate with their cost in Australia &#39;s future defence? </para>

            <para>-I am advised that no missile capacity is intended for the particular patrol boats mentioned. My understanding is that they were designed to augment and later to replace the &#39;Attack&#39; class patrol boats as a general purpose low contingency surveillance vessel with good sea-keeping and endurance capabilities. I am advised that the fitting of missiles entails complex fire control systems, radars and a number of additional features such as the desirability for higher speed, all of which would change the concept of the vessels&#39; intended operations. </para>

Has the Minister seen consistent criticisms by the Foreign Minister of Singapore about the way in which the Australian Government and Qantas Airways Ltd have behaved in this matter? Is it true, as is claimed in the cover story of the respected magazine <inline font-style="italic">Asia Week of</inline> 16 February this year, that Singapore could lose some 250,000 tourists and $US43m annually due to these new arrangements? Does the Australian Government view with any concern the fact that its attitude in this matter is severely prejudicing our good relations with our South East Asian neighbours at a time of great crisis in the region and all for what may well turn out to be quite illusory gains for the vast majority of potential Australian travellers? </para>

          <para>The economic Ministers of ASEAN countries are understood to be planning a meeting in Kuala Lumpur on 22 February to consider further their joint position. It is the Government&#39;s hope that their talks will clear the way for negotiations with Australia to proceed. It is true that the Foreign Minister of Singapore has voiced criticisms of the aviation policy but it is the Government&#39;s view that any disagreements or misunderstandings over the effects of our aviation policy would be best resolved at the negotiating table. </para>
          <para>The estimate that Singapore could lose a quarter of a million tourists a year as a result of the policy is understood by the Government to rest on assumptions that in its view are not valid. Proposals put to Singapore and the other ASEAN countries include provision for retention of the facilities for Australian travellers to make stop-overs in ASEAN capitals or in ASEAN countries. In addition, reductions in fares for travel to ASEAN countries themselves on a point to point basis should result in substantial growth of Australian tourism to the ASEAN region. The Government has been at pains to explain its new international aviation policy to the ASEAN countries and it is hopeful that with some goodwill on both sides the matters concerning those countries will be resolved speedily. </para>

My understanding is that changes in ministerial portfolios over the years have resulted in the consolidation of functions and new alignments with Commonwealth governments. Previous planning in a number of areas associated with transport is now out of date and is being reviewed in the light of current concepts and organisational changes. There is a body called the Defence Movements Coordination Committee- the DMCC- which has initiated discussions in committee with representatives of the various departments and, of course, it has in mind relationships between the States and the Commonwealth in terms of coordination. Past concepts and other historical data are being studied for background. Meetings are now being held on a regular basis to discuss developments and possible action. Defence representation on some existing national transport planning committees is being actively sought. </para>

The facts in terms of the company concerned are being unwoven at this moment. I would deprecate the tendency simply to attempt to use this chamber in that regard. Let us have the facts on Associated Securities Ltd. After all, private industries have failed in times of all governments. That is in the very nature of things. It is sad that that should be so and that some should suffer. Therefore, in times of all governments the people in charge of those industries have had to suffer the difficulties that arise.

            <para>- I address a question to the Minister representing the Minister for the Capital Territory. Can the Minister indicate what progress has been made with proposals for a major tourist industry development in the area known as the Jolimont site in Canberra? In particular, can the Minister say whether this matter will be affected in any way by advice from the Minister for Post and Telecommunications that significant funds are not likely to be committed to the new post office in the same area of Civic before 1980-81? Can the Minister say when a start might be made on the proposed tourist complex? </para>

            <para>-The vacant site at the Northbourne Avenue-Alinga Street intersection has been allocated for the development of a new post office and a tourist centre. The proposed tourist centre will incorporate terminals for tourist and airline buses and other tourist oriented facilities. My understanding is that discussions have taken place with potential users to determine the design requirements for the tourist centre, that the National Capital Development Commission has developed conditions and that at this stage they are almost finalised. Expressions of interest in the development of the centre are expected to be invited by the Department of the Capital Territory very shortly. It is understood that Australia Post is ready to proceed with the design of a new post office on the site but the actual timing of the construction and the availability of funds are matters for the Minister for Post and Telecommunications. The post office can be build separately or as an integral part of the tourist facility. These options apparently are presently being discussed. </para>

In particular, I have no recollection of having seen the reply to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Kerin</inline> that the senator has raised with me. I would have to check that. There is, of course, a ministerial directive which covers the general program of the Department. It is a public document and is contained in the annual report.

        </motion>
        <para class="block">It is fair to say that there is a definite feeling among the Australian people today that the machinery of government may have become too large and unmanageable. This phenomenon can be summarised in the oft used term &#39;big government&#39;. In fact this concern about &#39;big government&#39; is widespread throughout the Western democracies. In particular the proliferation of statutory authorities in these countries and Australia has raised the question of governmental activity becoming excessive in the economy and in the lives of ordinary citizens. For some years Australian parliamentarians have viewed this proliferation of authorities with growing interest and some concern. Many questions arose as to the number, identity, role and significance of these instruments of government. Consequently, in October 1977, the Senate referred the matter to the Standing Committee on Finance and Government Operations for investigation and report. </para>
        <para>The Committee found that as Commonwealth statutory authorities have proliferated, they have acquired an extraordinarily diverse set of characteristics. They are often outside the standard departmental structure with its safeguards of ministerial responsibility and accountability. Little or no attempt has been made to achieve uniformity in the justification for their initial creation, in the degree of operating independence granted to them or in the strictness and form of their accountability requirements. This situation has created considerable problems, both for the Executive Government in effectively managing Australia&#39;s economy and administration, and for the Parliament in ensuring that the authorities&#39; ultimate accountability to the people is maintained. An important example of the difficulties which have arisen concerns authorities&#39; financial activities. Some are financed wholly from the Budget and are required to pay all other income into Consolidated Revenue. Others are able to both raise and keep moneys free from the supervision of ministers and the Parliament. Many others fall between these two extremes. As a consequence, the total impact which authorities have on the economy is hard to measure. Moreover, the ability of the Government to effectively manage the economy is reduced by not having complete control over finances which are obtained and employed by organisations essentially owned by the taxpayer. The Parliament, according to constitutional theory, is solely responsible for appropriating public moneys prior to expenditure. Nevertheless, some authorities are able to generate and apply finances independently, free from complete parliamentary oversight. Another anomaly is that the Public Service Board has only incomplete control over authorities&#39; staffing. For example, the Board&#39;s power to impose staff ceilings on some authorities is uncertain. Moreover, some authorities are able to buy and sell property outside of the control of the Department of Administrative Services. </para>
        <para>As we see it, therefore, the major problem which we face in an inquiry is to strike a proper balance between, on the one hand, the appropriate operating independence of authorities and, on the other hand, their satisfactory responsibility and accountability to the Parliament and the people. When the extensive scope of the subject became apparent to the Committee, we decided to approach the subject in a selective way, and to publish a series of reports on a continuing basis, extending if necessary over several years, with each report commenting on different aspects of the inquiry. </para>
        <para>The first report, which has been presented today, examines authorities primarily from the viewpoint of the Parliament and concentrates on measures to improve their accountability. We regard this report as introductory in establishing and outlining some of the background facts in relation to these authorities. As the first step, the Committee set out to identify those Commonwealth statutory authorities which are actually in existence. Surprisingly, no comprehensive list was available, and the Committee compiled its own by examining each piece of Commonwealth legislation and taking various other and, I might add, somewhat tedious steps. The list, comprising 241 authorities plus a large number of subsidiary authorities, is included in the report. We consider that the absence of a list is indicative of the haphazard ways in which authorities have been created, and of the attitude towards their proliferation. The Committee intends to update its own list annually so as to keep the Parliament and the people fully informed. </para>
        <para>An examination of existing authorities showed that similar governmental functions are being performed by different types of organisations, for example, by statutory authorities and by government-owned companies. This results in variations in the degrees of operating independence and accountability standards. This Committee suggests that these anomalies could be overcome in the future by adopting the standard practice of creating an authority by separate statute if it varies from the departmental structure in a significant way. The lack of attention which has been paid to statutory authorities is further evidenced by the dearth of official statistics on them. The Committee commissioned a consultant to undertake a preliminary study into the impact of authorities on the Australian economy. The results of this study, which are included in the report, indicated that their impact is both significant and underestimated. The Committee is therefore carrying out a survey of authorities to ascertain the full extent of their financial activity and economic influence. We consider this aspect of their behaviour to be most important, because authorities directly or indirectly owned by the taxpayer constitute a significant economic force and yet are often outside the accountability safeguards of a department and remote from the Government&#39;s economic management guidelines. The full results of the survey will be published in 1979. </para>
        <para>The Committee considers that the direct link which exists between the Parliament and the statutory authorities it creates requires that the </para>
        <para class="block">Parliament should institute satisfactory procedures to ensure that authorities are properly accountable for their actions. If these procedures do not operate, then the authorities may well, in effect, be accountable to no one- neither to the Minister nor to the Parliament. We consider that the taxpayer is the universal guarantor of authorities and that authorities should therefore be accountable to the taxpayer, through the Parliament, in at least the same way as a company is accountable to its shareholders. A primary method of ensuring this accountability is the presentation to Parliament of a comprehensive annual report. There are many anomalies in the reporting standards of authorities. For example, of the 194 authorities created by the Commonwealth in its capacity as the national government, 67 have the standard reporting requirement, 29 have no reporting requirement and the remaining 98 have a wide variety of other requirements. Auditing arrangements also vary considerably. The Committee considers that, to remove these anomalies, an annual reports Act should be enacted to introduce a standard reporting requirement for authorities whereby they would report annually to the Parliament through a Minister. We also suggest that the Act provide for interim reports to be tabled when final reports are delayed. The Act could also specify the basic contents of reports, in relation to both financial and general information, and should render the accounts of all authorities subject to audit by the Auditor-General. Annual reports should continue to be examined by the relevant Senate legislative and general purpose standing committees. If implemented, these proposals will continue the movement towards increased parliamentary oversight of authorities. A prime example of this movement is the new arrangement regarding the failure to meet reporting requirements announced last year by you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr President,</inline> as a result of a report of the Joint Committee on Publications. </para>
        <para>Because statutory authorities are often created to fill a need at a particular time it is possible that some have continued to operate after the reason for their creation has ceased to exist, or at least their need to continue as a separate entity. One method of overcoming this problem is &#39;sunset&#39; legislation, now widely used in the United States of America, whereby the enabling Act for an authority imposes a time limit at the end of which the authority automatically disbands unless specifically authorised to continue by new legislation. In this way, authorities have to justify their continuation rather than having an automatic right to an indefinite existence. The Committee believes that the &#39;sunset&#39; principle should be considered for inclusion in the enabling legislation for future authorities, and we intend to consider its possible application to authorities already in existence. </para>
        <para>In future reports, as well as discussing the economic impact of authorities the Committee will attempt to answer the following important questions: Firstly, when should a statutory authority be established to perform a particular governmental function? The system of conducting government through departments which operate under Ministers who are responsible and accountable to the people through the Parliament has served Australia well. It should not be departed from without good reason and the Committee will attempt to specify what those reasons should be. Secondly, what degree of operating independence should be granted to authorities once established, especially in relation to their financial activities, their staffing arrangements and their dealings in property and other assets? </para>
        <para>The answers to these questions can be established only in close consultation with those Public Service departments which have responsibility for these matters. The Committee will naturally be seeking these departments&#39; views, as well as those of others concerned with the inquiry, including, of course, the authorities themselves. The Committee will also proceed with inquiries into the operation of specific authorities. The depth of these inquiries will vary but in some instances will involve considerable examination. </para>
        <para>At the time we published the list we believed that it was as complete as we could make it but we did not guarantee its accuracy. In fact, it has now been drawn to my attention that we did omit at least one name. I wish it to be noted that to that list should be added the Receiver of Scalps for the Australian Capital Territory. I feel confident that this office is not intended to provide some form of sinecure for retired political operators and in fact I have been assured that it has been in existence since prior to August last year. I seek leave to continue my remarks later. </para>

          </motion>
          <para class="block">I regret that I must speak now about the two reports of which I am asking the Senate to take note rather than adjourn the debate to another day. It is very important to see what is being done to the Aboriginal community and to see the deprivation which this Government and the Department of Aboriginal Affairs is causing that community. There has never been a stronger condemnation of the activities of the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs or his Department than one would find in reading the annual report of the Aboriginal Land Fund Commission. This Commission is not anti-government, anti-Liberal or anti-Country Party. The members are: <inline font-weight="bold">Dr C.</inline> D. </para>
          <para class="block">Rowley, Director of the Academy of Social Sciences in Australia; <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Ernest</inline> Bridge, Shire  President,  Halls Creek, Western Australia; <inline font-weight="bold">Mr S.</inline> Martin Jambaiimba, Community Adviser, Willowra Station, Northern Territory; <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Thomas</inline> Williams, O.B.E., Director of Field Operations, New South Wales Aboriginal Lands Trust, and a member of the Aboriginal Relics Advisory Committee; and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Neville</inline> Amy, Senior Rural Officer, Commonwealth Development Bank of Australia. It is a quite dignified and respected commission. The Commission points out on page 4 of the report: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>The Commission sees its purpose as to supplement other measures to provide landed property for groups which have been dispossessed, which have not had access to a share of the Australian national estate by inheritance, and which have little if any chance to acquire property by participation in the western economy. The whole implication of a land rights policy is compensatory. The purpose is in the wider sense political, to do away with the situation of a helpless and dependant minority. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">So the Commission set about trying to do its duty, as it sees its role, to compensate the Aboriginals for their dispossession and lack of inheritance of land. It was appointed when the then Federal Government made a promise to provide $4m for ten years- a total of about $50m- for the purchase of land other than land that is acquired under the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act. The Commission has complained that there has been nothing but a reduction in capital, frustration and a lack of attention by the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs and the Department of Aboriginal Affairs to permit the Commission to carry out its policies. When we get a report like the one that has been presented today, is it any wonder that the Minister has decided to abolish the Land Fund and merge it with the Aboriginal Loans Commission, whose report was also presented today. This move will ensure that those who would dare to make such a condemning report of the Government will not remain in a position in which they can continue the work of the protection of Aboriginals and the condemnation of those who are not out to assist Aboriginals. The introduction to the report reads: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>For reasons outside the Commission&#39;s control several proposals could not be concluded during the year. </para>
            <para>For instance agreement had been reached to purchase a large station in Queensland, Glenore, for an Aboriginal group located on the reserve at Normanton. Transfer of the lease was refused by the Queensland Minister for Lands. Forestry, National Parks and Wildlife Service. Subsequently when the property was offered at public auction the Commission, through its legal representative, proved to be the only bidder and a contract was arranged for purchase. Once again the transfer of the lease was refused without any reason being given. Queensland Ministers in their public attacks on the &#39;immorality&#39; of purchasing at auction through  an intermediary showed a lack of knowledge of common commercial practice; and more significantly, a sensitivity about any move which might tend to undermine the Queensland Government&#39;s control of its Aboriginal communities. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">There was direct intervention by the Queensland Government in the work of this Commission, which was set up by the Federal Parliament to purchase land. The Commission engaged in a normal transaction by bidding at auction and arranging for a transfer of the lease but it was not allowed to acquire the land. According to the report of the Senate Standing Committee on Constitutional and Legal Affairs the Federal Government has the power to acquire the land, but it has done nothing about it, even though the Commission was prepared to make the highest bid for the property.

            <para>On 10 February 1978 the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs issued the Instruction attached - </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">I will deal later with the instruction. The introduction continues: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>Conformity with this instruction made the process of purchase very difficult and time consuming. The effect was to give to officials handling Commission business in the Department of Aboriginal Affairs a means of delay in any case of a purchase which they considered to be controversial. The Commission&#39;s view was that the instruction disregards the proper standing and duties of the Commission as a statutory authority. The Commission also questioned the legality of the instruction on the ground (which it put to the AttorneyGeneral) that the Minister&#39;s memorandum amounted to a series of particular instructions on procedures rather than a general instruction&#39; within the terms of the Act. The Attorney General&#39;s opinion had not been received at the end of the report year. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">I believe that the period involved was about 6 months. The important question is whether the Minister was acting illegally in delaying or impeding the activities of the Commission. In the Commission&#39;s mind he was acting outside his powers. The Commission applied to the Government&#39;s interpreting authority- the AttorneyGeneral for advice on whether the Minister was acting within the area of his responsibility but it could not get a reply. This is why when land becomes available daily the opportunity to purchase is lost. Is it any wonder that the Commission regrets its inability to operate under the terms of its establishment. The introduction to the report continues: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>As indicated in previous reports, the Attorney-General had already defined &#39;land&#39; as exclusive of stock and movable property. This has made it necessary for the Commission, from its inception, to seek matching funds from the Department of Aboriginal Affairs where a &#39;walk-in walk-out&#39; purchase (which is the standard transaction in the pastoral industry in some States) is involved. Through this dependence on departmental funding, the Commission has always been to some extent subject to departmental decisions and delays in reaching them. </para>
          </quote>
          <para>Some properties cannot be bought because the Department is not prepared to finance the purchase of buildings and livestock on the property. The introduction continues: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>One extraordinary circumstance became clear with the sale to a mining company with substantial overseas capital of Bing Bong Station, an area of first rate importance to some Aboriginal people in the Borroloola area which the Commission had resolved to attempt to purchase. The Foreign Investments Review Board passed on the information of the intended purchase to the Department of Aboriginal Affairs, but that information did not reach the Commission. The explanation later given was that this was because of the need for &#39;commercial confidentiality&#39;. As the Aboriginal Land Fund Commission is the only Commonwealth purchasing body which could conceivably have been interested, the explanation appeared somewhat inadequate. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">I believe that there was even a claim that the land was traditional Aboriginal land but as the land sought by the Aboriginals was not alienated land a land council could not deal with it. The Commission was prepared to buy that land. It was sought by the Aboriginal community but the information that it was available for sale was not passed on to the Commission by the Department until after it was sold to a mining company. That illustrates the lack of co-operation and liaison between these organisations which have the responsibility of looking after and improving the lot of the Aboriginal people. The introduction to the report continues: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>During the year the Commission&#39;s operations were hindered by opposition to purchase for Aboriginal groups expressed by the Minister for Lands in Western Australia. Such opposition may have the effect of slowing down or even diverting requests for purchase by the Commission. Western Australian Government concern was stated to be with alleged inefficiency of Aboriginal management of pastoral properties. Yet in many Western Australian pastoral areas landowners have been allowed to neglect management or to rely on caretakers only. The Commission remains confident that in spite of the fact that most pastoral properties after purchase become residential locations for Aboriginal families not involved directly in the pastoral enterprise, Aboriginal management requires only guidance and assistance, management training and some help in book-keeping. After all, these workers have carried the northern pastoral industry for generations. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">We can see from this report that there is opposition from the Queensland Government, the Department of Aboriginal Affairs and the Western Australian Government to the ownership of land by Aboriginal people. The report continues: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>Opposition to land purchase reflects a common prejudice and comes also from those who continue to profit economically, or in other ways, from the depressed condition of Aboriginals. Only through purchase can the majority of Aboriginal communities in remote areas be vested in a minimum of community property. Where such a minimum is lacking, efforts at &#39;development&#39; and improved health will probably come to little. </para>
            <para>Yet, at the table on page 13 shows, the Commission&#39;s budget allocations have never been more than a minor part of the annual expenditure on Aboriginal affairs. It is much easier administratively to pay officials to &#39;look after&#39; the poor and people of low status than to give to such groups those basic resources which they need for safe living, health and economic development. </para>
          </quote>
          <para>So we take the easy way out of the problem. I want to say a few words about the ministerial directions. Ministerial directions were given at the time I was Minister for Aboriginal Affairs. They were directions to enable the Commission to operate normally, as an independent commission. Let us look at the directions since we have had the Fraser Government in office. The Commission states in its report: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>In addition to these original directives, the present Minister for Aboriginal Affairs issued further directions to the Commission; in a letter of 1 2 March 1976 directions under section 5 (2) required the Commission to refer to the Minister before entering into any new commitment to buy properties in the period from March to the end of the financial year rather than direct the Commission not to spend $ 1 million of the money in the Fund. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">Therefore, the Commission had been allocated $1 million which the Minister could have directed it not to spend but it was decided instead that before any purchase was made the Commission was to seek the Minister&#39;s permission for such a purchase and the Minister could ensure that no purchase was made. The report continues: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>At the same time, in relation to purchases in the Northern Territory, the Minister directed that: The purchases already made are likely to entail administrative and financial responsibilities for my Department for some time, and I think that it is desirable, in the light of the recommendations of the Aboriginal Land Rights Commission, that for the future purchases in the Northern Territory should be made as a general rule only on the basis of an examination of needs and claims by the Interim Land Commissioner, or the Land Commissioner if and when appointed. I would feel that where the Commission desires to take advantage of opportunities for the purchase of land in the Northern Territory which has not been recommended by the Interim Land Commissioner or Land Commissioner, your Commmission should, for the time being at least, seek my concurrence in the purchase. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">That constitutes the complete destruction of the independent role of the Commission. It has become purely a ministerial body. The report stated further: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>On 16 July 1976 the Minister issued the following directions: </para>
            <para>As you know the new financial year is to be one of consolidation and review for Aboriginal Affairs in accordance with government policy. In such an environment I am sure you will agree that the tight funding position for government departments and instrumentalities generally makes it essential that maximum benefit be achieved from every project funded and this must, of course, have inevitable implications for your own Commission. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">The Minister concluded his direction by stating: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>It therefore appears most desirable that whatever decision your Commission finally takes should be in the light of the Department&#39;s capacity, if any, to offer complementary funding support. Naturally, should you feel at any time that the </para>
            <para>Department&#39;s inability to provide essential supplementary funds warrants further consideration, I would appreciate the opportunity to discuss the proposal with you . . . </para>
          </quote>
          <para>I refer honourable senators also to the direction about which the Commission complained in the introduction to its report. The report states: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>On 10 February 1978 the Minister issued further directions to the Commission under section 5 (2) of the Act. As required by the Act, the pertinent part of this new Ministerial directive is here recorded: </para>
            <para>I have decided to direct, pursuant to the powers vested in me by section 5(2) of the Aboriginal Land Fund Commission Act, that: </para>

            </list>
          </quote>
          <para>Therefore, the Commission had to negotiate with the Minister before it approached a vendor. The complaint of the Commission is that this held up negotiations until the property concerned was sold. Effectively the Minister has clamped down on the Commission to such an extent that it is unable to function properly. The Ministerial directive continues: and, in conjunction with this advice, </para>

          <para>The statement should also contain information about the Aboriginal corporation involved, in sufficient detail to enable the Minister to satisfy himself as to whether the members are members of a community of Aboriginals: </para>

          </list>
          <para class="block">That leaves the Aboriginal Land Fund Commission able to buy only properties that are not readily snapped up, properties that no one wants. I wish to say just a few words on funding. On this matter the report states: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>In April 1977 it was understood that one million dollars would be available for the 1977-78 financial year. However because the Commission had to carry over $756,194 from 1976-77 (against which there were legal commitments of $644,478) the Government appropriated $750,000 for the year. </para>
            <para>In the first part of the financial year the Commission reached agreement and /or settlement on eight properties with a value of some $688,000, but it then experienced considerable difficulties in the latter half of the year in reaching purchase stage. Although proposals with a value in excess of $ 1 m were under active consideration/negotiation, no further purchases were made because of administrative difficulties which arose from the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs&#39; directive of 10 February 1978; </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">Do honourable senators note the cry? The Commission had the money, they were negotiating for the property, but negotiations fell down because of the Minister&#39;s directive. The report continued:  a change in regional responsibility affecting two proposals in NSW; and inability, for various reasons, to reach agreement with vendors. All these factors contributed to the Commission having to carry over $507,699 this year (against which there is only some $61,000 in legal commitments). </para>
          <para>This carry-over of funds will likely result in the Commission being appropriated less than the budget bid which is understood to be $ 1 . 5m. As commented on in past reports, the uncertainty of the funding allocations to the Aboriginal Land Fund, since its inception, has made it difficult for the Commission to develop and pursue a purchasing program. Uncertainty is further exacerbated by the very nature of purchasing land on the open market. </para>
          <para class="block">There we see the very destruction of the Commission&#39;s independence. The Commission has had the courage to come out and criticise the Government, the Department of Aboriginal Affairs and the responsible State Ministers who will not let it operate. Because of this criticism, we are told that the Commission is going to be wound up. The other report we are considering is that of the Aboriginal Loans Commission, from which I wish to to quote three short extracts to show the impossible situation created by the lack of interest in Aboriginal affairs by the Government. In the introduction to the Aboriginal Loans Commission&#39;s report it states: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>The Commission also continued to assist Aboriginals to establish themselves in viable business enterprises. Assistance in this area has been limited to some extent by a lack of opportunities for new projects at a time of economic consolidation and increasingly by the Commission&#39;s limited ability to adequately investigate and monitor enterprise projects because of field staffing difficulties. Nevertheless, demand for enterprise finance has continued to be evident. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">Under the side heading &#39;Renovations and Extensions&#39;, which deals mostly with the housing area, we see that the Commission reports: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>The Commission is not at present empowered to make loans for the purpose of renovating or extending homes. It is felt that legislative amendments to permit loans of this nature would enable the Commission to extend the range of its benefits to Aboriginals considerably without a marked increase in the Commission&#39;s funds requirements. The Commission has made representations to the Department of Aboriginal Affairs seeking appropriate amendments to the legislation, and it is understood that the Department currently has the matter under investigation. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">I pertinently ask the Minister: What is the Department doing about it? Does it intend to bring down the amendments? If so, when can we get them and when can the Commission function as it thinks it can and should function? The Commission reports on its lack of ability with regard to new initiatives as follows: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>However, as loans for renovations and extensions are beyond the scope of the Commission&#39;s enabling legislation, amendments to the Act were sought in 1976 . . . </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">So they were not sought yesterday. Amendments to the Act were sought in 1 976 to enable the new initiative to be introduced. The report continues: </para>

            <para>It is understood that the Department of Aboriginal Affairs is currently taking steps to introduce the required amendment. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">The amendments were sought three years ago and now the Department is getting to the stage where it is currently taking steps. We do not know how long it will be before the steps reach fruition and come here in the form of legislation. 1 urge the Minister to hurry the steps because we get more alarming reports like this: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>As at 30 June 1978, 2,042 names were on the housing loan waiting list. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">We can see the demand of people to get a loan to acquire their own houses- 2,040-odd people. All the time the results of the reduction in Aboriginal welfare ends up in the Department of Health which pointed out in its last report that infant mortality in the Northern Territory had decreased in Labor&#39;s years and is increasing continually year by year under this Government. The Department of Health&#39;s report says that it jumped 44 per cent in 1977-78. These are human lives that we are dealing with and here the Aboriginal Land Fund Commission says that the Department finds it more convenient to appoint administrative officers to run around and try to remedy the position of Aboriginal people in Australia. This is the sort of thing that government-appointed reports bring out and show clearly. I can say definitely that if ever there was a failure to assist Aboriginals it was shown by the previous Minister. He cut down and cut down and disregarded the health, welfare and lives of babies in the north and got away with it. He was so successful that he was given responsibility for unemployment and the introduction of a voluntary labour scheme. I hope that there has been a change of front and of attitude by the present Minister for Aboriginal Affairs and that he will study these reports and do something about them. </para>

        <para class="block">Throughout the last decade Australia has pursued a more vigorous and independent foreign policy than during the prior years. This development has come about through a combination of our efforts as an outward looking nation and the impact of international events on Australia. International affairs do not remain constant and changes occur rapidly, often with great significance to Australia, as current events in Iran and South East Asia demonstrate. </para>
        <para>Australia is no longer isolated or immune from international issues and just as our domestic and foreign policies are becoming more interdependent there is a growing interdependence between nations. No other country can serve Australia&#39;s interests overseas as well as we can ourselves, and to do so we must have resident Australian representation in the countries with which Australia has dealings. </para>
        <para>The Department of Foreign Affairs is responsible for providing the majority of Australia&#39;s representatives overseas. When the Committee was given this reference it was aware that the Department had been the subject or part of numerous inquiries during the past five years. However the Committee felt that it was important to examine how the Department is functioning and its ability to continue to do so under the staff ceilings and financial restraints that now exist. </para>
        <para>Briefly, I propose to example some of the Committee&#39;s findings which are of concern and which the Committee feels require attention: Staff ceilings were imposed on the Department and required the Department to redeploy staff resources. It has continued to carry out its functions but as responsibilities increase and staff resources are not available the Department will be forced to let some functional areas run down to meet urgent demands. Evidence of this occurring exists already. I draw the Senate&#39;s attention to the summary of conclusions and recommendations on page 3 where the Committee states: </para>
        <quote>
          <para>The Committee is dissatisfied with the arbitrary manner in which staff ceilings have been imposed on the Department. There appears to have been little consultation or examination of what repercussions these rulings have on staff and the organisation&#39;s ability to continue operating effectively. Staff reductions, financial restraints and a slowdown in promotion prospects have affected morale among officers of the Public Service generally and the Department of Foreign Affairs has not remained immune from the slump in morale. </para>
          <para>Other adverse features have developed in the Department (retrenchments in overseas locally engaged staff ranks) and as a consequence Australia&#39;s image, particularly as an employer overseas, has suffered. Functional areas suffer from staff shortages, the implementation of Australia&#39;s development assistance program is impaired, training, particularly in languages, is restricted and the dissemination of Australian publicity and information material is affected. The maintenance of existing residential and office properties overseas and the acquisition of additional properties has been neglected, the introduction of security precautions is too slow and there are aspects of conditions of service in need of review. These are examples of deficiencies which are beyond the control of the Department of Foreign Affairs alone to remedy. They require recognition and corrective action by the Government in co-operation with the appropriate regulatory authorities, and the Committee strongly emphasises that the Government should acknowledge this obligation. </para>
        </quote>
        <para>The Committee draws particular attention to the following: </para>
        <quote>
          <para>The resources of the Policy Planning Section in the Department have been depleted to cover commitments in newer areas such as the Nuclear Division. This relocation of staff has serious implications for the Department&#39;s capacity to define and plan future foreign policy initiatives and priorities and consequently for its policy planning advice to the Government. Demands on the Department&#39;s services are growing in complexity and scope and if the forward planning capacity of the organisation cannot function fully, its capability to respond is impaired. New organisations such as the Office of National Assessments require particular reporting from posts and its requirements for a specialised service will grow as it becomes fully operational, adding additional strains on the Department&#39;s resources. </para>
        </quote>
        <para>Recruitment to the Foreign Affairs Office category, ceased for some two years. It has now resumed but the gap could have repercussions in future years. Recruitment should be undertaken annually, as continuity and stability in a career service is vital to the Department. The incorporation of the Australian Development Assistance Bureau into the Department has created some problems, and there are issues between the Department and the Bureau which must be resolved to ensure that the effective implementation of the development assistance program is not impaired. </para>
        <para>The consular and administrative career structure in the Department requires review. This is an increasingly important aspect of the Departments work, and careers in this field should be such as to retain experienced staff and to attract talented people. The Committee notes that the predicted growth in the number of Australians travelling abroad will produce greater demands for Australian consular services and, as a consequence, the Committee recommends that the Department should give a high priority to developing consular training courses and training consular officers to improve the capability to meet forecast demands. I refer to locally engaged staff overseas. They were used through wastage and retrenchment to meet departmental staff ceilings. The Committee reports that this action caused hardship and damage to Australia&#39;s image as an employer overseas. Attention must be given to correcting this unfortunate situation. </para>
        <para>Commonwealth owned property overseas has been neglected for the sake of short term economies. Construction has declined, acquisitions stopped for two years, and maintenance of existing properties has been limited through a shortage of funds. Urgent attention must be given to these matters to avoid an accumulation of expense in the near future and a declining standard of living for representatives overseas. Again I draw attention to the Committee&#39;s comments on page 65 of its report, where it states:  lt is apparent that in the past three years there are aspects of Australian overseas property management which have been neglected. The Committee is not critical of the work of the Overseas Operations Branch. It operates under severe financial limitations and as an organisation has undergone five transfers between departments as well as three physical relocations. The Committee believes that Governments have not acted responsibly by adopting a shortsighted attitude to the funding of overseas property maintenance and the acquisition of new properties. </para>
        <para>The result has been spiralling leasing costs . . . delays in future works programs, higher market prices for the reintroduced but modest acquisition plans, deteriorating property, added expenses for essential maintenance and a decline in living standards for officers and dependants occupying the affected properties. </para>
        <para class="block">The security of Australian offices and residences is not receiving the priority and resources it deserves. Security cannot be absolute but sufficient resources must be made available to protect staff and their dependants as effectively as possible. Conditions of service must be kept under constant review to ensure that staff serving overseas are not disadvantaged. The response to rapidly changing conditions overseas has to be quicker and the regulatory authorities concerned will need to give priority to adapting to these changes. </para>
        <para>It became evident during the inquiry that Australia has an effective overseas service which also has the respect of diplomatic representatives from other countries. Its professional skills and integrity have been noted. The service can be improved, and the Committees received evidence that steps are being taken to improve it. Australia&#39;s growing international involvement will place greater demands on the Department of Foreign Affairs, and the Committee considers it important that the Government acknowledges this and ensures that the Department has the resources necessary to perform its functions efficiently and effectively. I seek leave to continue my remarks at a later stage. </para>

          <para>-by leave-I should like to take a few moments to touch on one or two items on which the  Chairman  of the Senate Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sim,</inline> has not touched. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para class="block">Firstly, I congratulate <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sim</inline> on his chairmanship of the Committee throughout its consideration of the matter of Australian representation overseas and also congratulate the staff of the Committee on the excellent job they have done, although it always seemed to me that they required too many meetings when the Senate was in recess and imposed a work load on honourable senators that they wished they did not have. Be that as it may. </para>
        <para>I turn to the Committee&#39;s report. I believe it is obvious that the morale in the Department of Foreign Affairs has slumped rather dramatically over the last three years. If anything came through to me during the Committee&#39;s hearings, it was the effect that the present Government has had on the Department of Foreign Affairs. As has been mentioned, the imposition of arbitrary staff ceilings had a great deal to do with the drop in morale. In my estimation, from evidence given it would appear that the Department will take a long time to overcome the position that has prevailed over the three years with staff ceilings and drops in recruitment. It seems to me that there will be large gaps in areas of the Department for perhaps even a decade, given that the Government reverses the trend and goes ahead with normal recruitment over the next few years. I can quite envisage and quite believe what I suppose I would describe as the despair that has been suffered by people in the Department because of this lack of younger people coming up through the Service in a continuous stream. I believe that, while this system prevails and while this Government adopts that sort of attitude in relation to a department as important as this one, Australia&#39;s image, particularly abroad, could well be jeopardised. </para>
        <para>The only other comment I wish to make is in relation to the Australian Development Assistance Bureau, or ADAB as it is known. I think the Department could well come in for some criticism as being at times a department which shows a form of elitism. I have said previously- I have struck this situation now and again in foreign posts- that the Department, having recruited a certain class or type of person, then thrusts that recruit on to people of a culture different from our own where there is a requirement for perhaps greater sensitivity than is the norm. I am referring to the recruit who all too often comes from the Geelong Grammar School or one of the other, in my opinion, upstart schools. Some of these people never quite adapt to living in an environment which to them would perhaps appear to be hostile, an environment where people do not cross all their t&#39;s and dot all their i&#39;s. They are loath to mix with working class people. I believe that such people would be better left out of the Department, and particularly overseas postings. </para>
        <para>This problem has arisen, I believe, where there has been a refusal or a disinclination by the Department to give proper status to ADAB personnel, located both in Canberra and abroad. The Committee received quite an amount of evidence on this matter. It is referred to in several paragraphs in the recommendations section of the Committee&#39;s report. One of the matters that is of some concern to me is reported by the Committee thus: </para>
        <quote>
          <para>The Committee is not satisfied with the imposition of the inflexible policy that a foreign affairs position overseas may not be reclassified to an ADAB position unless 100 per cent of the duties are development assistance matters. The Committee recommends that urgent attention be given to changing the rules to allow specialist ADAB officers to fill positions overseas where development assistance duties predominate. Due recognition must be given to the importance of the function and not the application of a rule. </para>
        </quote>
        <para class="block">That is one area in which I believe the Committee is 100 per cent correct, and the inflexibility in the Department thus far should be altered so that ADAB personnel are in a position to oversee what is going on. Furthermore all too often they are not in a position to travel to those areas to oversee the duties required of them. Perhaps this applies particularly in the Pacific area at the present time where millions of dollars of Australian aid is sought to be spent. After having listened to ADAB personnel give evidence to the Committee, I sometimes wonder whether they or anybody else are confident that the money is being spent wisely. </para>
        <para>In paragraph 13 of the Committee&#39;s report it makes a specific recommendation in regard to overseas travel by ADAB personnel. In paragraph 14, in relation to the same matter, the very unnecessary problem is raised that in Canberra we have the unsatisfactory situation where some 310 ADAB staff are located in five separate buildings. To me it seems stupid for that situation to remain. If this country is to spend its foreign aid wisely I believe at least those personnel should all be brought together under the one roof. </para>

            <para>- by leave- The problem of Namibia is ohe of long standing It dates from South Africa&#39;s refusal, at the end of World War II, to enter into a trusteeship agreement over the old mandated territory of South West Africa and its claim to sovereignty over that territory. South Africa has continued to administer Namibia despite the United Nations&#39; decision in 1966, that South Africa&#39;s mandate should be withdrawn. Concerted United Nations&#39; efforts towards achieving self-determination and independence for Namibia began in 1972. These efforts were unsuccessful and, in 1974, the United Nations adopted measures seeking immediate and unconditional South African withdrawal. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>In 1975, South Africa officially recognised the international status of the territory and decided to initiate its own discussions in Namibia towards a constitutional settlement. The five Western members of the Security Council (the United Kingdom, the United States of America, France, West Germany, Canada) in 1977 advised South Africa that its constitutional proposals arising out of these consultations would not gain international approval. Following this advice discussions were initiated between the Five&#39; and South Africa on how to achieve early and peaceful independence for Namibia through an internationally acceptable settlement. Discussions were also held with SWAPO- the South West African People&#39;s Organisation. These talks led, early in 1978, to the formulation of the present plan now agreed to by both the South African Government and SWAPO. The plan envisaged, in essence, free elections for Namibia, under United Nations supervision and control for the purpose of electing a constituent assembly to draw up and adopt a constitution for an independent Namibia. The plan, and proposals by the United Nations Secretary-General for its implementation, were later accepted by the United Nations Security Council as a basis for an internationally acceptable settlement that would give Namibia independence. </para>
          <para>The establishment of UNTAG-the United Nations Transitional Assistance Group- is part of the plan. Elections are scheduled to be held some seven months after UNTAG &#39;s deployment, and independence following about five months later. </para>
          <para>Since 1977, Australia has received a number of informal soundings about a contribution to a peacekeeping force in Namibia. Representations were made to us, at different times, by the UN, the Commonwealth Secretariat, and by representatives of the British and American governments. In July last year, the UN Secretariat made an approach enquiring whether Australia could provide elements for the UNTAG logistics force. In the light of recent indications that the UN would be seeking to establish UNTAG very shortly, the Government has been actively considering a contribution that would be consistent with Australia&#39;s international obligations, its support for an early settlement of the Namibia problem and support for the Western and UN proposals for achieving it. </para>
          <para>Southern Africa is a region of considerable strategic importance to Australia, indeed to the entire free world. In the Government&#39;s view we ought to do what we reasonably can to promote conditions there which will bring about stability and so contribute to security in the widest sense. The Western initiative on Namibia offers the opportunity for this and it is thus vital that it should be successful. There has been in the past great turmoil in Africa. Many African problems have been seen to be intractable. Now we have an opportunity to settle one of those problems peacefully and in a manner which will deal justly with all conflicting interests. We must not let this opportunity slip by. </para>
          <para>It has been no easy task for the United Nations to put together a peacekeeping force for Namibia acceptable to all concerned. Not all of its components have yet been settled. But it has been made entirely clear to us that an Australian contribution would be widely welcomed and, in particular, would be acceptable both to the South African Government and to SWAPO. It has also been put to us that an Australian component would contribute significantly to the effectiveness of the force. </para>
          <para>The Government has considered this question on a number of occasions in the past. It has weighed carefully all the issues which are relevant to it. In coming to the judgment that Australia should offer to make a contribution to United Nations peacekeeping in Namibia we have regarded as paramount the importance of having this Western initiative succeed, the political significance of the area in which the force will operate and the firm belief that a successful outcome in Namibia will bring new hope for stability and progress in what has been a sorely troubled continent. A successful conclusion to the problem of Namibia should give renewed hope that other African problems can be resolved by reasonable means. </para>
          <para>The Government has carefully weighed the international circumstances in which Australia finds itself at this time. It has especially taken into account present conflicts in South East Asia. It has concluded above all that now is a time for Australia fully to assume its international responsibilities. It is not a time for us to stand back and refuse to be involved because the problem to be settled lies in a distant continent and may appear to be of no immediate concern to us. We are fully aware that the conflict in Indochina involves grave risks to the region and to the world as a whole. We have made this clear by our recent actions. Some would argue that at a time of danger and difficulty in Asia we should not participate in this international initiative. The Government argues to the contrary- we are part of the wider world. </para>
          <para>We have a real capacity to contribute to the success of this United Nations initiative. We believe that this is above all a time when our sense of responsibility in international affairs and our commitment to the settlement of disputes by peaceful means needs to be firmly underlined. This is a time not for withdrawal but for participation, for the acceptance of a commitment which is within our capacity. </para>
          <para>If we are not prepared to participate in an initiative sponsored, amongst others, by the United States and Great Britain, adopted by the United Nations and accepted by the conflicting parties, how can we expect others to fulfil their obligations to act responsibly and co-operatively in efforts to settle disputes and restore stability in areas of conflict? The composition of the UN force in Namibia has not yet as I said before, been finally determined. The United Kingdom has already announced its proposed participation in UNTAG and it is expected that contributors will include a number of other western countries; there will also be African, Asian, Latin American and possibly east European contributions. </para>
          <para>The element which we will offer to the United Nations for inclusion in the force is an engineer contingent of 250 officers and men, together with a national headquarters and support element of 50. If accepted, this unit will have the responsibility of providing a variety of engineering services in support of the operational battalions. This role will be vital to the success of the force. It is planned that the United Nations operation in Namibia will be for a period of 12 months. It is intended that the deployment of the Australian contingent will be for that length of time. Our defence forces have been given instructions to pay the fullest regard to the safety of Australian personnel who may be deployed to Namibia. We cannot say they will not face any dangers. There are risks involved in any peacekeeping operation. But all aspects of the situation in which the force will operate have been given the most careful consideration and the risks our men will face are assessed by the National Assessments Board as low. </para>
          <para>Australia has played a part in a number of United Nations peacekeeping operations in the past. It is at present contributing to them in the Middle East in Cyprus, and in Kashmir. We cannot be expected, nor will we be asked, to contribute to all future United Nations operations. But we believe our decision to offer a contribution to the Namibia force is fully consistent with the policy adopted in the past by this and earlier governments. It is a contribution well within our capacity. It is the right decision. It has been taken in a conscious awareness of our international responsibilities at a time when such awareness, by ourselves and by others, is needed more than ever. </para>

            <para>- The Opposition normally supports the decisions of the United Nations. The platform of the Australian Labor Party clearly spells out its firm support for United Nations resolutions. For that reason the Australian Labor Party is sympathetic to any request for assistance that is made by the United Nations. But the question of support for the United Nations is not the matter at issue. No government can give a commitment to provide components of a peacekeeping force without knowing the implications for this country. Few of these details have been provided in this case by the Government. Indeed, it would not be unfair to say that there is an element of uncertainty about the statement which has just been put down. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>The statement makes no reference to the events at the end of 1978. The Government would have us believe that the plan which is the subject of the statement is unchanged from the plan that was agreed to during the middle of 1978. Yet in a remarkable omission the statement makes no reference to the fact that the South African Government rejected the United Nations proposal and went ahead with an election in Namibia in December of last year. It makes no reference to the fact that there is now a newly-elected assembly in Namibia. It makes no reference to the matters put before the Security Council in August and September of last year and the Security Council&#39;s resolution as a result of that information. On top of that- and this is of great concern- the statement makes it perfectly clear that the Australian Government has not as yet received a request to contribute to the United </para>
          <para>Nations Transitional Assistance Group. The reason why that request has not been received is fairly apparent. The size and composition of the United Nations force has not yet been determined. No doubt its role will be affected by the matters raised by the South African Government in its response to the Secretary-General of the United Nations in relation to the terms of Resolution 435. </para>
          <para>The Minister for Foreign Affairs ( <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Peacock</inline> ) made a statement in the Parliament on 23 August of last year. On that occasion he pointed out that the force for Namibia would be set up pursuant to a resolution of the United Nations Security Council which would provide it with a specific mandate spelling out its role and charter of operations. Where is the reference to that resolution in the statement that has just been put down? Where is the reference in the statement to the role and charter of the United Nations peacekeeping force? On these questions we are not told anything. There is no reference to Resolution 435, which was adopted by the Security Council on 29 September. There is no reference to the Secretary-General&#39;s report and his explanatory statement referred to in that resolution. On these important issues the statement is silent. On 23 August of last year the Minister for Foreign Affairs pointed out that there was an investigation which would reveal the nature of the tasks the United Nations peacekeeping force would have to perform, the extent and the type of units likely to be required, the command arrangements which would apply and the difficulties which would be likely to be met in carrying out the mandate. Again, the details of these matters have not been given to us. </para>
          <para>The statement tells us nothing about the role of the force even though the situation in Namibia has changed quite dramatically since the Minister&#39;s statement of August of last year. Once again I remind the Government that elections have since been held in Namibia and that there has been a newly-elected assembly in that country since that resolution was dealt with. We are entitled to ask the Government why it is now ignoring the very serious issues that it raised itself only six months ago. Is the Government saying that the position in Namibia has changed so dramatically that these issues are no longer important, as they apparently were six months ago? </para>
          <para>There is a fundamental difference in the statement last August of the Minister for Foreign Affairs and the statement which has now been put down. The Opposition wants to know why the Government has taken this course, why it has changed its mind in the last six months, and why it has decided that issues which were important six months ago apparently are no longer relevant in reaching a decision. On behalf of the Australian public and those men who apparently will be sent to Namibia, the Opposition calls on the Government to tell the Parliament the precise nature of the request it has received and the conditions which will apply to that force. No government should ever take a decision of this nature lightly. Last August the Minister made it quite clear in his statement- and I quote the exact extract- when he said: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>I see it as most important that the Parliament and the public have the fullest possible comprehension of this matter . . . </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">How can the Minister or the Government claim now that we have the fullest comprehension of this most important matter involving the commitment of Australian troops overseas, even under United Nations auspices, when in fact so many of the details of what has occurred in Namibia since the Minister&#39;s last statement are not referred to in the statement put down today? </para>
          <para>I have indicated the Opposition&#39;s very great concern about this matter. I reiterate that in principle we most certainly support efforts by the United Nations of this nature. However, the Opposition takes the view that commitments ought not to be made unless they are fully spelt out in detail in the Parliament, especially when the Minister for Foreign Affairs gave an undertaking last August that he would in fact do that. </para>

            <para>- I have read this legislation, which the Opposition does not oppose. I intend to make only some very brief remarks about it. In a sense the legislation is quite complex and the complexities are not mat- .ters which I should think would be of the utmost interest to members of the Senate. However, perhaps I should outline the main purpose of the Bill and give some of the background, which may be worthwhile in an effort to keep the Senate&#39;s business going if for no other reason. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>The purpose of the Bill is to apply State and territorial criminal law to offences on Australian ships or on ships on overseas voyages, to Australian ships in foreign pons, to some offences which may be committed on foreign ships in </para>
          <para class="block">Australian territorial waters and to offences in offshore areas beyond territorial waters. For the purposes of that objective the expressions &#39;Australian ships&#39;, &#39;foreign ships&#39; and so on are denned in the legislation. I suppose it is a somewhat complex relationship. </para>
          <para>It is intended that not only should there be legislation of the Australian Government which applies the criminal law in the circumstances to which I have referred but also there should be legislation of the State governments and of the Northern Territory parliament. I myself am not familiar with how far that complementary legislation has been implemented except that I am aware that the state of Victoria has passed legislation of a complementary nature. I am indebted to my Tasmanian colleague, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Tate,</inline> for providing me with a copy of the Victorian legislation. </para>

I will express it now and perhaps forget it for the remainder of the parliamentary session. As I understand the background of the matter, for some time the imperial law of the British Parliament has applied in the circumstances for which this legislation seeks to provide in relation to Australian ships and Australian territorial waters. In 1968, for example, in the case involving circumstances 22 miles off the coast of Western Australia it was found that the imperial law applied in relation to a theft of crayfish pots and as a consequence the relevant court had to apply the imperial law. I assume that that law will still apply in spite of this legislation but that in most circumstances jurisdiction will be exercised under the law of the relevant State Parliament or, where appropriate, the law of the Federal Parliament. </para>

          </continue>
          <para>Having pointed out what seem to me to be the main provisions of the Bill, I really do not wish to add any more to my comments about it. Importantly it has relevance to acts committed in the Australian fishing zone outside the territorial waters of Australia and to that extent is relevant to recent events in relation to the declaration of that zone. I suppose that to that extent it can be described as a piece of contemporary legislation whereas in all other respects it might have been legislation which could have been considered by this Parliament many years ago in relation to the fact that the imperial law applied. The Opposition does not oppose this Bill. It is a matter of some technical complexity but the complexities are designed to achieve the purpose to which I have referred. We commend the Bill to the Senate. </para>

            <para>- I likewise support the Bill. I do not perhaps have <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Button&#39;s</inline> vast knowledge of international law and I did not have the opportunity to read the Victorian Act which I see has arrived hot-foot on our desks while we have been speaking. I was glad to know that there was such unanimity of support from the Attorney-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Durack), Senator Tate</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Button</inline> and at least they were all well advised on this particular subject. It is, of course, a complicated Bill in many respects and I must confess that I do not entirely understand all aspects of it because there is following it other complementary legislation which we have not yet seen. I think it is highly desirable that we in this country should now be applying our own laws and the appropriate State laws which are made applicable by this Bill. Not so very long ago, in 1977, this was stated by the Privy Council in these terms: </para>

            <para>It may at first sight seem surprising that despite the passing of the Statute of Westminster, 1931, and the creation of separate Australian citizenship by the British Nationality Act 1948 . . . Parliament in the United Kingdom when it passes a statute which creates a new criminal offence in English law is also legislating for those Australian passengers who cross the Bass Strait by ship from Melbourne to Launceston. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">I should have thought that that would strike a note which would be immediately apparent to those who do cross those particular rough waters. I feel, therefore, that it is high time that we went ahead with legislation such as this and made it applicable. As has been pointed out in the second reading speech of the Attorney-General, it is an example of co-operative federalism between the Federal and State governments that we are applying the appropriate State laws to crimes which may be committed at sea. This is complicated because of the fact that the Bill goes to some lengths to show a connection between ships and a particular State because there may be many States with some association with a particular ship that is plying in Australian waters. Although the area of registration is the first, there are a number of other ways in which that connection is shown under the terms of the Bill. The Bill also deals with some actions on foreign ships, particularly in relation to ships coming to Australia on journeys and I think therefore that there will be a greater coverage of the law when crimes are in fact committed on such ships. </para>
          <para>I would appreciate some information from the Attorney-General in his reply as to the relationship this may have to some of the complementary and further legislation which is to come in relation to such areas as the Great Barrier Reef. At the moment considerable concern is felt by Australian citizens that in that area crimes may be committed on ships, very often foreign ships, where damage is done to that area and where things are being taken that are part of the national and international heritage of the world in relation to that particular area. I would appreciate some information as to the interrelations between this Bill and the situation in that area where, of course, there is existing legislation which is not at the moment being implemented. There is no marine authority in operation covering the various areas of the Great Barrier Reef. None of those areas has yet been proclaimed. I wonder whether activities could also be applied under this Bill and if so I am somewhat concerned in relation to the area where State laws might be applicable. We have got away. We have taken steps to bring the Federal law into this area. It may well be therefore that the Federal law would prevail but I would appreciate some information as to the relationship it might have to that particular vexed question. I believe that there is a problem in that there will need to be some co-operation between the joint authorities, who, I think, would have a joint operation in this area, particularly in regard to the clauses relating to offshore mining. Likewise I trust that that will not be a matter in which lack of cooperation will lead to the legislation being ineffective. Basically I suggest that this is a useful, if complicated, experiment in the law and that it certainly brings us up to date and into the twentieth century in respect of the operation of our laws concerning crimes that take place at sea. In this respect I welcome the Bill. </para>

            <para>- Four or so years ago it was alleged that Santo and Gaetano Oteri some time between 20 and 24 January 1 974 stole crayfish pots and tackle while on the vessel <inline font-style="italic">Providence</inline> on the high seas about 22 miles off the Western Australian coast. The Privy Council eventually decided that because they were naturalised Australian citizens and British subjects and owners of the vessel, the vessel was a British ship within the meaning of an imperial statute of, I think, 1799 and that the criminal law of England- in this case the Theft Act- applied. In other words, in relation to an offence committed off the Western Australian coast by naturalised Australian citizens on board a fishing vessel normally operating out of Fremantle and licensed to do so under Western Australian law the ordinary jurisdiction of the Western Australian courts was not applicable and Western Australian criminal law could not be applied. The case fell to be determined within ancient admiralty criminal jurisdiction. I believe that that situation is intolerable to any Australian, but particularly to those of us who believe that our national status demands that Australian citizens be subject only to legal rules devised by Australian courts or by Australian parliaments and not by bodies in the United Kingdom, in particular. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>This Bill seeks to deal with that situation which would, I believe, if left unremedied by any action of our Australian parliaments, amount to a very serious derogation from our national sovereignty; and, more than that, I believe it would be an affront to ordinary commonsense. It would be contrary to the expectations of ordinary people, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Missen</inline> pointed out, if I, when returning to Tasmania, to that efficient and beautiful port of Devonport across Bass Strait, were subjected to assault by somebody with a deadly weapon and, rather than bring that culprit to justice under Victorian or Tasmanian law, had to seek to bring him to justice under United Kingdom statutes. The Bill proposes to fulfil ordinary, normal, commonsense expectations that Tasmania or Victorian State law would apply. </para>
          <para>I am also particularly pleased to see that in clause 7 it is proposed that the provisions, for example, of the Tasmanian Criminal Code would be applicable to an Act of a person who commits on board a foreign vessel an offence such as murder whilst in the course of a voyage, say, from Auckland to Bell Bay, or whilst on board a fishing vessel fishing for squid off the east coast of Tasmania. I believe that as joint fishing ventures become more common the use of this legislation will also become more common and very helpful. </para>
          <para>I do note the defence available in clause 7- that a person may not come within the terms of the Act if the offence with which he is charged is not an offence in the country of his nationality. I assume that this would not happen often. Most countries have laws relating to ordinary crimes such as murder, theft, robbery and assault. I am wondering whether laws relating to the possession and use of drugs are the most likely ones to fall within this defence. I am wondering whether the Attorney-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Durack)</inline> might give some indication of the type or scope of actions to which this defence might be thought to be applicable. </para>
          <para>It was indicated by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Button</inline> that the Opposition supports and commends this legislation as the fruit of collaboration between the Attorneys-General. It is a good example of federalism at work. We have had the complementary State legislation brought to our attention- at least, that enacted by Victoria. It appears that it will, for example, cover purely intrastate voyages. </para>

              <para>- Apparently it leads the way in this matter. Of course, in four months Victoria will lead the way on a whole range of matters. It needs to be emphasised, however, that this legislation in no way detracts from the total sovereignty of this Parliament over the waters, seabed, et cetera, adjacent to the Australian coast from the low water mark outwards. That was the effect of the High Court decision in the Seas and Submerged Lands Act case. This legislation in no way retreats from that position- nor could it, of course. It is on that basis that the Opposition supports the Bill wholeheartedly. We maintain that resources in the seabed and waters adjacent to Australia are properly thought of and properly to be exploited as Australian national resources, belonging to the whole of the Australian people without regard to State boundaries or claimed State interests. </para>
            </talk.start>
          </continue>
          <para>These former colonial boundaries, now State boundaries, should be ignored in regard to matters beyond the low water mark. What cannot be ignored is the absolute need to ensure that where breaches of the normal rules relating to the protection of life, liberty or property are concerned, some law be certain and available to deal with them. Having to resort to the ancient admiralty jurisdiction in order to discover what law is applicable would be intolerable. It has proved intolerable. It is most convenient then that the criminal laws of the States and the jurisdiction of State courts be able to fasten on to the alleged offender and allow for the matter to be tried. This cannot be done directly. For example, State criminal law could not constitutionally apply to Oteri &#39;s case with the crayfish pots. </para>
          <para>Commonwealth law cannot do the unconstitutional. Therefore I do not think that the Attorney-General is quite correct. Elaboration at least is needed when he said in his second reading speech that the effect of the Bill is to apply the criminal laws of an appropriate State or Territory to offences on or from Australian ships on overseas, interstate and Territory voyages. Rather the Bill takes, as I understand it, the State law as denned, whether written or unwritten, and adopts its terms as the terms of the Federal law applicable to the situation. It is simply that this Parliament, rather than take the time to enact an ordinary criminal code to deal with all matters beyond a low water mark, as it could within its power- it is entitled to do so- is proposing in relation to offshore offences, connected with Tasmania for example, to take and adopt the provisions of the Tasmanian Criminal Code and transmute them into the provisions of a notional Federal statute to deal with offences at sea, off the coast or related to Tasmania. </para>
          <para>I seek the Attorney-General&#39;s comment on this way of putting the legal situation created by the Act. I do not do so for any narrow, legalistic or pedantic purpose but because I consider it crucial to policy, and in any case constitutional, to make it clear that the Federal Parliament is not abandoning its total ability to determine what shall or shall not be offences beyond the low water mark and the manner in which they are to be determined and disposed of. It is simply that in this case, on the whole, the Parliament thinks it convenient and suitable to cause the least disruption to ordinary expectations by adopting convenient State legal systems as its own. On that basis the Opposition commends the Attorney-General and his counterparts from the States and the Northern Territory and their various officers for devising a very neat scheme which claims for this nation its rightful jurisdiction over criminal offences, admittedly beyond its low water mark, which are its proper concern. </para>

            <para>- in reply- I thank the Senate for the support given to this measure. Although it is regarded, I suppose, as a technical, legal measure, nevertheless, it deals with the application of criminal laws in the offshore areas around Australia. This is a matter of very great concern, as honourable senators have recognised, to virtually all Australians. At some time or other most Australians will have some occasion to go beyond the low water mark around the Australian coastline, even if it is only to swim. It certainly is an important measure. Any measure dealing with the application of criminal laws is important, even though, as 1 said, this one seems to be somewhat technical. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>The other important point to be made- I do appreciate that honourable senators who have spoken recognised this- is that this measure is the first in what I hope will be a series of Bills to be considered and passed by this Parliament over the next 12 months or more to give effect to the constitutional settlement reached at the last two Premiers conferences regarding the control of the offshore areas of Australia as a result of the decision of the High Court in the Seas and Submerged Lands Case. Whatever debate there may be here today, there will certainly be debate on the other legislation as to the notion of sovereignty- what it is, who has it and so on. The fact is that the basis of that constitutional settlement is that the Commonwealth is recognising the traditional exercise of jurisdiction by the States in the territorial sea adjacent to their coasts. The High Court decision, of course, ascribed to the Commonwealth Parliament the full power to legislate in respect of this area but in that decision it did not take away in terms the very considerable powers that the States themselves have, in relation not only to the three-mile limit but also probably even further, provided there is a connection between the off-shore activity and the State whose laws are sought to be applied. Under the terms of the High Court decision, the Commonwealth could always come in and, by virtue of section 109 of the Constitution, pass its own laws and thereby override State laws. The exercise in which we have been engaged with the States, and in which we will continue discussions with them because a very complicated series of measures is involved in respect of the territorial sea, relates to our withdrawal as a Commonwealth Parliament from that area, although not from areas of traditional Commonwealth power, and our leaving it to legislation by the States. There are many other matters dealing with off-shore areas, in relation to mining and so on, which will all be the subject of special legislation and I do not want to go into them now. However, because <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Tate</inline> raised the matter I wanted to emphasise that this is the first of a series of measures to give effect to that constitutional settlement. </para>
          <para>The Bill before the Senate simply deals with the Commonwealth part of the arrangement with the States in relation to crimes at sea, that is, beyond low water mark. Complementary State legislation will be enacted. I regret that I was not in the Senate when the Bill was called on, because I intended before the debate began to circulate the Victorian Bill, which is the State counterpart of this legislation. These two Bills have been developed as a result of discussions by the Standing Committee of Attorneys-General. </para>

              <para>-Victoria is the only State as yet that has passed a Bill. The Northern Territory Assembly has passed it. I understand that the New South Wales Government is likely to introduce legislation quite shortly for consideration. We have no reason to doubt that all the States will proceed to implement their own complementary part of this legislation. Certain specific questions have been raised. One raised by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Missen</inline> relates to the effect of this Bill on activities on the Great Barrier Reef. As a result of complementary Queensland legislation, this Bill will deal with the application of Queensland laws to the territorial sea, which will include an area around all the islands of the Barrier Reef. Clauses 9 and 10 of the Bill will also apply Queensland&#39;s criminal laws to actions on the continental shelf and, by regulations under clause 10, in any economic zone when that is declared. </para>

              <para>- I will come to that point. These two clauses merely apply State laws. They are not themselves legislating in respect of particular problems that may arise in relation to the Barrier Reef. The Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority has been established by an Act of this Parliament. I imagine that some of the activities <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Missen</inline> may have in mind would be in breach of existing laws, but I think he is probably concerned that there should be special laws in relation to this area. The question of what special laws should be applied in relation to marine parks is under discussion with the States and is one on which the Premiers have not yet made a decision. I expect that it will be included, together with other matters, for consideration at the next Premiers Conference. </para>

          <para>
            <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Tate</inline>raised the question of the application of clause 7 of the Bill, which relates to acts committed on foreign ships, particularly in regard to drugs, before they enter Australian territorial waters. I imagine that the control of drugs in this situation would be covered almost entirely under the Customs Act, the existing Federal law, which of course continues to apply. This Bill does not derogate in any way from the application of ordinary Federal laws under our ordinary powers as a Commonwealth Parliament. As <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Tate</inline> observed, clause 7 of the Bill preserves the laws applicable to the offender. In the case of a foreigner, the laws applicable to him would be the laws of the country of which he is a national. Sub-clause (6) provides that proceedings will not be instituted unless the government of that country consents, and they will not be brought unless the Attorney-General consents. Really, clause 7 is not expected to apply very often. It is designed to deal with a situation which may arise if on a foreign ship an act is committed to which seemingly no law is going to apply and no country is interested in enforcing any law. So, in relation to the specific question raised by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Tate,</inline> I think we would be interested in applying only our own Federal laws to that situation, by and large. </para>
          <para>This Bill was introduced some months ago and has been lying on the table since August last year for comment. Comments have been made by the States, and I have received some from interested persons. I thank those who have taken an interest in it and made such valuable comments. As a result of those comments, we propose to make some technical amendments to the Bill. Those amendments have been circulated, although they are really a matter for the Committee stage. As far as the principle of the legislation is concerned, I am very pleased that the Bill is going to have a speedy passage through the Senate and, hopefully, through the Parliament. </para>

            <para>- As I indicated in my reply to the second reading debate, I have circulated a number of amendments and an explanatory memorandum about those amendments.

            <para>-The Quarantine Amendment Bill 1978 increases considerably, but not in the view of the Opposition excessively, the penalties for offences under the Quarantine Act 1908. It is worth noting, I believe, that it is the first time that these penalties have been increased in some ten years and that these increases bring the penalties somewhere into line with the inflation rate that has occurred in that time. One may in passing I believe wonder why there has been such a delay. I am conscious that during those ten years there have been in office governments of different persuasions but it seems to me that in a parliament in which frequently there are complaints that there is too much legislation, an important piece of legislation like this should not have avoided attention for such a long time. Quarantine and quarantine provisions are of vital importance to this country. It is necessary that there be an appropriate level of penalties in our attempts to defeat those people who for financial gain, from a misplaced desire to resist authority or because of some foolish attachment to an animal, flout our quarantine laws. However, just as it is important to have stringent penalties the most stringent penalties alone will not necessarily reduce the incidence of these breaches of the Act. Some certainty of detection is also needed and the greater the likelihood of detection of people breaching the Act the more likelihood there is of preventing people from attempting to avoid our quarantine regulations. I believe that this aspect of our quarantine procedures deserves some attention because we rarely get the opportunity to debate this matter in the Parliament. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>We live, as I am sure we all know, in a very lucky country. We live in a very lucky country when we consider some of the world&#39;s great scourges and the manner in which we avoid them. Australia is almost free from some of the greatest menaces in the way of infectious diseases of both animal and man. Plague, cholera, malaria, lassa fever, typhus, rabies, foot and mouth disease, Newcastle disease and many others do not afflict or very rarely afflict anyone in this country. This is due certainly to our geographical isolation, to our high standards of public health and equally as certainly to the efficiency of our quarantine service and procedures. Many of the world&#39;s most devastating insects have not invaded this continent as yet but it is disturbing to note, although it is unavoidable, that in the last 20 or 30 years many insect pests and diseases which affect plants have arrived in this country and have not been and will not be eradicated despite any measures which we may attempt. In my own State of Tasmania the syrex wasp still inflicts damage on pine plantations and every year in Estimates Committee discussions the Minister representing the Minister for Health, I and others have an interesting discussion on the efforts to eliminate the oriental fruit fly. We have managed to confine that pest in this country at a cost of many thousands of dollars. The giant African snail has recently reached the country. We hope that it has been controlled. The spotted alfalfa aphid unfortunately is consuming large quantities of lucerne in this country. The oak leaf miner and many other insects have invaded us and are causing trouble. </para>
          <para>It is worth while noting that in the last 20 years the European wasp has spread to all sections of Tasmania following its introduction. The world record size for European wasp nests is now held not in Europe but in Tasmania because of the favourable breeding grounds. This wasp is inflicting damage in Tasmania much to the discomfort of some of the inhabitants and certainly to the great distress of many of the apiarists in our State. </para>
          <para>Australia has not always been as lucky as far as human diseases are concerned. Cholera and plague were once regular visitors to this country and smallpox intermittently affected people. But this combination of our geographical isolation and our stringent precautions has managed to protect us. However, our isolation no longer exists due to modern air travel, with the vast size of modern airliners, and the decreases in air fares with brings international air travel into the reach of more and more people. Our isolation will continue to decline. In recent years cholera has slipped in occasionally. Fortunately it has been quickly contained and it can be quickly contained in a country like this. Smallpox, because of a worldwide campaign, we hope, has been eliminated. In so doing I believe that mankind has achieved one of the greatest medical, social and political achievements because the war against smallpox involved the overcoming of considerable social, political, economic and medical difficulties. In removing what was one of the captains of kings of death on the earth, and one hopes that we have done so, quarantine procedures played an important part. </para>
          <para>I suppose that if any disease illustrates the importance of our quarantine procedures and at the same time demonstrates the fragility of our quarantine facilities and potential dangers to this country the one which should personally come home to us all is the disease of rabies, although one can use many examples such as foot and mouth disease or bluetongue. Rabies is a worldwide scourge. In fact, Australia and the British Isles, Japan, Papua New Guinea, New Zealand, Ireland and possibly Denmark are about the only countries that are in fact free of this disease. It is spreading across Europe rapidly and experts readily predict that it will inevitably reach the British Isles. Once it is established in Britain or in Australia the chances of eradication are nil and the chances of control are very difficult in a country like this which has a large wild dog population, a large domestic dog population and many potential hosts for this disease. </para>
          <para>It is worthwhile mentioning that according to the records only three human beings who have actually developed the symptoms of rabies have survived. The disease does not affect a vast number of people but its prevention is unpleasant, its treatment is very difficult and its mortality rate horrifying. Although the methods of protection are improving the thought of this disease reaching our continent is a considerable worry and enough to give any health authority nightmares. Yet people in this country and people in the United Kingdom persist in trying to defeat the quarantine regulations in their attempts to bring in domestic pets which can be potential carriers of this disease. Misguided individuals still try to smuggle in foodstuffs. Many tons of foodstuffs and meat products are intercepted at our international ports every year. People, as a hobby or for gain, still smuggle in and attempt to smuggle in birds and birds&#39; eggs, thus bringing in Newcastle disease. Honourable senators who are interested in this matter would know about the outbreak of Newcastle disease from this source last year. Seeds and plants are still smuggled in and health regulations are still ignored, quite often merely to save time at medical checks and customs checks at international airports. </para>
          <para>We have an enormous problem in trying to educate our citizens and visitors that we are serious about our quarantine measures. We have an enormous problem which could be assisted by bringing in stringent regulations and by bringing in methods and procedures of detection of breaches of the Quarantine Act which would make detection more likely. At the same time, we are now at the stage where more than 1,000 people can arrive at Sydney Airport or Melbourne Airport in one day, thus making a complete detection method impossible. So education becomes important and detection methods become . very important in trying to keep our country free of these diseases. </para>
          <para>We have further problems arising because of difficulties in our near north and difficulties in the Middle East- difficulties which might occur anywhere. The possibility of this country having to take large numbers of refugees increases the need to upgrade and to assist our quarantine services, both in the Department of Health and in the Bureau of Customs. Increased fishing activities and increased air travel create problems. I hope that the Government can proceed with the new quarantine station at Cocos Island so that we can avoid some of the animal diseases. I hope that we will continue to find it simple enough to increase and improve the number of laboratories and mainland quarantine facilities in Australia to avoid these very real problems which face us. Very little publicity is given inside or outside this Parliament to certain expenditure which is of vital importance and which too often we tend to ignore. Expenditure on quarantine services and disease prevention services is one such expenditure. I hope that in the future we can continue to upgrade these services; that it will not be another 10 years before the penalties provided in the Act are looked at and careful consideration is given to the satisfactory nature or otherwise of the penalties. The Opposition supports the legislation and has no desire to hold it up. </para>

            <para>- The Government appreciates the Opposition&#39;s support of the Quarantine Amendment Bill. We are indebted to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Grimes</inline> for his thoughtful and constructive speech. As he said, the purpose of the Bill is to increase the level of quarantine penalties. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Grimes</inline> drew attention to the importance of the Quarantine Act and the role that it plays in providing a framework for the exclusion from Australia of exotic diseases of humans, animals and plants. Our capacity to keep Australia free from those diseases depends upon the effective administration of quarantine legislation and general awareness of the implications of quarantine breaches and the sanctions which can be exercised. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>As was said, the penalties have not been increased for some years and they are no longer commensurate with the gravity of the offences, nor are they sufficient to act as effective deterrents. This Bill provides for increased penalties which should discourage illegal action under the Quarantine Act. I commend the Bill to the Senate. </para>

            <para>- We are debating the Commonwealth Authorities (Northern Territory Pay-roll Tax) Bill 1978. The purpose of this Bill is to bring the Northern Territory into line with the rest of Australia with respect to payroll tax. Because of that we do not oppose the Bill. We see that it is necessary to provide for the same levels of payroll tax to apply in the Northern Territory as apply in the States and in the Australian Capital Territory, and for the same sort of coverage of Commonwealth authorities subject to payroll tax to apply in the Northern Territory as applies in the States and in the Australian Capital Territory. But it is fair to say that the Australian Labor Party is opposed in principle to payroll tax, just as it is opposed in principle to the investment allowance. The ALP platform seeks the removal of payroll tax and the investment allowance, mainly because they are taxes on activity. They seek to encourage the elimination of jobs and they encourage the replacement of men by machines. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>The ALP favours the removal of payroll tax because the ALP seeks to encourage employment and activity and, through that activity, the generation of profits which can be taxed. But because payroll tax applies all over Australia and because this Bill will bring the Northern Territory into line with the States and with the Australian Capital Territory, we do not oppose it. It is a part of self-government that we have got used to in the last 12 months. It is one of the Bills which has been brought forward to facilitate self-government in the Northern Territory. I have made the point in this place before that, with the creation of a new government and with the creation of new departments, there are many opportunities to find novel ways to look at things- new ways to organise a public service, new ways to organise departments and perhaps even new ways of government. But I believe that this is not one such opportunity and I do not intend to press the issue here. </para>
          <para>The discouragement of employment to which I referred is particularly important in the Northern Territory. Unemployment is a vital issue for us in the Territory. The January figures showed that there were 4,995 unemployed- 9. 1 8 per cent of the work force. As I have mentioned before in this place, a high proportion of young people are involved. There is little doubt that the percentage of young people will increase with the February school leavers and that the figures for February in the Northern Territory will be quite disastrous. There is little doubt also that the percentage of the total work force which is unemployed will increase when the wet season ends and the dry season comes upon us. This is traditional in the Northern Territory. Each year, at the onset of the dry, we have people from the south moving north and causing more unemployment. </para>
          <para>The situation is made worse this year by what one might call the lure of uranium. A number of politicians, both Federal and Territorial, have made some fairly ridiculous statements about the number of people who will be employed when uranium is mined. I seem to recall that the Minister for Trade and Resources, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Anthony,</inline> used a figure of something like 100,000 people. Nevertheless, we all know that the number that will be employed is nowhere near this figure, or even the somewhat lower figures quoted by other politicians. The people who will be employed in the Northern Territory will be specially recruited for their jobs, but the unemployed from the south will increase our unemployment. The unemployed in the southern States will not heed the advice of the Commonwealth Employment Service and will come to the Territory seeking work. We saw this sort of thing happening after Cyclone Tracy when many people, despite warnings in the Press and advice from the CES, came north looking for the work that they thought would follow the cyclone. </para>
          <para>I put it to the Northern Territory Government that it must take steps to increase employment opportunities in the Northern Territory. It is quite obvious that the Federal Government has not been prepared to do this. It has demonstrated its indifference to the Northern Territory in the last three Budgets. We have had no incentives, no stimulation of the economy and virtually no spending in the public sector, unlike the situation which has existed in the Australian Capital Territory when definite steps have been taken to make sure that building firms did not go to the wall and that employment was created for those people. We have not had this situation in the Northern Territory and so we have great problems with unemployment. </para>
          <para>If we are to have payroll tax, I hope that the Northern Territory will use this money as revenue for worthwhile purposes. It should use exemptions from the tax as incentives. There is nothing new in this. This sort of thing has been done already by the New South Wales Government at Albury to assist the paper manufacturers. It has been done in many States. In fact I can recall suggesting this and other incentives to industry when I made my maiden speech in this place. There is no argument about the fact that the Northern Territory needs more secondary industry and there is no argument either about the fact that businesses are reluctant to move into an area unless they get some sort of incentive to move in. I see exemption from payroll tax as one form of incentive that can be offered. The Northern Territory Government can use it as an incentive to encourage business to move in. Of course, there are others and they have been canvassed in this place previously. Perhaps this is not the appropriate time to go through them. But it is fair to say that little has been done up to the present in the Northern Territory by either the Federal Government or the Northern Territory Government. </para>
          <para>I am pleased to see that the Northern Territory Government has announced proposals along the lines that I am suggesting. I refer to a recent announcement by an executive member- the Treasurer, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Perron.</inline> It is not much but it is a start. Unfortunately- and I use the word &#39;unfortunately&#39; wisely here- the people in the Northern Territory have come not to trust their Government. This is a most unfortunate situation. I have already indicated to the leader of the Government in the Northern Territory, both publicly and privately by letter, that he has a great honour to lead the first Northern Territory Government. I have tried to remind him of his need to establish and maintain credibility, not only for himself but also for the Government as a whole- our Government in the Northern Territory. Unfortunately he has not done this, either with the people of the Northern Territory or with his colleagues here in Canberra. At least one Federal Minister in this place has had a recent experience of this. </para>
          <para>Perhaps I could cite the establishment of a government insurance office as one example of what I am talking about. The establishment of a insurance office very much along the lines of the sort of thing we see in the States with the State government insurance offices was suggested by the Australian Labor Party during the last election campaign. As is fairly common during election campaigns, the concept was attacked by the Country-Liberal Party, but this is to be expected. This year the Chief Minister moved to establish a government insurance office. Naturally he could not have an office which was the same as that suggested by the ALP. This would, unfortunately, represent some sort of loss of face. So he introduced a concept of his own. He disregarded the Caffin report, which is a report produced by a group set up to make recommendations about a government insurance office. This report actually suggested a proposition very much along the lines of the ALP proposal. </para>
          <para>The announcement which he made has sparked off a controversy in the Northern Territory. Insurance offices came out and opposed the suggestion. They criticised the conditions, terms, benefits and areas of insurance, and after that there was not much left. The  Chairman  of the Nominal Defendants Committee, who is a leading member of the CLP, resigned in protest at the announcement and he made the following statement in the local newspaper: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>It is a complete reversal of an undertaking given by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Everingham</inline> to the insurance industry last year. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">Branches of the Chief Minister&#39;s party, including his own, came out with their objections to it. The unions opposed it, suggesting that the Chief Minister was inviting a total industrial stoppage. So there was a complete turnaround by the Chief Minister. The beautiful brochures with his portrait on the back, which unfortunately had not been issued, were all thrown away and a new committee was established. We were given promises of new conditions remarkably similar to the ALP&#39;s proposals and it was suggested that there would be discussion by the public. I certainly welcome this. I welcome the establishment of the committee, the fact that there will be new conditions and certainly the discussion by the public. I hope that the discussion occurs. </para>
          <para>Unfortunately the present Northern Territory Government is notorious for not consulting the people. We had the first case of the referendum on statehood which went back into the previous Chief Minister&#39;s time and the more recent issue of casinos which the Government refuses to put to the people at a referendum. I welcome the step that has been made. I welcome the acceptance that a mistake has been made, although, of course, in true political terms this was not made explicit. But I regret another example of inadequate investigation before presentation. I regret also the lack of consultation with the industry, with the Territory Opposition and with the people of the Territory and I regret the reversal of the undertaking made by the Chief Minister. A situation which we all understand is that if one party or one politician errs the public become suspicious of all politicians and our standing in the community drops even lower. I do not mind its losing favour with the people. This will mean that we will have a Labor government next time. This is all part of the political will. But I do mind our Territory- it belongs to all of us, not just the governing group- being held up to ridicule and I object to our Territory starting on the wrong foot on its path to constitutional development. </para>
          <para>We on this side do not oppose the Bill for the reasons I have outlined. I hope and trust that the Northern Territory Government will not let us down and will use its powers for the betterment of the Northern Territory, firstly, to develop those industries which are already established in the Territory and, secondly, to compensate the small businesses which have been crippled by excessive charges. One example I cite here is the imposition of higher charges for electricity which, we understand, are to go up an additional 1 4 per cent. This is a particular problem for small firms such as quick food firms. I had one example of this cited to me last week where a firm had to put off one staff member so that it could meet its additional bill. When it gets a bill for the additional 14 per cent it is going to be in further trouble. I hope that the Northern Territory Government will use the device of exemption from payroll tax to encourage the setting up of the new industries that are so essential to our growth as a self-governing territory. </para>

            <para>- I rise to speak on a brighter note than the previous  speaker.  As I have often said in the Senate, I think that in the north of Australia there is a challenge ahead for Australia and that challenge is being met by people who are active and have faith in the future. Whilst there may be one or two small problems, they are part of life. The Northern Territory is developing now and accepting responsibilities. After all, when one looks back one sees that it was only last year that the Northern Territory (Self-Government) Bill was passed by the Senate. This has been an enormous task because it is the first time in the history of Australia that a territory has grown to something like the proportions of a State. The Northern Territory is not yet a State, but I can assure not only you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr President,</inline> and other honourable senators but also the people of Australia that the north is moving. The people of the north have confidence in themselves and the work that is being carried out now will be seen for decades ahead as a firm, good and stable foundation for their future. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>This Bill is a machinery Bill, as the Government has indicated. It is legislation that is necessary to cover certain aspects of Commonwealth authorities paying payroll tax to the Northern Territory Government. As speakers on both sides of the chamber have indicated, there is little to be said on this particular aspect, because the revenue from payroll tax instead of going into the Federal coffers will, under arrangements similar to those applicable to the States, now go to the Northern Territory Government. What has happened in the intervening period in relation to payroll tax which has been gathered within the Northern Territory? The Northern Territory Government has made certain moves. In the few brief months since the legislation was introduced it has made an adjustment which will be of benefit to people engaged in small businesses. What has occurred is that the level at which payroll tax is payable has risen. This will have the effect of helping small business people. It will give them more incentive and make assistance in becoming part of the new Northern Territory scene. When one looks at the turnover of small business one realises that the amount of payroll tax involved under this measure is not inconsiderable. </para>
          <para>I could speak at length about this subject, but perhaps I should refer to the debate which took place in the House of Representatives when this legislation was passed by that House. In that debate the Opposition spokesman on the Northern Territory, the honourable member for Capricornia <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr Everingham),</inline> said, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Robertson</inline> said on behalf of honourable senators on the other side of the Senate, that he was not opposed to the Bill. But he went on to say that it would be far more equitable, to leave the payroll tax abolished. That is the first point. I suppose it would be true to say that everyone in Australia would like to see payroll tax abolished. I suppose it would be true to say that they would like to see most forms of taxation abolished. Who would not? If it were, we would be living in a dream time and a dream country; but unfortunately the fact of the matter is that, while the country requires these vast resources to be spent in the fields of education, health and social security, someone has to pay. </para>
          <para>Everyone, whether he be in the Government, the Opposition, or living in the country, realises that the demand covering these three aspects of expenditure in Australia is enormous in its implications- so enormous, as I have said, that to some degree I find it frightening. The implications of this situation are so enormous in regard to cost that it will have the effect of reducing government expenditure in some areas in which many Australians would like to see it maintained. I refer, for instance, to defence. But that is another matter. What I am saying is that, because of the Government&#39;s requirements to make these outlays throughout Australia, there is a necessity to raise money. Unfortunately, payroll tax is part of the revenue gathering process, and payroll tax is part of the situation in the Northern Territory too. </para>

              <para>- I feel sorry for the honourable senator. In view of the way in which he sees things, it is no wonder that the Government of which he was a member brought the country to financial ruin.

          <para>Let me turn to the situation which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Robertson</inline> mentioned a few minutes ago when he was speaking to the Bill, namely, the unemployment situation in the Northern Territory. </para>
          <para class="block">The figures that I extracted today show that in the Northern Territory 4995 people are unemployed. That is a large number. It represents 9. 1 8 per cent of the work force. But the point 1 am making is that because the Labor Party discontinued the payment of training allowances to Aboriginal people they then had to apply for the unemployment benefit. At the present time 38.4 per cent of the total number of people who receive the unemployment benefit in the Northern Territory are Aboriginal. </para>
          <para>It is most interesting to look at the figures. Let us start with the situation in Darwin. There are 2,745 people unemployed in Darwin, and Aboriginal people comprise 12Vi per cent of that figure. But the figure in relation to those unemployed in Darwin is rather different from those for the rest of the Territory. Many of the people included in this figure, other than Aboriginal people, are people who have come to the Top End of the Northern Territory for various reasons. They are swelling the ranks of the unemployed. In Katherine there are 622 people unemployed, of whom the Aboriginal component is 405. That means that 65 per cent of those unemployed in the Katherine area are Aboriginal people. </para>

              <para>- No, I am afraid not. The Government of which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cavanagh</inline> was a member is accountable. This is the sorry story of youth unemployment in the Northern Territory. I deplore the unemployment figures that I am about to give to the Senate. But the fact is that we have this sorry story of youth unemployment in the Northern Territory. Bearing in mind that the total unemployment figure for the Northern Territory is 4,995, we find that the total youth unemployment figure is 184. In Darwin there are 144 unemployed youth, in Katherine there are 16 and in Alice Springs there are 24. </para>

          <para>One should look at the magnificent job that is being done, through the Commonwealth Employment Service, at the youth job centre at </para>
          <para class="block">Edmond Street in Darwin. That centre provides a particular service for youth unemployed. Much is being done there. I go further and make a comment regarding the spokesman for the Opposition on the Northern Territory. The Commonwealth Authorities (Northern Territory Pay-roll Tax) Bill was introduced on 24 August. The Opposition spokesman when discussing the Bill stated:   . . the Whitlam Government had abolished, certain investment allowances which have been and are an encouragement to industry to speed up the elimination of jobs- the replacement  of labour  by machines . . . </para>
          <para class="block">What absolute rot. The investment allowance applied in Australia gave encouragement to the search for oil and gas in the outback of Australia. It brought about immense returns to the communities and tremendous employment. But at the stroke of a pen the Labor Party Government cut out the investment allowance and therefore in the outback it brought development to a standstill and unemployment mounted rapidly. He continued: </para>

          <para class="block">That statement is absolute rot. Let us look at the cost of petrol to consumers in the outback. I refer to the Review of the Continuing Expenditure Policies of the previous Government. The document is dated June 1973.

          </quote>
          <para class="block">He was saying: &#39;Let us wipe the petroleum subsidy scheme for those few people in the outback because they do not count&#39;. One of the possibilities he gave to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Whitlam</inline> was to discontinue the existing program. For those who are interested, I refer them to this particular document in which there are four choices. But what did the Labor Government do? In this particular instance it discontinued the existing program which meant that, as far as the people of the outback were concerned, they went into a period when fuel costs and living costs went up. Ever since then we have heard whining from the other side of the Senate. In reality, the commencement of this downturn, this infliction on the people of the outback, came from the direction of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Whitlam</inline> to <inline font-weight="bold">Dr Coombs.</inline> The fuel subsidy scheme was removed, and the Opposition spokesman in the other place had the hide to speak about the cost of petrol in the outback as if it were their own problem. </para>
          <para>Now, of course, the Government has reintroduced the fuel subsidy scheme and at least the people in the outback are getting a better go. Another point is that when this scheme was removed from the people of the outback certain things happened. I shall take honourable senators into the Top End of the Northern Territory, where at that time there existed the North Australia Railway which ran from Darwin to Larrimah, the Frances Creek mining company and so on. When the fuel equalisation scheme was removed fuel costs went up dramatically and, as the North Australia Railway was using liquid fuel and not coal, its freight rates went up. The North Australia Railway then put pressure on Frances Creek, which was then the iron ore town in the Northern Territory. Pressure was put on to such an extent that the Frances Creek iron ore company found that it could not trade economically. At that particular time its freight bill to the North Australia Railway increased and, because of the freight rate, its operation was uneconomic. It could not pay the North Australia Railway freight bill. </para>
          <para>As the Frances Creek company was the main customer of the North Australia Railway and as it could not pay the bills that then made the North Australia Railway uneconomic. Then what did we have? We had the collapse of the Frances Creek company and we had the collapse of the North Australia Railway. It has been said so many times in this place that that was the responsibility and the fault of this Government. However, the fault goes back to that day when <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Whitlam,</inline> the Prime Minister, told <inline font-weight="bold">Dr Coombs</inline> to look at ways that the various schemes and expenditures of the previous Government could be removed so that the Labor Party Government could bring in its own ideas. It wiped and destroyed many aspects of the life of the people in the outback. </para>
          <para>I could go on at length in regard to this particular matter. When one loks at the rather ridiculous charges and criticisms that have been made one finds that they can all be answered. I shall answer them some other time. </para>
          <para>Let me go back briefly to the time in the affairs of the Northern Territory when there has been despondency, criticism and pessimism about the future of the north and of the Northern Territory Government. As I have said before, the transfer of power occurred less than one year ago. If one took close note of the situation in the Northern Territory, one would find that there was a new spirit abroad in industry and in the people of the north. Industries are being developed and roads are being put in. For once in their lives the people of the north feel that they are part of government. There is no room for pessimism and there is no room for despondency because the Northern Territory, like its fellow states of Western Australia and Queensland, will play a large part in the future of Australia. </para>
          <para>The Government Insurance Office is a bold venture which has been embarked upon by the Northern Territory Government which believes it will be for the benefit of the Northern Territory people. Of course there are problems. When one introduces a scheme like this amendments and adjustments have to be made. Has anyone seen a scheme which has not needed some adjustment or amendment? I discount the criticism that has been made in regard to the Northern Territory Government and the Chief Minister. There is liaison and communication today as there has been liaison and communication on other days. People are putting their viewpoint as to what should and should not be done. I believe that this ability of the people and industries of the Territory to communicate with and speak to each other will result in what everyone wishes and desires. </para>
          <para>I support the Bill. As I have said before, it is a machinery Bill, it is necessary, it is part of life, it is part of the adjustment that is needed as a result of the transference of Federal Government powers to the Northern Territory. However, the legislation has given some people the opportunity to air their pessimism, to knock and so on. But thank goodness that knockers and pessimists in the north express a minority viewpoint. The future of the north and the people of the Territory will be determined not by knocking but rather by confidence and looking ahead to achievement. </para>

            <para>- We are debating the Sales Tax (Exemptions and Classifications) Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1978. This Bill is similar to the Commonwealth Authorities (Northern Territory Pay-Roil Tax) Bill 1978. It is a machinery Bill to facilitate exemption from sales tax for departments and authorities under the control of the Northern Territory Government. The Opposition does not oppose the legislation. We note that the exemption is for departments and authorities and we hope that the Government will look at exemptions for groups associated with departmentsfor example, school committees, parent groups and so on. I appreciate that exemption is available at the present time and I trust that this will continue. However, I raise the point because I feel there is some need for clarification first in respect of groups associated with departments and authorities and secondly, in respect of items which attract exemption. Certainly, while we are looking at that, there is a need to look at exemption for other groups which are non-profit making- for example, youth groups, service organisations, church groups and so on. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>I accept that certainly care needs to be exercised but it should not be beyond the wit of this Government to establish reasonable criteria. Perhaps we could look at groups such as women&#39;s refuges which receive government financial assistance or groups such as Apex which are non-profit making and purely service organisations. But I do not have to continue. The Australian Council of Social Service and similar organisations could make suggestions if the Government is interested in this area. Perhaps I am moving beyond the scope of the Bill. I make the point that the Opposition does not oppose the Bill. </para>

That is part of our system and cautious hearts in this place must be prepared for very hard thrusts. But I do think that in the process we can use words to convey certain feelings that we may have without becoming what I regard as quite offensive. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McLaren,</inline> in respect of the point raised by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Carrick,</inline> was going very close to the wind. I indicated to him, by way of general background explanation, what was permissible when speaking to substantive motions. I hope not to be too rigid in my interpretation of parliamentary language. At the same time I believe that there is no better time than in the heat of debate to couch words in such a way as many members here can do. We can do it in ways that will convey the expressions of the individual without being hurtful or offensive to a person, such as by charging that person with lack of character, dishonesty and that sort of thing. That is all. I ask <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McLaren</inline> to continue his remarks. </para>

          <para class="block">I refer firstly to exports of metal chairs. I was given the details for the period from 1975-76 to July-August 1978.I am going to cite the figures for the last year of office of the Labor Government. In 1975-76, 391 metal chairs were exported to Sweden at a total value of $7,572. In 1976- 77 - the first year of the Fraser Government- the figure slipped down to 288 metal chairs at a value of $7,290. In 1977-78, the financial year about which the Prime Minister spoke, it slipped down further. Ten fewer chairs were exported to Sweden- namely, 278-at a total value of $6,170. So it can be seen that what I am saying is perfectly true. The Prime Minister did mislead the nation. He told the television audience that there was a massive export of furniture when in fact the number of metal chairs exported to Sweden had dropped away from 391 to 278 during his term of office and the total value had dropped from $7,572 to $6,170, a drop of $1,402. </para>
          <para>Let us have a look at the figures concerning the export of tables. In 1975-76 we exported 79 tables to Sweden at a total value of $3,857. The next year- the first year of the Fraser Government- we exported 49 tables, which was a drop of 30 tables, at a total value of $3,366. In 1977- 78 there was an increase in the number of units exported. There were 74 tables exported at a total value of $2,866. So all told there has been a drop of nearly $ 1 , 000. Taking the inflation rate into consideration, it is a diabolical exercise for the Prime Minister to try to hoodwink the people into believing that there was an export market for furniture in Sweden. </para>
          <para>
            <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Durack</inline>also spoke about other furniture exports. No figures are shown in <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Durack</inline> &#39;s reply of the number of units exported in 1975-76, which was the last year of the Whitlam Government, but other furniture to the value of $5,458 was exported to Sweden. For the next year, 1976-77 no figure was provided for the number of units exported other than furniture to the value of $5. That occurred in the first year of office of the Fraser Government. Let us look at the details for 1977-78. Again no figures are available of the number of units exported but there was an increase from $5 to $390 in the value of such exports that year. What a marvellous achievement! The Prime Minister has misled the nation into believing that we are developing great export markets in which we employ hundreds of thousands of people and that the economy of this country is improving greatly under the Fraser Ministry. </para>
          <para>Let us look at the answer to the question that I asked about colour television sets. It is very intriguing. I was a member of the Senate Standing Committee on National Resources, which had before it a reference about solar energy. During the course of our inquiry we paid a visit to a colour television set factory in Sydney. We were told by the management that no component parts for television sets are manufactured in Australia, that they are all imported from Japan. What the Prime Minister is saying is that we are now in a situation where we can import all the component parts from Japan, convert them to television sets, ship them to Hong Kong and compete with the Japanese in the market. That is what he said in his address to the nation. He said: </para>

I think it is a terrible state of affairs when, with the economy of this country flagging and unemployment at the highest level since the last Depression, we find the Prime Minister making a nationwide television broadcast that misleads the electors, misleads the people of this nation as to what this Government has achieved, in order to bolster the stocks of his Government. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Durack,</inline> in writing to me, has completely disproved what the Prime Minister said. </para>

That always occurs when we on this side of the chamber are able to bring to the notice of the public some of the things that they say to the public that are not correct. We are told daily- the Prime Minister even said it in this address to the nation- that interest rates are coming down. Of course, that is another misleading statement. He must have known at the time- 15 November- that interest rates would increase. He must have been considering with <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Howard</inline> the possibility of interest rates increasing. Of course, today he was taken to task about that in the other place by my leader and he could not come up with a satisfactory answer. He was like Daisy in the petunia patch. He stepped around for five minutes trying to get an answer and he could not find one. My leader nailed him to the wall on the question of interest rates, just as I feel that I have nailed him to the wall on this issue. </para>

          <para>There are many other things to which I could refer tonight but I am not going to do so because this is only the opening night of the autumn session. I am sure that my colleagues and I will have plenty to criticise the Government for in the coming months ahead and that we will be able to sustain and substantiate the claims we make. They will not be claims like the claims that were made in that substantive motion that was put before the Senate when we were in government. I refer to the claims which were made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Carrick</inline> and which he could not back up. As I have said, they were proved in the Queanbeyan court the other day to be completely wrong, yet the then Opposition hiked them all over the nation and convinced the people that they had in power in Canberra a corrupt and dishonest government. That court proved just the other day that what they were saying was a complete misnomer, that they were misleading the people. I am sure that the more the people of Australia are acquainted with what honourable senators opposite are doing the less the likelihood is of their staying on the other side for very much longer. </para>

Most of these were private Members&#39; Bills and the first to attract detailed consideration by Congress was the Bentsen Bill (S289S). This embodied the so called countercyclical concept of regulating the volume of imports to counter fluctuations in the level of US beef production. This Bill was approved by the Senate Finance Committee on 19 April 1978 and was passed by the US Senate on 5 May 1978. When considered by the House Ways and Means Committee some of the restrictive provisions of the Bentsen Bill were modified and an alternative, the Poage Bill (HR 1 1545) was presented to the House of Representatives. The Poage Bill, with minor amendments, was passed by the House and the Senate late in the second week of October 1978 and subsequently vetoed by President Carter. </para>

Special efforts were made to have the stamps and minisheets available by the issue date of 1 9 April 1978 and, in Queensland, Australia Post staff worked overtime on 1 7 and 1 8 April to hand-count the stamps and minisheets allocated to that State. Post Office staff members at Toowong are unable to recall whether the Aviators minisheet was available at that office at 9.00 a.m. on 19 April. As far as can be determined, however, the minisheet was available at the office by later in the day on 1 9 April 1978. </para>

          <para>The scope of such inquiries is quite wide ranging over all species of livestock and many countries.

          <para>Where appropriate, representations concerning quarantine issues are referred to my colleague, the Minister for Health, for consideration and decision or advice.

            <para>The PJT already has power under the Prices Justification Act to inquire and report on prices charged by companies for goods and services. Its jurisdiction does not extend to prices charged by unincorporated enterprises for goods and services because of the Constitutional basis on which the Act rests. </para>
            <para>With regard to statutory authorities, these bodies by their nature are ultimately subject to control by the Commonwealth or relevant State Government. Generally, such bodies are required to report to the responsible Minister on their operations and their reports are required to be tabled in Parliament. Their charges, and other aspects of their operations, are therefore subject to Parliamentary scrutiny through the responsible Minister. </para>
            <para>The Government has recently given detailed consideration to the role and functions of the PJT. Amendments to be made to the Prices Justification Act which I announced in Parliament on 18 October 1978 will provide for the Minister to initiate wide ranging inquiries, as necessary, into pricing matters. They would enable such price examinations as the PJT is presently conducting into beef marketing and processing, and processed foods, to be held as public inquiries. </para>
            <para>The amendments to the Act will also enable the PJT to require companies that have been subject to a public inquiry to notify their price increases for up to 12 months following the inquiry, where it considers this desirable, or for a longer period should the Minister so approve. </para>
