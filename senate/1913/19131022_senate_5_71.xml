            <para>- In the Melbourne press the Minister of Defence is reported to have said that he had placed the matter of the movements of the Fleet entirely in the hands of Admiral Patey. I desire to know if that is a &#39;correct statement of his intention, and whether Admiral Patey <inline font-style="italic">is</inline> to have the distribution of the ships? Is not the Naval Board to be consulted as to their movements) </para>

            <para>- I have not seen the. statement which SenatorPearce says is attributed to me in the press. Theoretically, and as a matter of fact, the Naval Board has the power to direct the itinerary of the vessels. It appears to me, however, entirely desirable that in this matter Admiral Patey, charged with the efficiency of the Fleet, should have a free hand as to the places to which he shall direct the vessels and the &#39; purposes for which they . shall go there. I am not aware that I have made that statement to any representative of the press. It is the attitude which I contemplate taking up. </para>

            <para>- The question, sofar as I have been able to follow it, israther complex. Dealing with the first part, let me assure the honorable senator, at whatever risk it may mean to myself, that I have not read the newspaper hi question to-day. With regard to questions without notice, I put it to the honorable senator that, unless they come within the category of urgent public business, it is desirable that notice should be given of them in due form. If he will put a notice on the business-paper, especially of that part of the question which deals with the attitude of the Ministry towards the Commonwealth Bank, he will get a fully considered answer, which at present I do not intend to attempt to give. </para>

              <para>- I have a recollection of the case mentioned by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Rae.</inline> The facts were these: The youth was incarcerated as a defaulting cadet. The matter was brought under my notice after he had served the major portion of his sentence. He had, I think, speaking from memory, served a period of twenty days. I directed that steps should be taken to release him. Those steps were taken, but some little delay was necessarily involved, because the matter of liberating a person from incarceration is not under the control of the Defence Department. Steps had to be taken, first of all, through the Commonwealth Crown Law. Department, and then through the State legal authorities. Then the direction had to be communicated to Broken Hill. A Saturday and Sunday intervened, and I understand that there was an interval of four or five days between the decision which I gave and effect being given to it. That lapse of time meant that the boy completed his term of incarceration. </para>

              <para>- I should say that, from the point of view of the Government, the &#34; wisdom &#34; alleged is scarcely visible. In regard to representations, the information that has reached the Government shows that divergent views are held. The Government would have to look at half-a-dozen different views if they were inclined, or desired - which they are not - to change their own. </para>

So far there has been no compliance with the terms of that motion. </para>

The papers referred to were partly in the Defence Department and partly in the Department of Home Affairs, and ithas taken some little time to put together the file, which, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> will readily understand, has now assumed enormous dimensions. I. anticipate, however, that they will shortly be laid on the table of the Library. </para>

No doubt, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McColl</inline> had intimated to me that it was his intention, to take this course. I hope that the members of the Opposition will raise no objection to the motion on an occasion of this kind. The Government have evidently made a very serious blunder in administering the affairs of the Commonwealth, and consequently it is only our duty to do all that we can in the interests of its people to assist them in getting out of that difficulty. On many occasions here I have heard whines, and even boisterous objections, raised to a suspension of the Standing Orders. I recognise - and I have always recognised - that it is a very serious matter to suspend the Standing Orders, which were made for the purpose of carrying out the business of the Senate in a legitimate way. </para>

            <para>- It is somewhat remarkable to find trained and experienced men like my honorable friend on one day opposing a motion of this kind, and on the next day tacitly supporting it, while at the same time he and his colleagues go throughout the States, and say that the Labour party in the Senate with our large numbers are obstructing the business. Here we are to-day, I suppose every one of us, anxious to put business through - eager for work, but no work to be done. Still the Government tell the people that we are obstructing business. </para>

As a matter of fact, I have just been doing a good turn for the Government by going round and telling my colleagues that we would have to supply an absolute majority of the Senate, as they have not sufficient on their side to suspend the Standing Orders. I felt some umbrage at the request of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor.</inline> When he spoke to me I said, &#34; What!

If it requires a suspension of the Standing Orders to drag the Government out of the dilemma into which they got by proclaiming the repealing Acts before the time was ripe, it ought to be done. I hope that honorable senators on this side will remain, so as to make the absolute majority required to secure a suspension of the rules without notice, and thus enable the Government to bring on this one little pet lamb. </para>

            <para>- Legislation regarding the sugar industry has occupied a great deal of the attention of the Commonwealth Parliament of late years&#39;. From 1901 to 1912, no fewer than thirteen Acts were passed by the Federal Parliament dealing with the question; whilst in the Parliament of Queensland, between 1880-1913, eight Acts were passed. The amount of legislation shows the importance of the question, and also indicates that the changing conditions of the industry necessitated fresh measures from time to time. It is an important industry, and also a peculiar one. In the early stages of its history in Australia, it was contended that sugar could not be grown except under coloured labour conditions. Many persons held that white labour was not competent to conduct the industry on account of the climatic conditions prevailing where sugar-cane is grown. For many years, there had been a strong desire for the. establishment of a White Australia policy. Effect- could not be given to that desire if we were- to continue to allow one of our greatest and most important industries to bo carried on entirely by coloured labour. It has, however, since been proved beyond a doubt that, in the large area where the industry has been conducted, the white man can grow sugarcane in a profitable manner. </para>

            <para>- Until Federation was accomplished, the sugar industry was entirely under the control of the- States, but with the advent of Federation various important questions arose,- the effect of which was to bring&#39; the industry within Commonwealth control. One of those questions was that of coloured labour, which was being dealt with by the Department of External Affairs. Secondly, there was the Tariff question. These two intimately related questions brought the industry under the- purview of the Commonwealth, which has had to do with it ever since. The industry in Queeusland is carried on in a belt of country ranging from the 16th to the 30th degrees of latitude. Sugar-cane is grown over an area of 1,000 miles in length, and about an average of 80 miles in width, upon the Queensland coast. The sugar area consequently occupies a great portion of the Queensland littoral. Last year the acreage under production in Queensland was 141,652. The quantity of cane crushed was 994,212 tons,, yielding 113,060 tons of sugar. The yield per acre was 1 ton 1 cwt. 3 qrs. :3 lbs. In New South Wales, the area under cane was 14,283 acres. Strangely enough, the yield of sugar per ton of cane was higher than in Queensland. We find that 1-40,114 tons of cane yielded 16,723 tons of sugar. In Victoria, no sugarcane is grown, but a beet sugar industry has been established for some years, and is making a little headway. Last year there were 572 acre&#39;s under crop&#62; which yielded 477 tons of sugar - a yield of li ton 1 cwt. 1  qr.  2 lbs. per acre. The consumption of sugar in Australia last year amounted to 226,484 tons - an average of 1-09*. 22 lbs&#39;, per head. The quantity grown, in Australia, 130,2&#39;60 tons, left&#39; a -shortage to be obtained elsewhere of 96&#39;,224 tons: I am glad to&#62; say that, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator&#39; Maughan</inline> mentioned a little while ago, the. present year is expected to be a record . one. Last&#39; year the yield was- poor. It- is expected that- the yield Joi- this year will be 220,000- tons, which means that, we shall almost overtake the consumption- of Australia-, and be practically providing ou-r own sugar for ourselves. Of course, it is- recognised by every one that this industry could not exist in&#34; Australia without Protection. It requires Protection, because the sugar lias to be grown in competition with the lowest-paid labour in the world. Consequently a duty of &#163;6 per ton was placed upon sugar coming to Australia from out side. Many may ask- whether the industry is worth the expenditure which has been; incurred  upon it. I think it is- for the following reasons : It is- true that- the industry is carried on at a cost- to&#39; the Commonwealth of over &#163;1,000,000, and that- this year the cost will probably be nearer &#163;1,500,000-. But at the same time we have to recognise that by means of our White Australia policy we obtain a higher standard of work and of wages for the industry than would otherwise be- possible, and we must bc prepared to pay for those benefits. It is as well that I should enumerate the advantages that we are getting for this great outlay. First of all, we are- getting an article which is entirely grown and manufactured by our own people: In the next place we bring&#39; about an enormous* amount of land settlement both in the sugar-growing districts and in the. inland districts adjacent to them, that would not be cultivated except for the industry. We are getting better social conditions in Australia, and we are excluding undesirables from this country. We are also affording protection to a part of Australia which is really our danger zone, because it is the pa-rt which is nearer to the great Asiatic countries than any other part of the country It is a portion of Australia that could not be settled by white people except for the sugar indus-  try. We are obtaining scope for the employment in the industry of some 26,000 white men. In fact, there are very feW coloured people engaged in it - only some- 5 or 6 per cent, of the employes are coloured people at present - and after this year there will be none at all. By encouraging, the industry we are placing a barrier to the invasion that might possibly take place unless these sugar districts were occupied, and consequently we are in a measure securing our national existence. Great as the amount spent may be, there has never been any indication that the people of Australia as a whole desire the duty on sugar to be repealed. They are prepared to pay it cheerfully, in order that the advantages* which I have enumerated may be secured. The duty, as I have said, is &#163;6 per ton on sugar; raw or refined. In addition to -that there is a bounty of &#163;3 per ton paid by the Commonwealth on the delivery of cane at the mills. We do not wait until the sugar is extracted from the cane, but we pay on it when the cane is delivered. Roughly speaking, the average quantity of sugar produced is 1 ton from 9&#188; tons of cane. When the bounty of &#163;3 per ton was given, an Excise of &#163;4 per . ton was imposed. The bounty and the Excise were levied together, in order that the White Australia policy might be inaugurated and in order that every inducement might be afforded for the employment of white labour in the industry. During the year 1912 there was an agitation in Queensland for the abolition of the bounty and the Excise. During the twelve years the amount received by the Commonwealth in import duty was &#163;3,050,609, and the amount received in Excise was &#163;6,191,570. The amount paid in bounty was &#163;3,750,312. Taking these figures, the Commonwealth in those years gained &#163;5,491,867. </para>

            <para>- Yes, including the import duty and the Excise. The object of Parliament in imposing the Excise and the bounty was, first, that the industry might be carried on by white labour. That policy has been entirely successful. Last year it, was urged that, our object having been practically accomplished, because only about 5 per cent, of coloured labour is now employed in the industry, the bounty and Excise were no longer required. The cost of administration comes to over &#163;7,000 per year. Moreover, many of the growers considered that the regulations under which the bounty and Excise were imposed were irksome. The bounty, of course, is paid at the mill when the grower brings in his cane, but the Excise is not paid until the sugar goes out of the mill for consumption. According to the Royal Commission which reported on this question, the net amount of duty obtained is not &#163;6, but &#163;5 5s. By doing away with the present system, the Commonwealth will obtain the full &#163;6 per ton. Another result of doing away with the bounty and Excise is that the growers will get 2s. 2d. per ton more for their cane than they previously received. In response to a demand which was general throughout Queensland, the State Government approached the Federal Government last year, and made the offer that they would exclude coloured labour from the industry altogether, and would be prepared to establish a Wages Board, so that the workers might be sure of getting fair payment for the work which they did.

        <para>Prime Minister, until the 5th December. The reason for the delay, as far as I can understand, was not any desire on the part of the Government not to proceed with the question, but to wait for the report of the Royal Commission to be sent in, in order that its recommendations might be studied. The report was not presented until the 2nd December. The Commission recommended the abolition of the bounty and Excise. Accordingly, the &#39; Fisher Government induced Parliament to pass two measures, abolishing both bounty and Excise. Those measures&#39; were assented to on the 24th December, just before last session closed. The session of the Queensland Parliament had ended previous to that, and nothing more could be done until that Parliament passed a Bill. </para>

        <para class="block">So that it will be seen that no time was lost by the present Government in doing everything possible to expedite the settlement of this question. I may say that the legislation passed by the Queensland Government fully covers what was required. They passed a measure stipulated by &#34;t&#39;he Fisher Government, prohibiting the employment of coloured labour in the industry, and another measure fixing the wages agreed upon until Wages Boards came to a determination on those matters. These measures were first - </para>

It has been held that the Government werecareless in this matter, and I wish toput the facts plainly before the Senate, in order to show that the Government omitted nothing which could fairly havebeen done. Telegrams were sent to every one in charge of mills, requiring an,&#39; accurate account of stocks in hand at. that date, and the names of the owners of the stocks, so that we might knowexactly what amount of Excise duty had1 to be paid on the stocks in hand, and theparty from whom it would be collected. Everything possible was done to securethe carrying out of the promise of theprevious Government, and we acted inn the best interests of growers, manufacturers, and workers. </para>

        <para class="block">If we &#34;had merely proclaimed the abolition of the bounty, we would have had no power to make the owners of sugar in bond -take that sugar out of &#34;bond. They might have left it there as long as they . pleased, and possibly the Excise would then have had to be paid by those who did not hold the stocks. I repeat that an accurate account was taken of the stocks in bond in order that the right people should be called upon to pay the Excise. No other course could have been taken consistent with fair play, and with the promise which had been made by the late Government. The stocks upon which Excise will be charged are those of sugar made from this season&#39;s cane, delivered before . the 26th July of the present year. These amount to about 36,000 tons of refined sugar. In addition, there are 3,500- tons of raw sugar, or a total of 39,500 tons. At &#163;4 per ton, the Excise chargeable . upon this quantity amounts to &#163;158,000. But this amount includes about &#163;8,000, which had been paid prior to the 26th July. </para>

            <para>- It was not released from bond, and the Government were bound by the agreement made by their predecessors. I am not going to say that the Labour Government were to blame. The whole thing was done in a hurry and to meet the necessities of the position. But the parties responsible for this trouble are quite willing to pay the amounts which are due by them. We had to incur whatever risk there might be or to break faith with the Queensland Government, and stop the payment of the additional 2s. 2d. per ton to the growers. But, as a matter of fact, there was no risk in this matter, because if the persons interested proved recalcitrant, this Parliament could enact legislation compelling them to pay it. Moreover, many of these persons, being registered companies, could pay the money only under Statute. However, it is idle to cry over the matter at this stage. When the Sugar Bounty Abolition Bill and the Sugar Excise Repeal Bill were passed by Parliament, the late Government did not consider the matter in all its bearings, otherwise they would have inserted a provision to meet the difficulty. The quantity of sugar in bond, I repeat, at the time the Acts were proclaimed was 39,500 tons in cane, and 6,208 tons of beet. This sugar will yield an Excise of &#163;158,000. The total bounty paid under the repealed Act was &#163;114,000, and the sum required to pay the additional 2s. 2d. per ton under the Bounty Bill will be about &#163;36,000, making a total disbursement of &#163;150,000. </para>

            <para>- It represents the difference between the bounty and Excise. The bounty payable was &#163;4 per ton, and the Excise chargeable was &#163;3 per ton. When both were abolished, the mills agreed to pay the difference between those amounts, which represents 2s. 2d. per ton to the growers. The Queensland Parliament passed the necessary legislation, which was assented to on the 24th July last. The Sugar Growers&#39; Employes Act provides that persons engaged in the industry shall receive a minimum wage of 8s. per day of eight hours, and the Sugar Growers Act directs payment to the growers by the mill-owners of the additional remuneration equivalent to the amount of the Excise, namely: - In No. 1 district, 9s. 8d. per ton of cane; in No. 2 district, 9s. 2d. per ton of cane; in No. 3 district, 8s. 8d. per ton of cane; and in No. 4 district, 8s. 2d. per ton of cane. It was morally obligatory on the part of this Government to carry out the promise which had been made by their predecessors. Otherwise, we should have been charged with a breach of faith. The Colonial Sugar Refining Company and some of the mill-owners in the Mackay and Bundaberg districts had promised that, if the Excise and bounty were abolished, they would give the growers the full advantage therefor, namely an additional 2s. 2d. per ton. This necessitated an adjustment being made, and, accordingly, the payment of the bounty vas temporarily suspended. On the 2nd August the Collectors of Customs in Queensland and New South Wales were instructed to communicate with each millowner, and ascertain the method proposed to be adopted in recouping the growers the amount of Excise on sugar the produce of cane delivered prior to the abolition of the Excise and bounty. Owing to the diversity of opinions among the millowners, it was then decided &#39; by the Government to take action to collect the revenue, and to make the necessary adjustment as between the mill-owners and growers. On the 13th August verbal instructions were given for the drafting of the present Bills, and written instructions were given on 16th August. The remarks which were made in another place were not made till some little time later. It is necessary to bring the Bill into force on a date to be proclaimed, instead of immediately, so that meanwhile the Department may be in full possession of information as to the exact quantity of excisable sugar. Clause 2 seeks to reimpose a duty of 4s. per cwt. upon sugar, and paragraph <inline font-style="italic">a</inline> covers all sugar made from cane delivered this season up to and including 25th July last. On this cane, except a very small proportion, namely, about 4.6 per cent, grown by black labour, the bounty at the old rate has been paid. The Excise on sugar is - except as to a negligible quantity - paid by the refining companies, and it is the intention of the Government to collect the Excise under this Bill in such a manner that no hardship will be inflicted. By arrangement with the refining companies, each will pay a proportion of the Excise due, with the result that the Excise will be paid by those who would have paid ib had it been continued in operation. The provision in paragraph <inline font-style="italic">b</inline> is intended to cover sugar in bond on 25th July last, which was made from the previous year&#39;s cane, about 3,000 tons. It also includes 450 tons of beet sugar, which were in the Maffra factory on that date. It is but equitable to charge this Excise, since the cane and beet from which the sugar was produced received the bounty under the former Act. Clause 3 is merely a formal one. In regard to clause 4, I wish to say that extreme care is necessary in determining the exactquantity of sugar which shall be charged Excise under this Bill. Reports have been obtained from all the State Collectors of Customs as to the quantities in  their  respective States. These show that they total about 39,500 tons. The figures are now being verified, and when such verification is complete, which should be within a few weeks, the quantity will be gazetted - the Act, of course, having by then been proclaimed. The course outlined in this provision is considered to be preferable to the mention in it of the quantities on which Excise is due. In regard to clause 5, it will be realized that the sugar which is actually excisable Under clause 2 cannot now be identified. Doubtless the greater portion of it will have passed into consumption. It will, therefore, be necessary to charge the Excise on the first sugar which is cleared after the proclamation of this Bill. As already explained, arrangements have been made whereby each of the  parties  responsible for the Excise will pay his proper share. Clause 6 provides that when Excise has been paid to the extent required under clause 12, the Excise duty shall cease to operate. This provision will obviate the necessity of passing another Act to repeal this one. The object of clause 7 is to impose upon sugar manufacturers the obligation of passing entries and paying duty - in short, to make it clear that the machinery clauses of the Excise Act 1901 are operative for the purposes of this measure. </para>

        <para>The Sugar Bounty Bill provides for the payment to the growers of the amount by which the average rate of Excise per ton of cane or beet exceeds the average rate of bounty per ton of cane or beet for the cane or beet delivered this season prior to the repeal of the Excise and bounty, so as to give the growers the full benefit of the abolition of the Excise and bounty as from the beginning of the season. Clause 2 provides for the payment of a bounty to every grower of whitegrown sugar on all cane delivered for manufacture between 1st May and 26th July, and on all beet delivered for manufacture between 1st January and 26th July. Under clause 3 the bounty is not payable to a grower in cases where the Minister is of the opinion that bounty would not have been payable under the Sugar Bounty Act 1905-12 if that Act had not been repealed. The rates of bounty are - For cane, 2s. 2d. per ton; for beet, 2s. per ton. </para>
        <para>That is a brief explanation of the provisions of the Bills, and in Committee it can be elaborated, if necessary. I think I have shown that the Government did all that was necessary, and acted fairly in the matter. The statements that we ran the risk&#39; of losing the money have no foundation. Even supposing that those who have to pay the money were unwilling, and tried to get out of that obligation, there was always the reserve power of legislating to make them pay. I move the second reading of the Bill relating to the Excise duty. </para>

A great deal has been said during the last few weeks with respect to the obstructive tactics of the Opposition in the Senate. We have been told by the Prime Minister himself that the Opposition in the Senate is like a man ready, with a knife to do desperate deeds, if any legislation is brought here. </para>

Even a simple measure like the Audit Bill was not introduced into the Senate, although it could easily have been brought here, passed, and sent to another place. Many similar Bills could have been introduced here, expedited, and sent to the House of Representatives, and would, no doubt, have readily been passed there. Nothing of that kind has been done, and consequently no- Minister, no supporter of the Government in the Senate, no supporter of the Government outside of Parliament, has any right to reflect in the slightest degree with respect to the conduct of the Oppo sition here regarding the business of the country. </para>

              <para>- Two principles are contained in this Bill. To one of them I do not think the Government will get any serious opposition from this side. I refer to clause 2, which provides that&#39;, in the future, the Treasurer shall, by warrant, have power to pay for services rendered to the- Commonwealth during the month of July. The Bill was brought in to another place as a matter of urgency. It was brought in after the real necessity, so- far as&#34; this financial year is concerned, had passed away. The month of July was passed and gone before the Bill1 coii&#39;ld have come into operation. It was to provide for inconveniences such as have been experienced in past years with respect to.the business of this Parliament. We have often been compelled to meet- much sooner than the business of the country&#34; made it really necessary in order to pass Supply early in July, so that no inconvenience should be suffered by the public servants-, or the caterers- for puhlitf requirements. This is a- piece of legislation which, to my mind, is only extending in one respect the term of the- financial year from the 30th June to 31st- July. Until the 30th June of next year, there will be no necessity for the Bill to come into operation. Even by legislation before the close of this session, we could ma&#39;ke an appropriation for the month of July of- next year. But if the proposed&#39; amendment of the- Audit Act is carried, there will- be no necessity for any provision of that kind to be made. </para>

              <para>- It, is like most of- the- legislation I have heard of coming  from any non-committal Government. It is neither worthy of serious consideration nor of serious opposition, and the seriousness of it to the public is of no consequence, for they are not affected to any great extent. The next portion of the Bill, however, presents rather a different aspect to me, and, I believe, to the whole of the senators on this side. It has been indicated by the Treasurer that the purpose of claus&#169; 3 is to empower a regulation to be made under the Audit Act to enable the Governor or the AuditorGeneral, or some undefined authority, to bring into existence a Supply and Tender Board. I do not think that any honorable senator on this side has any serious objection to such an institution. Most of the States have, in connexion with supplies and for contract purposes, Supply and Tender Boards. There are two ways in which such a board can be formed - by regulation, or by enactment. As regards the Commonwealth, to my mind, the proper method of creating a Supply and Tender Board is by a special Bill. Seeing that there was no objection, I do not see why the Government&#39; should not. have adopted that method of carrying out the intention embodied in this Bill. If honorable senators will turn to the Audit Act, and examine the functions and the powers with which the Auditor-General is clothed, and can clothe his officers, they will see that it is all for the purpose of looking after the revenue and the expenditure of the Commonwealth Department by Department. </para>

              <para>- If, as is proposed in this Bill, a regulation were made for the creation of a Supply and Tender Board under the Audit Act, it would be under the Auditor-General, and he and his officers would audit the accounts and transactions of a body constituted under the. Act, under which they themselves existed. I think that honorable senators ought to see the inconsistency of such a position. Section 45 of the Audit Act sets out the work of the Auditor-General. The purposes for which he and his officers are appointed are shown to be to look after the financial affairs of the Commonwealth, to see that the accounts and books are properly kept, that all expenditure has been authorized by Parliament, and that every item of revenue is faithfully and honestly collected. The Audit Act was passed to define those duties. </para>

              <para>- Any Bill on the subject is in order that Parliament, chooses to pass. But whether it is wisefor Parliament to permit such actions asmight be carried out by any Government under this Bill is entirely another ques-tion. If honorable senators will alsolook at section 71 of the Audit Act they will see that it embodies the power tomake regulations. Every one of the existing powers contained in paragraphs <inline font-style="italic">a</inline> to e of section 71, sub-section 1, dealswith the principles laid down in section 45. This Bill is for the purpose of glv, ing a further power under section 71. It proposes to insert paragraph /, enabling regulations to be made affectingthe purchase, custody, control, and issueof public stores. What in the name of wonder has that to do with auditing ? What has it to do with the Auditor-General and his officers ? It may have to do with the establishment of another Department, of the Commonwealth Service? It may have to do with Home Affairs. But it cannot have anything to do with auditing. Therefore, clause 3 of the Bill will meet with the opposition of every honorable senator on this side, and not because we wish to prevent the Government from calling into existence a Supply and&#34; Tender Board, as I think it would be a good thing in the interests of the Commonwealth to have a board of such a character.. There may be in the various Departments some amount of overlapping in the purchase of goods and materiaL It might be -advantageous to have the purchase of all stores controlled by one board. That would obviate overlapping. A Supply and Tender Board might make for greater expedition, efficiency, and economy. If a Bill for that purpose were brought down by this or &#34;any other Government I am sure that every honorable senator on this side would give it serious consideration. But we shall do all we can to prevent such an anomaly as the establishment of such a board by regulations made under an Audit Act. </para>

            <para>- As far as the first part of this Bill is concerned it may be termed a measure to extend the financial year of the Commonwealth to thirteen months instead of twelve. A little experience of  administration will show that there&#39; is a necessity for that, in view of the fact that this is a Parliament which has to be brought together from the four corners of a great country like Australia. No reasonable person can object to that portion of the Bill. But I intend to back up <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor</inline> in his opposition to the establishment of a Supply and Tender Board in such a manner, and in such a measure, as is here proposed. Such a board may or may not be a good thing to establish, but it ought not to be instituted by regulation. I can imagine, how <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Clemons</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> if they were on this side of the Chamber would protest against &#39;the proposal to establish a Supply and Tender Board under cover of regulations having nothing whatever to do with auditing. The Auditor-General has been deliberately set apart by Parliament from the administrative affairs of the Commonwealth. It is his duty to watch over the expenditure of public funds. The duties of a Supply and Tender Board would be concerned with administration. The board would be continually in touch with, the administrative Departments of the Commonwealth. It would have to be if it was to fulfil its purpose. </para>

              <para>- I am well aware that the Governor-General in Council will have to make the regulations, and that the officers will have to be appointed by the Public Service Commissioner; but I do think that an important matter of administration of this character should not be dealt with by regulation. It should be kept entirely separate from the Audit Act, because the Audit Act deals with a condition of things entirely subsequent to the affairs with which the Supply and Tender Board willbe concerned. The board will have to deal with the purchase, custody, and control of stores, whereas the Audit Act deals entirely with a time after the purchase has been completed, and after control has been exercised. I wish it to be understood that I am not opposed to the creation of a Supply and Tender Board, but I am not prepared to give any Government power merely by regulation to bring such a board into existence. </para>

            <para>. - I do not suppose that honorable senators opposite wish to reject clause 3. without clearly understanding what they are doing. I venture to- say that they are under a good deal of misapprehension with regard to it. I wish to explain exactly what is meant by the clause. Honorable senators have asked what the Auditor-General has to do with stores. I remind the Committee that the Auditor-General has a duty with regard to stores, just as he has with regard to funds. </para>

              <para>- One of the preliminary objections to the clause was made on that ground. I can pass that by. The next objection is that the clause is not in conformity with the Audit Act. It was <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor</inline> who, in objecting to the clause, endeavoured, to convince honorable senators in, his speech on the second reading of the Bill that this is an entirely inappropriate clause for an Audit Bill. If the honorable senator&#39;s contention on that point is sound, two of the most important sections of the existing Audit Act come entirely within his description, and should not be included in that Act. If those sections are properly included in the Audit Act, clause 3 is a fit and proper clause in a Bill amending the Audit Act. I am glad that I need not labour that point. </para>

              <para>-What is the difference ? If the honorable senator had read the sections of the Audit Act to which I have referred, he would know that the phraseology is almost identical with that of clause 3 of this Bill. I do not think that he can for a moment contend that there is anything in the wording of this clause inappropriate to an Audit -Bill, in so far as it describes certain operations. The next criticism was that it was the intention under this Bill that the Auditor-General should be invested with a certain power over Supply and Tender Boards. There is nothing in the Bill to indicate that there is anything in the mind of the Government which would justify &#39;the suspicion expressed on the other side. </para>

              <para>- Let me explain precisely what there is in it. There is nothing in the clause which in any way gives the Auditor-General any of the powers suggested. The clause prescribes certain conditions which must be complied with before the Auditor-General may pass, certain accounts, and especially accounts concerning- stores. It is. a method which Parliament, in my opinion, ought to adopt of prescribing clearly to the Auditor-General what he must do - when he is justified in passing any accounts, with respect to stores, and when he is not justified in doing so. </para>

May I remind Senators McGregor and Pearce that in the Commonwealth to-day we have practically- in operation Tender and Supply Boards. Within the last few years the operations of the Commonwealth have very largely increased, and we engage in very large transactions for the purchase of goods and the supply of stores, and for this purpose we are using various Tender and Supply Boards ofthe different States. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> is aware that that is exactly the position. We require to give some sort of Federal status to these Tender and Supply Boards which to-day are used by us occasionally, but which are really under the control of the State Governments. </para>

              <para>- No, the clause is not in the wrong place. Let me remind the honorable senator that a similar provision appears in several of the State Acts. I assure him that, in my opinion, there could be no Bill in which this clause could be more appropriately included than an Audit Bill. </para>

After consultation, we were deliberately of the opinion that this is an appropriate provision to introduce in an amendment of the Audit Act. I have explained that in ;the original Audit Act exactly similar provisions to clause 3 of this Bill will be found in sections 45 and 71.

              <para>- They do not. It is not merely the business of the AuditorGeneral to look at a set of figures, but also to look at the goods, and see that they correspond with the payments made for them. In other words, it should be hia duty to audit stock. What we prescribe is that the Auditor-General shall be told by regulations, which will have to be submitted to Parliament, the proper method to audit goods as well as money, to ascertain whether stocks correspond with accounts of purchases and issues. That is the main object of this clause. </para>

              <para>- No; not so far as the Auditor-General is concerned. I have admitted that one of the objects of the clause is to provide, where it may seem desirable, Federal Tender and Supply Boards to take the place of the State Tender and Supply Boards which we now make use of. We have passed several Acts the chief object of which was to gradually acquire direct control of State facilities and services which we previously used. There is no other purpose in this Bill, so far. as Tender and Supply Boards now being used are concerned, except that, by way of regulation, we give the Federal Parliament, which appropriates the money, an opportunity, when and where it seems desirable, to deal with the purchase and supply of goods directly through its own servants. </para>

              <para>- I have no wish to conceal anything. I have taken up the different points urged against tlie clause by honorable senators opposite, and have done my best to meet them. The final objection to the provision is that I have complained before now of legislation by regulation. As honorable senators are aware, I sat on the other side in this Chamber for a very long time, and I admit that I often objected to legislation by regulation; but I do not think that it is possible to introduce into a Bill everything that is necessary to meet this particular provision. If this clause is agreed to, it will have to be given effect very largely by way of regulation. It is said that this is not the kind of Bill in which such a clause should be included, but if it were included in any other Bill we would have to take advantage of the right to make regulations to give effect to it. What are regulations? Honorable senators are afforded abundant opportunity to check them, and there is plenty of vigilance in the numbers I see opposite to insure that any regulation which this Government may lay upon the table of the Senate will be closely scrutinized. If we pass this Bill to-day, honorable senators opposite will not incur any risk whatever - assuming that they exercise the slightest vigilance - of anything being done in connexion with the auditing of public accounts, or the constitution of Supply and Tender Boards to which they may object. </para>

Thus, I shall then be called upon to meet precisely the same contention that I &#39;have to meet to-day. &#34;Unless we take to ourselves power under this Bill to frame regulations - regulations which will always be under the supervision of the Senate - we cannot possibly provide for all contingencies that may arise. Let me instance the Postal Department or the Defence Department. I venture to say that every honorable senator who knows the enormous expenditure which has been going on in those Departments year after year will recognise that it is quite possible that much good may be accomplished by establishing in connexion with each of them a Supply and Tender Board. </para>

              <para>- Under the Audit Act, it is impossible to foresee all the contingencies which may arise. It may be that we may wish to establish our own Supply and Tender Board, or it may be that we may want to set up a special Supply and Tender Board to deal with the supply of stores for the PostmasterGeneral&#39;s Department all over Australia, or only in one State, and the same remark is applicable to the Defence Department. In the absence of that amount of elasticity which is conferred by regulations, it is impossible to provide for all contingencies that may arise from time to time. If honorable senators think it is wise that we should have power to deal with these matters, if they think it prudent to lay down strict conditions which must be complied with before , the Auditor-General is empowered to pass accounts, and if they are of opinion that we should have Supply and Tender Boards in various States and&#34; for various Departments, they ought to agree to this clause. I hope that the opposition to it will not be persisted in. The Bill is one which ought to commend itself to honor able senators opposite, and I did not think it would be necessary for me to speak upon it at such length in Committee. </para>

            <para>. - I am sorry that we have to come into conflict with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Clemons</inline> over this clause. But all that lie lias said regarding the duties and authority of the Auditor-General is already provided for under section 45 of the Audit Act. That section provides for the inspection and audit of books and accounts. It also makes provision for the audit of goods and material with a view to determining what quantity of stores has been purchased, what quantity has been used, and what quantity still remains in stock. I repeat that these things are all provided for in the Audit Act at the present time. That being so, if there is any intention  on the part of this Government, or of any other Government, to establish a permanent Supply and Tender Board or Supply and Tender Boards, or provisional Supply and Tender Boards, the method of establishing those bodies should be clearly defined-&#39; in a separate- Bill. The powers of such bodies should be prescribed, the number of persons composing them should be stated, and .their duties&#39; should be specified. Then, if there be anything of which we can conceive which has not been set out in such a measure, provision should be made to cover it by regulations. But to empower the Government to institute Supply and Tender Boards in the different &#39; States by means of regulation is too vague a power to embody in an amending -Bill .such as that which is now before us. That is the reason why I am opposed to the clause. If a separate Bill be introduced, providing for the creation of a- Supply and Tender Board, or for supplementary Supply and Tender Boards, and the authority of those boards is clearly defined, it will receive the serious consideration of members of the Opposition, and I have not the slightest doubt that it will be passed, providing that it properly safeguards the public interests. I am opposed to this clause because it confers an undefined power. It is all very well for <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Clemons</inline> to argue that we shall have an opportunity of watching the actions of the Government, and of closely scrutinizing any regulations which they may frame. But I would point out to him that a Labour Government may again be in power in the near future, and if only a few members of the party opposite were present, when such regulations were tabled, he will readily see that effect might be given to very injurious regulations. If a Bill is to be passed constituting Supply and Tender Boards, we ought to know exactly the powers which it confers, and we should then have a better opportunity of watching any regulations which might bo framed under it than we can possibly have under a Bill of this description. </para>

I am very sorry to say that it is clearer to me now than it was previously that the clause under consideration requires to be struck out. What, is evidently the intention of the Government should be incorporated in a separate Bill. Nobody can read this clause without concluding that the powers sought to be conveyed by it are rather vague and ambiguous. Under it, the Auditor-General would be in a position, after a Supply and Tender Board had been constituted, to give instructions as to where purchases of materials should be made. </para>

In view of the growth of Commonwealth expenditure, and particularly of the expenditure of the Defence Department, I should welcome any noncontentious piece of legislation which was designed to protect the public interest.

              <para>- Whether we understand the intention of the Government or not, there can be no misunderstanding what is the contention of the Opposition. Several speakers on this side have said that they are not against the idea of creating a body to control the purchase of Government supplies, but that it ought to be constituted under a special measure, not under cover of an Audit Bill. The Audit Act is intended for quite another purpose, and that is to see that goods for the Government are purchased properly, and not to give power to a Department to purchase goods. I agree with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor</inline> and others that a great deal of economy may result from the appointment of a Supply and Tender Board, but we do not want to see a clause passed empowering a regulation to be made to create such a body. I know that the Post and Telegraph Act would be greatly improved if such a power were given to the PostmasterGeneral. At present, the purchase of stores for&#39; the Post and Telegraph Department is in the hands of the Home Affairs Department. We have had a good deal of complaint against the Home Affairs Department as regards the roundabout way in which . things have to be done. To explain the system: the Home Affairs Department has to be notified by the Post and Telegraph Department that the latter wants certain stores, and then a certain amount of red-tape has to be indulged in before the business is actually done. It may be that the Post and Telegraph Department could better control the purchase of its own stores. If we had . a proposal to amend the Post and Telegraph Act to enable the Department to purchase its necessary supplies, I do not know but that it would be accepted on this side. But to ask us to amend the Audit Act for that purpose is quite another proposition. I object to accept the assurance of the Minister that a regulation must be published and issued to honorable senators before any action can be taken. That, to my mind, is a very dangerous way of proceeding, because in ordinary circumstances honorable senators have quite enough to read in the shape of Bills and other papers without closely scrutinizing the hundred and one regulations which are always being distributed. I, for one,  seldom read a regulation, simply . because I have not the time. If power is given in this clause to the Government to make an important regulation under which they may create a Supply and Tender Board, the regulation may escape the scrutiny of any honorable senator. The matter is too important to be dealt with without due consideration. If we believe in the principle of a Supply and Tender Board, let it be embodied in a separate measure, and dealt with on its merits, but do not let such a body be brought into existence under a regulation. I shall vote against the clause. </para>

              <para>- That is only a subterfuge on the part of the Minister to get away from the main point at issue. The Supply and Tender Board will be directly under the Department of the Auditor-General, and to say that he will not purchase any goods is to state only half the truth. He certainly will not go personally to make a purchase, but it will be made under his Department, and he will audit the accounts of his departmental purchases. </para>

              <para>- The position whichthe honorable senator was trying to provewas that, because there is power in the clause to overlook certain things, therefore there is power to make a certain regulation, and that will bring the Supply and Tender Board into operation, and the Auditor-General will not be in it. That officer will be there all the time. He will be the head and chief offender if any wrong is committed. There will be no one to supervise what he has done. The proposal is entirely foreign to an Audit Bill, because it has to do with commerce. The Government might very reasonably ask the Senate to constitute a Supply and Tender Board. The Minister has given a very strong reason why such a Board should exist. He has shown unmistakably that there is overlapping. He has shown that not only will a Supply and Tender Board be more efficient, more economical, and more just, but that to establish the board under a regulation is the most disastrous thing which could be projected. As an old politician, he must know that legislation by regulation is not only the most roundabout and red-tape way of proceeding, but the most dangerous and ineffective way. </para>

              <para>- The Minister would say it were the political conditions reversed. I can quite understand how things appeal to him now. We are reasoning, not against the institution of a Supply and Tender Board <inline font-style="italic">per se,</inline> but against&#39; its creation by an insidious method. There is nothing clear or definite as to how much power is to be taken, the way in which the board is to be conducted, or how it is to be controlled. But we have simply a bald statement that, under cover of the clause, such a body is to be established. I think that we might expect the Government to be honest enough to stand out in the daylight and show us how much they intend to do, what powers they want to take, how many persons will constitute the proposed board, and under what law it will operate. But they want to leave it entirely to the Auditor-General. </para>

              <para>- All I can say is that in the honorable senator&#39;s secondreading speech, and in the speeches made elsewhere, the Government have failed in their duty in not clearly stating what is the purpose of the clause, and the radius within which it is intended to operate. We are entitled to that information, and until it is given, I intend to vote against the clause. </para>

Let me first point out what effect the regulations will, have, and how they are intended to be brought into existence. Section 71 of the Audit Act provides that regulations may be made by the Government not inconsistent  with the provisions of the Act.

              <para>- Let us assume for the sake of argument that the Act on which the regulation has to be founded does not give the power to appoint a Supply and Tender Board. Then honorable senators need not be alarmed about the regulation which may be made, because it must be consistent with the Act. Honorable senatorson the other side say that this Bill wilt empower the Auditor-General to deal with the purchase of the whole of the stores, but that is not so. It does not provide that the regulations are only to be administered by the Auditor-General, but assuming that it is legal under the Act to create a Supply and Tender Board, this provision gives power to the GovernorGeneral to make regulations to provide for the details in connexion with such ari appointment. Who would appoint theboard? It would not be the Auditor-. General. Who would make the regulations ? </para>

          <para class="block">It would not be the Auditor-General. The appointment would be made by the Executive Council, and the regulations would indicate  the methods in which the appointments were to be made. I think that when honorable senators come to look at the matter in that light, they will see at once that there is no great danger to be feared. Any regulations will have to be laid on the table of the Senate, and it will be open to either House of the Parliament to dissent from a regulation, and so put it on one side. </para>

In that way honorable senators will know what is being done by the board. Assume, for the sake of argument, that we appoint a Supply and Tender Board, apart from the Audit Act altogether, and say that all purchases are to be made under special conditions. Assume that some purchases are not made under those conditions. Has the AuditorGeneral authority to call attention to that fact if he is not empowered under the Audit Act? I think he would be going beyond his duties. He would be confronted by the position that the Government had appointed the Supply and Tender Board, and that he was not instructed to supervise the way it carried out its duties. </para>

              <para>- It is true that under paragraphs <inline font-style="italic">d</inline> and <inline font-style="italic">e</inline> of that section the Auditor-General has to obtain particularsof supplies purchased. But now it is proposed to enable regulations to be made dealing distinctly with the purchasing of goods. The Bill does not enable the Auditor-General to make the regulations. Suppose the Government were to appoint a Supply and Tender Board to-morrow. Unless there were a regulation, the AuditorGeneral would be unable to point out how the board carried out its duties. He would have no power to comment upon whether things were done rightly orwrongly. The regulations made under this provision would amplify his powers. Parliament appoints an Auditor-General for the protection of the public against possible maladministration of public funds by Ministers or their officers. </para>

              <para>- Practice is made by what Parliament puts into our Acts. We often have to take a rough-and-ready means of attaining a desirable object, although we might prefer to have legislation passed in the most perfect form imaginable. I believe that we shall be conserving the interests of the public by agreeing to a provision under which we shall obtain a stronger control over the expenditure of public money than we have had hitherto. I believe that it has become necessary to have a check of this kind. Honorable senators opposite should not turn down the proposition, even though they may think that it would be more desirable to deal with the matter by a special Act of Parliament. In my judgment, it is not possible to do any harm to public affairs by accepting a provision enabling a Supply and Tender Board to be established departmentally. On the contrary, it will enable a better control to be exercised over public expenditure. </para>

First of all, I put it seriously to the Committee that, whatever else this clause does, it restricts the powers of Ministers. There is no question of that. It restricts Ministers in the power of purchasing goods and spending money. If honorable senators opposite oppose it on that ground, they must do so with the full knowledge of what they are doing.

We have indicated clearly that we think it desirable that there should be closer supervision by a special authority in regard to the control and purchase of stores! -We say, further, that the regulation should be so framed that the Auditor-General himself will see that the purchasing was carried on under conditions which make for the financial safety of the Commonwealth. </para>

              <para>- I do not know why we should. Even if we did, it would have to be a Bill to amend the Audit Act. We should have to import into it a power for the Auditor-General to check the purchase and control of stores. He would have to see to it that the quantity of stores balanced the money expended. That is a necessary part of the AuditorGeneral&#39;s duties. Somebody said something just now to the effect that under the Audit Act we already have power to issue regulations. But we could not do all that is desired under the present Act. We desire to add words giving power to make regulations dealing with the purchase, control, and issue of public stores. This power is wanted to make the Bill useful. This ought net to be regarded as a party matter. It makes for an improvement in our methods in handling, purchasing, and controlling stores. We think it a right and proper thing that the Auditor- General should be called in for such a purpose. </para>

              <para>- He would not have to purchase. The name of the Auditor-General does not appear in section 71 at all. He has nothing to do with purchasing. The honorable senator might just as well say that power is given to the Governor-General, or to the manager of the Commonwealth Bank to purchase. We are not seeking to enable the AuditorGeneral to purchase a thing. The reason it is proposed to include it in the Audit Act is that we want the Auditor-General to check purchases, and see that proper conditions are complied with in the buying and controlling of stores. If the Committee reject this clause, the effectwill be to retain in the hands of Ministers a power which, in my opinion, it is most desirable should be exercised by a more expert person. I say that to pass this clause will be to restrict the power of Ministers, and to secure for the Commonwealth proper control over the purchase and issue of stores by means of the Auditor-General. With regard to the purchase of stores, a regulation is desirable in order that, possibly, we may have small, and, perhaps, temporary departmental boards for the purchase of goods of which they have expert knowledge. No one who has been a Minister of the Crown will deny that Ministers are called upon at times to purchase tilings which they are not competent or well qualified to purchase. Some goods are required for a Department, at times, of which even the officers of the Department are not the best judges in the interests of the Commonwealth. If honorable senators pass this clause, the Federal Government will be given power to avail themselves -of expert assistance in these matters, and the work of the Tender and Supply Boards will be checked from A to Z by the Attorney-General. </para>

              <para>- In clause 3 of this Bill, the Government are asking for no power inconsistent with the provisions of the Audit Act. It is intended only to make more clear the power of the AuditorGeneral in regard to the purchase of goods. He has already a general power of veto and control given him in the words of paragraph <inline font-style="italic">d</inline> of section 45, requiring him to ascertain whether any person in the Public Service has requisitioned for or obtained any stores in excess of the reasonable requirements of his office. The institution of a Supply and Tender Board by virtue of clause 3 of this Bill, which it is intended shall be a part of section 71 of the Audit Act dealing with the framing of regulations, will be distinctly complementary to the powers already exercised by the AuditorGeneral, and will in no way derogate from those powers. If such a board were set up under this clause, no member of the Committee could contend that anything of a pernicious nature had been inaugurated. The object of the clause is merely to particularize, by way of regulation, a power already vested in the Auditor-General in general terms by section 45 of the Audit Act. I support the clause as it stands. </para>

As was stated by a Minister in another place, if this clause be passed, it is the intention of the Government to constitute a Public Supply and Tender Board. That will be a most important body, charged with the function of buying stores and materials for the Government in a general way. A body possessing such functions should be appointed under a measure dealing with that matter alone. </para>

              <para>- I am aware that purchases are made through State Supply and Tender Boards, and that in some cases a competent official is authorized to purchase for a particular Department, and is, of course, held responsible for what he does. The object of this clause must be to confer some power which is not provided for under the Audit Act as it at present exists. But the Act as it stands gives ample powers to protect the revenue, so far as one who is not a lawyer can judge. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bakhap</inline> has referred us to paragraph <inline font-style="italic">&#34;d</inline> of section 45, which requires the Auditor-General to ascertain whether an officer has requisitioned for goods in excess of the requirements of his office. </para>

        <para class="block">I may be permitted to explain for the information of new members of the Senate the reason why this motion is submitted, because in the lack of such an explanation it may strike them as rather peculiar. In the first place, I desire to apologize to the Printing Committee, because the printing of these papers would, under ordinary circumstances, automatically have passed to it. But, as a matter of fact, this motion represents the continuance of a custom which has grown up here during the last few years - a custom which lias for its object the bringing of the Budget-papers and Estimates before members of the Senate at an earlier period than in the ordinary course of events they would have an opportunity of considering them. The Estimates - as honorable senators know - come before the Senate in- the form of an Appropriation Bill, and owing to the length of time which must elapse before that measure can reach this Chamber, the information contained in the Estimates and Budgetpapers is necessarily somewhat stale. Some years ago, therefore, it was decided that in order to give, honorable senators an opportunity of taking these matters into their consideration at an earlier stage than is provided by the Appropriation Bill, a motion similar to that which I have moved should be submitted. But I venture on this occasion to depart from the practice which was adopted by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor,</inline> and, I believe, by his predecessor in office, of making a speech&#39; upon the Budget itself in submitting this motion. I think that a more appropriate time for the delivery of such a speech is when the Appropriation Bill is engaging our attention. So far as I am concerned, therefore, I venture to intimate thafT while I move this motion in order to place before honorable senators all that is contained in the Budget and the Estimates, I shall defer any statement that I may have to make upon those matters until the Appropriation Bill is before us. </para>

          <para>. - Perhaps I have been the unwitting cause of a little amusement in the chamber. I had no intention of allowing this opportunity to pass without referring to a matter of vital importance to the State I represent. I could have been in my place a few moments ago, but I thought that, following the custom, the Minister in charge of an important motion would have spoken longer than he did to-night. The only question to which I wish to address myself is one of paramount importance to Tasmania. In fact, I do not know of any question that has come before the Senate for some years which has been of greater importance to Tasmania than that of the contract for the carriage of mails between the State and the mainland. My reason for speaking to-night after the question was so thoroughly threshed out here at our last sitting is that there may yet be time for the Government to make better conditions in the interests of the people of Tasmania than will be the case if the agreement, as outlined by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Clemons,</inline> is adhered to. I know that it is of no use to discuss the question of whether the Government should have adopted a resolution carried by the Senate in favour of a Commonwealth owned and operated line of steamers. That question has been thoroughly threshed out here. A motion has been carried in two successive sessions, but we know that the present Government are opposed to State activities in that direction, or, if not opposed to them, prefer private enterprise in that regard. I do not intend to discuss the principle. There have been opportunities for that purpose in the past, and there will be similar opportunities in the future. Seeing that the Government, through their representative here in charge of the Post and Telegraph Department - I refer to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Clemons</inline> - has said that they have definitely decided on a certain line of policy, I am going to put it to the representative of Tasmania, who happens to be the representative of the Government here, that it is not yet too late, perhaps, if they use all their influence, to make a couple of alterations in the agreement he outlined. The alterations of the agreement, which I think might still be secured to the immense benefit of Tasmania, and incidentally to the benefit of the mainland are, firstly, a reduction in the present fares andfreights, and, secondly, an increase in the time in which the extra steamer, during the summer months, is to be run. My reason for referring to the matter tonight is that at any moment the agreement may be signed. I put it to the representative of the Government whether it is not worth their while to try to still further improve the agreement on the lines I have indicated. As it stands, we are to have three boats a week between Launceston and Melbourne all the year round, just as we have now, so that does not secure any very great advantage. </para>

            <para>- That does not matter. I candidly admit that there is to be a big improvement, in the class of boats, but still in the winter months - which causes all the grumbling in Tasmania - we have three boats a week leaving Melbourne and Launceston, and two boats a week leaving Melbourne and Burnie. The new agreement lays it down that there must be another vessel of the <inline font-style="italic">Loongana</inline> type to take the place of the obsolete <inline font-style="italic">Rotomahana</inline> during the winter months. At present the <inline font-style="italic">Loongana</inline> does all the running through the summer months. Under the new agreement there will be very little improvement in the number of mails per week. </para>

        <para class="block">I submit that the fares and freights were quite high enough prior to the increase which was made only a few months ago, and that the Government should attempt to get the combine to agree to reduce the fares and freights, particularly the fares, to the standard of a few months ago - that is, before the last increase of 15 per cent, was made. I am sure that I have <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bakhap&#39;s</inline> approval of that suggestion, because he was  Chairman  . of a Select Committee appointed by the Tasmanian House of Assembly only last year. Its report, which was presented on the 12th  December, contains a number of paragraphs which stress the fact that Tasmania is suffering very largely because of her geographical isolation from the other States, and that it badly requires an improved mail service. One paragraph reads as follows - </para>
        <quote>
          <para>Freights and fares between Tasmania and the mainland have been markedly and. substantially reduced during the last quarter of a century; but recently passenger fares have been increased&#39; </para>
        </quote>
        <para>That was prior to the 12th December of last year - and it is. probable that they are, nowadays, too high to permit of the tourist traffic to Tasmania attaining its full stature. </para>
        <para>That was the opinion expressed by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bakhap</inline> last year. If the Select Committee unanimously decided, as the honorable senator has informed me, that the charges were then so high that the tourist traffic, which means a great deal to Tasmania, would&#39; not attain its full stature last year, what chance has it to get the tourist traffic it ought to get, or would get, seeing that there has been a further increase of 15 per cent, in the fares since the date of the report ? That is, I think, a very strong point in favour of my argument that the Government should at least make one more attempt before the PostmasterGeneral signs the agreement tying Tasmania up to the combine for the next seven years under the present extortionate charges. </para>

            <para>- I do not know that I need pick my words. It is generally held by those who ought to know better than I do that the charges since that increase of 15 per cent, are rather extortionate. I might quote the chief newspapers in Tasmania, which certainly by no stretch of imagination can be said to have any leaning towards the Labour party. They are bitterly opposed to us, but for a long time past they have held that the charges are too high. When the increase was made a few months ago, at about the time of the small-pox outbreak in Sydney, the <inline font-style="italic">Launceston Examiner</inline> stated in its leading columns that it was a remarkable increase to make. This newspaper said - </para>

        <quote>
          <para>Merchants and manufacturers are complaining of the further increase in Inter-State freights by the shipping companies. In the past the practice has been to make a small advance of 5 per cent, or less, but this latest jump is one of 15 per cent., making a total of 20 per cent, in the last six months. Business men regard the increase with alarm, and state that it will seriously affect the Inter-State trade. Even if it does not lead to the curtailment of imports and exports it will necessitate higher prices being charged for goods with a corresponding upward tendency in the cost of living. </para>

        <para>In another part of the article it was stated - </para>
        <quote>
          <para>The shipping companies said that the advance has &#39;been necessary because many vessels are running practically empty, owing to the outbreak of small-pox, but they do not say that these rates will be reduced when the conditions again become normal. It also seems peculiar that the advanced rates apply, not to cargo shipped on vessels trading to the infected city, but to goods consigned to any port in Australia from Geraldton to Cairns. </para>
        </quote>
        <para class="block">That passage was quoted in the Senate a few weeks ago by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Long,</inline> but it 1 is worth while to repeat it. Here is a newspaper which is always barracking for private enterprise as against Commonwealthowned enterprise. Yet it says deliberately that this total increase of 20 per cent, during the last six months is not fair to Tasmania. </para>

            <para>- I quote the <inline font-style="italic">Launceston Examiner</inline> as the authority. We know, at all events, that there was an increase of 15 per cent. I submit that if the charges can be brought down under this agreement to the level of those which existed before the last increase of 15 per cent., we should, at any rate, be able to feel that we had done something for Tasmania. I am quite satisfied that the representative of the Government would like to do that if he could. </para>

            <para>- I believe that I should be on pretty sound ground if I advocated the payment of even a larger subsidy for the purpose of securing a reduction in freights and charges. That, however, opens up a bigger question. How absurd it is for the Government, having such a splendid chance in its hands, to throw away that chance simply because it will not under any circumstances give encouragement to Commonwealth enterprise. There, is no other way of linking Tasmania to the mainland than by a steam-ship service. There is no possibility of bringing other steamers into the field as long as the Combine has a monopoly of the trade.. I would even go to the length of advocating a further increase of the subsidy in order to - obtain a service with rates more commensurate with the services rendered. </para>

            <para>- I do not know that other States are called upon to pay for the carriage of their mails over State railways. But it all comes back to the question that the Government has- a blind and foolish opposition to a Commonwealthowned service, simply because that amounts to State Socialism. Seeing that the Government are determined to do nothing but pay a subsidy to private enterprise, I maintain that they should hold back the signing of the contract until further representations have been received from Tasmania. Two questions were asked by Tasmanian senators this afternoon on the subject. In reply to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ready,</inline> the Minister said that he did not think it advisable to hold back the signing of the contract until repre- 1 sentations were received from Chambers of Commerce; and, in reply to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator</inline></para>

            <para>- It is a wellknown fact that merchants in all parts of Tasmania consider that freights and passenger fares are too high. The tourist traffic has developed largely in recent years, and it is hoped will go on developing. But that traffic certainly will not develop as it ought to do unless we do something reasonable in the matter of reducing fares. When the charges were 15 per cent, less than they are to-day, the Parliamentary Committee reported that the tourist traffic had no chance of attaining its full dimensions under conditions then existing. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Clemons</inline> has asked me to read a letter received from the Chamber of Commerce.

              <para>- I have stressed the opinion of prominent Tasmanians that the tourist traffic ought to be encouraged. The development of it is a very important question in Tasmania. It is proposed, under the new contract, that there shall be three boats per week leaving Melbourne, and three leaving Launceston, and two boats per week leaving Burnie, and two leaving Melbourne for Burnie, all the year round, and that during two months of the year, to cater for tourist traffic, there shall be an extra boat between Melbourne and Launceston running by way of Burnie. The extra boat is to be of the <inline font-style="italic">Loongana</inline> type, but she is only to run two months out of the  twelve. That is the one improvement which the new agreement gives to Tasmania. </para>

              <para>- I do not see why the company should have any objection to being bound under the contract to run the extra boats for four months instead of two, seeing that the Commonwealth is to be bound for seven years to pay a subsidy of &#163;15,000 instead of &#163;13,000, as at present. If the two alterations I suggest could be made before the agreement is signed, the result would be very beneficial to Tasmania. I appeal to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Clemons,</inline> as a representative of that State, to make a . still further effort to induce the company to make these alterations. I say that even if they were made, the Government would still be entering into a very bad bargain in the interests of Tasmania, as compared with the position of affairs which would be brought about if the service were conducted by a Commonwealth-owned line of steamers. It is of no use to labour that point, because the Government are determined in their opposition to that proposal. I am afraid that they arrived at the determination to resist that proposal because they felt that, long before the proposed contract with the Union Steam-ship Company expires, there will be a Government in power in the Commonwealth who will favour the establishment of a Commonwealth-owned line of steamers. If such a Government came into power within the next two years, they would find their hands tied in this matter by the fact that this agreement with the Union Steam-ship Company would still have five years to run, and they would be unable to devote the subsidy which will have to be paid to the Union Steam-ship Company under the agreement to meet the expense of carrying the mails on their own steamers. </para>

              <para>- We know that the late Government proposed big things, and did them, and were pilloried for them all over Australia during the elections. If they had added this to the list of their big national achievements, they would have been pilloried to a greater extent than they were. Owing to the fact that they were not returned with a majority in another place, that policy of the late Government is dead until such time as the electors of Australia get another interval of sanity, as no doubt they will in the course of the next few years. When they are again returned to power, the Labour Government will have the establishment of a Commonwealth-owned line of steamers between Tasmania and the mainland as a part of their policy, but their hands will be tied by having to pay a subsidy of&#163;15,000 a year to the Union Steam-ship Company under the proposed agreement for a number of years. </para>

              <para>- I do not profess to quote the exact words of the answer given to a question put in the Senate, but the effect of it certainly was that the Government had no intention of reopening the matter. Still, wiser counsels prevailed, no doubt at the instigation of Tasmanian representatives who support the present Government, and an increase ia the grant -was -made. It is quite on the cards that, if the Government delay the signing of this contract until the re-- presentations referred to have been received from Tasmania, and the matter can be threshed out in another place, they may be able to induce the Shipping Combine to concede better  terms  than they are prepared to concede now. I hope that Tasmania will not be bound for seven years under the terms of the agreement as stated by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Clemons</inline> some three weeks ago. </para>

              <para>- Every one knows that the numbers were a foregone conclusion. With the strength enjoyed by the Opposition in this Chamber, Liberal senators may be regarded all the time as being in the net of the retiarius. It would not have mattered if the debate had been prolonged for a week; the result would have been the same. Had I thought it worth while, I might have analyzed the motion submitted by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ready.</inline> I could have shown how ingeniously it was drafted, and that it was designed to commit ali those who were in favour, in certain circumstances, of. a Commonwealth-owned service between Tasmania and the mainland to support a Commonwealth ownership of lines of steam-ships trading to the Old Country and elsewhere. Once an honorable senator voted for that motion, his vote could bo construed as lending support to the principle of Commonwealth - owned steamers, not merely trading between the States, but between the Commonwealth and all foreign countries. I am not one of those- who are frightened of the term &#34; Socialism.&#34; I regard all these matters which are termed &#34; Socialistic &#34; at times, from the point of view of expediency. As <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O&#39;Keefe</inline> has done me the honour to read from the report of a Committee of which I was  chairman,  I may be allowed to quote a little of that report, for which I was largely responsible. This is a very important matter. It is probably one of the practically live questions in&#34; Tasmania, and we can well understand that the people of that small State are geographically so isolated that the matter of communication with the larger </para>

          <para class="block">States of the mainland is of first im- *portance to them. It was in recognition of the existence of a great deal of feeling on this matter that the Tasmanian House of Assembly, at my instigation, consented to the appointment of a Select Committee to inquire into this very vexed and many-sided question. Honorable senators may run away with the idea that it is a matter which is capable of a very simple solution. But if men with judicial minds commence to investigate it, they will find that it is of a much more complex character than they had anticipated. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O&#39;Keefe</inline> is certainly right when he says that it is by no means a party question in Tasmania. It is a question of the first importance to the inhabitants of that State, irrespective of their political colour. The Select Committee, which was appointed, committed itself to the view which was put forward by the Honorable George Collins, a strong Liberal, who is responsible for a very great deal of good work in Tasmania. Indeed, he may well be regarded as the <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Henry</inline> Parkes of that State. The Committee reported - </para>
          <quote>
            <para>This point of view is best demonstrated by an illustration drawn from the evidence of the Honorable George Collins, in which the witness states, in effect, that if the slenderest isthmian connexion existed between Tasmania and Vic toria, long ere this a railway would have been constructed to connect the two communities, and that a train would leave Launceston and Melbourne daily for alternate destinations. The conclusion is then advanced that as this service is physically impossible of achievement there should be a daily steamer service each way in lieu thereof. </para>

              <para>- Yes. As that is physically impossible honorable senators must not run away with the idea that the public men of Tasmania, without exception, are opposed to the establishment of a Commonwealth or State-owned service. But when we come to deal with marine matters we are dealing with matters which are substantially different from a railway proposition. It is well known that the State has the power to prohibit competition with State-owned railways. But no State-owned steam-ship service, between Tasmania and the mainland, can eliminate all competition with itself in the same way as it could eliminate competition in the matter of a railway service. So that the question of profit at once enters into consideration. Of course, a whole generation of people has grown up since 1888. But in that year I came from Tasmania to the Exhibition in Melbourne, and I distinctly remember having to pay &#163;4 10s. for a return ticket. Will <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O&#39;Keefe</inline> tell me what is the present &#34; extortionate &#34; charge, as he calls it? It is substantially less than it was then. </para>

              <para>- If the honorable senator has read this report, and the evidence upon which it is based, he will find that there has been a substantial reduction of fares within the past twenty years. There has been a little reflex action since. Owing to the increase in the working of steamer services - this increase has been reflected in the profits derivable from State railway services - it has been found necessary to increase fares and freights. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O&#39;Keefe</inline> knows perfectly well that at its last meeting the Adelaide Steamship Company declared that it was impossible for it to pay a dividend.For the first time for many years in its history no dividend was declared, because of the fact that the increase in the cost of running -the service had so entrenched upon the profits earned that sufficient money could not be put by to enable a dividend to be paid. The facts are that the representatives of the steam-ship companies admitted that the trade between Tasmania and Victoria was profitable, but not particularly so, and Captain Evans stated that the trade between Tasmania and . New South Wales was not at all profitable, and that a profit was only shown by failing to make any allowance for depreciation. Captain Evans has been a Premier of Tasmania, and he is the manager of Huddart Parker and Company, one of the companies engaged in this traffic. Here is a question which I put to him when he appeared as a witness before the Select Committee of which I have spoken - </para>

            <para>As a reasonable man- of course, the Committee know the company has to make its profits - you do not think the freights and fares charged are such as to unfairly handicap the public of Tasmania? - Taking them all round, I think they are very fair. The freight ques tion has been exercising the minds of the directors for some time past with the idea of increasing them even higher in the future. </para>
            <para>You say they think it a commercial necessity? - It has been exercising their minds for some time.

              <para>- <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O&#39;Keefe</inline> is well aware that the recommendations of the Committee were only presented to the Tasmanian House of Assembly in December last. Soon after a dissolution of that Chamber took place, a general election followed, and almost upon its heels came the general elections for this Parliament. Since the advent of the Liberal party to power action has been taken to give Tasmania an improved service. </para>

              <para>- The honorable senator will admit that a good deal of water has run under the bridge since December last. Notwithstanding the fact that there is u widespread, not altogether justified, opinion in Tasmania regarding the tremendous profits that are alleged to be made by the Union Steamship Company, no Tasmanian investors can be found sufficiently plucky to put up the money to form, a company to compete with those who are alleged to be making tremendous profits. That matter was discussed by the Select Committee, and information was elicited from the witnesses. But, notwithstanding the fact that I have introduced the name of the Honorable George Collins as being an enthusiastic advocate for a daily service, I want to say, in justice to those gentlemen <inline font-style="italic">who</inline> have pronounced Liberal proclivities, and who tentatively have spoken in favour in the first instance of a Stateowned service, <inline font-style="italic">that</inline> they desire, in the interests of Tasmania, to see any nation alized or State-owned service absolutely controlled from the Tasmanian end. For it is to the Tasmanian people that this question is most vital. </para>

              <para>- I know that it is in contemplation - unwisely, in my mind - to build a line across the central Australian desert. Honorable senators who talk about nationalizing steam-ship services of the Commonwealth at present- hardly think of what the nation has to shoulder. We have now one battle cruiser, which has recently come into Australian waters to defend our commerce, and these honorable gentlemen, who will presently realize the tremendous burden on the shoulders of the people - a necessary one, I will admit, in connexion with the scheme of Naval Defence - actually in the most light-hearted manner, talk of nationalizing all the ordinary marine services existing between the Commonwealth and other ports of the world, to start, of course, with Tasmania. I know my duty to the people of that State as well as any of those who assist me in its representation do, hut my sense of duty to those people does not blind me to my sense of duty in regard to those larger issues that the Parliament of the nation has to face. While we have only one cruiser on the seas to protect the large volume of Australian commerce, it would be quite premature, even admitting the expediency in certain circumstances of such a line of action, for the Commonwealth to embark upou the owning of all the services now existing between ports of the Commonwealth and other ports of the world. </para>

              <para>- But if it is going to be of value to Tasmania - to which State the question is particularly vital - it must not be a Commonwealth-owned service, but a Tasmanian-owned service. I recognise the proper distinction there is between the actions of the Tasmanian Parliament and those of . the Commonwealth Parliament; and what I have been striving to do, I think with reasonable prospects of success, is to provide a Tasmanian administration, be it a Liberal or Labour one, with the money to enter into competition with the steam-ship companies, if, after a proper investigation, it comes to the conclusion that those companies are not acting fairly to the people of the State. I know that my remarks, although they are somewhat disconnected, and made on the spur of the moment, will be recorded and read by large numbers pf Tasmanian people. If the Tasmanian Legislature, in its wisdom, has decided to spend a very large sum in nationalizing the hydro-electric works, at the Great Lake - I am not questioning its wisdom, as it is responsible to the people of the State - if it really feels that the people of Tasmania are being unfairly treated by the combination who own the so-called ferry service, at a smaller cost than it has incurred in connexion with the acquisition of the hydro-electric scheme, it can build a boat, or a couple of boats, to enter into competition with those companies; and it will be in this happy position, that, if this service does i&#34;-t pay. it will be able to sell the boats.  If  the Tasmanian people really believe that the proposed contract is unsatisfactory to them, it is absolutely within the scope of their Legislature, which has full power in this matter, to build vessels, and enter into competition with the companies. </para>

              <para>- Is not that the very argument used to justify the increases of the freights and fares which have been made during the last year or two in the Bass Strait service? In appealing to judicially-minded men, it is absolutely certain that the companies, knowing that they would incur a lot of odium by an increase in freights and fares, would not take that step unless they found it was necessary to commercially fortify themselves in that regard. Here is another paragraph in the report which honorable members have done me so much honour by advertising. </para>

              <para>- What is the use of a State-owned line from the Tasmanian stand-point, unless it secures lower freights and fares to its people? Seeing that honorable senators opposite do not want a State-owned line to be run at a loss any more than a privately-owned line desires to be so run, will they straightforwardly lay down the proposition that they believe that large profits are to be made on the scale of fares and freights, and that therefore an opportunity for the profitable running of a ,. State-owned service exists ? </para>

Surely they would have regarded the extra money as a mere bagatelle. I venture to say that they would not have haggled with the Honorary Minister, who has had to. take an important share in these partly satisfactory negotiations. I call them only partly satisfactory because nothing short of a daily service will be wholly satisfactory. As a matter of fact, the companies regarded the trade in such a light that they would not consent to anything more than an engagement not to raise freights and fares without Ministerial permission.

              <para>- I desire to see freights and fares substantially reduced, but I am not sure that it is commercially possible to reduce them and run the service at a profit. I am quite satisfied that if the Tasmanian Parliament is allowed to develop the schemes that it has on hand, and if we provide it with the money that is due to it from the Commonwealth as an act of justice, we can safely leave it to determine whether it will be expedient to build two boats to compete with the companies already operating in the service. Honorable senators opposite, assisted by the newspaper representing the Labour party in Tasmania, have already dangled speciously before the eyes of the Tasmanian people a motion passed in the Senate at the instance of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ready.</inline> I can easily justify the action taken by my Liberal co-senators in voting against that motion. But I want to make it quite clear that voting for it not only committed its supporters to the establishment of a service, Commonwealth-owned, between the mainland and Tasmania, but committed them to the principle of the nationalization of all the marine services operating between the Commonwealth and all other parts of the world. </para>

              <para>- I believe that the name of the Premier of Victoria is known over even a larger area of the world than is that of the honorable senator who has just interrupted. For some time past there has been a surplus on the working of the railways of this State. That surplus has been substantially reduced.. What is the reason given for the reduction ? It is the increase in the cost of operating the service. Here lies a cardinal objection to the extension of the principle of State enterprise - that all profits are absorbed, and will continuously be absorbed, by the ever-expanding demands of those engaged in the mechanical operation of State services. If the Commonwealth established a service between Tasmania and the mainland, and that service was successful, the profit would not&#34; result in a reduction of fares and freights, but would be absorbed by the ever-increasing demands of the employes. </para>

              <para>- The honorable senator thinks that they are entitled to the lot, and that the taxpayers are to be continuously called upon to shoulder any loss. In the light of what has happened in connexion with State railway services in New South Wales and Victoria, and of what will happen in connexion with State-owned services throughout the Commonwealth, I say that it is hopeless for the Australian people in the future to think of the extension of the principle of nationalization in the hope that it will result in a substantial reduction of the cost of nationalized services. In this matter I am an  expedientist.  I will not be frightened from supporting a proposition merely because&#39; it is called Socialistic. I admit that it may be desirable in some instances to institute State-owned services. </para>

              <para>- Seeing that this is not a party question, if, at the expiration of the period of the contract it is found that the people of Tasmania are really suffering, in comparison with the people of the mainland States, from the exorbitant demands of the shipping companies, I venture to say that very few will be found to object to the establishment of a State-owned, if not a Commonwealth, service. But in the meantime we must be content with the present service. The Tasmanian Parliament, assisted and subsidized by the Commonwealth, can, if it thinks fit, establish a service to supplement the existing service - a thing which no business people in Tasmania would feel justified in doing. Knowing the difficulties that &#34;have had to be overcome - and no one should know them better, seeing that I was the  chairman  of the Committee which exhaustively inquired into this matter in Tasmania - I venture to say, in conclusion, that a very great deal of credit &#39; is due to the Minister, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Clemons,</inline> for the substantial measure of improvement which has been effected in the signing of this new contract. </para>

            <para>.- Now that the temporary whirlwind from Tasmania has subsided, perhaps his junior colleague will be granted the indulgence of the Senate for a moment, while he proves, out of the mouths of the witnesses who appeared before the honorable senator&#39;s Committee, that the statements he has made are unreliable. I shall be able to prove from the wonderful document to which the honorable senator has referred that the people of Tasmania are dissatisfied with the existing service, and look for something better. They will by-and-by call <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bakhap</inline> to account for the vote he gave a few weeks ago in the Senate. </para>

I am prepared to play second fiddle to any one on this or the other side who has done something; but I object to a man whose chief qualification is his verbosity, speaking of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O&#39;Keefe,</inline> who has been a member of the Senate for nine years, and did more for Tasmania in three years than <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bakhap</inline> has done during the whole course of his political life, as his assistant.

I can give this great champion df the shipping companies a little more information about the profits made by the companies. One of the witnesses who came before the Committee, and who was complimented on being the most efficient, reliable, and well-informed witness who appeared before them, gave some evidence on this point. I refer to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Black.</inline> He stated that one boat, plying between Hobart and Sydney, earned &#163;43,000 in one season. The expenses of the vessel amounted to less than &#163;20,000, so that there was a profit of &#163;23,000 on the running of that boat for twelve months. </para>

              <para>- When we consider that the mail contract is the lever by which these shipping companies in combination &#39; control the trade of Tasmania, it will be seen that it has everything to do with the contract. I may inform honorable senators that fruit-growers of Tasmania sending fruit to Brisbane have topay freight amounting to 17s. 6d. per ton between Sydney and Brisbane, whilst Queensland fruit-growers shipping fruit, back to Sydney by the same steamers are charged a freight of only 9s. 9d. per ton. Is that not an indication of the way in which the people of Tasmania are beingexploited ? If we could once break upthis Shipping Combine by means of Commonwealthowned boats, or could induceanother shipping company to compete with the Combine, we should at onceeffect a material reduction of freights and! an improvement in the shipping conditions applying to the whole of Tasmania. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bakhap</inline> knows that quite well. </para>

              <para>- If the honorable senator had a good thing on, would he do something which he was not obliged to do ? I have given facts concerning this service which cannot be disproved. I could give others. It is recognised in * shipping circles in Tasmania that when we proposed to establish a Commonwealth line of steamers, we did so primarily as a business proposition. The sum of &#163;150.000 would build an improved <inline font-style="italic">Loongana.</inline> With the present subsidy we could build two <inline font-style="italic">Loonganas.</inline> We could give Tasmania a daily mail service, reduce fares and freights, and if the steamship companies entered into competition with us, the people of Australia would benefit by the reduced rates charged. Yet <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bakhap</inline> had the audacity to rise to-night and make a whitewashing speech on behalf of this Combine. </para>

          <para>I wish to give one instance of how far-reaching is the influence of the Union Steam-ship Company, which in the matter of transport holds Tasmania in the hollow of its hand. A gentleman who is a friend of mine recently visited England on a holiday trip, and whilst there called upon the manager of the Federal Houlder Shire line of boats.  His  idea was to induce that company to engage in the InterState fruit trade between Hobart and Sydney. The general manager of the company listened to what my friend had to say with interest, and replied, &#34;Yes, the proposition certainly looks good enough.&#34; My friend then &#34;said, &#34; There is a good thing in it for you, and I will guarantee to get you the trade,&#34; and thereupon the manager answered, &#34; You call again to-morrow.&#34; My friend did so, and upon seeing the manager the latter said, &#34; I find, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Soandso,</inline> that the Union Steam-ship Company are engaged in the business of which you spoke, and I am sorry to say we cannot enter into competition with it.&#34; My friend pressed for an explanation as to the reason, and the manager replied, &#34;The Union Steam-ship Company is one of the biggest shareholders in our company.&#34; That circumstance shows that the Union Steam-ship Company is able to influence freights even so far as the big liners of Great Britain are concerned. </para>
          <para>I am not ashamed to stand up and break a lance for my State against this Combine. The Royal Commission on the Fruit Industry, of which I had the honour to be a member, found that an honorable understanding existed between practically every steamship company trading in Australia - an understanding under which the waters of one route were allotted to a particular line of steamers and the waters of another route to another line of steamers. </para>

That is the position we are up against. We came to this Parliament with a business proposition which any company with the necessary resources would have jumped at. But what was the attitude adopted by the Government towards us? Are they willing to discuss the matter with us? The Postmaster-General, when asked whether the contract with the shipping companies for the carriage of mails between Melbourne and Tasmania for a subsidy of &#163;15,000 per year had been signed, and, if not, whether he would hold it over until the House had dealt with the motion submitted by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. O&#39;Malley</inline> in another place, replied - </para>

            <para>- I wish to refer very briefly to the alleged treatment of a cadet named Victor Yeo, at Broken Hill. The circumstances surrounding this, case are such that I do not think the reply which was given to me this afternoon by the Minister of Defence was at all a satisfactory one. Doubtless he told the Senate all that he knew. I am a supporter of the principle of compulsory military training, and therefore have no desire to prejudice the operation of that system. But I was led to believe from debates which took place in this Chamber during the last Parliament that the later amending Defence Act provided that defaulting cadets, instead of being imprisoned, were to be detained in barracks, and that in&#39; no circumstances were they to be gaoled. </para>

            <para>- If the information which has been conveyed to me is correct, this particular lad was not only committed to gaol for twenty-one days, but for the first seven days was fed only on bread and water. After his release he was again tried for refusing to put in the prescribed drills, and was again committed to gaol, where he was again fed on bread and water.  His  sentence expired while circumlocutory action was being taken by the Defence Department. I never did have much time for professional military people, and I am quite certain that if <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> is content to take - as too many Ministers are in the habit of doing - a report as to what has been done from those who were the head and front of the offenders, from those who were practically doing it, or ordering it, he will never get anything but faked reports. Such reports are useless in political matters. The idiotic system, which is customary with all Governments during my experience, of calling upon the person who is practically accused of committing the wrong, for a report as to what has been done, and then taking&#39; that report for granted, does not satisfy me for one; nor do I think it should satisfy the democratic spirit of the Senate, &#39; whatever may be submitted to in a more Conservative Chamber. 1, for one, shall continue to make a &#34;dickens&#34; of a row over this kind of thing, unless I get some satisfactory  assurance that when such reports are circulated, the men who are accused -shall not be applied to for their version of what happened, but that some inde pendent person shall be appealed to to report, and report fairly. I trust thatthe Minister- will take these remarks, not as a threat, but as a warning that, &#39; unless something more satisfactory is done than is disclosed in the answer I received from his chief, more will be heard of it at no distant date. </para>

          <para>. - I have no doubt that the actual prosecution, which ended in the cadet referred to being  sent to gaol, never came under the notice of the Minister until the lad was really in gaol. When the case was first mentioned here, it came as a surprise and a shock to me, because of one of the reasons I stated for moving the second reading of the Defence Bill, on the 18th July, 1912. The Government of the day decided that they would so amend the Act as to substitute in all cases commitment to a place of military detention for gaol, as the alternative for the non-payment of fines imposed on cadets, and the instruction given by myself to the officer who represented the Defence Department was that the Attorney-General&#39;s Department was to draft a measure which would have that effect. We were under the impression - I certainly was - that the Bill carried out that decision, and I told the Senate that that was the intention.

        <para class="block">I only wish to say, in justice to the lao3 Government, that we believed that the amending Bill - and I am certain that the Senate so believed - attained that end. On both sides that, was hailed as a reform which everybody thought should be brought about, and it did come as a surprise and a shock to me when I heard that a lad in Broken Hill had been sent to gaol. I hope that if it is found that the amending Act is not perfect in that respect, the Government will amend it. I am sure that they do not want to send lads to gaol any more than the late Government did, and if this case makes it plain to them that there is still open some means by which lads can be sent to gaol, I trust that the Act will be amended. </para>

            <para>- I agree with the honorable senator that, in these  cases.  there is a great difficulty - I know it only too well - in getting a perfectly independent report. That is one of the difficulties which always confront a Minister when he is making an inquiry of thissort. But if it can in any way . be got over, it will be got over,  so  far as I can bring it about. I shall make it ray personal business, to look into the law, and if, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> has . said, the amending Act was so drafted that the clear intention of both sides in the last Senate was not given effect to, I shall urge upon the Cabinet the desirability of amending the Act. in the direction indicated. I express my personal sympathy, and I will not stop, until I have got to the bottom of this matter, if that is possible. </para>
