                            <para>- Will the Minister representing the Postmaster-General see that the number of public telephones on our central railway stations are added to? May I be permitted, sir, to point out that, although the averages may not be high, most of those who use the public telephones are on their way to a train and have not very much time to spare. It is quite common to see as many as eight or ten persons waiting to use the public telephones, and, as the trains have to depart in a few minutes, very often those persons have to go away without conveying what might be an urgent or important message. I ask that the number of public telephones on the Flinders-street and Spencer-street stations be added to. </para>

                    <para>.- I am sorry that the Minister of Defence is not present, although I know that he has very good reason for being absent. Nevertheless, I feel that I must ask that the Committee should be informed as to why a vote of £8,000 is required in connexion -with Garden Island. A few days ago I brought before the Minister a question, which, I think, is deserving of some attention. I pointed out that the Garden Island establishment contains, among other things, a dockyard and a repairing dock. These were very necessary for the ships of the Imperial Fleet, because it was the only repairing establishment which they had in Sydney. The position, however, has undergone a complete alteration since the departure of the Imperial ships from our waters, inasmuch as we have Cockatoo Island, which is not only suitable for undertaking new works, but also for effecting repairs. If we are going to maintain a repairing establishment at Garden Island, as well as at Cockatoo Island, we shall require two sets of engineering officers to run them. I cannot see why that is necessary. Garden Island serves other purposes besides that of a repairing establishment. In addition to the dockyard, ' there are on the island stores, a depot, the hospital, and, I think, a gaol . Now that the Imperial establishment has been done away with it seems to me that we should determine whether it is not possible to concentrate all the engineering work at Cockatoo Island. If honorable members will refer to the ordinary Estimates they will see that that engineering staff is a pretty costly one. To my mind, it is not wise to duplicate these establishments if we can avoid it. We should not perpetuate a duplication of staffs and of works. If the repairing work can be undertaken at Cockatoo Island it should be carried out there. The Government are in control of that island, and they can say that the repairing of ships in commission shall take precedence of all other work. I should like to know whether in this item of £8,000 any expenditure is proposed on the workshops at Garden Island ? </para>

The matters covered by the proposed vote include a store for gun mountings, the general manager's residence, officers' quarters, and a dining-hall for workmen. I will bring the question of the necessity for retaining Garden Island before the Minister of Defence as soon as he returns to the Senate, and will request him to supply <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> with an answer to his remarks during the day. </para>

In view of the want of knowledge on the part of the Vice-President of the Executive Council regarding this matter, I would suggest that the item be postponed. </para>

                    (Western Australia) {11.28]. - I would direct attention to the item in this division, which reads, "Victoria Barracks, Melbourne - office accommodation - towards cost new service, £3,598; re-vote, £3,902; total, £7,500." A paragraph recently appeared in the press, stating that it is proposed to build# a new wing to the Victoria Barracks, and* to instal the Naval Administration there. I wish to ask the Minister representing the Minister of Defence whether that is the explanation of this item ?

                    <para>. - I understand that the premises now occupied by the Naval Board in Lonsdale.. street have been leased for a period of two years. Having seen in the newspapers a paragraph to the effect that it is intended to spend £25,000 on the Victoria Barracks, so that the Minister may be able more expeditiously to carry on his work there, it has occurred to me that it can scarcely be regarded as economy if the premises in Lonsdale-street are to be vacated, and we have to pay rental for them during the  remainder  of the term for which they have been leased. Do the Government propose to proceed forthwith with the alterations to the Victoria Barracks; and, if so, is it anticipated that the necessary accommodation there will be available to the Minister before the expiration of the lease of the premises in Lonsdale-street ! </para>

                    <para>. - This item is absolutely misleading as it appears in the scheduler The proposal has emanated from the pre&gt;sent Minister.. There was no vote on the Estimates for the purpose last year. But the schedule makes it appear that -the amount is a re-vote. There may have been a vote on the last Estimates for additional -office accommodation for the military side, but there was no proposal for additional accommodation of the Navy Administration at the Victoria Barracks. Yet the schedule would make it appear that this is a commitment of the late Government. No proposition to move, the Naval Administration from Lonsdale-street to the Victoria Barracks was made by the late Administration. Consequently, this was npt a commitment of theirs. The item ought to be altered so as to show that the only demand made by the late Government was for additional accommodation from the military side at the Victoria Barracks, and that the further proposals to house the Navy Administration there are new. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable senator is not serious when he makes that statement, because it is admitted by many of those who are vigorously opposed to  Labourism  in any shape or form that no Government did so much for the people in the rural portions of Australia as the "late Labour Government did. I shall test the feeling of the Committee on this matter. I have a slight idea of the importance which the Naval and Military officers attach to themselves. Some of them seem to labour under the hazy belief that they are beings altogether distinct from the average human. </para>

I do not expect that this money will be thrown away, but if these officers get any encouragement whatever in regard to buildings, one cannot forecast the amount which they will demand in the future. The Minister of Defence seems to have been very much worried since he took on the responsibilities of office by having to go from the Victoria Barracks to Lonsdale-street. The distance is not very great. He can run from the one building to the other very quickly. No doubt, from the defence point of view it would be very much better to accommodate both branches in one building, but, in my opinion, the amount proposed is altogether too large. It may lead to other expenditure in the same direction. For that reason I move - </para>

                    <para>.- I think I can furnish the Committee with reasons justifying the action that has been taken in this matter. The position is this: First of all, the Victoria Barracks is the home of the military side of the Defence Department.- We have also in Lonsdale-street, Melbourne, a rented building which is the headquarters of the Naval Branch. Then we had somewhere else in a place which I have not yet had time to visit another block of buildings for the Works Branch of the Department. I believe there is also a little side branch blossoming out somewhere else. As a business proposition alone, I submit that this proposal is defensible. Unless we did something of the kind we should have to rent other buildings to provide additional accommodation for a growing Department. </para>

                        <para>- There will certainly have to be a home for the Department in Canberra, if my ideas are carried out. But we cannot have the whole Department there. We shall still want some buildings down here. It is obvious, I think - and I can appeal to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> on the point- that the present accommodation is insufficient. That can be claimed without fear of contradiction. We have three important branches of the Department scattered about this city. No one can satisfactorily look after them under these conditions. , It not infrequently happens that when I arn in the middle of papers at the barracks, I receive an urgent call to deal with some important business at the Navy House; in Lonsdale-street. When I am dealing with papers there, business has to be attended to in connexion with works. Then telephone messages have to be sent in order that the papers may be brought to me from the Works Office. It is harassing to have to transact business under these conditions. I put no exaggerated estimate on the value of my time, but I say that no man can administer a Department satisfactorily under these circumstances, and do it or himself justice. </para>

                        <para>- The premises will not be temporary. If the Committee thinks that we ought to go on renting premises, let me point out the difficulty. I believe that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce,</inline> while he was at the head of the Department, was trying to find out whether it was possible to obtain a block of buildings somewhere in Melbourne which would meet our requirements. Suitable premises were not to be found in Melbourne. There are, of course, many suitable buildings, but they are held under lease, and it was not possible to find close together the accommodation necessary for the Naval and Military Branches of the Department. There was an opportunity of purchasing the block in which the Navy Office is now housed for £10,000. The .Home Affairs Department could put up an additional block of buildings at the back at a cost of £8,000. The position, therefore, was that we could either spend £18,000 on the present premises or build for ourselves. It appealed to lue as *i very much better business proposition to put £25,000 worth of buildings on our own land - and there is ample room at the corner of the barrack lands in St. K i Ida-road - than to purchase premises which would only meet our immediate requirements. The building which we propose to erect will answer the purpose for an indefinite period. </para>

There was an amount of £4,000 on the last Estimates for the purpose of providing additional accommodation for the Naval Branch, but the idea of spending the money at the Victoria Barracks was evidently not in contemplation at that time. That idea, which I consider an excellent one, and claim as my own, enables us to concentrate the Department in one building. </para>

The small amount set down in the vote referred to by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bakhap</inline> is merely a supplementary amount to. complete work for which provision was made on the last Estimates. Albany is not in the same fortunate position, and is still awaiting the passage of this measure before it will be in the position of Launceston, which can point with pride to the drill hall erected there. Drill halls are being erected at Hobart and at Launceston, and the vote referred to by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bakhap</inline> is to meet some supplementary accounts for little additions for which the previous vote was not sufficient. </para>

                    <para>.- Speaking from memory, the last communication on this subject which I perused supported the statement made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Rae.</inline> The number of rifles- being turned out is disappointingly small. So far only 500 completed rifles have been put together. The manager of the factory has himself drawn attention to this, and expressed his disappointment at it. 'Jio points out that a good deal pf the delay in turning out completed rifles is due to the difficulty of training men in the necessary processes, and also to the disinclination of a number of mechanics, who previously resided in Sydney, to reside at Lithgow. The men become anxious to get back to their old haunts, and it frequently happens that young men, after they have become to some extent skilled in mechanical operations which require to be performed at the factory, return to Sydney, and it is then necessary to train- other men. </para>

If the love of men for city life is going to render it impossible for us to keep a sufficient staff at Lithgow to do the mechanical work required to secure a fair output of completed rifles, we must shift the machinery of the city, or provide Lithgow with city conveniences. A satisfactory output of rifles is essential, because men are no good for defence without guns; and if the difficulty cannot be overcome in any other way, we must import mechanics for the work, under a contract to remain for a certain time at Lithgow. </para>

It is one of the causes. - We can readily understand that, starting from nothing, it takes time to assemble the requisite staff of workmen. Every little cause that tends to deplete the ranks of the workers is serious at first, but it will become of less consequence as time goes on, and as the younger men employed are becoming qualified for higher positions in the factory. </para>

                    <para>. - One difficulty in connexion with the Lithgow Small Arms Factory has not been mentioned by the Minister. The town of Lithgow is situated in a "V " formed by the mountains, and there is across the " V " a lion in the path in the shape of the land monopolist, who absolutely refuses to sell land under any fair conditions whatever. The result is that the town is cooped up at the end of the "V," and houses can only be obtained at enormous rentals. </para>

I agree with the Minister that the outlook is not so black as some might imagine. As a matter of fact, the Lithgow Small Arms Factory turns out rifles in far less time than did a factory established by the British Government in India. </para>

                        <para>- The Indian is capable of being trained just as our men are. I am convinced, from what I was told by the manager of the factory, that the ordinary fitter is quite useless when he arrives at the factory, and has to be trained from the beginning in the work required to be done there. The Lithgow factory turned out rifles . in two years shorter time than the factory established by the British Government in India, although the difficulty of securing the necessary labour was much less in India. I am not disappointed at the result so far, and I feel sure that within the next year or two the factory will get into full going order, but the question of land is undoubtedly one of the lions in the path of the progress of, not only the factory, but every other undertaking. </para>

                    <para>. - I am still not entirely satisfied. It is very cheerful indeed to see the Minister of Defence and the ex-Minister jointly offering reasons why we should feel no alarm. I was very pleased to hear <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> give the facts regarding the land monopoly, which I intend to accept from hearsay evidence, but about. which I did not know as much as he has indicated. There is still: another matter which, while I have not detailed information, may be a factor. I am told that the authorities frown on trade unionism. If anti-unionism, combined with land monopoly, could not crush a factory, I would like to know what combined forces could ? I am given to understand that there is a kind of bogus bosses' union in the district. </para>

                        <para>- He probably gave the information to the honorable senator as the result of representations made by the man who was refused employment, and at once set on foot an agitation that he was rejected because he was a trade unionist. He was not rejected for anything of that kind, and he has made statements regarding the union there. The late Government intimated to the management of the factory as well as to other managers that he was to adopt the principle of preference to unionists in securing his employes, and he did. Over 75 per cent. of the men employed there were at the time of their joining members of various unions throughout the State. But certain unionists in Lithgow, because the men coming from other States did not happen to be members of the local union, objected to their getting employment. I instituted inquiries, and found that the men were unionists, but did not happen to belong to the Lithgow union. The man who was refused employment at the factory was secretary to one of the Lithgow unions, and he insisted that these men should be compelled to join the Lithgow union. I refused to be a party to anything of the kind. I said that so long as the manager was satisfied that the men belonged to a union that was all that I desired. After the staff was collected the men naturally desired to have a union of their own, because this is the only industry of the kind in Australia. They formed a union to which, I believe, over 90 per cent. of the employes of the factory now belong. To say that it is a bogus union is to reflect on the. unionists who came from every part of Australia, and who were genuine members of trade unions when they got employment. </para>

                        <para>- I cannot say offhand. Not only is that so, but the factory union is affiliated with the Eight Hours' Demonstration Committee at Lithgow. It is a reflection on the unionists of Lithgow if they have allowed a blackleg union, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Rae</inline> would call it, to . be affiliated with them. I am in a position to say that the rule of preference to unionists, which was enforced by the late Government, was observed by the manager, so far as he was able to do so: </para>

                <para class="block">In a number of cases he had to get in certain specialists who did not happen to be unionists, and there, of course, the rule did not apply. There is justification for a union of men employed in the factory, because it is the only factory of the kind in Australia, aud is distinct from all factories in the iron-work trade. It is registered in New South Wales as a genuine trade union, is affiliated with the Eight Hours' Demonstration Committee at Lithgow, and takes its part in all 11111011 matters in the State. It is unfortunate that a member of the Senate has made these statements when, if he had inquired of me, he could have learned that they were inaccurate, and set on foot by a man whose animus is attributable to the fact that he was refused employment at the factory. </para>

I am given to understand that great objection is taken to the Commonwealth establishing its stabling so close to the habitations of many people. It is considered that a place could easily be found a little further away from the very centre of the residential parts of Sydney for the stables and other buildings. Have any representations been made to the Minister, and, if they have been refused, is the Department still going on with the erection of the stables ? </para>

                    <para>.- As_ the item on the Estimates will show, provision is made to carry on a work which was authorized in the last "financial year, but as the result of representations which have been made to me by civic and other authorities I have directed that the work shall be brought to a stand-still for the present, and shall not be proceeded with until I can look into the whole question. The civic representations do appeal to me very much against the undesirability of placing in the midst' of a thickly-populated area stables for a large number of horses. It seems to me that it ought to be possible to devise some better means for meeting the requirements of the military, and 1 am now looking into the matter. </para>

                    <para>. - I observe an item of £4,287 for the Cordite Factory at. Maribyrnong. A little while ago the Prime Minister, in speaking at a. public meeting, sneered at the alleged interest of the Labour party in defence, and he said, " Why did not they, instead of starting clothing and saddlery factories, make provision for the manufacture of cordite in Australia? " As a matter of fact, during last year I appointed a Committee to go into the question of manufacturing cordite for big guns, and before I left office it had * reported in favour of its manufacture here. It reported that by an extension of the present plant big-gun cordite could be manufactured, and the manager said that if that extension were made he could manufacture cordite, not only for big guns, but for the small arms, at a lower cost than that at which he is now making it. The Committee recommended an extension of the factory, but there is no provision for such extension in these Estimates. Yet the Prime Minister goes about the country sneering at the late Government. We did not have the opportunity to act upon the report. It was only received just before we went out of office. The Minister has framed his Estimates without providing for an extension as recommended. Therefore, the Prime Minister is in this matter endeavouring to bluff the public in order to score off the late Government. </para>

                        <para>- I do riot cavil at the report not having been made public. It discloses confidential information as to our reserves of ammunition and matters of that kind, and therefore it is not advisable that it should be published. It may be that for good reasons the Minister has decided not to extend the factory, but it does not come very well from the Prime Minister to sneer at the late Government for not doing something which they were not in a position to do. When we framed our Estimates we had not the report in our possession. The present Government have the report in their possession, hut are not going on with the proposed extension, although the Committee reported as to its feasibility and its necessity, and pointed out that it would lessen the cost of manufacturing cordite. </para>

The question covered by those remarks was not whether the factory ought to have been started or not, but the fact that, having a certain amount to spend, the previous Government spent it in establishing factories to make those articles which private individuals were already making, instead of spending it in establishing a. factory to make cordite, which nobody was making. It was a very fair criticism of an administrative act of our predecessors. </para>

The inquiries made by a Committee appointed for the purpose certainly apply to cordite, whereas the actual processes of manufacture in the case of the woollen and clothing factories are those which are followed by numerous private firms in different parts of the Commonwealth. I can quite understand that the Minister should think that the criticism of his leader is fair, but if it did happen to be fair, it would constitute a most extraordinary departure on his part. I understand that all explosives deteriorate with age, some much more rapidly than others. I, therefore, desire to know whether the cordite manufactured for the small arms is turned out in excess quantities and stored for future use. If so, to what extent is its destruction necessary in order to insure a safe and reliable explosive? </para>

I regret that the process of building up that reserve is not quite as rapid as one would like it to be. Nevertheless, that is our policy. That necessarily means that in consequence of deterioration, after the lapse of a certain time, some portion of these stores has to be destroyed. Examiners are appointed whose duty it is to make examinations of the explosive, and when it is condemned it is destroyed. I cannot say what time elapses before deterioration takes place, but I know that now and again quantities of these explosives are destroyed. </para>

                    <para>. - I wish to impress upon the Minister the necessity for manufacturing big-gun cordite in Australia. This particular class of cordite deteriorates much more rapidly than does the cordite for small arms ammunition. Moreover, we have to recollect that in the first attack. on the Commonwealth, it is quite possible that big-gun ammunition will be more important than will be small arms ammunition. In one year, there was no less than £10,000 worth of big-gun cordite which had to be destroyed. </para>

                        <para>- It is all imported. It deteriorates apparently for no reason whatever. Deterioration sets in from the time of manufacture, and climatic and other conditions appear to affect it materially. We depend upon obtaining our supply of big-gun cordite from Great Britain. That supply is most irregular. If our communication with the Mother Country were interrupted in time of national emergency, we should be absolutely helpless. It does seem to me, therefore, that the Government should take into  their  early consideration the  advisableness  of extending the present Cordite Factory. . I have been informed by the manager of that factory that this could be done at a very small expense. The greater portion of the expenditure would be absorbed in providing a proof ground after the cordite had been manufactured. The subsequent expenditure would not be heavy. I suggest that the Minister should look carefully into this matter because I venture to say that the impracticability of keeping a sufficiently large supply of cordite on hand is one of the weakest links in our defence system. Our only safety lies in having a local source of supply. A reserve is an uncertain guarantee which may disappear in a few short months. I would impress upon the Minister the necessity of giving early consideration to this question. It may be possible to include in the Supplementary Works Estimates an amount for this purpose. </para>

The honorable gentleman said a moment ago that that information was not complete. If that be so, will the Minister hasten its completion ? I think that the statement made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> is a very important one. The Minister smiles. But we have to recollect that, under existing conditions, although we may have the guns, big or small, we may not have cordite. If we are going to have the guns, by all means let us have the cordite and the factory at which to manufacture it. If the information in regard to the manufacture of cordite in Australia- be not complete, will the Minister expedite its completion ? </para>

Nor do I wish it to be understood that I was in any way reflecting upon the gentlemen who formed that Committee. But it does seem to me that they approached the subject-matter of their inquiry from the technical side, and that it is necessary to supplement the information which they gathered. I frankly admit that this is one of the matters to which I have not been able seriously to address myself since I assumed control of the Defence Department. But I do not wish it to be understood that it is being overlooked. If I am in office as long as was my predecessor, there will be no necessity for this Committee to ask why there is no cordite factory iu existence in Australia. </para>

Factory, I would suggest to the Minister that something might possibly be done in the way of organizing parliamentary visits of inspection to these institutions. To my mind, there is an objection to an honorable senator visiting Commonwealth factories in a private capacity. At the same time, I think that we ought to be brought into actual contact with the work that is being done there. With this end in view, I suggest that if visits could be arranged to the cordite and clothing factories, they ' would prove advantageous. I hope that the Minister will provide some facilities for honorable senators inspecting these institutions. </para>

                        <para>- At any rate, the mares are there, and the foals are there. I certainly do not intend to make arrangements for the breeding of horses for military purposes. Whilst cordially approving of the idea of purchasing our own horses, I do not believe that we can breed as economically as we can purchase. No horse-breeder will deny that in order to breed horses of a particular type you will have to breed a very much larger number than you require. It is only one out of half-a-dozen that will be suitable for the particular purpose. I do not believe that the Defence Department can breed horses as profitably as it can buy them in the open market, because it only requires horses of a particular kind to meet its requirements. </para>

                    <para>. - Although the Minister of Defence may have some experience in horse-breeding, I do not agree with the opinion which he has expressed that the Government .of the Commonwealth cannot breed horses for artillery purposes as economically as it can purchase them from private breeders. I do not think that it is better for the Commonwealth to purchase horses from local buyers as occasion requires. We have in Australia a number of people who have breeding studs.  They have not established these places for the good of their health, but as business propositions. They get high-priced stallions and mares, and they sell the fillies and. colts at a good profit. Many of them are making a substantial income out of these establishments. Surely what private individuals can do the Government can do on a much more extensive scale. From time to time thousands of horses will be required, not only for the Defence Department, but also for other Commonwealth Departments. We shall want them for the Post and Telegraph Department, and for various purposes in the Northern Territory, and as the Commonwealth develops, we shall require still more and more horses. Only quite recently horses were at a very high price indeed. It was suggested that there were a few people in Australia who had control of the horse market. I know that a few had' control of the pig market, and the same class of people would not hesitate to get control of the horse market, and fix their own prices for horses. It is true that I am a strong believer in the principle of Government enterprise as against private enterprise, but I urge that if the present Government is true to its professed desire to economize in various directions, it will realize that it will be economical to abandon the system of purchasing horses, and to pursue the policy commenced by the late Government and fostered by the ex-Minister of Defence. It would be very much better for the people if the Government gave every assistance to the horse-breeding industry. <inline font-style="italic">L</inline> am certain that if the matter is inquired into in a businesslike way, and a horse-breeding establishment is commenced, and capably and sympathetically managed, we can make as big a success of it as any private individual can. We cau get the best of horses and mares if we pay a suitable price, and we can obtain the services of the very best men to control the establishment. But, of course, if Ministers do not believe in this policy, they might as well abandon the project. I am satisfied that we can get better horses and better results in every way by doing our own horse-breeding than by depending upon haphazard buying from commission agents, because that is what it really means. </para>

                        <para>- What does it mean, then ? Officers are employed by the Department who are commissioned to go out and buy horses. Those officers cannot obtain horses unless they get into touch with the commission agents in different parts of Australia. They have to deal through the middlemen, because you cau rarely obtain horses direct from the breeders. It was the intention of the late Minister to enter upon horse-breeding in a businesslike way. I am satisfied that if the Commonwealth Government pursues that policy, it will have nothing to regret, because it will find that a better quality of horses will be obtained. </para>

To-day he has told us that he has been informed by officers of the Department that I had approved of the purchase of mares for breeding purposes. That is ou all-fours with some of the other statements emanating, I am afraid, from certain officers who apparently allow their political bias to influence the information they convey to the Minister. </para>

                        <para>- No such action was ever taken by me, and the officers who told the Minister that were either ignorant, of the true position, or were anxious to give <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> some political shot with which to fire at me. At any rate, they did not trouble to ascertain the true facts, which were these: We decided to do away with the old practice of hiring horses for the Field Artillery, and to purchase our own. Officers were appointed to purchase them, and they did so. They purchased, amongst others, three mares which happened to be in foal. Those mares foaled, and we kept the foals. But I am free to say that that was only the initiation of a scheme whereby we intended to establish breeding stations throughout the Commonwealth, and to breed horses for military purposes. A considerable quantity of data was collected with that end in view. I am convinced that it is the right thing to do. At the present time horse-breeders do not, except in the minority of cases, breed the kind of horses that are required for Field Artillery work. When we had to buy somewhere about 2,000 horses we practically had to honeycomb Australia to get them. We had to send from the northwest of Western Australia down to th«&gt; south of Tasmania, and from Queensland to Victoria, to get them. If that is not sufficient to convince any one of the necessity of having a properly-organized system of supply I do not know what would convince them. In war time the wastage of horses is enormous. As a matter of fact, we have no reserve supply of Field Artillery horses in Australia to-day, and experience a great difficulty in keeping up a normal supply. </para>

                        <para>- Buyers come from Japan and India to purchase suitable horses for military purposes. We have in the north of Australia, the west of Queensland, the east of Western Australia, and the west of New South Wales, vast areas of country that are the best breeding grounds for horses in the world. The Commonwealth requires horses, not merely for artillery purposes, but also for  the policing of the Northern Territory and the Post and Telegraph Department. If any of the horses which we bred were unsuitable for Commonwealth requirements, we should find a ready sale for them in the markets of Australia. We could sell every such horse, and could thereby obtain a revenue that would pretty well make the' breeding establishments self-supporting. In addition to that, I do not see why we should not assist the Mother Country in this matter of the supply of horses. At the present time, the Indian Government is pretty badly robbed in the buying of horses in Australia. Honorable senators have only to compare the prices which the Commonwealth has paid for military horses with the prices paid for horses for India to find that that is so. I do not know where the money goes. </para>

                        <para>- Let the Minister compare the prices, and he will see that the difference is pretty startling. When I was in London, I saw the Secretary of State for India on this matter, and inquired of him whether the Indian Government would be prepared to make the Government of Australia its agent in Australia for the supply of military horses, in the event of our establishing horse-breeding establishments. I said that we were considering the question, but were- not in a position to do it yet. He said that if the Commonwealth Government went in for horse-breeding for these purposes, the Indian Government would have confidence in it, and would welcome its assistance in every way. There is a demand for an enormous number of horses from Australia, and it would increase if a properly-constituted Government stud farm for breeding were organized. By that means we could utilize a large  area of country that is not at present put to the best advantage. It has been demonstrated that in similar country ve can breed the best horses in the world. If the Minister will look at the departmental files on this question, he will find a mass of data indicating that this is a feasible proposition . </para>

                    <para>. - I should like to add a word to what has been so well expressed by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce.</inline> Much of the talk about Socialism and private enterprise is quite beside the mark, and is inapplicable to military affairs. We are often brought into conflict by what are only alleged differences of opinion on fundamental matters. It is fallacious and misleading to speak of war as Socialistic, because it is organized and run by Governments. It is really absolutely anti-Socialistic. In this matter the Government should consider the best course to adopt to secure a reliable supply of the horses for military purposes when they are most required. It is not a question of the expense of purchasing horses bred privately as against that of breeding horses by the Government. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> has said that our export of horses to India and other countries merely shows that Australian buyers are not prepared to pay the price demanded for them. If a number of horses are exported this month, they cannot be secured here next month, no matter what price may be offered- for them. It is absolutely essential for the effective working of the war machine that we should have all the horses we require when an emergency arises. It is not a question of price, but of reliable supply. The practice of foreign countries should be a 'guide for us in this matter, because their experience of war exceeds any that I hope we shall ever have in Australia. Austria-Hungary, Germany, Japan, and other countries have established breeding farms for the supply of horses for military purposes. If our war machine is to be relied upon there must be no weak link in it. The real question before us is how we can secure the most efficient and reliable supply of horses for military purposes. </para>

                            is credited with knowing something about land, and he will admit that it does not follow that because country has a slight rainfall it is not good grass country. The country to which I refer is well known to be good grass country, but permanent water has not yet been discovered there. If artesian supplies could be discovered there, and also in the Northern Territory, we could breed very good stock on country that is at present unutilized. Whilst the scheme could be made a success if conducted by a sympathetic Government, we can have very little hope that it would be successful if administered by a Government who are opposed to State enterprises of any kind

                        <para>- They should be, of course; but we know that commercialism has seriously affected arrangements made for defence in every country, and in none to a greater extent than in England. Commercialism has entered into the supply of armaments, ammunition, stores, and everything required for the conduct of war, and we know, further, that wars have in nearly every instance been brought about through the influence of the spirit of commercialism. We cannot expect the present Government to turn turtle on their principles and introduce  a  matter of this kind. It is too much to expect them to do anything which would lead to the success of the scheme advocated by the Opposition. </para>

                    <para>.  - <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie has suggested that it is not reasonable to expect the present Government to sympathetically administer a scheme of this kind. I understand that one of the virtues of the present Government is that they do favour a proposal that the Commonwealth should breed its own horses. The most aggressive member of the Government is so much in favour of the establishment, of Commonwealth horse-breeding depots that he submitted a motion in another place for their establishment. This is not a business in which we need come into conflict with private enterprise. There can surely be no objection .to making any Government service self-supporting. We have an exceptional opportunity to undertake this enterprise, because we possess vast tracts of country most suitable for the purpose. The best horse standing on four legs in Australia to-day was bred at a place about 70 or 80 miles from Oodnadatta. As recently as last August he put up a 4-mile record, carrying 14 stone. That is the class of horse the Defence Department are looking for. To show that his stock are not dying out, I can mention that only last Wednesday a full brother of. this horse, bred at the same establishment, was responsible for carrying a very fair weight to the front over the jumps. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen,</inline> who has had some experience in this business, speaks of the proposal as a wild scheme, because we could only get one suitable horse out of six. I believe the honorable senator has over-estimated the number, but the position in Australia today is that we cannot get one out of six, because the horses we require are sent to India, the Straits Settlement, or Japan. The horses that are being bred in Australia to-day, from the point of view of their use for military purposes, are deteriorating, and it is becoming a question of preserving our good stock. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> says that he is quite satisfied with the present system, but he has not been a very long time in the Defence Department. Until recently it was a common thing for the Defence Department to use horses for Saturday afternoon military parades that had been working in lorries in the city of Melbourne up <inline font-style="italic">to</inline> 12 o'clock on the Saturday. Surely, that is a system which would not satisfy <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen.</inline> It has come to my knowledge that whilst officers of the </para>

                <para>Defence Department have gone through stock, and selected horses with certain brands, on more than one occasion when these horses have appeared in the sale-yards they have had quite different brands upon them. I do not say that as a reflection on any of the  officers  of the Defence Department, but in order to show that the present system is  unsound,  as well as undesirable. </para>

                    <para>. - I desire to refer to the item of £11,696 for new rifle ranges and additions to existing ranges in Western Australia. Some years ago action was taken to close the Karrakatta rifle range, because of its being unsafe. During the last three years the building of a rifle range at Osborne has proceeded. The range is now completed, and recently the Minister gave orders for the closing of the range at Karrakatta. The rifle clubs have raised a protest against that act, which, I understand, has Deen before the Minister. I ask him to say what action, if any., he has taken. During the elections in Western Australia, it was brought under my notice that <inline font-style="italic">the</inline> new rifle range at Osborne had been constructed in sandy country, and that, as it was undulating at some of the ranges, firing embankments had to be put up. As this is a central range for the State, at an Association meeting there are a very large number of riflemen, markers, scorers, and other officials at those firing points. The banks were found to be not wide enough on the top, with the result that Captain Osborne, the Director of Rifle Clubs, has visited the range, and reported that on the top of the embankments there is not room for the number of persons who take part in the Association rifle matches. That work was carried out by the Home Affairs Department, and that is the. condition in which it was handed over to the Defence Department. I desire to know whether the Minister proposes to take action to have the firing embankments made of the proper width, and whether any money for that purpose is included in this item of £11,696. It is regrettable that the blunder was made. I do not know whether the responsibility for it lies with the Home Affairs Department or the Defence Department, but evidently somebody blundered. The rifle clubs have always kept up a continuous agitation for the retention of the Karrakatta range. The unfortunate feature is that, whereas the military authorities think there should be the other range, the fact of the new range being unsuitable adds fuel to the fire, and the rifle clubs are in a state of indignation about being called upon to conduct their matches at the Osborne range. From what I have heard, I am of opinion that if the embankments were extended it would be a suitable range; but if the embankments are not extended, the dissatisfaction which has existed there for the last few years will continue. I ask the Minister to give early attention to the matter, and if this item contains no money for the purpose, to see whether he cannot find money, so that the range, which is equal to the range at Long Bay, in New South Wales, or at Williamstown, in Victoria, may be put in a proper condition. </para>

                    <para>. - I need hardly assure <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> that I shall give, not only serious but immediate consideration, to the insufficient accommodation at the Osborne range. He, of course, is aware that the complaint he voices is not limited to that rifle range. The same complaint comes to me - from quite other causes - as to the Randwick range. I take it that the serious part of his statement is- that one part of the new range is not in proportion to the other ; that is, that the accommodation for the men to fire is not sufficient for the number of targets to fire at. The position at the Randwick range is the other way about. </para>

I would like the Minister to give us an idea as to the progress which has been made in the establishment of an aviation corps, and what .step? the Government are taking, or intend to take, in regard to providing monoplanes, biplanes, and dirigible balloons for strengthening our system of defence. For a long time I have thought that Australia should have an up-to-date system of aerial ships of different types. When the suggestion was first made, it was looked upon as emanating from a man who was in dreamland. But we know the progress which has been made in different countries. </para>

                        <para>- Exactly. Six or seven years ago it was considered by some persons, who were supposed to know everything about defence, that it was humanly impossible to do anything of a practical nature for the defence of this continent other than by following out the old methods. I am of opinion that if a big war should eventuate in a few years it will be different from any previous war. It will be fought, not as before, on the land and the water, but in the air and under the water. Damage will be done by men in submarines and flying machines. I consider that money expended in aerial defence would do much more good, comparatively, than money which is' expended in the building of battle-ships, which are up-to-date to-day and out-of-date to-morrow. I trust that we shall be furnished by the Minister with the information which I seek. </para>

                    <para>. - In regard, to the aviation corps, certain officials were appointed by the previous Government whose business it is to act as instructors, and certain machines were purchased. We are engaged now in erecting on the site that has been provided those buildings which are necessary to enable the officers to utilize their machines and set to work for the purpose for which they were brought here. The item of £10,000 is required ;or putting up the first instalment of the buildings and levelling the ground. Some levelling will be required, fencing and internal roads will be necessary, and, in addition to that, the buildings to be erected are sheds or hangars to accommodate the machines, an engine-shop, a repair shop, a surgery, and other buildings necessary to give the officers and the machines the opportunity of starting on the business for which they were brought here. It is not contemplated, with this item, to make any addition to the flying fleet until those officers have got to work with the plant they have. Once they are engaged on that work, then the time will be ripe, I think, to consider what further purchases should be made, and to what extent those purchases should go. At present it is thought  desirable to get to work the plant we have before we add to it. </para>

I am rather inclined to think that there has been a somewhat lavish expenditure in the erection and furnishing of these buildings. But in. regard to the estimate which is now submitted, I venture to say that there is not much room for extravagance. This expenditure is intended to cover, amongst other things, the construction of a hospital', the establishment of a heating installation, additions to barracks accommodation, a laundry plane,, storm-water drainage, roads, fences, and other similar improvements, . repairs and maintenance, and the ordinary additions to buildings already in existence. I have gone through the estimate very closely, because of the fear I entertained that previously money had been spent to an extent which was not justified. I have cut down the estimate as far as it could be cut down without in any way endangering the efficiency of the establishment; </para>

                    <para>.- While the Government are to be congratulated upon making provision in this Bill for the erection of drill halls, I should like a little information upon how the days appointed for compulsory drills in the case of our Cadets and Citizen Forces are determined. In travelling through Victoria, I find that some area officers, whose enthusiasm outruns their discretion, appear to be carrying matters a little too far. I have been in country districts where an annual holiday, in which the local lads desired to take part, has been appointed for some months ahead, and yet that very day has been selected for compulsory drill purposes. Consequently, numerous complaints have Deen received. On the last occasion that I passed through Bendigo, I met several lads who had very serious complaints to urge on this ac- " count. Bendigo is an important centre, and Saturday afternoon is usually set apart for a football match there. Now, it was well known six months in advance that the final match would be played upon a certain date. Yet, notwithstanding that plenty of other days were available which could be set apart for compulsory drills, this particular date was selected, and the boys were obliged to forego their sport. Whilst I am not prepared to say that sport should be given first consideration, provided that we do not jeopardize the efficiency of the Forces, common sense suggests that these compulsory drills should take place on days which have not been appointed public holidays. We ought to do all that we can to encourage our lads, and not jeopardize the popularity of our defence system by dragging them out on. such days for compulsory drill. I have received ten or twelve complaints from, different districts on this account. The exercise of a little common sense by area, officers would overcome the difficulty. </para>

But, of course; in connexion with the carrying out of a. big system there will always be some officers who, either from forgetfulness or excess of zeal, overlook the matter to» which he has referred. At the same time,, it is not always as easy as it appears to set. aside as a day for compulsory drill a date: which will suit everybody. Quite recently I had an experience of this iu a suburb of Sydney, where a compulsory drill had been 'fixed for a day upon which a football match was to be played in which many of the lads were deeply interested. When I inquired into the matter, I found that the area officer had endeavoured tc» overcome the difficulty, but had ascertained that if he postponed the drill to&gt; another suitable date, it would clash with a regatta, which was an equally important event in the suburb. I would suggest to&gt; <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Russell</inline> that when he hears complaints of this character he should ascertain whether they emanate from a few individuals, or whether they represent the&gt; opinion of the whole Unit. Of course, I will endeavour to see that the convenience of the trainees is met as far as possible. </para>

I recollect reading a few months ago that an ordnance officer was being brought from the Old Country for the purpose of making a special and comprehensive report on the artillery in the Commonwealth. I ask the Minister how far that matter has progressed ? Has the officer arrived here, and is he engaged in making his inspection? Of course, I do not wish to know the details of his report, if it has been presented. It may be in the best interests of the Commonwealth that they should not be disclosed. But I would like to know if the officer is now engaged in making his report; and, if so, I would ask the Minister, for reasons which I will disclose to him privately, to instruct him to report particularly on the fortress artillery of the Commonwealth, especially in regard to guns of emplacement. </para>

                    <para>. - In regard to the item " Erection of Drill Halls, Mobilization Stores, and other accommodation for Citizen Forces - towards cost, £100,000," I desire to know how much of that amount is to be expended upon drill halls. Speaking from memory, the amount appropriated for that purpose last year was £80,000. I wish also to ask the Minister what arrangement he is making with a view to expediting the building of these halls' I frankly confess that I am heartily ashamed when I look at this item for drill halls. I had a bit of a fight when I was in the Department to get a sufficient sum of money on the Estimates. I knew the need there was for drill halls in the country. But I am ashamed when I see that last year, out of £100,000 voted, only £28,884 was spent. That is a reflection on the Department. I was Minister at the time, and I am to blame as much as any: body. I take that blame. I can only say in justification that every week or so I used to ask the officers why the work of constructing drill halls was not pushed on, and the explanations, if not satisfactory, were certainly lengthy. I have been informed by a gentleman not associated with either of the Departments concerned, but who has cognisance of what is going on, that what takes place is this. The Minister can say whether it is correct or not : We adopted three types of drill halls. Each time a drill hall was required, the Defence Department said to the Home Affairs Department, " We want you to put up No. 1, or No. 2, or No. 3," as the case might be. But then I am informed that the Home Affairs Department set about preparing fresh plans for the particular drill hall ordered, instead of having a number of copies of the type plans ready for use immediately. The whole process was gone through over again for each individual drill hall. It seems scarcely credible that that should be done, but I am informed that that is what has taken place. If it be true, it is an explanation of why the money voted by Parliament could not be. spent. </para>

                        <para>- I quite recognise that. I sympathize with every word <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> has said about the delays. There are several causes for them. Sometimes there is a difficulty about the acquisition of the site. I could not substantiate what I am about to say if asked for evidence, but I feel that whenever our officers are set to work to make a deal for the Commonwealth in the matter of purchasing laud, they are apt to be overcareful. They fear lest in some way they should make a mistake, and their error should be put down to some unworthy motive. I can see that a man intrusted with such a duty would desire to be cautious, but the caution exercised at present is such as would not be tolerated in a private concern. In a sense, it is a virtue on. the part of the officers. They are over-cautious lest a mistake should be made. It may arise to some extent from the feeling of <inline font-style="italic">?..n</inline> officer that if he makes a good bargain he will get no particular praise for it, but if he makes a bad one, every one in the town will go round saying that this officer has done something that he ought .not to have done. That is an inducement to officers to be exceedingly cautious to avoid mistakes. Then there are local interests to contend with. There are advocates of one site as against another, and this blocks the progress of works. </para>

                        <para>- These are some of the causes for delay. Another one is that all appropriations made by Parliament expire on the 30th June, and there is a little delay until money is supplied to enable works to proceed again. An arrangement may be approaching completion on the 29th June, and you may be in a position to conclude the business, but after the 30th June there has to be ari interregnum, which means further delay. We are trying to overcome these difficulties in order to further the erection of buildings, which are recognised to be a highly important portion of our universal training system. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> made reference to plans of drill halls. I have made inquiries regarding that matter, and am informed that the position is this: There are three types of drill halls which have been approved by the Defence Department, and plans have been drawn out for each type. They are printed and ready for use. Sometimes a drill hall ha3 to be built in a town where one of these plans is not exactly suitable, but assuming that a site is level, and that there are no difficulties arising from inequalities in the ground, there is a printed plan available. That should be re-assuring to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce.</inline> He seemed to assume that the plans which have been prepared are adaptable to all cases, but I am assured that such is not the fact. </para>

                    <para>.- I went to inspect a drill hall recently erected in the district where I live, and was sorry to observe that 50 per cent, of the timber used in it was imported timber. Inasmuch as our defence system is based upon the patriotism of our youths, we ought to make a special endeavour to give employment to their fathers in the material which we use for construction purposes. No doubt, for certain specific purposes, imported timbers may be better, but at the same time, as far as possible, we ought to use Australian wood, especially in defence work. I trust that the Minister will pay particular attention to this matter. </para>

I would go further, and say that Australian timber should be used wholly in defence buildings. It ought to be the policy of the Australian Government to use Australian materials and products to the utmost. On one or two occasions I have approached Ministers in connexion with the building of Customs-houses, post-offices, drill halls, and so forth, in Western Australia, and have suggested the use of Western Australian timbers. I am glad to say that that has been done to a considerable extent. The policy ought to be generally adopted. </para>

                    (Victoria) [3.121.- In connexion with the vote for woollen mills, I have been informed that one or more Commonwealth officers have been travelling in the Old Country. I should like to know what there business is? There are rumours that part of .their mission was to engage labour for the mills when in operation. But there are at present in Australia, I understand, a number of men who are quite competent to fill any position in a woollen mill, from operating -any portion of the machinery to managing the concern. I should like to know whether arrangements have been made to engage labour in. England. I am satisfied that the Australian workman is well qualified to fill the bill; and unless there are powerful motives for engaging persons from other parts of the world, I disapprove of the policy.

The manager did go to England some time ago, at the instance of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce,</inline> for the purpose of purchasing machinery. That  mission has been completed, and the manager has returned to Australia. I am not aware that he was commissioned to engage labour or to make any promises of employment. I cannot conceive that, in the absence of authority, he would have done so. I can give the Committee my assurance that any employment that is going will be given to Australian workmen. I shall also have in view the object of seeing that local products are used as far as possible. Our policy is, as was that of our predecessors, to make use of Australian products and Australian technical skill in all possible ways. There is no intention on our part to depart from that policy. </para>

During the week, I have, by questions put to the Minister representing the Postmaster-General, called attention to the need for some telephone signal which would indicate to the attendant in the telephone exchange that an urgent call was being made which should be given precedence. I pointed out that last Saturday night a man was killed in Swanston-street by being run over by a motor bus. A policeman went to the telephone to ring up the ambulance, but he had to wait so long for a reply from the Central Exchange that the man had to be taken to the hospital in a cab, and on arrival there it was found that he was dead. It may have been thought that, in referring to the matter, I reflected upon the Central Exchange. I had no wish to do so. There is no man in this Parliament who has a better knowledge than I have of the irritating and nerve-racking nature of the. work which the girls employed in our telephone exchanges have to do. I am satisfied that it is done well. I suggested that the electrical staff of the Department should be asked to consider the adoption of some device which would indicate an urgent call where human life is at stake, and would secure precedence for it by shutting out all other calls until it was attended to. I was informed that no such device has yet been provided, that the officials do not believe that such a device could be arranged, and that if it were possible it would be abused by the public. </para>

If I ring up  a  number that is engaged, I am warned of the fact by a peculiar sound that is transmitted over the wires, and must stand aside until the number is disengaged. I do not believe that it is beyond the intelligence of the electrical staff of the Post and Telegraph Department to devise  a  means whereby  a  call for a doctor or an ambulance in a case where human life is in danger can be given precedence over all other calls. I ask the Minister now to make further representations on the subject, and see whether such an arrangement as I suggest cannot be made. </para>

                    <para>.- Am I right in concluding that the vote set down for sites for wireless telegraph stations is for the site for the high-power station at Darwin to link up with Singapore and the Empire system ? It has been publicly stated that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Swinburne</inline> was brought out here as a wireless expert to advise the Government in regard to the patent gratuitously handed over to the people of Australia by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Balsillie.</inline> The late Government were satisfied that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Balsillie</inline> is a highly qualified officer. They had indisputable evidence of the fact, because, under his supervision, quite a number of wireless stations have been erected in different parts of Australia, and, so far as I know, all are working satisfactorily. I should like to know what was the real object of inducing <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Swinburne</inline> to come to Australia at an expense, I understand, of £2,000, when, according to the indisputable evidence to which I have referred, we have a highly qualified expert here, and, according to our legal advisers, we were quite within our rights in adopting his system, and ran no risk of infringing the patents of the Marconi or Telefunken Companies. I saw a newspaper paragraph to the effect that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Swinburne's</inline> report has been presented, is favorable so far as <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Balsillie's</inline> system is concerned, and justifies the late Government in deciding to defend the action in which the Marconi Company claimed a considerable sum of money for the infringement of their patent. Perhaps the Minister is in a position to say whether or not that statement is correct. </para>

                    <para>. - I shall not delay the Committee, but this is the only opportunity I have to draw public attention to the manner in which expenditure on hew works and additions for postal buildings in the State of Victoria is allocated. I understand that many members of the present Government profess to be the friends of our producers and the residents of the country districts, yet I find from an analysis of the vote set down for new postal works in this State that, out of a total proposed expenditure of £85,156, no less  than £54,182 is to bo expended in the metropolitan district, and only £30,974 in the whole of the country districts of the State. I am not' objecting to necessary expenditure in the metropolitan area, but it does seem to me that the country districts, in which more than half the population of the State reside, are not receiving proper consideration in the matter of expenditure on new works. If I take the expenditure proposed for additions under these votes for this State, and eliminate a vote of £6,093 for sundry offices, I find that, out of a total vote proposed of £7,717, no less than £6,513 is to be expended in the metropolitan area, and a little over £1,200 in the whole of the country districts of the State. I enter my protest against what I regard as an unfair distribution of expenditure for this Department. 'I hope that when the next Estimates are being framed the country districts will receive more consideration. </para>

                    <para>. - <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley</inline> asked some questions regarding the appointment of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Swinburne</inline> to advise the Government in connexion with wireless telegraphy. The honorable senator has said that the previous Government assured themselves that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr.</inline> Balsillie's  patent was unchallengeable. It is one thing for a Government to feel confident about a matter of that kind, and another to engage in a case before the law courts. In this matter we had to consider first of all whether the patent was good, and next the evidence we should furnish to prove it in view of the fact that a considerable sum would be involved if the Government lost the action. We knew that the Marconi people would put the very best case they could before the Court, and would buttress it with the most expert evidence that could be obtained. </para>

                    <para>. - With regard to the matter raised by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Needham,</inline> the reply that came from the Department, as he is aware, was that they had tried a system of what they called "flashing," but discovered that it was very much abused. Persons were found! to be using the system not in a <inline font-style="italic">bond fide</inline> way, and it was temporarily discontinued. The matter was only brought up again yesterday, and there has not yet been time to do anything, but the' Department has been communicated with, and asked to see whether some method cannot be adopted by which urgent telephone calls in case of sickness or accident can be answered at once. I assure the honorable senator that the matter is not being neglected. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Blakey</inline> complained of the large amount which is to be spent in the metropolitan districts as against the country. I have not made an analysis, but on looking cursorily through the list of items, it seems to me that the country is to get a very big share of the vote. I do not know how he has credited the first item of £5,807, because it is not stated where the money is to be spent, but the whole of that amount is to be spent on a number of offices in the country. In addition to that, the building which is being erected in Bourke-street, Melbourne, for a parcels post, postal sorting, and postal stores building will take £45,000. If that amount is deducted from the total vote, it will be seen that the rest of the money is to go to country districts. I shall be glad to show the honorable senator the list of proposed new offices. He will find that the bulk of the vote is to go to country districts, and not to Melbourne. </para>

The re-vote is £50 and the new service £1,395 I do not want to oppose the item because it may be justifiable, but to point out that Newnes is a township . 30 odd miles from the main western line in the Wallan Valley, and that the Commonwealth Oil Corporation, which has recently suspended operations and gone into liquidation, was responsible practically for the very existence of the town, owing to the fact that they were working shale deposits at the bottom of the valley. The township is entirely a creation caused by that company, and is, I am informed, practically deserted. </para>

                    <para>. - I am pleased to see that the Government propose to do something in the matter of extending telegraph lines in Queensland. Hitherto the Government have been very remiss in the matter of constructing the necessary telegraph and telephone lines in that State. Queensland has a vast territory, which is not linked up by railways as other States are, and consequently we have to depend to a great extent on telegraphic communication because of the impossibility of dealing with urgent matters by means of letters. The trouble, however, is that when a storm takes place in the northern part of Queensland, owing to their dilapidated condition the lines get blown down, and interruptions to telegraphic business are so frequent, and often continuous, that I believe special orders had to be given to provide " detained by interruption " stamps. There is not the slightest chance of getting a reply on the same day to a telegram sent from the north to, say , Brisbane, unless the sender pays double fees. Yet we are told that we have such an up-to-date system. It is time we had something done in the way of constructing permanent and substantial lines that will not be blown down with every gust of wind. </para>

There is almost as great a discrepancy in this division dealing with the provision of telephones and telegraphs, aud I would like some Minister to explain why this is the case. Is it because Tasmania is in such a state of perfection as compared with other States that it only requires this small amount of expenditure ; or is it due to the fact that the requirements of Tasmania have been overlooked ? </para>

On the west coast of that State, and also in the Pinnaroo district, large expansion is taking place, aud if honorable senators were seized with the extent of that they would recognise that the amount provided for constructing new lines is much too small. When I was in the South Australian Parliament I knew how difficult it was to get a new telephone or telegraph line, notwithstanding that there were hundreds of people settled where the line was required, and I fear now that the amount provided in these Estimates will be too small by at least two-thirds. </para>

Instead of the total of £85,000 for South Australia in this subdivision, it should be £150,000. </para>

                    <para>. - I have no desire to complain about the amount provided for Tasmania, but I wish to lay before Ministers the very vexed, but, nevertheless, important question of erecting a telephone line to Port Davey, on the south-west coast of the island. I do not bring this matter forward because there is any very large settlement, but simply because a telephone is essential in the interests of humanity. There have been several shipwrecks with loss of life on the south-west coast; and it is necessary that there should be some rapid means of communication between civilized districts and the dep6t which the Tasmanian Government have established at Port Davey for the relief of the shipwrecked mariners. Had a telephone been provided long ago, it is possible that many valuable lives would have been saved. </para>

                    <para>. - Time and again the question of the divided control in the Government Printing Office has been before the Committee. The printing work of the Commonwealth is growing rapidly; and a number of the men who are engaged at the linotype machines, and are in the employ of the Commonwealth, have, from time to time, asked to be made permanent officers, but, so far, without success. The men in the service of the State in the Printing Office have permanent positions, and yet those employed by the Commonwealth have only a temporary status. The time has arrived when the growing requirements of the Commonwealth raise, the question whether we should not have a printing office of our own, independent of State control, and whether our employes should not be made permanent servants. Three or four years ago this question was brought before the Senate by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley;</inline> and I think the Minister should give some indication of whether there is any intention on the part of the Government to establish their own printing office. </para>

While we are in Melbourne, this divided control must, in my opinion,- and in the opinion -of the Ministry, continue, because we can -see no help for it. As to the question of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley,</inline> I took special care to get the information, because I was sure the honorable senator would refer to the matter.

One of the first reforms announced by the present Postmaster-General was the abolition of the kangaroo stamp, and that announcement, I believe, was acclaimed by the philatelists. Shortly afterwards, we were informed that the Postmaster-General intended to still retain on our stamp the imprint of a kangaroo.

I read in the press recently a statement that the present Postmaster-General had arrived at the conclusion that stamp collectors in different parts of the world were ever anxious to secure the latest and most neatly, designed stamps, and that, in order to gratify, the whims and cater for the hobbies of these people in other lands, the honorable gentleman had decided to have printed and published a new stamp bearing the kangaroo's head, together with a design emblematical of Australia. It was stated that in order to make this change there would be an initial expenditure of £3,500, and I am told, on what I consider very good authority, that, if the Postmaster-General carries out what was stated in the press to be his intention, an expenditure of about £10,000 will be incurred in obtaining steel plates and up-to-date machinery to print from them. The difference in the cost of  printing  from steel plates instead of the plates that are now used would be from 3d. to 5d. per thousand, I am informed, and this, I think, would be a gross extravagance calling for condemnation if it is to be undertaken merely to gratify the whims and to cater for the hobbies of stamp collectors in other parts of the world. </para>

                        <para>- I wish to know for what reason this change is proposed ? Confirmatory of this press statement, we had the further question, " Why confine ourselves to one design. There are many who would prefer this or that design? " And, in order that people might have a number to select from, it was stated that the Minister was seriously considering whether we should not have quite a number of stamps bearing different designs. I ask the Minister representing the Postmaster-General to give us the fullest information as to the intentions of the Government in this regard, and whether it is proposed to tax the community to provide for special plates for the printing of these newer stamps bearing the King's head, and to import additional machinery for the work. </para>

                    <para>. - The Government Printing Office is under the Treasurer, and for that reason I am answering these questions. In reply to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Needham,</inline> I may say that it has not yet been decided how many stamps shall be issued. Certain computations are being made relative to the expense that will be incurred. That brings me to the statement made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley,</inline> and I can assure him at once that the Postmaster-General has not, and never had, the idea of playing into the hands of stamp collectors. The question of quality is a totally different consideration. What the Postmaster-General is considering, and to the best of my belief he has not yet settled the point is whether it is desirable to slightly improve the quality of the paper on which our stamps are printed. </para>

I regret very much that no provision lias been made on these Estimates for the establishment of freezing works at Port Darwin. When the parliamentary party visited the Northern Territory, its members were given distinctly to understand by the Administrator that he was making arrangements with stock-owners at the back of the Katherine River to supply a certain number of cattle at certain periods of the year, so that the works which were contemplated might be kept fully supplied. I would like to know whether the Government have decided to do nothing in the direction of establishing those works. Then there is the laundry, at Port Darwin, which, has been so frequently ridiculed as a Socialistic enterprise. As one who has visited the Territory, I sincerely trust that something will be done to alleviate the conditions under which white women labour there. </para>

                    <para>. - I am afraid that I have to make a painful reply to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Rae,</inline> and therefore I desire to answer his question first. I wish to say, in regard to the important question of railway construction in the Northern Territory, that the building of the line from Pine Creek to the Katherine River is provided for in the Loan Bill. The work is not to be constructed out of revenue, and that is why no provision is made for it in this Bill. Knowing <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Rae</inline> as I do, I give this answer with a great deal of trepidation. I can assure <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Blakey</inline> that no subject is causing the Minister of External Affairs more constant anxiety than is the suggested establishment of freezing works at Port Darwin. But it is not his desire to erect Government works there. He agrees with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Blakey</inline> that it is most desirable that freezing works shall be established at Port Darwin, and he hopes before long to be able to make an announcement on the subject. The other question to which the honorable senator referred may be collocated under the heading of sanitary provision for the Northern Territory. If he will look at these Estimates, he will see that attention has been given to that matter. A considerable sum is included in them for that very purpose. </para>

Certain sums have been expended in connexion with this railway out of revenue, but the Government does not intend to construct the whole line out of revenue. As to the cottages, I have no particulars; but the total amount is made up of a number of small sums. </para>

The Cockatoo Island dockyard is primarily a shipbuilding establishment, its slips being to-day fully occupied. Garden Island, on the other hand, was designed for, and is being continued as, a repairing and refitting establishment, and as the site for victualling stores, torpedo stores, oil stores, and other purposes. I am not prepared to say whether the Government will continue indefinitely to use both these establishments as they are now being used, but at the present time I am advised that it is necessary to continue their use. </para>

                                <para>- There is no need for the honorable senator to ask me that question. He has learned from the message which I have read that permission has only been granted to such members of the House of Representatives as are named in the message. It is quite ridiculous to ask me why the House of Representatives has or has not done a certain thing. I have no responsibility for what that House does. </para>

                        <para>. - I have asked the Minister for Defence several questions with reference to the discharge of men from the Fitzroy Dock, Cockatoo Island. To-day I have received a telegram from Sydney, stating that the position is that a number of shipwrights have been discharged owing to the want of material. I wish to ask the Minister to hasten the inquiry which he promised to make. It is unfair that these workmen should be thrown out of employment on account of blundering somewhere. I do not say where the blundering has been, but at all events these men have been made to suffer for it. I hope that before we meet again the Minister will make inquiries with the object of putting the men back to work again. </para>

So far, my inquiries have shown me that the statement that they were consequent upon some blundering in the head office is not correct. I am now endeavouring to find out exactly what the position is. I have sent a message to the acting manager urging him to' expedite the report that has been asked for, but up to the time when I left the Navy Office the report had not come to hand. </para>

Here we have a. gentleman occupying the position of Prime Minister, who has repeatedly made statements alleging corrupt practices and roll-stuffing in connexion with the general election. He has made those statements, not only on the floor of the House of Representatives, but from almost every public platform where he has addressed meetings in the country. The Senate, in its wisdom, appointed a Select Committee to inquire into the allegations made by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr.</inline></para>

I think Che question is of sufficient importance for <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Cook</inline> to have at least treated the Senate and its Committee with common courtesy by appearing. </para>

                            <para>- I thought that he was at least a man, and that, having had the courage to make these statements about roll-stuffing and corrupt practices - charges hurled against the last Administration from many platforms - he would have had the courage and the manliness to come before the Committee and repeat his statements on oath. But I find from the message read by the  President  to-day that the only members of another place authorized to appear before the Select Committee are members of the Labour party. The other gentlemen named  in  our message have been refused permission or have treated the Committee with contempt. I will go further and say that the action of the Prime Minister especially is on a par with his conduct in connexion with another Select Committee of the Senate appointed to inquire  into  the dismissal of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chinn.</inline> The Prime Minister refused to that Committee the funds required for prosecuting its inquiries in Kalgoorlie, where <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chinn</inline> was employed. The Prime Minister treated the Committee and the Senate with contempt. Now, when another opportunity  is  given to the Prime Minister and others of his party to prove their charges about roll-stuffing, &amp;c., and the Prime Minister  is  invited to come along - not simply by virtue of his office, but as a citizen of Australia - and give evidence on oath, he shirks the job in a manner characteristic of him. I make this protest, and I express a sincere hope that, if he has not the courage to come before a Select Committee of this National Parliament and give his evidence on oath, he will, in the future, be silent as regards alleged roll-stuffing and corrupt practices at the last Federal elections. </para>

                            <para>- No; but I have very good reasons for believing that if <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Cook</inline> were a free agent, and were permitted to do as he wishes, he would comply with the request of the Senate, and would come before the Select Committee which has been referred to and give his evidence. I am satisfied that whatever honorable senators may say about <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Cook,</inline> they cannot say that he lacks courage. Look at the manly way in which he goes on to all the Women's League . platforms in the Commonwealth and denounces the things done at the last election by the late Government. Look at the manly way in which he stands up to every charge he has hurled at the Labour party. Has he not stated these things over and over again; have they not been printed by the daily press; and is that not a sufficient proof of his courage and manliness? Still <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Needham</inline> will complain that the honorable gentleman is wanting in courage. Another message has been sent to the House of Representatives asking that Mr.' Cook should be given leave to attend and give evidence before the Select Committee appointed to inquire into the dismissal of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chinn.</inline> It is quite true, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Needham</inline> has said, that the Government have refused funds to enable the Committee to go to Kalgoorlie and investigate the matter there. It is quite true that they have refused to permit officers of the Department to come here from Kalgoorlie to give their evidence; but I feel quite sure that when the time comes <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Cook</inline> will make good all the charges he has made against the Committee. </para>

                            <para>- No doubt the honorable senator is also good at low comedy, and has played as many parts in his time as has the gentleman whom we are now discussing. I repeat that I am satisfied that when we get the reply to the second message sent by the Senate to the House of Representatives, we shall find that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Cook</inline> will come before the Committee inquiring into the dismissal of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chinn,</inline> and will make good all the charges he has hurled against it. It is because I feel quite sure that he will do so that I stand up here this afternoon to say a word on behalf  of  the much-abused Joe Cook. </para>
