                        <para>- I have to give the same answer to this question as I have given to others - that the information has not yet been obtained. May I be permitted to remind honorable senators that they themselves enjoyed a holiday yesterday, and that one of the results of the Senate enjoying the holiday was that all the Departments enjoyed it, too. </para>

If honorable senators object to that, I can say nothing. At the same time, if I may be allowed to do so, I would remind the Senate that invariably it has been difficult to give replies to questions on Friday. </para>

                    <para>. - I think it is rather deplorable that the Standing Orders should be suspended so frequently. The Opposition up to the present time have refrained from interfering with the ordinary course of business in accordance with the Standing Orders, as far as they possibly could; but as the Government are setting us such a deplorable example, it may be found necessary in the future, seeing that we are not furnished with business to the extent that we might be, to suspend many standing orders. There is no member of the Opposition who has not in the past shown every anxiety to assist the Government to carry on business. Supply has not been blocked. Everything has been done to help in that direction. Yet when members of this Government go about the country addressing ladies' meetings and  'bun struggles, ' ' they are continually complaining about the obstruction of business in Parliament. It is nearly time that that sort of thing should stop. .It is time that the Government were given t6,under.stand that if they are not prepared to carry on the business of the country as it ought to be conducted, it will be necessary for the Opposition to take a hand. </para>

                <para class="block">I suppose that the gentlemen whom the Prime Minister was addressing were quite unaware of the fact that these Supply Bills afford the only opportunity we have, as representatives of the people, to criticise the administration of the Government. When he told his audience that we were hanging up the Supply Bill, they cried, "Shame!" Were we hanging up the Supply Bill ? I venture to say that the debate in another place on the Supply Bill which we are to consider to-day was about the shortest on record. I think that will be the experience here also. . I am surprised that, in order to make political capital, Ministers should say these things outside. They must result in reprisals here. Honorable senators on this side do not propose to interfere with the motion now before the Senate, although when similar motions were submitted during the. last Parliament no one more vigorously denounced them than did <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> when leading the Opposition in this Chamber. It is time that the country was informed that the humbug which Ministers talk outside is merely intended to cover up their tracks, and that the Government do not desire- to. do anything. The speech which I have just quoted would warrant honorable senators on this side voting against the motion now before us, and if it were defeated the retaliation would be justifiable. I point out that, even if it were defeated, the civil servants would still get their pay in time, as we could sit to-morrow and pass Supply before the end of the month, and their wages and salaries are not due until the end of the month. The statement of the Prime Minister that we are preventing the payment of the civil servants is an absolute falsehood, and that gentleman ought to know it. It was made merely to mislead the people. In the helpless position in which- the Ministerial party is in the Senate, it . is very unwise of members of the Government to make these malicious statements outside. They will undoubtedly provoke reprisals if they are continued. . </para>

Time after time we read that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McColl</inline> has made statements such as those attributed to the Prime Minister, and casting unwarrantable reflections on the members of the Opposition in this branch of the Legislature. In the interests of decency, and that fair play which should characterize the relations between parties, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McColl,</inline> when he is next addressing the electors, should seriously consider whether the statements which he has been in the habit of making are quite fair to the Opposition in the Senate. I claim that members of the Opposition in this Chamber have done everything to facilitate public business. I direct attention to the fact that, in reply to questions from this side, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator</inline></para>

I have no desire to obstruct the passage of this Supply Bill; but we have reached that stage in the existing dispute between political parties when some greater sense of fair play should be exhibited by Ministers in addressing meetings than has been exhibited by the Prime Minister and the Vice-President of the Executive Council during the past few weeks.

                            <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor</inline>
                            said that, although, when the late Government were in office, vigorous protests were made against the suspension of our Standing Orders by honorable senators upon this side of the Chamber, the present Ministry were following the same course. He knows very well that there has not been a Supply Bill submitted to the Senate unaccompanied by exactly a similar proposal. Honorable senators opposite were in office for three years, and, during that period, they never took any course other than is being taken to-day. It is true that we protested against it on the ground that Supply Bills were frequently brought forward at the last possible moment, when there was no adequate opportunity of discussing them. The suspension of the Standing Orders in such circumstances was a gross infringement of ordinary political decency and propriety. Honorable senators opposite abuse their privileges for political purposes, and not from an honest desire to do the business of the country.

In a Senate which is composed of twenty-nine Labour members and of only seven Liberals, what need have the former to obstruct? They can do just as they like. It is extraordinary -that honorable senators opposite should take this opportunity of protesting against the suspension of the Standing Orders and then affirm, as

                    <para>. - As a new member of the Senate, I must express my astonishment that the honorable and gallant colonel who has just resumed his seat should have become so excited over a little matter. In view of his exhibition, I shall certainly be apprehensive, should the time ever arrive when he is called upon to lead troops against an invading force, because it is an axiom in military campaigning that one needs to keep cool under fire. I realize, therefore, that even the honorable senator could hardly be regarded as a fitting example in this respect to the rank and file. But my main object in rising is to indorse, to a very large extent, the remarks which have been made by my colleagues on the front Opposition bench concerning certain misstatements as to the status and general conduct of members of the Opposition in this Chamber. One would imagine that the twenty-nine Labour senators had no right to be here. One would think that the electors who had sent them here had committed a dreadful crime. May I point out that we are not responsible for what the States may do. If the States in their wisdom decide in a constitutional way that they will be represented by Labour senators, we will represent them. If I do not misjudge affairs in the Commonwealth, in the event of another appeal to the people, the Labour party in this Chamber will come back stronger than ever. As a new member, I note with regret the attitude adopted by certain political veterans in the matter of belittling this great institution, the Senate. On every conceivable occasion certain gentlemen in another place, as well as here, persist in attempting to belittle this Chamber. I think it is absolutely undignified on their part to do anything of the sort. I, of course, can quite understand what some honorable gentlemen have in view. As a matter of fact, they do not like the idea of the Senate being elected as it is. </para>

                <para class="block">I take this opportunity to reply to the debate - which, perhaps, was a little irrelevant - on the previous motion. I very much appreciate the attitude of the Opposition with regard to Supply Bills, especially when I remember their number - I never can forget that. I do not hesitate to assure <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor</inline> that I regret very much the necessity of suspending the Standing Orders in order that Supply Bills may be submitted here. But I feel sure he will agree with 'me' that, no matter what the desire of the Government may be in the Senate, it is almost impossible, with regard to the early Supply Bills, to avoid taking that course in order to get the measures before the Senate. The Government could have introduced at once- whether the Senate would have allowed the Bill to pass or not, I do not know - a Bill for two months' Supply, which, of course, would have obviated the necessity  of suspending the Standing Orders twice. </para>

                        <para>- I will not say that we were frightened in that regard. There was, of course, one reason. I admit, frankly - that it was net certain that the Opposition would not have replied to a request for three months' Supply, " We do not care to give it to you." But there was another reason for our action, and I venture to say that it must appeal to every honorable senator, no matter where he sits, and that is that the first reading of a Supply Bill affords, what every member of the Senate has always wanted, an opportunity of dealing with general matters of policy. </para>

That is to say, they belong to that class which it is to be hoped will secure the full concurrence of the Opposition. </para>

                        <para>- Is that quite a generous remark? Have the special adjournments of the Senate been moved owing solely to the strong desire of' the Government to adjourn ? I certainly found, in moving for those adjournments, that I had the full concurrence of honorable senators opposite. Indeed, I had to get their full concurrence in regard to every adjournment we desired over the ordinary sitting days. I think I have replied, as far as seems desirable to me at present, to the remarks which have been made about introducing Supply Bills, and I shall say no more at present. </para>

                    <para>. - I hope that the representatives of the Government in the Senate will not imagine for a minute that any member of the Opposition was opposing, or even complaining about, the suspension of the Standing Orders: We know that no business of this character could be dealt with to-day unless that course were followed. In our remarks, we only meant to call attention to the conduct of those who are now carrying on the government of the country when we were in office with respect to suspending the Standing Orders. A motion for that purpose was never moved in the Senate without being complained of, and complained of very strongly, by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gould.</inline> He has been a perpetual grumbler at anything which has ever been proposed by the party represented on this side. We have a right to complain of the conduct of business in the Senate, and the very contention of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Clemons,</inline> who is leading the Government here today, that he had to obtain our concurrence, shows that the members of the Opposition have such sympathy with the small band of heroes opposite . who are endeavouring to carry on the business of the country in this Chamber that we are prepared to always treat them leniently. I am very glad that the honorable senator has made that admission. I am also pleased to learn that it is the intention of the Government to bring business before the Senate. Parliament has been in session for nearly three months, and the Senate has sat only about one week altogether, The reason why we agreed to special adjournments was because we thought that the Government were in a difficult position and wanted to help them out of it. Owing to the manner in which we have been referred to, in almost every case, where an opportunity has been afforded to members and supporters of the Government, we may be compelled to abandon, the leniency which we have shown hitherto, and, in the interests of the people of Australia, to introduce measures to which we are pledged. I am sure . that if that time should arrive, the members and. supporters of the Ministry here will not be in a position to complain-. With regard to the action of the Government in connexion with Supply .generally, it may be easily realized that, so far as a first Supply Bill is concerned, there are always certain limitations which are recognised, and that, consequently, a Supply Bill for a large amount might not be acceded to, though the Opposition in another place allowed the Government six weeks' Supply. Was any attempt made to find out the attitude of the Opposition with respect to the second Supply Bill? So far as my knowledge goes, no one in the Senate, in' view' of the circumstances existing, would have complained about a Bill for two months' Supply. The granting of one month's Supply just landed the Parliament of Australia in the middle of the visit of the Parliamentarians from Great Britain, and also in Show Week, which is a most difficult time for getting Supply of any kind. If* the Government had had any foresight at all, they would have anticipated that position, and put these facts to the Opposition in another place, as well as to the Opposition here, when, I feel sure, two months' Supply would have been granted, and all this wrangling and waste of time would have been saved. With respect to this Supply Bill, we must admit that the amount, asked for one month's Supply is very moderate. I am not going to complain, but to call the attention of honorable senators, and the people of the country, to the fact that scarcely a Supply Bill has been introduced by a Labour Government without very strong criticism being indulged in, and serious objection raised to voting any considerable amount for the Treasurer's Advance. Yet, in one Supply Bill this session, an advance of £250,000 to the Treasurer was asked for by the present Government; and in this Supply Bill an advance of no less than £300,000 is asked for. That means over £500,000 in two months for purposes of the Treasurer's Advance. We may be ignorant of some of the conditions requiring a larger amount than would appear to be necessary. It may be the intention of the Treasurer, quite apart from the sanction of the Government, to proceed with the works at Cockburn Sound. It may be his intention to do many things without the advice and sanction of his own colleagues. Therefore, we, as members of the Opposition, have stronger reasons for objecting to this extended Treasurer's Advance than has been the case previously. But I do not think that any member of the Opposition intends to oppose the grant. Of course, we know that <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> Forrest finds no difficulty in spending any money that is advanced to him. What is a million to him? I thought it right to call attention to the large amount of the Treasurer's Advance in order that it may be known that we are watching what is occurring. Every honorable senator will have an opportunity of expressing his opinion on grievances and matters of policy, but I hope that before we adjourn to-day the Supply Bill will be carried, and that no public servant will be alarmed as to the prospect of receiving his salary next week. </para>

                    <para>. - I welcome this opportunity of saying a few words by way of taking up the challenge thrown out by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Clemons</inline> that we should criticise the work of Ministers, and generally review the political position. I wish to refer to the statement made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> earlier in the week.  His  declaration has been somewhat clouded, but there is no doubt whatever that, in reply to a question from our leader, he did say that the Government would not introduce any measure in the Senate this session which involved a question of policy. There is no getting away from that position. When I asked <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> whether, in making that announcement, he was not ignoring the Senate, he jocularly replied that he was not, because he was recognising the present position of parties here. The statement of the honorable senator is being re-echoed from every platform from which a member of this Ministry speaks. They are doing all they can to belittle the Senate. I hold in my hand a copy of the policy statement issued by the Government. It refers to a number of measures involving Government policy, some of which are non-contentious and might easily be introduced in the Senate. But let me pin <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> down to his own statement, that it is not the intention of the Government to introduce any Bill involving Government policy in this Chamber until the question has been reviewed in another branch of the Legislature. I say that such an attitude is absolutely in defiance of the wish of the people of Australia. One would think that the twenty-nine Labour senators had been sent here in a surreptitious manner - that they had been forced here against the wish of the people. One would think that the electors had not sent them here by means of a free adult franchise. I have had the honour of being a member of the Senate for about seven years, and I can recollect occasions when the party to which I belong was in a minority. We did not hear from Ministers of the Crown in those days statements reflecting on the constitution .of the Senate, and upon the judgment of the electors of Australia. That is really the cardinal point. The people of Australia on the 31st May were faced by two political armies, which, through their leaders and candidates, laid certain proposals before the people. The election was taken. The result was that the Senate was composed of twenty-nine on one side, and seven on the other. For Ministers of the Crown to reflect on the judgment of the electors, as has been done lately, is unheard of in the history of Australia or of parliamentary government. The attitude of Ministers on public platforms is decidedly different from their attitude when speaking here or in another branch of the Legislature. </para>

                        <para>- Let it be remembered that this Senate, in common with the House of Representatives, is elected by the franchise of every man and woman in this country over twenty-one years of age who has been a resident here longer than six months. Practically the whole manhood and womanhood of the country is qualified to vote for both branches of the National Parliament. Except in regard to money Bills, the Senate has co-equal powers with the other House. The attitude of Ministers is, therefore, not comprehensible, and will certainly tend to a situation with which honorable senators opposite may not be altogether pleased. If it is the view of Ministers that the Senate is not worth considering, the best thing they can do is to abandon their seats on the Ministerial bench, and say that they will have nothing more to do ' with this Chamber. They know perfectly well that they are helpless, and that at any time the majority of the members of the Senate can compel them to bow to our will. They are as mild as babes when they are here, but when on the platform outside they are like roaring lions. </para>

                        <para>- Take <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McColl.</inline> From the way in which he discharges his functions, one wonders whether he is really in the Ministry or not. At any rate, he is a tiny little mite when he is here. But when he is at a "teafight," he speaks as if he were going to move empires. I trust that the Government will reconsider their determination, and will introduce here measures, even though they involve Government policy. We have every right to have Bills brought before us. The present attitude of the Government is simply defiant -to the people of Australia. I wish to say a word in connexion with the dismissal of a number of men from the Kalgoorlie end of the trans-Australian railway. The Honorary Minister certainly gave me a reply to my question, but he said nothing about the discourteous treatment which I had received. I can only assume that it was due to the Assistant Minister of Home Affairs, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Kelly.</inline> I remember on another occasion making a statement about a matter of public policy affecting the Minister of External Affairs; and, when I found that I was wrong, I made the <inline font-style="italic">amende honorable</inline> on the next day of sitting. But when I asked <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Kelly,</inline> over the telephone, a question relative to the dismissal of about seventy men from the Kalgoorlie end of the railway, he curtly told me that I must put my question in writing, as he declined to answer it across the telephone. I said that I would send him a letter, and did so. This occurred during the debate on the no-confidence motion in the House of Representatives; but I received no reply from him, nor did I even get an acknowledgment of my letter. Treatment of that kind towards representatives of the people, when asking for information directly affecting their constituents, is not worthy of a Government; and I hope that it will not be continued, no matter what party is in power. </para>

                        <para>- I do not think that it will be a very serious act of condescension for the Minister to reply in this instance. In 'the Legislature of Tasmania, according to the <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> of yesterday, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr.. Earle,</inline> leader of the Opposition, on Wednesday last - moved the adjournment of the House to ask the Government to protest against the contract which the Federal Government proposed to enter into with the Union Shipping Company for seven years. He said if the Labour paTty had been returned, Tasmania would now have had an efficient national mercantile fleet, but as it was the service had got more inconvenient than ever. It was a continual experience for boats from Victoria to miss the connecting trains in the north, and strand passengers and mails at Launceston and Burnie, while the commerce of Tasmania wai chronically dislocated. </para>

                <para>I wish to asktheMinister whether the Government intend to give the Premier of Tasmania an opportunity of seeing that contract before it is finally agreed to? If so, why not give the information to the Senate? I understand, on the very best authority, that the. contract is to be for a period of five years, and that the subsidy to be paid is £2,000 more than the present subsidy; whilst the service is to be one of four days per week, such as was proposed when the Fisher Government were in office. There are to be two boats each way between Launceston and Melbourne, and two <inline font-style="italic">viâ</inline> Burnie. I hope, before the contract is ratified, the repeated protests of the representatives of Tasmania will be taken into consideration, and that we shall have an opportunity of seeing the contract before the final steps are taken.

                    <para>. - The fact that we are meeting here in the twelfth week since the opening of this Parliament, and have so far' done nothing in the way of legislation in the Senate except to pass the necessary Supply Bills, shows that whatever their professions may be the present Ministry are doing their best to belittle, flout, and ignore this Chamber. I think that a most reprehensible and regrettable example has been set by the Prime Minister in denouncing the Senate wherever he may happen to be. There never was in the history of Australian politics a man who chattered -more, who uttered more pious platitudes, cheap wit, and smug hypocrisy generally than the honorable gentleman. There never was in Australian politics any one who so disgraced his office as has this renegade Prime Minister, who is the most splendid liar in Australia to-day ! </para>

He has used a great many expressions to describe the conduct of a gentleman or individual who for many years past has been prominent in public life, and who is not very particular as to what he says about other people. When it comes to collecting all these statements together, and characterizing them as deliberate lies, I recognise some necessity for the withdrawal of anything of that kind. If the references were made to the private conduct of an individual the case would be entirely different, but when they apply to the public conduct of an individual, though I agree that it would not be in order to charge him distinctly with lying, I should like to be informed as to what portion of his statements <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Raeis</inline> expected to withdraw. </para>

                        <para>- Very well, sir. I think I am amply justified in the most extreme criticism of . a person who, holding a very high public position, continually tries to belittle -and degrade the Senate. I want to know where, in these circumstances, our remedy lies. The Senate is a coordinate branch of the Legislature, and we should have some remedy against those who indulge in a confirmed habit of continuously belittling and degrading this institution. At the last, as well as during previous elections, members of the party that now happens to be in power were very emphatic in their statements that the Constitution under which this Parliament exists deserved to be treated with respect, and even with veneration, because of the eminent gentlemen who originally drew it up. On every platform in Australia, the Opposition were assailed for attempting, it was alleged, to destroy the Constitution, but nothing could be more destructive of the Constitution than the attitude recently adopted by Ministers in attacking this important branch of the National Parliament,, and continually referring to it as "the undemocratic Senate," and suggesting that we are blocking public business, and taking it out of the hands of the Government. The members of the party led by the present Prime Minister have been foremost in making these accusations and charges, and in this way attempting to degrade the Constitution which they profess to so revere. It appears to me that, while the Senate may wisely ignore the statements of outside bodies, we have reason to protest against the statements made by the Prime Minister. There is no more self-contradictory man in the world than the honorable gentleman, and it is therefore not surprising to find that, while we are accused of standing in the way of the policy of the Government being placed on the statute-book, he has been assuring public meetings that the best thing that could happen Australia would be a complete rest from all legislation. The language I used regarding him was not used in heat, but calmly and deliberately. </para>

I did not speak without warrant. I take the statement that the Opposition in another place held up Supply, and it is evident from the reports appearing in the daily press, which practically agree that it was made for the purpose of inducing those who were listening to the Prime Minister to believe that the Labour party were trying to prevent the wages of the civil servants being paid. The honorable gentleman was attempting to arouse- animosity by putting before his auditors "a false issue. </para>

                        <para>- I am not; and I have do reason to be. The result of the last elections goes to show that there is a growing feeling in favour of Labour all over Australia, and so far as it was a victory for the party opposite, it was due only to the deliberate misrepresentations of the press, and the more deliberate misrepresentations of many candidates on the alleged Liberal side. My object in rising was to call attention to the fact, especially in view of the standing order under which I had to withdraw the truth, that that standing order should be put in force in regard to some one else. As I read it, we are not supposed to reflect on members of the State Parliaments. That should be a mutual obligation, and they should, in like manner, abstain from casting reflections on us. I find- that at a meeting of the alleged Liberal People's Party, held last night, the Premier of Victoria said, amongst other things, " The most amazing farce yet perpetrated in Australia was the Chinn inquiry." He then proceeded to say that the matter was <inline font-style="italic">sub judice,</inline> and he could not therefore express any opinion on the merits of it. This was after he had denounced it as the greatest political farce ever perpetrated in Australia. He goes on to refer to the celebrated French trial, which was satirized by the humorist Dooley, who said that the Court denounced the prisoner as a monster of iniquity, and proceeded to record a verdict before hearing any evidence. But even worse follows. Towards the close of his remarks, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Watt</inline> said - </para>

I do not suggest that State and Federal politicians have not mutual interests, and that a member of any political party has not an interest in the State as well as the Federal politics of his country. But for the Premier of a State to go out of his way to pronounce opinions on a question which is <inline font-style="italic">sub judice,</inline> and with which he is not concerned, to denounce the members of the Chinn Committee as men who are incapable of doing justice to anybody, is nothing short of an outrage. If the Senate is to be subjected to these continued onslaughts by those who ought to be its defenders, instead of its assailants, it is time that we took action. There would be an outcry from one end of the Commonwealth to the other if anything of a similar character were hinted at by a Labour member. </para>

                        <para>- Any self-respecting Government would take action in this matter. They would defend the measures and the acts which are constitutionally performed by the Legislature. If they fail to do so, it is the duty of the Senate to take action without undue delay. I wish also to point out that every act on the part of the Senate is prejudiced in the eyes of the public- first, by those who should be its defenders, and, secondly, by a corrupt press, which systematically reports anything to the detriment of the party in opposition, and as assiduously cloaks the most infamous acts when committed by their political friends. Until this sort of conduct is altered our parliamentary institutions will continue to be  degraded. We know that there is not a member of this Parliament who dare attack the <inline font-style="italic">bona fides</inline> of any member of the Chinn Committee by saying outside what these high politicians are permitted to say at their party gatherings. An action for libel would be laid if any individual member of the Committee were attacked. An attempt has been made to cast disgrace and obloquy on those who constitute the Committee collectively, but not on its members individually. It is part of that universal mud-slinging policy which has been adopted by the Government, from the Prime Minister downwards, and which wa3 very largely responsible for the success of the so-called Liberal party at the recent elections. </para>

                        <para>- My complaint is that they are made in such a general way as to prevent the members of the Committee, individually, from securing any legal redress. Of course, I am not out to defend <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bakhap</inline> personally. I am speaking of the Committee and of the Senate which appointed it. As a matter of fact, the reactionary attitude of the Government upon most questions must call forth determined opposition. If they had sufficient political <inline font-style="italic">nous</inline> they would bring forward measures of a non-contentious character - measures the enactment of which would be to the benefit of this country. Such Bills would receive proper consideration, and would probably be placed upon our statute-book. It is only because they are anxious to avoid going to the country that the Senate is prevented from doing practical business. They are afraid of the consequences. </para>

                        <para>- Even that is of a non-party character. The reason why a policy of drift is being pursued in the Senate is that the party who are in power are absolutely afraid to bring forward any legislative proposals of a serious character. They are merely marking time in order that they may enjoy the distinction and emoluments of office and the chance of giving effect to the most reactionary policy possible, not by means of legislation, but by means of administration. The confession of the Attorney-General that objections will be received from any organization against the name of any person on the electoral roll without a deposit of 5s., if not a direct breach of the law, is one of the most scandalous acts which have yet been committed by this most scandalous Ministry. There has never been a more deliberate attempt to effect the wholesale disfranchisement of the workers than that which is now being made. I recollect some years ago, when the pioneers of the same party which is endeavouring to do this thing here, attempted the same dodge in New South Wales. I remember taking an oath at the time upon a blackthorn stick that I would brain the man who was responsible for my name being removed from the roll if the objection succeeded. Luckily for him, he withdrew his objection. The same method, I repeat, was adopted in New South Wales to strike the names of people off the roll in a wholesale fashion before the advent of Federation. It is idle for <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gould</inline> to suggest that it is only proper that any person should be permitted to lodge an objection. We know that it is objections by the Tory organizations which have created and which rule the Ministry for which this provision has been made. These associations are levying blackmail on the commercial classes of the community to provide them with funds with which to do their infamous work. They are sending out circulars to the business people of every State demanding practically that they shall contribute to their funds. </para>

                        <para>- I hope so; and if it knew its duty it would give a great deal more than it does. The honorable senator knows quite well, although he is attempting, as he always does, to cloud the issue, that there is no objection to an honest contribution to any party, whether it is his or any other. These secret attempts to blackmail business men are worse than anything which could be charged against any union in Australia. Business men are threatened with boycott, loss of trade, bank pressure, and so ou, unless the demands are complied with. Not only the gathering in of these funds, which is sometimes accomplished in an objectionable way, but the manner in which they are used from the moral point of view, is absolutely criminal. To disfranchise thousands of electors in every State is the chief end and aim of the reactionary party, headed at present, from a legal stand-point, by the Attorney-General, who practically invites people to come along and show reasons why persons should be disfranchised. The statement is made that no harm can be done by handing in an objection to a name on the roll ; that any one giving information that So-and-so is supposed to be dead, or to have left the residence for which he is  enrolled,  cannot do that person any harm, -because a philanthropic policeman will go and make inquiries before any positive action is taken. This morning the daily press of Melbourne states that the Opposition are raising a false alarm - -a storm in a tea-pot; that we do not seriously believe that there is any harm in this thing being done. But our past experience shows us that where a large number of objections are made, a very large proportion of them are upheld, because, in the ordinary walks of life, there are thousands of men who are away from their homes temporarily - I refer, to men who are going shearing or following an occupation of a casual character which takes them away from their abodes, and naturally, being poor, they are less settled as to place of residence than the wealthy' and property-owning classes. There are tens of. thousands who get struck off the rolls, because once an objection is urged against a man's name he may not hear of the objection until it is too late for him to reply. I have no wish to run down the police in any way, or to depreciate the valuable services they render to the community, but I can say that in New South Wales the police are so overloaded with duties quite extraneous to ordinary police work that it is impossible for them to adequately look after the various matters which are referred to them. There is no reason why they should be expected to do so. This is a deliberate, wicked, and infamous plot on the part of the Ministry to strike as many as possible of their political opponents off the rolls. They have their well-paid organizers to object, as well as their associations. At the same time, they have every facility, every power and influence which money can give, to look after their own pets - those who are likely to be their supporters. The rest of the community are looked upon as poor and friendless by comparison, and the Liberals are making a bitter, ferocious, and wholly unjustifiable attack upon them. Their electoral proposals teem with reaction from beginning to end, and all attempts to carry a measure of that kind into law will, I hope, be met with the most strenuous opposition from this side. Whatever good there is in the Bill, by all means let us adopt it and carry it. It is in keeping with the whole of their proposals. The proposal to prevent electors from being enrolled for a considerable time before the date of an election, the proposal to compel all electors to sign butts, and thus to make it impossible for men to get through the polling booth quickly, and all the other reactionary proposals, justify, not merely a suspicion, but a conviction, that the motive urged by the Attorney-General - the arch-priest of Conservatism in .this State-- </para>

                        <para>- No ; I leave that to the "law and order" crowd on the other side. I do not want to join him. Honorable senators on the other side, who are very loud in objecting to this, that, and the other being done by the Labour party, whether in office or in Opposition, have always preached about upholding the dignity of the Senate and maintaining its rights. Yet they not only look, but speak, from the same platforms as their State friends, who are not merely denouncing the Senate, but holding it up to contempt and ridicule, and are guilty of the disgraceful conduct of practically condemning a body before it has presented a report, or even dealt with the matter referred to it. If they are not prepared to allow their party feeling to sink sufficiently to uphold the dignity, the rightful power and influence of this branch of the Legislature, they are bringing down upon themselves a fate which they will richly deserve. I do not intend to say anything in regard to the question of Supply, but I think it will be quite right, on the part of the Senate, to take the business out of the hands of this inept Government now, and act in regard to the insulting and disgraceful attitude of the Premier of Victoria in his comments on the action of the Senate. If the leaders of the Labour party do not see fit to do so, I am not prepared to take any action, but I do protest most strongly against this kind of proceeding. Furthermore, the whole attitude of the party in power is to try to bring disgrace and ridicule upon this branch of the Australian Parliament. We should do away for ever with the obsolete provision which prevents the Senate from going on with business until another place has finished its discussion on a motion of censure or similar matter. While the motion of censure was pending - and the debate lasted three or four weeks - it would have been quite possible for the Senate to have effected a great deal of useful work, besides disposing of the Address -in-Reply. Yet we were perforce kept idle, and dragged at the heels of the other House, although the Constitution has charged us with responsibilities and duties which are rendered futile by this absurd deference being paid to the attitude taken up in another place. It is time that we acted independently of that House. Whatever rights and powers we have under the Constitution, we should proceed to put them into full and effective use. I am utterly sick of this plan of adjourning the Senate for a week, then for three or four weeks, and then for four or five days, thereby putting in the greater part of the session in practically tailing away after another House, which is doing little better. </para>

                    <para>. - <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Rae</inline> remarked, at the close of his speech, that if certain things were brought about he would welcome a double dissolution. Every observing man, I think, has come to the conclusion that a single dissolution is very imminent, and is likely to take place any day. Every observing man, too, must realize that a double dissolution, so far as the immediate future is concerned, is unthinkable, and absolutely impossible. Realizing, as our opponents do, that a general election is not far distant, and having the opportunity of fixing their own time, as the Prime Minister said they intended to do, evidences are not wanting that the Government, true to their traditions, are going to try to win the next election by hook or by crook. They hope, they say, that in connexion with the next election there will be fair play and pure rolls. I hope the day is not far distant when we shall have fair play in connexion with Commonwealth elections, and, if fair play is meted out to both parties, I know the party that will sink and the party that will swim. The Labour party has never had anything approaching fair play in political contests in Australia. We have been hampered in every possible direction. We have been weighted down by misrepresentation and vile slander. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McColl</inline> is one who, since he has been in office, has made many speeches in the country. They have been marked by the bitterness which is characteristic of him. I do not suppose that there is a man in public life in the whole of Victoria who stirs up so much strife, and is so vitriolic in his remarks as he is. He professes to desire to see class prejudice removed. Almost ever since he has been in public life he has lived on class prejudice, and has endeavoured, by innuendo and incorrect statements, to make people believe things which, in his heart of hearts, he knows to be absolutely untrue. </para>

The honorable senator may smile, but any serious minded man occupying a public position under the Commonwealth should hesitate before making such statements as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McColl</inline> has made since the election. Not long ago he made a speech at Fitzroy, for some of the statements in which he has since apologized to this House and to the country. But, after having withdrawn them, he has, according to the public press, repeated them almost word for word. </para>

I will never lose an opportunity of drawing attention to another statement that he made, and will not withdraw, although it has been shown to be incorrect. It has been disproved by official statements which he knows to be true. He said that there were 5,760 cases of impersonation or ' double voting at the last election.' He sticks rigidly to that statement. I say that it is absolutely incorrect. </para>

There is a motion on the notice-paper standing in the name of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> for the appointment of a Select Committee to inquire into statements that have been made by newspapers, and by responsible and irresponsible persons in different parts of the Commonwealth, respecting the manner in which the recent elections were conducted.

                            asserts that his statements have been confirmed by the Chief Electoral Officer. I wish to say, in all earnestness, that it is a grave reflection on the honour and capacity of the Chief Electoral Officer that such a statement should be persisted in, and that he should be quoted as the authority for it. It is also a matter to be condemned that a responsible Minister should endeavour to dodge responsibility for statements he has made by getting behind an official. The Chief Electoral Officer has serious duties to perform, and in the exercise of them should not be subjected to unfair criticism, and should not be made responsible for statements made for party purposes by any Minister. The Chief Electoral Officer has not in any statement, printed or otherwise, confirmed the assertion which

                        <para>- He does not say anything of the kind. I ask the honorable senator to read the statement) carefully, and to remove the bias from his mind. If he does, he  will  come to the same conclusion as the officer has done, that there were a number of irregularities, most of which were explained away when the investigation took place. I venture to say that when the whole subject is thoroughly investigated, as it will be by the Committee to be appointed, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McColl</inline> will have reason to regret very sincerely the unfair and incorrect charges which he levelled against the late Government and the supporters of the Labour party throughout the length and breadth of Australia. I trust also that, in order to clear this matter up thoroughly, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> will be called as a witness. I shall have to say something about him when he is present at our next meeting. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McColl, Senator Millen,</inline> and the Chief Electoral Officer should be the first three witnesses called before the Committee. The two senators should be asked to justify statements made from innumerable platforms, and which have been circulated broadcast, not only throughout Australia, but throughout the world, and which constitute a serious reflection on the honour and integrity of every man and woman who voted at the elections. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McColl</inline> has said that the Government want only fair play and a pure roll, and that has been repeated by other Ministers. I want to know what they mean by a pure roll. The i'dea of the present Government is that all impurities in respect, of Labour voters shall be removed from the roll. The roll is not pure if there are too many Labour voters upon it. </para>

                        <para>- That is the whole trouble with the present Government. It is no secret that at the present time, in anticipation of an early election for the House of Representatives, there is a large army of organizers, men and women, in the service indirectly of the present Government; and their chief aim seems to be to remove Labour names from the Commonwealth rolls in order that the Ministerial party may be enabled, if possible, to win the election in any circumstances. We have on our statute-book an Electoral Act making it mandatory on the part of any man or woman lodging an objection to names being allowed to remain on the roll to deposit 5s. in respect of each objection. That is a necessary safeguard, because if all and sundry could be objected to, thousands and thousands of persons would be disfranchised improperly. These people in the service of certain organizations are not doing this kind of work for the good of their health or for philanthropic purposes. They are doing it because they are being paid for it. By whom are they being paid ? </para>

                        <para>- This army of men and women move about from house to house. One of them will ring a bell or knock at a door. They may get no response to the knock or ring. In the event of somebody responding, the question is asked whether So-and-so lives there. They do not make too strict an inquiry. The person inquired for may be away from home, or down the street. But if he or she is not at the place of residence, an objection is lodged against that person's name remaining on the roll. Wholesale disfranchisement is taking place. </para>

                        <para>- That is so, provided he lodges 5s. with each objection; but there was no 5s. deposited in connexion with the eliminations from the Indi roll, to which I have referred. No responsible officer of the . Electoral Department would remove names from a roll in that way without the consent, or unless by the instruction, of some member of the Ministry. The enrolment of the citizens of Australia should be a matter above party. We have adult suffrage, and it should be the desire of every member of the community, no matter to which political party he may belong, to see that all adults outside the walls of a gaol or a lunatic asylum shall be afforded an opportunity to exercise their rights as citizens on election day We know the obstacles which were placed in the paths of electors in days gone by. I had an experience of this when standing for a seat in the State Parliament not many years ago. There were at the time three systems of voting in operation, - a ratepayers' roll, a manhood suffrage roll, and a voters' certificate roll. At the election to which I refer, for the East Melbourne seat, there were three booths, and in each booth, at each table where voters whose names appeared on the voters' certificate roll had to record their votes, there were, not only responsible electoral officials, but -political partisans armed with cameras, who were taking snapshots of every man believed to be a Labour voter, with the object of overawing the electors. </para>

                        <para>- No; we snapped the cameras. <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Maloney</inline> and I went into the polling booths and asked by whose authority the cameras were there and photographs were being taken of electors. We could get no satisfactory answer, and, to the everlasting credit of <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Maloney,</inline> I may inform the Senate that he smashed each camera to "smithereens." We were told that we would be prosecuted for damaging property, but we never heard any more of the damaged property. That was the beginning and end of that kind of work in connexion with elections in this State. I have said that it should be the desire of every fair-minded man to see that we have the fullest rolls possible. The rolls used at the last Federal elections were the fullest, best, and purest we ever had in the history of the Commonwealth. It might be that a number of names were duplicated on some of the rolls; but it is far better that there should be duplications, if that cannot be avoided, than that the names of armies of men and women should -be left off the rolls, and they should thus be disfranchised. There has been no proof of the allegations of fraud and dishonesty in the conduct of the last elections. All sorts of innuendoes have been made against the party to which I belong; but when the proposed Committee thoroughly investigates the matter I am certain that the Labour party will come out of the investigation with clean hands. If any acts of fraud or dishonesty are proved, it is very probable that the chickens will come home to roost, and it will be found that the dishonesty and corruption were on the other side.  Men do not do evil things without some reward, and the Labour party is too poor to pay men and women to do these evil things. If evil tilings were done at the last Federal elections they were risked by the only people who have money for that kind of work, and they are people who supported the present Government. </para>

                        <para>- The eyes of Australia were directed to Ballarat. That was the place where it was said that corruption was rampant, and where, according to the <inline font-style="italic">Argus,</inline> one man voted nineteen times. It was said that this man's name and address were known, and the charge could be sheeted home to him. It was said that he was known to the police and to several people belonging to the Liberal party. Where is he ? A thorough investigation was made by the Electoral Department, and this was followed by an inquiry by a special detective, and neither investigation has shown that there was one case of dishonesty or fraud in connexion  with  the Ballarat election. If there has been, ' why does not the Government produce the proof? They are in possession of the report of the special detective, and I ask why the Senate has not been furnished with a copy of that report ? Why are we not in possession of the reports from different centres in connexion with the inquiry recently held ? The reason is that none of the charges made has been proved to be correct. That is why the Government are not anxious to furnish the information they have to Parliament. We are all aware that it is the intention of the Government to do something in connexion with the Tasmanian mail service, which, according to the unanimous opinion of representatives of Tasmania, has not been conducted satisfactorily, whilst the shipping company having the contract has been enabled to exploit thousands of men and women in Australia. We are given to understand that a private agreement has been submitted to the shipping company, which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Clemons,</inline> when in opposition, described as nothing but a combine. Although the honorable senator has never belonged, and probably never will belong, to. the Labour party, he has been as strenuous as any member of the Senate in his opposition to monopoly. I wish now to ask the honorable senator whether the Senate will be given an opportunity to discuss and express an opinion on the agreement referred to before the contract is definitely signed. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ready,</inline> in company with other representatives of Tasmania, has interested himself in this question. Last session the honorable senator carried a motion in the Senate in favour of the establishment of a Commonwealthowned line of steamers between Tasmania and the mainland.  His  speech showed special study, and was worthy of the honorable senator. He showed clearly that the Union Steam-ship Company had made, and is making, huge sums of money out of the Tasmanian mail service. The honorable senator quoted figures to show that, as a matter of fact, the <inline font-style="italic">Loongana</inline> had been paid for by the subsidies received by the company from the Commonwealth. We are now given to understand that the present Government are prepared to increase the present subsidy to such an extent that this rich company, which has been exploiting the public, will be enabled to build another <inline font-style="italic">Loongana</inline> at the public expense. It will, no doubt, give a better mail service to Tasmania, but I ask whether the people who send goods to and from Tasmania, and  the passengers who travel between the mainland and that State, should not receive some consideration. If the Government are disposed to increase the subsidy, surely those making use df the service should have something to say in fixing the freights and fares to be charged by this monopoly. I again ask <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Clemons</inline> to say whether we shall have an opportunity to peruse and discuss the agreement which, we understand, has been drawn up before the contract is definitely signed. When the present Government came into power, to the great joy of certain people, we were told that their policy was to be bold and progressive. If there was one item in their programme which, more than another, gave satisfaction to a number of their supporters, it was one which they considered of paramount importance. When it was announced by a certain member of the Government, it was received with intense enthusiasm by a certain newspaper supporting the Government in this State. I refer to the proposed abolition of the Commonwealth stamp. The Melbourne <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> said that the late Government had taken two years to decide upon a uniform stamp for the Commonwealth, and that the present Postmaster-General was only in office a fortnight when he decided to abolish the kangaroo on the stamp and substitute for it the King's head. This newspaper, in its wild enthusiasm for the abolition of the existing postage stamp, stated that the Government had taken only a fortnight to accomplish what a previous Government had taken two years to accomplish. According to this organ, the present postage stamp was to be abolished in a fortnight. More than a fortnight has elapsed since the Government took office, the representation of the kangaroo is still upon the stamp, and the Government are still printing the stamps. Ministers have been in office for twelve weeks, and yet this much boasted reform has not been effected. According to newspaper reports, the Government intended to do two things which were to save Australia - to abolish the postage stamp and to restore the postal vote. These were matters of national importance. In last night's <inline font-style="italic">Herald,</inline> a short article was published with catchy headings, the first of which read, " King and Kangaroo," and the second, " Two Kinds of Stamps." Previously we were informed that we were to have only one stamp. Evidently this matter has been considered in Cabinet, and, according 'to the latest decision, we are to have two stamps, one containing a repre-  sensation  of the King's head, and the other a representation of the kangaroo. The Postmaster- General has decided that those persons who desire to have a reproduction of the King's head on the stamps shall be able to get it, whilst those who prefer a representation of the kangaroo will be able to indulge their fancy. To use the vernacular, ' ' One pays his ' brown ' and takes his choice." Anticipating that there will be a greater demand for the purely Australian article, it is intended to keep the printing presses going in order to supply it. When the Government came into power it was openly stated that they intended to restore confidence and to place the finances of the Commonwealth on a stable basis. There was to be no extravagance. But, according to the statement in the <inline font-style="italic">Herald,</inline> the Postmaster-General is of opinion that there are a number of persons in the world with funny ideas - persons who develop hobbies - and in order to encourage the hobby of stamp collecting, he intends to have special stamps printed containing a representation of the King's head. There is no doubt that catering for this class of people will do_ a lot. for Australia, because, when they get the stamps, they will put them in their booklets, where they will remain until they are able to make a profit, when they will sell them. Thus, according to the Postmaster-General, Australia will be better advertised than she could be in any other way. The idea is a brilliant one, and the simultaneous issues of these stamps - one bearing the King's head, the other the kangaroo - will be more beneficial to Australia than all the recent bountiful rains ! In the opinion of the Government it will be an excellent thing if we hang on to the kangaroo stamp in addition to a stamp containing a reproduction of the King's head. The Cabinet later on may hold a special meeting for the purpose of considering the  advisableness  of introducing additional designs for our stamps. We are told that 400,000,000 of these stamps are printed annually, and that there is to be a small edition of the stamp containing a representation of the King's head. The Government which declared they intended to stop extravagance - although they have never been able to prove extravagance on the part of the late Administration - propose to incur an additional expense of £3,500 in order to satisfy the curiosity of a number of stamp collectors in different parts of the world. We were further assured that the stamp was to be a uniform one throughout Australia. Now, it appears that we are to have as many different designs as possible. I trust that, in his reply, the Minister will give us the information in his possession concerning the three matters which I have mentioned, namely, the deletion of hundreds of names from the electoral rolls, the agreement which has been entered into concerning the Tasmanian mail service, and the abolition of the existing postal stamp. </para>

                    <para>. - The rapid rate with which we are dealing with legislation in this Chamber is sufficient to take away one's breath. We are now about the middle of the session, and yet, with the exception of Supply Bills, no legislative proposals have been introduced into the Senate. The present Government, who were going to repeal the bad legislation of the Labour party, and to restore responsible government, have hitherto only provided us with a " dead horse," in the shape of the Address-in-Reply and three Supply Bills. This is about the only opportunity that honorable senators have of refuting the unfair statements which are made from time to time by members of the Ministry. I am pleased to say that not one of the Ministers of whom I am going to complain is a member of the Senate. But they must accept their share of responsibility for the misdoings of their colleagues in another place. No later than last night we had another disgraceful exhibition. From time to time, we have had exhibitions of the most blackguardly conduct on the part of members of the Government that I have ever known. We know that a certain case is at the present being inquired into by a Select Committee appointed by the Senate, and that the Prime Minister, the Attorney-General,, and the whipper-snapper who holds the position of Honorary Minister in another place, have indulged in the most scandalous criticism of that body.- I say, advisedly, that, from the very inception, the Government have done their best to prevent an honest inquiry being conducted into one of their acts of administration. When the constitution of that Select Committee was brought forward, I endeavoured to secure the services of Government supporters upon it, and, on the floor of the </para>
                </talk.start>
                <para class="block">Senate, I invited the Government to nominate members of the Select Committee. No fewer than four senators upon the Government side of the , Senate were approached with that end in view, but only one of them would consent to act. That fact evidences that, from the very beginning, the Government endeavoured to burke inquiry into this case. Twenty-four hours later, we had a further proof of that. Speaking at one of the Fusion gatherings in Victoria, before a single step had been taken by the Committee, the Prime Minister declared that it was a partisan Committee. I challenged his statement in this Chamber, affirmed that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chinn</inline> had Been a persecuted man, and that evidently the Prime Minister was prepared to go on persecuting him. My statement was based upon the findings of the Royal Commission which was appointed to investigate some of the most scandalous charges that were made against him by a member of the Fusion party, not one of which was proven. As a matter of fact, five out of the six charges preferred were clearly disproved. In the light of these facts, I declared that political persecution was being indulged in. I care not whom I offend in this connexion, and so long as I believe there is a case of injustice, I shall be man enough to stand up for the individual concerned. No matter how unpopular the cause may be, no matter how powerful are the individuals who are trying to deprive that man of his rights, I shall secure justice for him if I can. The people of Australia ought to know who the members of the Government are that try to burke inquiry into their administration of public affairs, and into their dirty tactics, because dirty tactics of the most contemptible kind have been pursued in opposition to this Committee ever since, and even before, we began to make our inquiry. We had the last exhibition of it only last night, when <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Wait,</inline> the Premier of Victoria, went completely out of his way to interfere with the affairs of another Government. I think I can shed some light on the cause of this outbreak on his part, although I may not be able to clear it all up, but just as a straw sometimes shows which way the wind blows, I may be able to show, by reading a statement made by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hedges</inline> at the last election in Western Australia, why <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Watt</inline> pushes his oar in at the present time. This Chinn case was, perhaps, more before the public at the last election than was any other Government matter that I know of in any other election in Australia, and the most blackguardly statements were made against a man who had just cleared his character from the charges made against him. Certain statements, made during- the election, were submitted to eminent members of the Bar in Western Australia as to whether they were libellous or not, and two at least of those gentlemen declared that Messrs. Fowler, Hedges, Forrest, and the rest . of them had gone right up to the line of the libel law, although they did not cross it. They were very careful how far they went. They were ready to wound, ready to injure this man, although they were not prepared to take the responsibility of their actions. This kind of conduct had been going on for such a time that, when I had an opportunity of refuting the statement of the present Prime Minister that the Select Committee was a partisan body, I was entitled to declare that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chinn</inline> had been the victim of a conspiracy on the part of the Fusion party, who condemned him on the floor of the House of Representatives last year, using the coward's castle to damn this man's character. During the election, we had these matters dished up to us from different standpoints. Even before the Royal Commission undertook its investigations, the 'very same tactics were pursued that are being pursued at the present time. The other side are ready to damn this man, and to force him to seek a living elsewhere, because if a man is once condemned by thai section of the community which has the power to employ him, he is compelled, even though he is a native of Australia, to go elsewhere to earn a living. That is- the kind of persecution that is going on, and that I am going to expose, if it is in my power to do so. I was, therefore, justified, when speaking of the past, in saying that the Fusion, party had persecuted this man, simply because he differed with them in politics. That is my statement, which I repeat fearlessly, and I am not at all afraid that I shall not be able to prove it from what has already taken place. Even after a Judge of the Supreme Court of Victoria was appointed a Royal Commission by the Fisher Government to inquire into the case, and after closely scrutinizing the various charges made against <inline font-weight="bold">Mr.</inline></para>
                <para class="block">Chinn by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Fowler,</inline> under the cover of privilege in another place, had shown that not a single one of them could be upheld, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hedges</inline> the then member for Fremantle, cast aspersions on the Judge who tried the case, and insinuated that corrupt action had been taken by no less a person than <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Watt</inline> to bring this result about. He stated that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Watt,</inline> because of his connexion with a certain timber company, had taken certain action, with the object, I suppose, of saving his own skin. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hedges</inline> went even to the length of insinuating that the Chief Justice of Victoria was a party to this sort of thing. These were serious charges to make. When I have quoted the reports published in the press of Western Australia on the subject, I will ask honorable senators to say whether there is not some ground for believing that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Watt,</inline> in order to save his own miserable skin, is prepared to join in this cowardly howl against one individual. This is what they call British fair play ! I would sooner be a blackfellows dog than join in a howl against a man who is down; but these creatures, who call themselves men, want' to hound' him out of the service, if they can. Some of us are trying to get fair play by holding an inquiry into his case; and if he is found to be at fault, I am prepared to hold him responsible, and let him take the consequence, and so, I am sure, is every other member of the Committee. While I am a member of the Senate, however, I shall never sit quietly by and see any man persecuted without giving him an opportunity of clearing his character, when he may be innocent of the charges made against him. That is what the Select Committee is doing, and what the Senate authorized it to do. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hedges,</inline> during, the last election, went over quite a number of matters connected with the case, with which we need not trouble ourselves at the present juncture. Suffice it to say that not a single one of the charges brought against <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chinn</inline> on that occasion can be proved against him. That; fact should have carried some weight with the present Government when they took office. They knew that this man had gone through a very severe ordeal to clear his character, and had been subjected to treatment which few men would have been able to come through so well. These considerations, however, carried no weight, for as soon as the present crowd got into power they got rid of him as quickly as they could. </para>

                <para class="block">I am sorry that I have lost the more elaborate report of this speech which appeared in the other Perth paper; but although this report is not very full, it contains sufficient to show that there was some reason for <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Watt</inline> joining in the present howl against <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chinn,</inline> and to explain why he has pushed himself into a Commonwealth matter. This is a question which <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Watt</inline> would have been well-advised to leave alone, because there may be need for a Royal Commission to inquire into <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Watt's</inline> own action and connexion with these matters. We must remember how these companies can exercise influence, and bear in mind <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hedges'</inline> statement that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Watt</inline> is a shareholder in the particular company mentioned. I cannot believe that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hedges</inline> would go out of his way to attack his own side. He was always ready to attack his political opponents; but there would have to be some very good reason before one member of the Fusion party would attack another. An old saying is that " dog does not eat dog " unless there is a particularly good reason for doing so. Here we have a case of a political party combining to "down" one man by hook or by crook. The speeches I have been finding fault with from time to time, as  Chairman  of the Select Committee, furnish ample reason, if there were no other ground, for the Committee to continue its work "and probe the matter right to the bottom. There is, underlying the whole affair, something which we have a right to know. I can assure the Senate that, before the inquiry is finished, we shall see that justice is done, so far as that lies in our power. We are hampered in every way. When we ask for papers that are absolutely essential to the investigation, it takes weeks and weeks for us to get them. The Government is throwing every obstacle in the way of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chinn</inline> proving his case, whilst every facility is given to the other side to put up its case. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deane,</inline> the Engineer - in-Chief , is helped by no fewer than four clerks in the room. They PUt things into his hand to make out his case. Not only has he the help of men from the Railway Office, but he has the assistance of men from the Home Affairs Department, and also from the Solicitor-General's Department. Then, too, the Government were quite ready to engage one of the most eminent barristers at the Victorian Bar to help them to set up their case. When a request was made by the Select Committee that similar treatment should be meted  out to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chinn,</inline> there was an emphatic refusal of any such help to him. In the face of these facts - and they are facts, as every 'member of the Committee knows - it is the duty of the members of the Committee to protest here when they get this chance to do so. We are not going to be deterred from continuing the inquiry simply because the Attorney-General - a man who ought to know the rules of conduct in cases of this kind - goes out of his way to make an attack upon us. He aspires to be one of the Judges of the High Court of Australia, but God forbid that such a partisan as he is should ever get into such a high position, because he would be totally unfitted to occupy, and would disgrace, the position. Then <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Cook</inline> - the Minister who signed the order for the dismissal of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chinn</inline> - of course, objects to an investigation into his administration. He is seeking, not only to shut down the inquiry by preventing, as far as he can, evidence from coming before us, but he is denying funds to enable us to 'bring witnesses to Melbourne, or to go to where the witnesses are. That is the sort of attack we get from time to time from the Government for doing what the Senate has every right to empower us to do - to inquire into the administration of the Government. </para>

                    which has already been investigated and dealt with.

                        <para>- The honorable senator may put in that word. The reasons which have been given for the dismissal of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chinn</inline> are that he was incompetent, that he was insubordinate, and practically that it was quite impossible to deal with him at all as an official in the Public Service. Therefore, any statements with regard to the charges made against him previously as being reasons for his dismissal are not justified. There is a minute which states why he was dismissed. I offer no opinion with regard to the general question. I admit that I was asked to join the Select Committee, but I declined to act because I had confidence in the Ministry, and in their having good grounds for the dismissal of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chinn.</inline></para>

I did not wish to be associated with the inquiry, and, judging by the papers and the method in which the examination of witnesses is conducted, and the latitude which is allowed to people, I am very glad that I am not on the Committee.

                        <para>.- The Senate has the right to do as it sees fit, and individual senators have a right to record their votes as they see fit. Although I was not in sympathy with the proposal to appoint this Select Committee, I recognised that the Senate had a perfect right to appoint it. I do not say that anybody has the right to endeavour to burke a full inquiry into any matter which the Senate, in the exercise of its inherent right to make an inquiry, wishes to have investigated. I am not going to do anything to prevent the Select Committee from working out its inquiry to what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie calls " the bitter end." </para>

                        <para>- Wherever the Senate sees fit to appoint a Select Committee, I think that that Committee should have the opportunity to make a full investigation. I do not object to that being done, although I did not believe that there was any need or justification for instituting the present inquiry. That, of course, was my private opinion, which was expressed by my vote in opposition to the proposal. I am very sorry, too, that there has been so much attention paid, through the press and in certain ways, to the action of the Committee before the whole investigation is finished, when it will be time to criticise any individual as severely as we see fit. So much for the Chinn inquiry. Let me now say a few words in regard to complaints made about the Government not producing business for the Senate to deal with. It occurs to me that Ministers, if they were to submit matters of policy in the Senate, where they know there is a majority of four to one against them, would be rather foolish. The other House is the place for the Ministry to submit all broad matters of policy. While I did hear an interjection that Labour had won all along the line because it is in a majority here, at the same time, I realize that, in the other House, no less than five seats were gained by the Liberal party from the Labour party, and that by that means a majority was obtained there. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Fisher,</inline> the Leader of the Labour party, and the responsible Minister of the Crown, told the Governor-General plainly that he was unable to carry on the business of the country, and therefore advised that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Cook</inline> should be sent for. </para>

I recognise that the quarantine area was proclaimed in the early stages of what might have become a very dangerous disease to the people of the Commonwealth. One could not complain about the steps which were taken then to protect the public health and public safety as far as possible, but the quarantine has existed for a considerable time, and it has been shown that this is not what might be termed a virulent disease. There have been no deaths in connexion with the disease. There certainly has been a number of cases in which persons have been attacked, but, fortunately, they have all recovered. It has been shown that it is not a disease of a virulent type, in fact, it is no worse than measles, scarlet fever, diphtheria, and many other diseases which attack people from time to time. In the interests of, not New South Wales alone, but the whole of Australia, it would be well, I think, if the Government could see their way to remove the quarantine. </para>

On the Health Board of New South Wales there are medical men of considerable knowledge and skill in this disease, who have made a very strong recommendation to the State Government, and, I believe, to the Commonwealth Government also, that the quarantine should be lifted. I put it to the Government that it is time that they should give full consideration to this matter with the view of doing what I think would be in the best interests of the country. </para>

                    <para>. - I feel grieved that there should be members of this Senate so discourteous as to adopt methods that are entirely foreign to what may be called gentlemanly conduct. I am not surprised at statements that have been made by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Watt,</inline> the Premier of Victoria, because he is one of those bursting bombshells of whom one need not take much notice. But <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gould</inline> is supposed to have a judicial mind. He has occupied high and honorable positions in this House and in the country. Yet he has stooped to anticipate the judgment of men who, I can assure him, are as honest and as capable of coming to a sound conclusion in respect to any matter with which they have to deal as he is. I feel that he has entirely departed from the line of action which a thorough gentleman ought to adopt. Indeed, he has stooped as low as the man whose utterances are reported in this morning's newspapers concerning the Chinn Committee. The position of the Chinn Committee has been referred to as being polluted. The only pollution  connected with it, in my opinion, is the source from which this criticism came. As far as the Committee is concerned, I, as a member of it, am not prepared to say whether <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chinn</inline> has, or has not, received the just reward of his conduct. But I do say that our every effort has been to find out whether he has been persecuted or not. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gould</inline> deliberately accuses me, as a member of that Committee, of being a dishonest man. I hurl the accusation back into his teeth. </para>

I am speaking from my knowledge of what we have endeavoured to do, and what we have been prevented from doing. I assert that the Government have, done everything to prevent a fair investigation from being made. Nevertheless, they have not altered my opinion in any way. Whatever the truth may be, my desire is to get at it. When I have arrived at what I believe to be the truth, whether it be in favour of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chinn</inline> or against him, I am prepared as an honest man to give an unbiased verdict, regardless of the consequences. </para>

                    <para>. - There are one or two questions about which I would like to say a word. One is the matter of the discovery of oil deposits in Papua. There have been indications that a valuable supply of petroleum exists in that Dependency of the Commonwealth. When our fleet unit is in being we shall require 14,000 tons of oil annually for naval purposes. I think it is practically demonstrated that oil is to be found there, and I urge that the. supplies should be kept in the possession of the Commonwealth. We all know what has happened in regard to the Standard Oil Company in America, and throughout the world. I should like to have an assurance from the Government that they propose to keep these natural supplies as the property of the people of Australia, and to develop them for Commonwealth purposes. I also desire to urge that the Commonwealth will have the courage - because I know it requires some courage - to back down from their present untenable position in regard to the outbreak of small-pox in Sydney. In Western Australia, in 1895 or 1896, we had a virulent outbreak of small-pox. It was dealt with, not by quarantine, but by isolation. By that means it was thoroughly stamped out, although the health authorities at Western Australia were at the time badly organized. The methods adopted by the Government in Sydney have not prevented the spread of the disease. I trust that they will resolve to adopt the modern method of isolation in preference to the method which they have hitherto pursued. I say this without any desire to make  party capital out of what has occurred. I quite understand the difficulty with which the Government have had to cope. But it is not a party question, and I think they will be wise in altering their tactics in Sydney. . </para>

                    <para>. - Even at the eleventh hour I desire to appeal to the Minister representing the Postmaster-General to afford the Senate and the other House an opportunity of discussing the proposed agreement which, I understand, is to be entered into between the Commonwealth and the Union Steam-ship Company and Huddart, Parker and Company in reference to the carriage of Tasmanian mails. It is stated that the agreement is to operate for five years. I think it would be only fair, not only to Tasmania, which is vitally interested, but also to the Commonwealth generally, that we should have an opportunity of insuring that reasonable freights and passenger fares are provided for. We ought not to place ourselves in such a position that within a few years it will be shown that the freights and fares are absolutely out of all proportion to the cost of maintaining the service. The Government should not depart from the usual practice of affording Parliament an opportunity of discussing contracts of this kind. The matter is one that is of interest to the whole Commonwealth, and I feel strongly that we should have an opportunity of considering the agreement before it is ratified. </para>

                        <para>- I admit that; but I am in receipt of information from Western Australia, from which it would appear that an attempt is being made to evade the award recently given by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Higgins, in the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Court, in connexion with the employment of electricians. During September a number of applications were made in Western Australia for these positions, and the mechanician stated that the applicants were competent workmen. A member of the Amalgamated Society of Engineers went to see the  Deputy  Postmaster-General of Western Australia about the applications, and was referred by him to the Chief Electrical Engineer. He was informed that ten men would be required for installing the new automatic telephone system in Perth, that only those who had experience of common and magnetic batteries would be required, and that there were not more than six men. in Western Australia who had that experience, as there was only a common battery in Fremantle. He was further told that men were to be drafted from all parts of the Commonwealth to gain experience of the new automatic system, and, further, that it was intended to pay them the minimum rate of £144, payable according to the award to junior mechanics, instead of £168, the rate for mechanics. I wish to direct the attention of the Minister to the award itself. I find that, in section 1, the Judge said - </para>

                        <para>- Whilst I have every respect for the convenience of other members of this Parliament, I also have respect for the interests of men who are amongst my constituents, and for the officers of the Department, who may unconsciously be doing something wrong. There is attached to the award from which I have quoted a memorandum by the Public Service Commissioner, practically warning the Government of the increased .cost that will be entailed if the award is observed. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McLachlan</inline> tells the Government plainly that the award will entail an additional expenditure of something like £30,000 a year, and says that the maximum, and not the minimum, might be observed. Hitherto the minimum award has often been made the maximum, and, in the expectation that something better will follow <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Higgins' award in this case, the Public Service Commissioner sounds a warning note. I thank the Minister for his assurance that an investigation will be made into this matter. If he will instruct the Chief Electrical Engineer in Western Australia to pay the minimum awarded by the Conciliation and Arbitration Court to competent men engaged as telephone mechanics in Western Australia, and if he will consult the union affected, he will find that there will be any number of competent men offering in that State. I give that assurance, and I pledge the unions to assist the Minister and the Chief Electrical Engineer in getting competent men, able to pass the necessary examination, provided <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Higgins' award is observed. I hope the Minister will give the matter attention during the next day or two. </para>
