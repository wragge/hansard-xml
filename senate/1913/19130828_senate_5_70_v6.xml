They practically say, as was interjected just now, that we might as well tear up the Standing Orders and have done with them, because the opportunity of dealing with the matter on which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> desires to speak again is open to every honorable senator who has not spoken on the Supply Bill. It will be just as logical if any other statement is made which is impugned for an honorable senator to move the suspension of the Standing Orders to enable further debate to take place. </para>

                                <para>- It is competent for honorable senators to deal with them during the debate which has not yet been concluded. I again direct attention to the fact that in order to enable one member of the Opposition to make a second contribution to the same debate, it is now thought desirable by honorable senators opposite that we should tear up our Standing Orders. </para>

                                    GOULD (New South Wales) &#91;3.11&#93;.- If honorable senators desire to incur the contumely and contempt of the people of this country, they are adopting a line of action which will rapidly bring that  about. Although honorable senators opposite have an overwhelming majority, they owe it to themselves and to the country to respect the Standing Orders of the Senate and the orderly conduct of debate. We have twenty-nine senators on one side in this chamber, and only seven on the other side. What chance have the seven to secure the suspension of the Standing Orders, if at any time they desire to break through the rules, practice, and procedure of Parliament, as they are known throughout the British Dominions. The power given to suspend the Standing Orders is to enable the Senate to deal immediately with special and urgent cases where justice could not be secured by a too rigid adherence to the Standing Orders. It was never imagined that the power would be utilized for such a purpose as this. We know that honorable senators opposite are determined that no business shall be done here if they can prevent it.

                                <para>- Perhaps no one will be a penny the worse or the better for all the words of wisdom uttered in this chain ber for the next two or three years. We have passed Standing Orders to provide for the orderly conduct of debate, and I again remind honorable senators opposite that in the debate on the Address-in-Reply every honorable senator will, have the fullest opportunity to make known his views on matters of public interest. It is still open to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> to speak in that debate, and to place before the country all the facts which he thinks the people should know. He says now, practically, that he wants to make a second speech on the same subject, in contravention of the Standing Orders he assisted in passing, and because he knows that he has a number of friends behind him who, when they see fit, are prepared to let the Standing Orders go to Jericho for all they care. Honorable senators opposite should bear in mind that these sort of chickens frequently come home to roost. I recognise that my honorable .friends possess a majority in this Chamber, and that it is in their power to convert our proceedings into the greatest farce that can be imagined in connexion with - I will not say a deliberative assembly, because with me it is rapidly becoming a question of doubt as to whether this Senate is a deliberative body. They will vote to break any Standing Orders if it suits their purpose to do so. </para>

If we do not respect our own Standing Orders we shall cover ourselves with contempt. I say that those Orders should be suspended only in cases of grave emergency, and when no other opportunity is presented of dealing with the matter which requires to be ventilated. If our Standing Orders are suspended on the present occasion, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> will make a speech, and the Minister of Defence will reply to him. A little later <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> will discover that the Minister of Defence has said something which he thinks ought not te have been said, and he will then desire another suspension of our Standing Orders. Thus we shall never reach finality. </para>

                                <para>- If any matters of fact have been misrepresented so far as papers or documents are concerned, it is open to any honorable senator to move for the production of those papers or documents, so that the Senate may inform itself of the real merits of the dispute. I do not know whether the Government would object to the production of those papers. I hope they would not. I imagine that in connexion with a great question like that of defence the papers or documents would be produced. &#39; No honorable senator underestimates the importance of defence matters. I have no desire to unduly debate this question. I protest against the gross misuse of powers which is being attempted by honorable senators opposite - powers which were given to us for an entirely different purpose. At the same time, I recognise that all the protests in the world would be of no avail here. I recognise that my protest will be like a voice crying in the wilderness. No attention will be paid to it. There is, however, a greater tribunal by which my honorable friends will be judged, and before which they will have to justify their action. </para>

The claim forms were not signed by anybody, but the names of the persons were typed in, in order that their whereabouts should be inquired into, and they should be given an opportunity to send forward a signed claim form. </para>

What has happened since proves that, so far from there being fraud in this matter, the action taken by the Electoral Department resulted in these persons being given the opportunity of being placed on the rolls which otherwise they would not have had, because, whilst there were 80,000 of these persons for whom claim forms were put into the card index, the Department sent to- those persons claim, forms for them to sign. I am in the position of being able to say - and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> will obtain the information if he inquires at the Electoral Department - that 99J per cent, of the 80,000 persons before the last election had filled in claim forms and signed them, and that signed forms were in the office of the Home Affairs Department. Yet we had the Minister of Defence coming here and saying that these 80,000 persons were wrongfully on the roll- </para>

                                <para>- Whereas the very fact that these claim forms have since been received proves that in practically the whole of the 80,000 cases the persons existed, and the facts as disclosed by the police canvass are shown to be true. In the face of such facts, are we not justified, in view of the nature of the charge hurled, not only at the late Government, but hurled, I venture to say, at the officers of the Electoral Department, in rejecting the statement of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> ? If we have electoral officers who are prepared, even under Ministerial direction, to do such a thing as the honorable senator tried to make out they had done, then the sooner those officers are retired and a new set of officers take their place, the better it will be. I think that any one who heard or read the remarks of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> could come to no other conclusion than that these names had been put on the rolls by no other than fraudulent methods without the authority of the Electoral Act or the regulations, and that the Minister had directed the electoral officers to do this wrongful thing in order to gain some political advantage. The facts as disclosed in the Home Affairs Department, and which cannot be controverted, prove that every step was taken with the advice of the Crown Law officers, that the Minister was never aware of the dummy cards being put in the card index, and that, on the contrary, it was done by his officers, as it would be done by them if a new roll had to be compiled tomorrow, no matter what Government was in power. It was done absolutely without the knowledge of the Minister, and there was no need for him to have knowledge of it, because it was perfectly within the law, and the officers were acting on the advice given to them by the Crown Law officers. </para>

                                <para>- As regards the details by which the officers were going to comply with the proclamation, of course, the Minister did not know them. That is the way by which these 80,000 names were retained on the roll, and I have shown that they had a perfect right to be on the roll. I do not intend to labour this point; but I do say that when a Minister of the Crown, with all the prestige which attaches to the position, with the knowledge of the public that he  has access, not only to public documents, but also to legal advice, stands up in his place here and says that 80,000 electors in one State were improperly put on the roll by Ministerial authority, he makes a statement which he ought to be ashamed to make. If he made the statement inadvertently and carelessly, he ought to withdraw it at the earliest possible moment. </para>

                                <para>- If the honorable senator repeats the statement, he will repeat something which he must now know to be untrue. I advise him not to. allow his temper to outrun his judgment in this matter. He has a reputation to maintain, and a future to look forward to. I do say that in this instance he has either made a mistake or has unwittingly been led, for the purpose of making political capital, into making statements which are not correct. The facts show that the Minister, in issuing the proclamation, and acting under the advice of the Crown Law officers, was acting under the authority of the Electoral Act, and using the powers conferred upon him. The facts show, too, that the officers, in carrying out section 5 of the proclamation, acted within the proclamation, and complied with the law as regards getting the signatures of those whose signatures were not obtained in the first place. They are today, and have been for some time, proceeding to take the course laid down by the law by striking off the roll the names of the remaining J per cent, who have not complied with the requirements by sending in the requisite form. In view of the Minister&#39;s alarming statement yesterday, it is well that the country should know that the statement is inaccurate, that 99$ per cent, of these 80,000 persons complied fully with the law, and that before any of them voted at the last election there was in the Electoral Office in New South Wales - as there was in the Electoral Office of any State where they were affected - signed claim forms in order to show that they were entitled to vote. I do not think that any further&#39; remark is necessary; but I would suggest to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> that, in view of the information which is available in his colleague&#39;s office, he should&#39; withdraw the statements he made yesterday, and apologize to the ex-Minister of Home Affairs for the imputation he has made upon his political honour. </para>

When I say that a thing was done under the authority of the late Government, the honorable senator is not entitled to say that I charged the ex-Minister of Home Affairs with . ordering the filling in of 80,000 names. This is not merely typical. I will show that the instruction was there. This motion is so worded as to make it appear that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. O&#39;Malley</inline> wrote a definite instruction to officers in New South Wales to put 80,000 dummy cards in. </para>

                                <para>- The instructions given by the Minister are set out in the proclamation. I want to see what &#39; they are. Here is the charge I sought to make yesterday, and wish to repeat now. From the time the Electoral Bill was introduced, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> stood here as the champion of the card system, and led Parliament to believe that, under that system, new cards were being prepared. No one was ever given the slightest hint in public right up to the last moment that it was intended to depart from that system. As a matter of fact, every one in Australia had a right to believe that the card system was in operation. I want to show how recently it was that, even in this Chamber, when the matter was under discussion, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> spoke in the belief that the card system was in operation, whereas it was not, because he has already shown me that there was a proclamation which authorized a departure from it. In October last, we had a debate here in which I brought up the question of inflated rolls, and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> spoke on that occasion. As my time is short, I do not propose to read his speech, but the honorable senator will correct me if I am wrong when I say that the whole of his speech, buttressed by a memorandum from the Chief Electoral Officer, was to the effect that with the card system inflation of the rolls was practically impossible. That speech was made in October last year, that is, some months after the issue of the proclamation on 29th July, 1911, to which he has referred. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> said that the names were typed on the cards, or filled in by the electoral officers on reports from the police, who were certain that the people were in the place, but could not get them to sign the cards. I do not believe that statement, whoever made it. In the small subdivision of Boggabri, ninety-eight names were furnished to me of persons who were either dead or had left the district for over a year. I refused to believe that the police in that case gave a certificate that they believed that the owners of the names were away from the district. An honorable&#39; senator interjects; and in answer to him, I may saw that registration is a matter I want to look into, but, so far, I have had no opportunity to do so. I am told that I ought to have looked into that matter before to find how many of them got on, but it was impossible for me to do it. I am dealing with statements made here. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> has stated that, as regards the people who could not be found, or who, for some reason or other, could not sign claim forms, the police very kindly looked after their interests, and sent down their names, &#39;with the statement that the people were there, but could not be got to sign the forms. I want to know, if that is the case, why should the late Government have given such an exhibition of favoritism ? Why was it that they put certain names on the roll of people who had not conformed to the principle of compulsory enrolment, probably at the time they were launching a prosecution against a bid-ridden woman in Queensland, because she had not enrolled herself. </para>

                                <para>- The honorable senator is quite right. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> has admitted that, under the authority of his colleague, the ex-Minister of Home Affairs, the late Government were departing from the compulsory enrolment system, involving a penalty of <inline font-style="italic">&#163;2</inline> upon any qualified person who failed to send in a signed application card for enrolment, and that, with respect to the 80,000 in New South Wales, the officials were so careful and tender of their interests that they relieved them of their obligation under the law. It is admitted by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> that 80,000 names were inserted on the New South Wales rolls in contravention of the card system, which he represented to the Senate as the system on which the late Government intended to compile the rolls. The honorable senator has reminded <inline font-style="italic">me</inline> that it is provided that the rolls shall be prepared &#34; in the manner prescribed.&#34; I do not know whether he derives very much comfort from that, but I will ask him whether he can deny that, in introducing the Electoral Bill, and during the subsequent discussion in the Senate, to which I have referred, he did not lead honorable senators to believe that the new rolls would be prepared in accordance with the card system, and that the compulsory provisions of the law would be applied. That being so, I say that I am justified in every word I said. Parliament was told that the rolls would be prepared in a certain way, and some time later, not in July, when we were passing  from one system to the other, but in March of the present year, the proclamation referred to was repeated authorizing electoral officers to insert in the rolls the names of persons who had never sent in cards. I do not propose to find any excuse for that violation of the card system, because, if the late Government intended to go back upon it, they should have made their intention known. They met Parliament subsequently, and the proclamation was issued months before the debate on the alleged inflation of the rolls to which I have referred. In that debate, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> did not tell the Senate that the card system was not being observed, and I believe that was because he did not know it, and his electoral officers had not informed him of it. The fact that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. O&#39;Malley&#39;s</inline> name appears at the bottom of the proclamation shows that he knew and consented to what was being done. If that be so, I am justified in saying that everything that followed from the proclamation was authorized by the ex-Minister of Home Affairs. </para>

                                <para>- Yes j &#34;in the manner prescribed.&#34; But I ask why, during the debate which took place in October, 1912, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> was not informed . by the electoral officials that the card system, as he had explained it, was being departed from ? Why was the honorable senator informed that the rolls were free from inflation ? That they were inflated at the time is proved by the fact that from that time onwards the officials have been removing names from the rolls which have no business to be there. </para>

                                <para>- Then why did the Government prosecute a bed-ridden woman in Queensland who could not get about to enroll herself? Honorable senators opposite do not want to hear the reference to that case. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> has admitted that, under Ministerial authority, and in violation of the card system, as explained to this Parliament, the names of 80,000 persons were inserted in the New South Wales roll. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> seems to take some exception to my statement that these names were wrongfully inserted in the roll; but I repeat that they were. We were asked to support an Electoral Bill to provide for keeping the rolls pure by the simple procedure of insisting that, before any name went on a roll, an application card should be received, signed by the person claiming to be enrolled; and I say that if any names were placed on the rolls in violation of that principle they were wrongly there. </para>

                                <para>- I say that in this particular case we had a right to believe, from the assurances of Ministers and the law itself, that there was in existence a system known as the card system, .because certain people who did not conform to that system were proceeded against in the law courts. If that be so, why was different treatment meted out to these 80,000 persons in New South Wales ? Was there no reason for it? I venture to say that after what has taken place here no Government will attempt such a thing in the future from this time on. We were told with regard to the 80,000 persons that the officials were not able to secure their signatures for a multiplicity of reasons, and still put their names on the rolls. Had an election taken place immediately those persons would have been entitled to vote, and it would have been a fraud on the country to permit any one to vote irregularly in that way. What was done was done by Ministerial sanction and under a proclamation signed by a Minister. </para>

I went on to say that they had departed deliberately from their own system to the extent of putting 80,000 names on the rolls of New South Wales that had no business to be there. The statement which has been made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> to-day is an admission that, had the card system been observed, those 80,000 names would never have appeared on the New South Wales roll. </para>

                                <para>- No doubt the time is coming when my honorable friends opposite will try to suspend, not merely the Standing Orders, but an Act of Parliament, if they find its provisions in their way. It has been said that the favoured 80,000 persons had their names placed on the roll because the police gave an assurance that they knew those people were residents in the different divisions, but could not for some reason or another sign the application cards. In reply, I have only to say that I furnished the electoral officers of New South Wales with names of persons appearing on the rolls who had been dead for two years. I am satisfied that the police could not have given any such assurances in cases of that kind. I supplied a long list of names, and I do not remember all the cases, but I remember that one was the case of a man who had been twelve months out of the subdivision for which he was enrolled, and at the time of his enrolment was holding a licence which required his residence on premises 200 miles from the district. </para>

                                <para>- I am satisfied that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Russell</inline> would not accept the slightest wager, no matter what odds I offered him, that the person to whom I refer was not residing at the place at which he was compelled to reside under the licence issued to him. I modify nothing, and withdraw nothing. I say that the card system which the late Government led the country to believe they were adopting for the compilation of the rolls was a system which, if carried out, would at least have assured that no one could get upon a roll who was not entitled to be there. I admitted that at the time we were passing the law, though I recognised the difficulty of carrying it out. The moment the Government departed from that system, what was bound to happen did happen, and by a gross act of favoritism 80,000 persons in New South Wales, who did not comply with the conditions of the card system, which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> described in this chamber, were allowed to have their names placed on the rolls. That being so, why was not the late Government prepared to do the same for the whole of the electorates of the Commonwealth ? </para>

I say that if we are going to allow the officers of the Department to favour certain citizens, we ought to give every citizen in the country the opportunity of having his enrolment done for him. I am very pleased that this further debate has taken place. I object very strongly to the course which has been adopted of cutting in two the debate upon the Supply Bill by suspending certain of our Standing Orders, but it has provided me with another opportunity of directing public attention to this matter- </para>

                                <para>- That statement was; made in this Chamber deliberately with a view to inducing people to believe that; 80,000 names were put on the New South Wales rolls: under Ministerial authority within a day or two of the elections, so that the Labour party might have 80,000 additional . voters on- its&#39; side. That is the impression which the Minister of Defence endeavoured to convey. But he has made a very poor reply to the attack which has been made upon him by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce.</inline> He says, &#34; I repeat that the names were improperly on the roll&#39;s under the card system.&#34;&#39; That is not&#39; what he said yesterday. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> has. shown that almost the whole of these 80,000 names were properly on the rolls in accordance with the provisions of our Electoral Act. I want to ask the Minister of Defence, and those honorable senators who represent New South Wales, what would have happened if the late Government had decided to rigidly enforce the card system, and thus disfranchise 80,000 voters there? What a hue and cry would have been raised. The desire of the late Government was to give every adult citizen an opportunity to vote. Because of that desire we never had - as I said two or three days ago - a fuller, better, or purer roll than we had at the last general election. In confirmation of my statement, I would point to the fact that in Victoria a bigger poll was never recorded, and, in comparison with past elections, never were there fewer irregularities. It is up to the Minister of Defence to withdraw the statement which he made yesterday - that 80,000 names had been deliberately put on the New South Wales rolls on the eve of a general election by means of dummy cards. That was an incorrect statement, because no dummy cards were introduced. </para>

                                    does not confirm the statement. It is up to the Minister to say that he was in the wrong in speaking as he did yesterday, and to admit that the suspicion which he- had in his mind that the late Government had been parties to organized corruption was without justification. When he made that statement yesterday, it was taken up seriously by the press, and sensational subheadings appeared over the reports of our parliamentary proceedings. Probably in the New South Wales newspapers to-day very great prominence will be given to the Minister&#39;s statements. I say that there is not a tittle of evidence to support it. The officers whom he declared would confirm what he said have stated exactly the opposite.

It has been stated, not only by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen,</inline> but by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McColl,</inline> that thousands of names were put on the rolls for party purposes.

                            <para>. -  There was some method in <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gould&#39;s</inline> madness when he rose to object to the Standing Orders being suspended. There was a great deal in his little move which did not appear at the moment. The exposure which has been made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> of the statements which we heard last night, reveal the secret of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gould&#39;s</inline> desire to cloak the matter and prevent a further statement being made with regard to it. We are getting somewhat accustomed to the sneer that is so frequently cast across the chamber about our big majority. I can assure honorable senators opposite that that big majority is going to be used on more than one occasion to prevent downright misrepresentation from remaining unchecked. </para>

                                <para>- It is a red herring that stinks very badly. Apparently <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> was trying to outdo <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McColl</inline> in the statements that he made about the conduct of the election, that wholesale corruption had been practised by the Labour party. That was the impression that he tried to convey last night. We must admit that he went to great pains to make it appear that the officials in New South Wales had revealed certain facts to him. He made it appear that the whole process of wrong-doing had been revealed. But, unfortunately for himself, he did not take very much care to verify his facts. Otherwise he would have known that these statements, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> has shown this afternoon, were wholly misunderstood. Had he known that, he would have been prevented from making such rash assertions as he has been guilty of. What has become of those 80,000 voters? I am reminded of the story with which we are all familiar, of the boy and the thousand cats. The cats in the story dwindled to &#34; our cat and another.&#34; <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen&#39;s</inline> 80,000 votes have dwindled down to i per cent., or only 400 for the whole State of New South Wales. </para>

There is no getting away from this position. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> may try as much as he likes to smother up what he said yesterday by picking out here and there points in the speech referred to by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce.</inline> It is useless for him to say, &#34;I say the same again.&#34; Saying the same again does not make his statements one whit truer than they were when he uttered them yesterday. He may do his utmost to smother up his meaning, but he will not succeed. He has alluded to a misunderstanding of some speech made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> in introducing the amending Electoral Bill. I certainly do not remember the whole of that speech. There would be no time for anything else if we all remembered each other&#39;s speeches. But I do remember this - that whatever <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce&#39;s</inline> impression may have been as to what effect the card system would have, he expressed, the opinion that until that system was in active operation no one could possibly tell how it would work out in practice. As far as that is concerned, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> has to-day declared, &#34; What I said I say again.&#34; Said what? That 80,000 names were placed on the rolls wrongfully. </para>

                                <para>- He is a little bit shy of the word &#34; fraudulently &#34; now. He has had to admit that the proclamation was a perfectly legal document, issued within the four corners of the Electoral Act, which provides that the rolls be compiled in a prescribed manner. The prescribed manner necessarily means prescribed in accordance with the terms of the Act. Clearly, therefore, that refers to the card system; and there is a direct obligation to manage it within the four corners of the Act. The course taken in the Senate to-day has been amply justified by the speeches that have been made. We have had an opportunity of dealing with the whole subject as one, and to concentrate all our attention upon it. If the debate had taken place upon the measure which we were discussing last night, other speeches would have been interposed. The only credit which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> can possibly get out of the whole affair lies in his gallant effort to smother up the innuendoes and insinuations which he cast last night, not merely on our party, and the ex-Minister, but on the officials. </para>

He told us that when he took on the <inline font-style="italic">role</inline> of a Sherlock Holmes, and acted as a private detective for the purpose of finding out who ought, and who ought not, to be on the rolls, he made inquiries from the electoral officers, who made an explanation to the following effect in regard to four names : - &#34; We could only find a card for one, and the others are dummy cards.&#34; <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> asked, &#34; What do you mean by dummy cards?&#34; He was told, according to his statement - </para>

                                <para>- I consider that they were, because the whole imputation of the honorable senator was -that 80,000 of his fellow countrymen were willing to lend themselves to the manipulation of the Labour party, in order to fraudulently help them to victory. If that was not his point, his statement had no point whatever, and certainly no one can accuse him of talking aimlessly. He generally has some object in view when he talks, and there would have been no object except to impute that, under the sanction and the direction of the Labour party and their Ministers, this attempt was made, and succeeded to the extent of 80,000, to place names on the roll wrongfully. Admittedly there were very many changes in the electoral system by the introduction of claim cards. It is known that a very large proportion of the electors of every State are somewhat careless in carrying out the provisions of the law, either as to enrolling or as to seeing that their names are retained. Consequently, we could not expect any system, however perfect in theory it might be, to work well at its inception.  There were numerous misunderstandings; there were tens of thousands of persons who did not even know the penalties to which they were liable. It is ridiculous to say that the police, in collecting the rolls, should not exercise a little discretion when they find that one or more members of a family are absent, though their names were already on the roll, and had been, perhaps, for the last twenty years, and should not have power to say, &#34; We will hold our judgment in suspense until these people have had a further opportunity.&#34; As we know, they have a legal right to send in the claims, which they are supposed to do. But <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> makes out that that was showing favoritism. If it had been a case of eight or eighty persons, or any small number, we could understand that a charge of favoritism might lie, but when it is a case of 80,000 persons, probably 10 per cent, of the whole of the electors of the State - at any rate, a considerable percentage - no room for a charge of favoritism is possible. I suppose that a proportionate number were similarly enrolled in other States. The application of the argument to New South Wales is only because the direct reference of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> was to that State; but he meant to imply, I believe, that the same thing occurred in other States. Therefore, the number of those concerned must have amounted to an enormous percentage of the whole of the electors of the Commonwealth. If in the transition stage from the old system to the new one, there was a danger that, perhaps,&#34; some hundreds of thousands of electors would be disfranchised through not understanding the new law, it was most meritorious conduct on the part of all concerned to extend the utmost possible facilities to individuals to get their names on the roll. If it were not for this blind partisan spirit, which is becoming so rampant on the part of the disgruntled minority opposite, they would not have dreamed of making such charges. In fact, a charge would have fairly lain against the Labour party if it had attempted to carry out one particular part of the Act in such a rigid manner as to make it impossible for these persons to be enrolled. All this talk about inflation has, to my mind, fallen very wide of the mark. It only shows that in our opponents there is deeply rooted the old traditional Tory spirit of liking to keep .the rolls in as attenuated a form as possible. They would rather that ninety-nine electors were omitted who should be there than that one elector should be placed there without justification. </para>

                                <para>- That may be so; but it is just as relevant as other interjections. I am not discussing the question of compulsory voting, but pointing out that the general desire on the part of honorable senators opposite and their &#39;party is to try to strike every possible name off the roll and to oppose any attempt to get the fullest possible roll. I, for one, would rather see the rolls inflated than have the thousands of names struck off that were habitually struck off under the rule of our political enemies. When they were in charge every effort was made to strike off all the names they possibly could, knowing that, with a small roll, probably the old capitalists, the old prosperous people, who are always in one place, would be there and vote with them while the workers - the more nomadic class - would be missing. </para>

It was the absolutely corrupt electoral methods that were to some extent followed by our opponents at the last election that put our honorable friends opposite on the Treasury bench. Only for the most direct violations of the law by very many of their principal supporters, a number of Liberals would not have been returned to the Senate or the other House. </para>

Some years ago, long before I ever thought of becoming a member of the Senate, I used to closely follow the speeches of not only <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen,</inline> but other senators.

                                <para>- The means was to mislead honorable senators in order that they should adopt a scheme which the Labour party were reserving to themselves the right to set aside at any moment. It has been stated, not only in regard to New South Wales, but in regard to all the States, that the electoral law helped to very great abuses. I know that I have no right to debate the whole of this question, but I think that if one did make a statement he would have an opportunity of showing it was a system by means of which opportunities were given which did not previously exist to manipulate the rolls corruptly. It was a system by means of which corruption might be practised - I do not say by Ministers, but by individuals who were prepared to take advantage of it. We have had proof that all that has been said <inline font-style="italic">on</inline> this motion might have been said just as well on the Supply Bill, and I express the hope that honorable senators will not consider it necessary to beat the drum again when we take up the Supply Bill, or the Address-in-Reply. We have had sufficient of this matter to-day, and, personally, I am in no better position to form an opinion on the subject than I was before this debate commenced. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie appeared to credit me with a certain amount of prescience when I objected to the suspension of the Standing Orders; but let me assure the honorable senator that I desired only that we should adopt an orderly system of procedure in this chamber. </para>

                            <para>. - As a new member I might be allowed to say a word or two upon the important question occupying the attention of the Senate this afternoon. Before the recent elections, and for some time after they took place, we were accustomed to hear tales of roll-stuffing, and many complaints about the conduct of elections. I was very much astonished yesterday afternoon to hear the statement made by the Minister of Defence. The honorable senator told us to-day that he was pleading to a jury whose minds were made up. So far as I am concerned, I give that statement an absolute denial. I was very much impressed with the honorable senator&#39;s statements yesterday, and if he had made out as good a case this afternoon as he appeared to me to make yesterday, I might now hold a very different opinion on this subject. Had the late Minister of Home Affairs given instructions in the way described by the Minister of Defence yesterday afternoon, his action would, in my opinion, have been, not merely a grave offence, but a crime. To-day, the honorable senator has been met with a complete refutation of his statement, and a full explanation of the whole of the circumstances. He has made a very bad attempt to side-track the whole question,, and has not had the manliness to withdraw and apologize for the impression he intended by his remarks of yesterday to convey to the Senate and to the public outside. This is a matter of the greatest consequence, because, I have no doubt that in the daily press published in every capital in Australia, as well as in the daily newspapers published in Melbourne, there have been scare headings making the charge against the Labour party that, for political purposes, 80.000 dummy names were inserted in the rolls. </para>

I have myself no doubt whatever that what was done in New South Wales was done in every other State. The statement of the Minister of Defence has gone out to the public to the detriment of the Labour party. To-day, we have taken the first opportunity, notwithstanding the protests from the other side, who desire that a handful of honorable senators shall control the Senate, to thoroughly explain the matter in order that at the earliest possible opportunity the truth might be stated, in the hope that it might catch up with the statement made here yesterday by the Minister of Defence. Honorable senators opposite desire that the minority, and not the majority, shall rule in the Senate. </para>

                                <para>- I bow to your ruling, sir. The Minister of Defence has come down from 80,000 dummy electors to one bed-ridden old woman, against whom action is supposed to have been taken in Queensland. In this case the inference to be drawn from the honorable senator&#39;s remarks was that the action had been taken by the ex-Minister of Home Affairs, but an honorable senator representing Queensland has informed us that not only was the ex-Minister of Home Affairs unaware of the prosecution referred to, but even the Chief Electoral Officer of the State did not know that such action had been taken. The action was taken by the local Returning Officer. </para>

                                <para>- I know nothing whatever about it; but I am satisfied that if a fine was imposed there was a sufficient number of Labour men in the district prepared to see that a bed-ridden woman was not required to suffer by the infliction of a fine. It is a sorry spectacle to find a Minister of the Crown on one afternoon making charges against the whole of the people of Australia and accusing the late Government of placing 80,000 people on the rolls on the eve of an election for improper purposes, and coming down next day to justify his charge by a reference to the alleged punishment of one bedridden old woman. I have entered this Chamber with a fairly open mind. I am prepared, at any rate, to give due consideration to any measure brought for ward to benefit Australia, no matter from what side of the chamber it may emanate; but I do say that the exhibition by the Minister of Defence yesterday and to-day has made a marked impression upon my mind with respect to the credence I can give to his statements. </para>

                    <para>. - I rise mainly for the purpose of asking the HonoraryMinister if he can inform us whether arrangements have been made between the Commonwealth and any of the shipping companies in regard to the establishment of an improved mail service to Tasmania. In the State which I represent many rumours are afloat to the effect that the Government propose to enter into another contract for a period of seven years with one or other of the two companies which now hold the contract for the carriage of mails there. If that be so, I think the people of Tasmania should be informed of it, in order that they may have an opportunity of voicing their views to the Government. In spite of repeated protests, we have, year after year, the spectacle of a very inefficient mail service during the winter months between the mainland and Tasmania. For some years we have had only one good vessel on the line - I refer to the <inline font-style="italic">Loongana.</inline> She has now been laid up for the annual overhaul, which, I understand, is likely to occupy longer than usual, and her place has been taken by the <inline font-style="italic">Westralia</inline> - a very slow vessel. Then we have the Rotomahana, which, winter after winter, has proved to be absolutely unfit for the service. Tasmanians would like to know as early as possible whether the Government intend to enter into a fresh contract with the Huddart, Parker Company, or with the Union Steam-ship Company, or with both, for a term of years. I recollect that the Honorary Minister and myself were members of a deputation which waited on the late Government, some time ago, in respect to this very question. On that occasion the Honorary Minister was opposed to any contract being entered into for a lengthy period. In view of the rumour that the Government intend to enter into another such contract, 1 would like an assurance from him on that point. I do not propose to refer to any matters in connexion with this Supply Bill which can better be dealt with upon the motion for the adoption of the Address-in-Reply. But I do feel bound to ask one question, which I put to the Minister of Defence yesterday. A statement has gone forth to Australia, through the columns of the <inline font-style="italic">Argus,</inline> that is absolutely unjust to every member of the Labour party in this Parliament. I asked the Minister of Defence if he would give me a refutation of that statement. He declined to do so, and sheltered himself behind the plea that it was not proposed to answer questions until the motion of censure in another place had been disposed of. He must have known that the Prime Minister himself gave an answer to a similar question on the previous day. </para>

                <para class="block">I asked the Minister of Defence yesterday if he was aware of any occasion upon which a member of his party had been refused a pair in case of illness, but he declined to answer. I believe that the Vice-President of the Executive Council and the Honorary Minister will admit that the statement made by the <inline font-style="italic">A.rgus</inline> is an absolute untruth. If any such occasion has arisen, I invite the Minister of Defence to name it. I have been a member of this Chamber for ten years out of tha thirteen years which have elapsed since the consummation of Federation, and I say that it has always been the custom to grant pairs in the case of illness or accident. But because the Labour party have refused to grant pairs to the other side in cases other than illness or accident, this statement has been published. It was an unmanly statement for any journalist to make, because it casts an undeserved reflection upon the members of the Labour party. I submit that the Leader of the Government in this Chamber ought to have observed the unwritten code under which  one political party has always been ready to shield its opponents from imputations of unfairness. I do not intend to say any more at this juncture, but I hope that in Committee the Honorary Minister will give me the information which I seek in connexion with the establishment of an improved mail service to Tasmania. </para>

                    <para>. - I do not propose to delay the passing of this Bill, but I would like to reply to some statements which were made by the Minister of Defence yesterday regarding the stoppage of work at the Fitzroy Dock, Sydney. I believe that the action of the Government was another political move which has utterly failed to achieve its purpose, and I say, without fear of contradiction, that the Minister of Defence and the Naval Board, by closing down the works at Cockatoo Island, have made themselves the laughing stock of all who know anything about the business. If the. boilers in use there had been so defective as to be positively dangerous, is it not reasonable to assume that the boilermakers who repaired them, as well as the engineers and the firemen, would know something of it, and would know if their lives were in danger? In another place we were assured that there was only a steel plate one sixteenth of an inch in thickness between these men and an explosion. Such a statement was perfectly ridiculous. If there were only one-sixteenth of an inch of steel in a boiler there would be no fear of an explosion, because that weak spot would give way, the water would flow out, and the attendant would thus know that there was something wrong. But so long as one can keep water in a boiler, there is no danger of an explosion. The statement reminds me of that credited to a railway authority who said that no locomotives were to go out of the workshops because of the danger of a collision on the line. The Minister of Defence desired to make political capital out of his action at the expense of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce.</inline> In the Sydney <inline font-style="italic">Daily Telegraph</inline> of 1st August of the present year he is reported to have said - </para>

                    <para>It must be obvious, however, that with every human expedition the delay in the completion of the boats referred to cannot be avoided, <inline font-style="italic">and</inline> is, as stated, serious. Judging from such a view of this transaction as I have so far been able to take, I can only conclude that the Commonwealth has been committed to an extremely bad bargain. </para>

                <para class="block">I believe that the Minister, in reply to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> yesterday, was a little inaccurate. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> asked him whether he had a report from the acting manager, and he said that he had not. I honestly believe that he had; and if we had that report before us, together with the report of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Julius,</inline> we could see clearly why these works were closed down. I feel perfectly sure that any private firm would be only too glad to take over the dock and the machinery at the price which the Commonwealth Government paid for them. We are told that the machinery is obsolete. I wish to say distinctly that there is not an obsolete machine at Cockatoo Island Dock. Some of it is old, but, as a matter of fact, the shipbuilding machinery there is more up-to-date than is the machinery at many good ship-building yards in England and Germany. We have had men working there who worked in the yards in England and on the Continent of Europe, and they say that the facilities for ship-building at Cockatoo Island Dock are superior to those with which they were familiar abroad. Moreover, this machinery has been manufactured at Cockatoo Island </para>
                <para class="block">Dock under the guidance of an experienced young Australian, who served his time in this country, and went to England to acquire further experience. He came back here, and the reforms which he effected turned the island into an up-to-date dock-yard. But he got little credit for what he did. I say that much of what has occurred is due to paltry spite against this man. He can do nothing that is right in the eyes of some people. When he built a pair of engines for the Small Arms Factory, at Lithgow, some persons in authority were going to put them on the scrap heap, but they have been proved to be amongst the best running engines in Australia, and were the first engines of that class to be built in Australasia. There was a report some time ago that it would not be possible to build ships at Cockatoo Island Dock, because the weight of a cruiser would cause the island to sink into the water, though it is formed of solid rock! Some one is trying to belittle the place as a dock for building vessels. When the Government took over the island, they were told by the manager that the boiler power was old. He desired them to allow him to purchase a boiler, so that he could put it in position, and then test the existing boilers one at a time without causing any cessation of work. There was absolutely no necessity for closing down the works: One boiler at a time could have been closed down until the whole of them were tested. We are told that the management had been careless, and that the boilers must have been in a bad condition for some time. As a matter of fact, however, better care has been taken of these boilers than of any boilers that I know of. They have been subjected to a periodical overhaul. There is a ten days cessation of work at Christmas time, when boilermakers are employed cleaning and repairing them. On every holiday, men are engaged to look after them. An order is given that they are to be blown down and washed once a fortnight. Boilers that are looked after like that are certainly in a good condition. &#39;I say unreservedly that these boilers are in a better condition than are some of those which are running on our railways to-day - infinitely better. They have been looked after better, and have had more care devoted to them. The action which the Minister should have taken was to call for a report by a Navigation Board Surveyor. These men are every day of their  lives engaged in surveying boilers. They could have furnished a report without stopping the work for a moment. But instead of that, we get a prejudiced report from a man who does not want to see shipbuilding going on there. He does not want to see Australian ship-building at all. He wants to see our ships imported. </para>

Before interfering with these boilers the Minister should have inquired into the condition of the rotten old tubs of vessels which are used to carry the men from Circular Quay to Cockatoo Island. I do not say that the boilers on those vessels are not in a good condition. I do not know. They certainly have been in use for a long time. If there is any danger at all to the lives of the men, it is when they are being carried to and from their work, and not when they are engaged upon it. </para>

Fancy a Minister telegraphing, at half -past 3 in the afternoon, &#34; Close the boilers down; stop the works! &#34; I believe that everything was stopped from the very moment of the receipt of the telegram. A blower was stopped in the moulders&#39; shop, and hundreds of pounds&#39; worth of work spoilt. A lift was stopped half way up the bank, and the men on it had to descend on ladders. I never heard of such a mad thing in my life. </para>

                        <para>- The Minister cannot have thought so. Some of these men worked with thousands of tons of solid rock between themselves and the boilers. The whole of the guns in the British Navy could not blow away that rock. I say that the report relied upon by the Minister can be proved a lie. Something has been said about the thinness of the boiler plates. Any one who knows anything about a boiler, or who has had anything to do with such things, knows full well that a boiler has to be stayed; and no matter if a plate is only one-sixteenth of an inch thick, if the stays are correct and perfect no harm can come to it. </para>

                        <para>- Of course it is.. When you test a boiler it is tested at cold-water pressure to double the pressure ordinarily required under steam, to see if any defect discloses itself in the inside of the boiler. Although the plates themselves may be as thin as has been represented in this case - and, as a matter of fact, there was not a plate in one of the boilers under five-sixteenths of an inch - nevertheless, as long as the stays are perfect, the boiler is absolutely safe. Do not honorable senators think that the men who work at these boilers know when they are safe ? </para>

                        <para>- They certainly ought to know, and if they do not I should like to know who does. We are told about the scale found inside the boilers. The man who made that report and commented upon the scale did not know what he was talking about. To survey and inspect boilers of this kind, the tubes have to be drawn. When the tubes come through the front they scrape the scale off, and that scale falls to the bottom. That is the scale that  was found in the boilers in this instance, and it was for that reasons that they were said to be dangerous. </para>

So we are; but these boilers at Cockatoo Island Dock are, as a matter of fact, thoroughly inspected and examined every twelve months. When the Navigation Bill was before us, I tried to secure an examination of marine boilers every six months, but the proposal was knocked out, on the ground that the period was too frequent. </para>

                        <para>- I have myself been and had a look at these boilers at Cockatoo Island Dock. I propose to tell the Senate what I know about  them. No. 1 boiler was re-examined and re-tubed in January, 1910. It was thoroughly repaired at that time. We are told that these boilers have been inefficient for years. Does any one mean to say that a boiler that was thoroughly repaired in December, 1910, has been unsafe for years? Any one who knows anything will say that that cannot be so. When I see reports by men who make statements of this kind, I am led to believe that they are without practical experience. Unpractical men, when they go to inspect a boiler, have to drill a hole through it to find the thickness of a plate. A practical man does not. He knows the thickness of a plate from the tap of a hammer. I say again that the Minister ought to have called on a surveyor of the Marine Department of New South Wales to report. I should be prepared to stand by such a report. No. 2 boiler was re-tubed, thoroughly repaired, and placed in position in 1905. It was formerly a locomotive boiler. It was overhauled during the ten days&#39; vacation at Christmas time. </para>

                        <para>- Up to 110 lbs., I think. When you test a boiler under cold pressure, you put on double the pressure that you have when it is under steam. That makes it absolutely doubly safe. If I were testing a boiler for myself I would not think of doing that, because I know that it is an undue strain. But that is the safety rule of Lloyd&#39;s and others. </para>

                        <para>- To any boiler that test is applied. This particular boiler was thoroughly repaired by the locomotive department of New South Wales before it was taken to Cockatoo Island in 1909. No. 4 boiler was taken out of the <inline font-style="italic">Countess of Hopetoun;</inline> it was thoroughly repaired and retubed in 1911, and tested to double the working pressure. It was working at 60 lbs. pressure, and 50 lbs. is enough to drive the machinery. If the men had been doubtful as to the boiler, all that they had to do was to reduce the pressure to 50 lbs., as is done by any surveyor or practical man, and the boiler would have worked all the machinery necessary. The authorities did not do that, but told the men to blow down the boiler and draw the furnaces. No. 9 boiler is the <inline font-style="italic">Protector&#39;s</inline> old boiler. It was condemned, and was known as the steam-hammer boiler. Since it was condemned it has been tested to a cold-water pressure of 180 lbs. to the square inch. A boiler which will stand that pressure under cold water is absolutely safe at 60 lbs., and although there may be a spot that is weak, still the boiler is safe. As it is with a boot, so it is with a boiler. When a hole appears in a boot, the boot is repaired, and is just as good as ever it was. With a boiler you may find a place where there has been a flaw in the original material, or undue pressure has been brought to bear; but that does not make the boiler unsafe, so long as the stays are sound and in position. Some years before the boiler was taken out of the <inline font-style="italic">Countess of Hopetoun,</inline> it was bound with angle-iron stays round the furnaces to strengthen it. These stays are still on the boiler, and make it absolutely safe, even if the plate  is only a quarter-of-an-inch thick. The repor t also states that the tubes of these boilers, which have been working for years, are condemned as unfit for further use. If these boilers are unfit for further use, and, when tested, carry a double working pressure under cold water, will any man who knows anything about the business say that they are unsafe? The other boilers on Cockatoo Island are almost new, and no exception is taken to them. The reason for closing down the whole of these boilers was a political one. The Minister of Defence wanted to have a stab at his predecessor, and suggest that he had done something wrong. He thought that his predecessor, to use his own words, had made &#39; &#39; a rotten bargain.&#34; In my opinion, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> made a good bargain. The policy of the Labour party has always been to assist the ship-building industry in Australia. Our policy is, according to Admiral Henderson, to build our own ships, and to have our own repairing depots. What would be our position with a war in . the China Seas, if some of our vessels were disabled, and we had no repairing depot ? When I was secretary of the Boilermakers&#39; Union, the Admiralty authorities knew of every man in Australia upon whom they could call in an emergency. We cannot have ship-building yards unless we have repairing yards. The policy of the present Government is, not to assist ship-building in Australia, but to get the work done elsewhere. Had not a Labour Ministry been in power at the time, our war-ships would have been built in England. This is a cowardly attack on a previous Minister, and one which should not have been made. It will be clearly proved to the country when the report goes forth that the stoppage of work at the Fitzroy Dock was a movement for some other purpose than to insure the safety of the men. The men understood how to insure their own safety. Let me ask <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Clemons</inline> if it is intended to recoup the men for the time they lost through this silly action ? Are sixty or seventy men to be allowed to lose money in that way when they were perfectly willing to work, and the life of no person was in danger? The report will clearly show that what I say is absolutely correct. In my opinion, it was a political attack aimed at the ex-Minister of Defence, and, like the charges made yesterday, it fell short of the mark. </para>

First, I want to supplement what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O&#39;Keefe</inline> has said with reference to the proposal of the Government, as expressed in forecasts made in the press, to give a contract to the present steam-ship combine for seven years. That this is contemplated seems to be pretty clear. I want to ask <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Clemons,</inline> as a representative of Tasmania, whether, in view of his past utterances here on the question of the steam-ship combine, and the unfortunate position which the State occupies in regard to not only the mail contract, but trading facilities, he is going to be a consenting party to an agreement which will tie Tasmania up to the combine for seven years? He knows that quite recently an intimation appeared in the press of Australia that the fares of the steam-ship companies throughout the Commonwealth, with the exception of Tasmania, were to be increased 15 per cent. The increase was to apply to every other route except the Tasmanian passenger trade. If we, by means of our mail contract, give the shipping companies the right for seven years to impose what, fares, freights, restrictions, and conditions on Tasmania they like, clearly we shall have the Tasmanian fares and freights increased at perhaps a greater ratio in the near future. It is clearly courting the inevitable if we give them a contract. </para>
                </talk.start>
                <para>While we have the alternative - and one which will be debated here at some length - of running our own boats, and paying the interest with the present subsidy, it would be criminal on the part of the Government, without consulting the representatives of the people of Tasmania, to tie up the State for seven years to this unholy combine. I shall look for, and confidently expect to get, the support of every representative of Tasmania on the question of nationalizing the boats. But if the Government once tie up Tasmania by means of a mail contract, they know, as we know, that that question must be put aside as having been finally dealt with. During the last few weeks, prominent business men in Launceston, who are not supporters of the Labour party, have come to me in fear and trepidation, and asked me whatever I did to try to cooperate with those in power to prevent this combine getting a seven years&#39; con-  tract. When I asked these gentlemen why they did not come out in the open and assist me by agitating in that direction - and I can give the names privately if necessary - they said that they dare not lead an agitation for the simple reason that if they did, by some strange means, they may be penalized by the shipping companies. </para>

                <para>I come now to the funny part of the matter.

The aim of the Labour candidate is to keep the eyes of the elector upon the money that has been voted. &#34; See what we have done for you &#34; they say. &#34; There never were such fine fellows as we are. Take a good look at us, and whatever you do don&#39;t forget those five hundred thousand pounds.&#34; But this is merely political tittilation It is meant to tickle the ears of the unthinking.

The Commonwealth owes the State of Tasmania the sum of .&#163;400,000. The Labour party has declined to pay it over. The only real hope of ever getting it is to look to the Liberals. They tried to give us last session &#163;70,000 of it, but failed. The caucus was too solid. The Liberals have some sympathy with Tasmania. The caucus has none. It has no time for us. No names are too hard, no epithet too opprobrious. Even the &#163;500,000 was flung at us as a charity vote. We were scorned as a &#34; mendicant State.&#34; </para>

                <para>I suppose it is of no use to ask for information from Ministers, who have adopted a very high-handed style. In this connexion I wish to place on record a little experience which, as one of the trustees of the Commonwealth, I had when I made a request for information. I do not refer to a question asked in the Senate, but to the fact that I wrote to the Director of Works,  Colonel Owen,  asking him for an outline or report of the present system of dealing with buildings carried out by the Public Works Branch of the Home Affairs Department. Here is the reply I got, not from  Colonel Owen,  but from the under-strapper, the gentleman&#39; who looms large on the horizon of the Home Affairs Department, and who, I believe, is known as the Assistant Minister of Home Affairs. He wrote- </para>

                    <para>- It is inevitable that we shall dp that, but the question at present to be considered is whether we should sit down calmly and permit Ministers to flout us by refusing to supply information. I have yet to learn that the Director of Public Works is under any obligation to submit to the Minister a question put to himself before he can give a reply to it.  Colonel Owen  did me the courtesy of writing me confidentially, but I received a point-blank refusal from the Minister. </para>

                <para>I wish now to say a few words upon the question of defence. The Minister has twitted the late Government with having been extravagant. I noted particularly one remark which he made when he affirmed that the greatest enemy to effective defence is extravagance. I differ from him on that point.I believe that the greatest enemy to effective defence is unsympathetic administration such as we have now. To-day we have Ministers in office who are absolutely put of sympathy with our defence policy. While we have in power gentlemen like <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Clemons,</inline> we cannot expect much in the way of sympathetic administration. Both of them have many times expressed their contempt for an Australian-owned and an Australian-controlled Navy. </para>

He has shown that in Tasmania. For some time past a report has been current in Launceston that he did all in his power to evade those sections in pur Defence Act which rendered the military training of his boys compulsory. A Minister of the Crown should be the first to observe the law of the Commonwealth, and thus to set a good example to others. </para>

                        <para>- He was not. He used every legitimate means to enable his boys to escape compulsory military training. Upon many occasions I, in common with others in Launceston, have received complaints from mothers whose boys were being trained because <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Clemons&#39;</inline> sons were not being trained. It was urged against members of this Parliament that we were not anxious for our own boys to be subjected to military training. When one inquired for a justification of&#34;&#34; that accusation, one was met with the reply that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator demons&#39;</inline> boys were not being subjected to military training. </para>

When the lieutenant in charge of one area wrote to him, notifying him that his lads were eligible for military training, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Clemons</inline> replied that he did not reside in that area because his house fronted another street. It was a question of the honorable gentleman living in a house which faced both ways. I ask leave to resume my remarks at a later stage. </para>

Thus for several months the matter dragged on unsettled. Finally, one Area Officer was plucky enough to do his duty. He served <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Clemons</inline> with a notice that his boys must be trained. Subsequently a letter was received from <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Irvine</inline> to the effect that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator demons&#39;</inline> boys were not up to the required physical standard - that their chest measurement was not good enough. </para>

                        <para>- Yes. That his statement was not true was. proved afterwards. When another officer approached <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Clemons</inline> and insisted that his boys should be trained, that gentleman, in his high-handed manner, went down to the military office in Launceston, where he had a violent quarrel with the sergeant-major, who was merely performing his duty. Surely that is a magnificent example for a Minister in this Parliament to set. When the sergeant-major told him that he was merely doing his duty, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Clemons</inline> said, &#34;How dare you speak to me in such a fashion?&#34; Evidently he is the great man, the mighty hero, the senator who represents Tasmania. Because a gentle man who was appointed to the Defence Forces dared to perform his duty, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Clemons</inline> abused him. When, owing to the persistence of this sergeant-major, the sons of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Clemons</inline> were examined by a duly qualified medical officer, they were all passed into the ranks, and they are being trained to-day. But how can we expect efficient administration from a gentleman who does not believe in the primary principles of our Defence Act? As one of the six senators who represent Tasmania, I feel sore that the report to which I have referred should have gone round Launceston, and that one of our number should have been charged with endeavouring to dodge his legal and moral obligations under that Act. </para>

That was the position. </para>

                    <para>. - I now desire to refer to the speech made by the Prime Minister to-day. I am not taking up this matter in a spirit of pique, but simply because I feel that we have a duty to perform. When reflections are made upon the Senate by a gentleman in a responsible position, especially by one occupying the highest position within the disposal of this Parliament, I think that we should be lacking in our duty if attention were not called to it. As the language used by the Prime Minister was most unfair to the Senate, I certainly cannot allow the matter to pass. I will now proceed to read the speech of the Prime Minister in order that honorable senators may be made acquainted with the facts. </para>

                <para>The Prime Minister, at the outset, pointed out the necessity in view of the position of the Liberal party in the House, of continued organization. He urged them to be as prepared as they were at the last election to render the fine services which had resulted in the Liberal victory. The Government was in office but not in power. That was the position. All that was left for them to do was to look to their administrative duties, in the meantime, while they got ready to make their appeal to the country for a further accretion of political power. He wanted them to understand, and events daily were confirming it, that this Parliament could not be of long duration. They were feeling every day how precarious it was to have to depend upon a gentleman in the chair who, however true his Liberal instincts might be, was still supposed to be in an impartial position and was therefore not available on the floor of the House like an ordinary member. </para>
                <para class="block">Here is the portion which I consider a very serious reflection upon the work of the Senate - &#34; You have only to look at the position in the Senate,&#34; continued <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Cook.</inline> &#34; I was there last night, and we had a spectacle which, I hope, will not be repeated for the sake of the credit of the Commonwealth. I saw a Labour member take control of the Senate absolutely, and our responsible Ministers sitting by, helpless as babes, having their own Supply Bill taken out of their hands and deliberately set aside while this Labour member instituted a partisan committee to inquire into a departmental act in regard to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. H.</inline> Chinn. When we see gentlemen in the Senate prepared to flout the decision of the country a. very serious position arises with regard to responsible Government.&#34; </para>
                <para class="block">What is the decision of the country so far as the Chinn case is concerned ? I can promise the Prime Minister and his sup-, porters that the country will know a great deal about the Chinn case before it is finished with. No more scandalous piece of persecution has ever taken place. </para>

                        <para>- Before very long the country will know a great deal more about the Chinn case than it knows now. We will see how far the gentleman who was most directly responsible for the action taken was justified in going outside and reflecting on the Senate for ordering an inquiry. He dubbed the Committee appointed yesterday &#34; a partisan committee,&#34; although it contains one member of the Government party, and two other members of that party were afforded an opportunity to be included. If it is a partisan committee, who made it so? It was certainly not this side of the Senate, as we were prepared to nominate three supporters of the Government to sit on it. In face of these facts, I cannot see why even <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bakhap</inline> should take the matter in the way which apparently he does. </para>

                    <para>.- I wish to point out as briefly as possible the grave discrepancies existing in Tasmania between the Federal land tax valuations and the State unimproved land valuations. The discrepancies are so very glaring as to warrant, I think, an inquiry on the part of the Federal Government and this Parliament. Some time ago, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Norman</inline> Cameron, then independent member for Wilmot, rose in the Tasmanian Assembly and pointed out that, whilst his State assessment for three properties was &#163;33,334, his own valuation, which was accepted in the first year of the Federal land tax, was &#163;17,260, being a difference of about &#163;16,000. In other words, the Federal valuation was just about half of the State valuation. The definition of unimproved value in the State Act is practically the same as the definition of unimproved value in the Commonwealth Act, so that there should not be any grave difference between Federal and State valuations. Yet we find that in the case of nearly every big estate in Tasmania the Federal valuation is from 25 to 50 per cent, lower than the State valuation. </para>

                        <para>- The valuations have been revised, and I have here an interesting set of figures showing the results of the revision. Take, for instance, the property which <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Norman</inline> Cameron brought before the notice of the Tasmanian Assembly.  His  assessment for Federal purposes was &#163;17,260; the amended assessment by the Federal valuator was &#163;19,445, being a slight increase; while the original assessment by the State valuator was &#163;33,334, which has since been reduced by a State Court of Appeal to &#163;25,246, being a difference of about &#163;6,000. Clearly either the State valuation is too high or the Federal valuation is too low. In Tasmania, we have a Government who disapprove of the principle of unimproved land value taxation. An honorable senator asks me why they do not repeal the tax. The answer is because the people have forced them to put the tax on the statute-book against their will. </para>

                        <para>- I claim that my statement is absolutely correct, and that these figures bear it out. In my opinion, in Tasmania, the unimproved values have been fixed too high, and I believe that the object is to discredit the principle of unimproved land value taxation, and, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Long</inline> interjects, to get at the smaller properties. I think that an inquiry should be instituted. I approached the Commissioner and the  Deputy  Commissioner, whom I found very courteous and willing to assist, unlike the Assistant Minister of Home Affairs, who refused to give some information to me two or three days ago. I found both those officers anxious to facilitate an inquiry. At my request, they had valuations made of four estates which I named, to see if the Federal valuations were not too low or too high. The estate of Meadowbanks was checked by an officer of the Commissioner. The departmental valuation was &#163;5,652, while an independent valuation was &#163;6,021. Quorn Hall, another estate which I know fairly well, was valued at &#163;18,392, while the check valuation by an independent valuator was &#163;18,412. Ellenthorp was assessed departmentally at &#163;12,960, while an independent valuation made it &#163;13,700. Chiswick, another estate of 10,000 acres, was assessed departmentally at &#163;19,420, while an independent valuation was &#163;20,238, being a slight increase. On the increases that were given, the Commissioner did not consider that any interference with the present valuations was necessary. To show honorable senators that there is no exaggeration about my statements, I will refer to the case of Newnham, an estate owned by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. W.</inline> C. Grubb, just outside Launceston. The case was reported in the Launceston <inline font-style="italic">Examiner</inline> of 19th August. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. W.</inline> C. Grubb appealed against the State valuation of &#163;11,660, and the Federal valuator went into the witness box at the State Appeal Court, and said that the Federal unimproved valuation was &#163;5,830. Here is another enormous discrepancy. </para>

                </continue>
                <para>The representatives of Tasmania should not be content to have these discrepancies pass unchallenged. The complaint is freely made - whether it is correct or not I am not in a position to say - that in Tasmania the Federal valuations are .very low, and the consequence is that the Federal land tax is not as effective, or bringing in as much revenue, as it otherwise would do. I think that the Government might well have an independent valuation made by a mainland officer. Let them send a capable judge to investigate the matter thoroughly, and if it is found that the Federal valuations are correct, it will be clearly established that the State valuations are wrong, and that the members of the State Legislature will have to do their part in getting those valuations substantially reduced. </para>

                    <para>. - I wish to refer to a matter connected with the maternity allowance. I asked a question on the subject yesterday of the Minister representing the Treasurer. I did not ask the honorable senator  to do anything, but he refused to answer, in accordance with the stupid practice which is observed, because of the vote of censure pending in another place, which we are not supposed to know anything about. I understand that registrars under the Maternity Allowance Act were requested to furnish returns, I supposed, as to the number of applications in the different States. I believe that they are entitled to fees, and I asked the representative of the Treasurer in the Senate whether he would ascertain if the fees had ever been paid. To my surprise lie asked that notice should be given of the question, and intimated that he was not prepared to answer it until something occurred in another place. If a number of people are suffering injustice, we have reason to complain when a responsible Minister refuses to take any notice of the fact because of the ridiculous practice to which I have referred. I again ask the Honorary Minister if he will look into the matter. I do not care whether he replies to my question or not; but I think he should ascertain whether fees which should have been paid long ago are still owing, and, if so, the reason for the delay in paying them. </para>

In every case of the kind that has come under my notice, it has seemed to me fair and reasonable for the Commissioner of Taxes to remit the fines. I shall undertake to make inquiries, and give the reasons for the remission of the fines. </para>

                    <para>.- I want to say that I made no imputation against the Federal Land Tax Commissioner, and did not reflect upon his action in any way. I simply asked whether, in view of the discrepancies between Federal and State valuations in Tasmania, we should not have it clearly established who is right and who is wrong. I want the Federal position to be unassailable. I believe that the valuations of the Federal Land Tax Commissioner are more nearly accurate than are the State valuations. But I wish to have that absolutely proved, and that can only be done by investigating and checking the valuations. I again ask the Honorary Minister whether, in view of the definite instances I have cited, he will have an inquiry made? I wish to know beyond all doubt whether the Federal Land Tax Commissioner is satisfied that these valuations are correct. </para>

He apparently believes that the valuations by State officials in Tasmania are not correct; but I do not conceive it to be the duty of the Federal Treasurer, or of any of his officers, to investigate the accuracy of valuations made by State authorites. </para>

I understand that these men are now working in Western Australia. Though sufficient time has elapsed for an answer to my communication, I have not so far had even the common courtesy of an acknowledgment df its receipt. Perhaps this is because the Minister of External Affairs is also following the ridiculous practice of refusing to answer questions whilst the vote of censure is hanging over the heads of Ministers. I ask the Honorary Minister now whether he .can inform me if the Federal authorities gave their Sanction to the introduction of these men, and if the unions concerned were asked whether such men were required in the Commonwealth. If the unions concerned were not consulted I would ask the Honorary Minister to say whether in future, when it is deemed advisable1 to bring artisans to Australia, the Federal Government will consult the unions concerned ? </para>

I rose especially with the object of referring to certain misstatements by the Minister of Defence with regard to an officer whose salary is provided for in the vote for the External Affairs Department. I wish to refer to what I describe as the uncalled-for remarks made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> concerning the qualifications possessed by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. George</inline> Ryland, Director of Lands in the Northern Territory. It was not the first occasion on which references have been made to the qualifications of that gentleman for the position he holds. As a matter of fact, throughout Queensland and New South Wales - I cannot speak definitely for Victoria and the other States - a good deal of political capital was made during the recent election campaign out of that gentleman&#39;s appointment by the late Government. </para>

                        <para>- I cannot believe that they did, but I shall leave it to my honorable friend to deal with that. I wish to say, as one who had the pleasure and honour of being associated with <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Ryland</inline> in the Queensland Parliament for many years, that his knowledge of land questions is very extensive. That <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Ryland</inline> &#39;s knowledge of the land question is very extensive no man knows better than does the late Prime Minister, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Fisher.</inline> Some honorable senators may be equally familiar with his qualifications for the position to which he has been appointed. I do not say that he is the only man in Australia who can fill that office. My only object in rising is to defend a public officer, who has been unjustly treated, from the unpardonable slanders which have been hurled at him by the Minister of Defence. One of the stock-in-trade arguments advanced at the last election was that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Ryland</inline> was a Labour man. That was his only disqualification ! How dare he be a Labour man, and how dare he be a strong supporter of the Labour party ? </para>

                        <para>- I do know that he was one of the most intellectual men we had in our Queensland Labour party, and, indeed, in our State Parliament. When I tell honorable senators that for many years he occupied a position on the Lands Committee of our party, and that he was charged with the responsibility of preparing amendments to all Land Bills coming before that Parliament, they will recognise that I am justified in saying that he is well qualified for the office which he now fills. It was hinted yesterday that his chief disqualification was that he was a supporter of the Labour party, and also that he occupied an important position in the Public Service of the Commonwealth as the result of the late Government having given effect to the doctrine of &#34; spoils to the victors.&#34; I believe that the late Government appointed Professor Gilruth Administrator of the Northern Territory. Did they do so on account of his professed Labour principles? I believe that they appointed <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Bevan to his position in the Territory. Is he a Labour man? I do not think that any of us know what are his political convictions. Then I understand that the late Attorney-General recommended the appointment of Judge Murray to Papua, and so satisfied was the present High Commissioner with his selection that when he came into office he confirmed that appointment. During the course of the debate yesterday <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Jensen&#39;s</inline> name was mentioned. Nobody who knows that gentleman, or who is acquainted with his work, will question his fitness for the position which he occupies. He is one of the big authorities on geology in Australia, a fact that has been recognised by no less a man than Professor David. </para>

                    <para>. - I am informed that the Government have decided that the postal, uniforms which the Commonwealth Clothing Factory has been engaged in. making, apart from the uniforms for the. Naval and Military Forces, are to be manufactured by contract, and that, consequently, fifty employes have been discharged. I wish to ask the Honorary Minister if this step is the result of the decision indicated in the policy statement to substitute the contract system for that of day labour, and whether naval and military uniforms will also be manufactured under contract? I may say that it was the intention of the late Government to considerably extend the functions of the Clothing Factory, and with that end in view they had increased the machinery installed there, and also the size of the factory itself. Does the manufacture of postal uniforms under the contract system represent the beginning of a policy to practically close down the factory? I know* that the Government claim to be an anti-Socialistic Government, and as this factory is an instalment of Socialism, they will be quite consistent in closing it down, and getting all these uniforms made under contract. There is just one other matter that I desire to mention. During the debate in this chamber last evening, the Minister of Defence, when asked what expert advice the Government intended to get outside of Australia, in regard to the location of the naval&#39; dockyard at Cockburn Sound, replied that what was being done was the result of a minute, which he read, by the first naval member of the Board. That minute; indicated that the first naval member of the Board was not satisfied that sufficient expert advice was available in the Department. I asked him what was the date of that minute, and he replied 12th August. 1 would remind honorable senators that the House of Representatives reassembled on that very day, and when it met in the afternoon, the policy statement was already in print, and had been circulated amongst honorable members. That policy statement contained a paragraph to the effect that the Government had decided to obtain expert advice outside of the Commonwealth regarding the location of the dockyard site. </para>

                    <para>.- rAs <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Fanstone</inline> seems to have &#34; filled the bill &#34; very efficiently, and to be a capable man, all I can say is that if he meets with the fate that other capable men have encountered from this Government he will be getting what we might reasonably expect. Apparently victimization is part and parcel of the policy of the Ministry. As for the Cockburn Sound Naval Base, if it is removed from the site recommended by Admiral Henderson, I suggest that we shall have to institute another investigation into the reasons for the change of policy. It will be necessary for us to probe the matter, in order to see who are the owners of the foreshore at Mangles Bay. </para>

                    <para>.- During my remarks before the dinner adjournment, I made some reference to a matter affecting <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Clemons.</inline> It has been a matter of public talk in Launceston, where I reside, and is, I consider, a reflection on every Tasmanian representative in this Legislature. I myself, on several occasions, have heard the mothers of children taking exception to the compulsory provisions of our Defence Act, which renders it obligatory upon them to send their children for military training, and objecting to this duty being fulfilled by them, whilst at the same time, an attempt has been made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Clemons,</inline> an Honorary Minister in this Government, to evade the obligations as far as his own children are concerned. </para>
                </talk.start>
                <para>I take it that we, as members of this Parliament, are called upon to set an example in reference to the proper observance of our laws. If we ourselves show a desire to break any provision of any Act of this Parliament, we are setting the worst sort of example to those who send us here, and to the people of Australia generally. I shall refer to actual facts. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Clemons,</inline> as may be known to some honorable senators, occupies a very convenient corner house in Launceston. Some months ago the lieutenant commanding area 92b wrote to him, assuming that he lived in Welmanstreet, Launceston, pointing out that he was not observing the compulsory provisions of the Defence Act in relation to his children. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Clemons</inline> replied to the effect that he did not live in the area in question. The corner block on which his house is situated has one front to High-street, and therefore he claimed that he was not living in the area of which Welman-street is a part. That was surely a flimsy excuse, and a bad example to set in relation to evading the responsibilities of military training. </para>

                        <para>- I think he admits that. In fact, he claims to represent, or misrepresent, the State at the present time. The .officer for the area in which High-street is situated thereupon wrote to him, but <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Clemons</inline> continued to put up a fight against his boys being trained. Whether he objected to them . mixing with the common herd or not, I do not know. Whether he thought that it was <inline font-style="italic">infra dig.</inline> for his sons to be trained alongside the sons of common people, I do not know. But, for some reason, he did not wish to have them trained, and he secured a certificate from <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Irvine,</inline> of Launceston, to the effect that they were not fit for training - that they were not up to the standard required. I have yet to learn that there is any standard set. </para>

                <para class="block">Sergeant-major Johnston, who had insisted that the lads should be trained, dared to speak to him &#34; like this.&#34; When a responsible man tries in this way to evade his legal responsibilities, it is a bad thing for the State which he represents. I give credit to the military authorities of the State for permitting no exception in this case. They insisted that the boys should be examined by the responsible medical Area Officer, and he at once determined that they were fit for training. Accordingly, the boys were put into the ranks, and they are undergoing training at the present time. </para>
                <para>I give the military authorities full credit for what they did in this case. But I do say that we, as representatives of Tasmania, have no right to subject officers to insult for insisting that we shall fulfil our responsibilities as far as our children are concerned. We on this side are quite willing to have our boys trained. I think it is about due to the Senate that some explanation should be made as to the action of the honorable senator in reference to this matter, and as to whether he considers there is any reason why an exception should be made in his own case ? Because he is a senator of Australia, I do not think that he has any right to browbeat officers in order to escape, as far as his own children are concerned, the responsibilities that attach to the children of other citizens of this country. </para>

                    <para>.- Yesterday we had a battle royal between the Minister of Defence and the ex-Minister in regard to the suitability or otherwise of a certain selected site of a Naval Base in Western Australia. I dc not think that there is any disposition, or any need, to discuss matters of defence in a heated or partisan spirit. I trust that it will be found, after inquiry, that the harbor at Cockburn Sound picked out by Admiral Henderson is suitable for a Naval Base. There has been considerable discussion in regard to the matter, which evidently is still at issue. One of the points relate to the existence or nonexistence of a sufficient depth&#39; of water at certain entrances to the Sound on the shores of which, the naval base is proposed to be established. </para>

                        <para>- I know a little about the matter, though I do not pro fess to be an expert. It must be remembered that there have been considerable differences of opinion in regard to harbor works in various parts of Australia, and that since Admiral Henderson&#39;s visit changes of- some importance have taken place in some localities. Whilst the general principles laid down in the Admiral&#39;s report may be adhered to, it is quite conceivable that alterations in detail may be permissible. The Marine Board of Launceston some time ago brought out from the United Kingdom an eminent engineer, who has made a careful examination of the upper and lower reaches of the River Tamar. I understand that Admiral Henderson advised the construction of a naval sub-base at Beauty Point, in the lower waters of the Tamar, and on the improvement of the harbor. It was largely in consequence of his report that the Marine Board of Launceston determined to spend &#163;400,000 on the removal of obstructions in the Tamar. I do not think that Admiral Henderson had any knowledge that a work of that kind was in contemplation. But the fact that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Hunter</inline> was brought out at the expense of the Marine Board, and has made a careful report upon the suitability of the Tamar for harbor works to accommodate ocean-going ships, makes all the difference in the situation. I venture to suggest to the Minister representing the Minister of Defence that the contemplated site of a naval sub-base in the Tamar may be advanced in consideration in view of the fact that it is now- shown to be capable of being constituted an impregnable fortress as strong as Port Arthur. Before Australia can be regarded as properly defended she will have to have several Port Arthurs around her shores. I remind honorable senators, that the Tamar disembogues into Bass Strait, which may be regarded as the commercial High-street or the marine Bourke-street of Australia. It is absolutely essential that there should be a strong fortification in the vicinity df that Strait. </para>

                    <para>. - I desire to refer to certain action which was taken in July last by the military authorities in Toowoomba in respect of defaulting cadets. Fifteen lads were charged in the Summons Division of the Police Court, before <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Harris,</inline> P.M., at the instance of Adjutant Hutchin, Lieutenant Penrose, and Captain Barlow, with not having put in the required number of drills in accordance with the Defence Act. I admit, of course, that a boy should be made to put in the necessary drills. These boys were found guilty, and, instead of being called upon to serve their detention in Toowoomba, they were taken down to Lytton Fortress, at the mouth of the Brisbane River, and kept there. That is, I think, introducing an element of militarism into the defence system which was never contemplated. I have no desire to belabour this matter, but I strongly protest against the action of the military authorities, as the boys might easily have served their detention in Toowoomba district, and without any difficulty, so far as the Defence Force was concerned. I trust that the Minister will be good enough to bring the matter under the notice of the Inspector-General, and ascertain whether it was really necessary to take the boys about 120 miles to the mouth of the Brisbane River, and make them serve from fifteen to twenty days in a fortress. </para>

It will be remembered that during the last campaign it was heralded all over Australia that as the result of Labour legislation during the last three years the sugar industry had been severely crippled. For weeks prior to election day the leading Conservative journal in Queensland, the <inline font-style="italic">Courier,</inline> had a. standing heading indicating some of the things which the Fisher Government had accomplished, and amongst other things was a &#34; Crippled Sugar Industry.&#34; For the information of honorable senators I wish to read a few lines from the Budget speech delivered by the Treasurer of Queensland on the night before last, and reported in the Melbourne newspapers of yesterday - </para>

                <para>The sugar season promised splendid returns, and, coupled with recent legislation, should go far to place the industry on a firm footing. </para>
                <para>I have here various extracts from leading newspapers circulating in the sugar districts, stating that this year&#39;s crop will be a record. </para>

                    <para>. - Under the head of&#34; Quarantine,&#34; I wish to ask the Minister what further steps, if any, the Ministry intend to take in regard to the small-pox epidemic which broke out in Sydney some time ago. It appears to me that they are either doing too much or too little. I have no personal complaint to make, as I was one of those who were vaccinated at a very early stage. The position is a serious one. It is having an important effect upon the trade and commerce of not only Sydney, but places trading with Sydney. I think that more energetic steps might be taken to stamp out the plague than are being taken. To think that there is any virtue in declaring a certain area within a radius of 15 miles of the Sydney General Post Office a quarantine area is to run away with a fallacy, because, in a sense, that area is npt really quarantined. A person living in, or occupying temporarily, a building in the area, or going through the area, if he wishes to go to an adjacent State, is prevented from crossing the border unless he complies with certain conditions. At the same time, people from other parts pf New South Wale? move freely into the quarantine area, and from that area into other parts pf the State. Unless a personal watch is kept over every individual leaving Sydney, there is no doubt that, after a short residence in some other part of New South Wales, there might be no great difficulty in getting across the border north, south, pr west. Again, in very many cases, the vaccination has failed to take, owing, presumably, to some fault in the lymph. The trade and commerce of the city, in fact, of the whole State, is being seriously interfered with without the proclamation having the desired effect of retaining the epidemic within the confines pf Sydney, where it originated More effective steps, I think, should be taken. I have no doubt that the officials are doing the best within their know.ledge; but that some other steps should be taken appear to me to&#39; be necessary. If a person were found to be suffering from the disease, and the premises in which he .was found were isolated, and the patient and the contacts were taken to the quarantine station, that might effect just as good results as the present method of instituting a quarantine area, and then allowing the inhabitants to roam freely in and out of the area. This disease has been prevalent in Sydney for many weeks, and there does not seem, by present indications, to Be any reasonable chance of it being stamped out for a considerable time. If the Ministry are so fond of recognising the rights and the susceptibilities of the States, let them take more vigorous action in conjunction with the State Government if they will. We know that political exigencies or some other reasons have prevented the State Government from making up their mind as to what legislation should be brought forward, and, if brought forward, no one knows what its fate will be. We must realize that, quite apart from the interests of New South Wales, the danger menacing other States is a continuous one, and that the trade and commerce between New South Wales and other States is being seriously impeded. The Government should not rest content merely with the action which has been taken. While they may have done all they could at the outset, they are not following up that action with the energy or the consistency necessary to meet an epidemic of a serious character, as this one has proved itself to be. I trust that the Government will indicate in what way they intend to use their powers and their influence to stamp out the plague. In these Estimates I see an item of &#163;250 for salaries in New South Wales, and &#163;350 for contingencies. Of course, this money is only required for the current month; but, as similar amounts are expended in Victoria, I take it that no special effort is being made by the Federal authorities to stamp out the disease. If the State authorities are not doing enough, it is *&#39; up to &#34; the Federal authorities, who have ample power, to protect the health of the community in any part of Australia and to take more energetic action than is indicated by theses Estimates. </para>

                    <para>. - I assure <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Rae</inline> that the Minister of Trade and Customs, and the Director of Quarantine,, fully realize the gravity of the present situation, and that their efforts are not being relaxed; in fact, have never been relaxed since the outbreak took, place. There is every reason, without being unduly optimistic, to hope that the outbreak is drawing to an end. I almost fear to use such words here now, but I believe that there are indications, and the Minister is advised that there is every reason for hoping, that we are going to reach the end of this trouble. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Rae</inline> will also recognise that it is a difficult question to deal with. He seemed&#39; rather to criticise us for being lenient. 1 can assure him that the Ministry and the Department have suffered very severely from criticism in the opposite direction. Accusations of all sorts are being levelled at us daily. </para>

The reference was to the permanent survey of the railway, and it was stated that the probable cost was over &#163;60 per mile, or a total of between &#163;60,000 and &#163;70,000 for the whole route. I wish to know from the Honorary Minister if this statement may be regarded as a further proof of the intention of the present Government to have all this kind of- work done by contract, and, so far as they can, to abolish the day labour system for carrying out public works established by their predecessors? </para>

                    <para>, - I wish to touch upon a phase of the perennially interesting electoral question. We have heard a good deal to-day and . yesterday upon electoral matters, and I wish to make some inquiries, and possibly comments, in connexion with the votes for electoral officers. I wish specially to refer to persons temporarily employed at election time. We have had accusations and cross accusations about the way in which electors are enrolled and votes are used ; but I want to touch upon the method of appointment and control of temporary electoral officers. In the conduct of an election it frequently happens that one candidate has the means to employ scrutineers at every polling booth in an electorate, whilst a candidate opposing him may not be in a position to do so. Labour candidates, for instance, are generally dependent upon the good will of friends and enthusiasts in . their cause to help them in this way where they can, but in many outside places it is impossible to find persons who &#39; can devote the necessary time to the work of a scrutineer. It is a base fabrication, as every one knows, but we are often twitted with appointing friends to political offices; but I say that the number of temporary electoral officers who are open, undisguised supporters of our political opponents is a scandal throughout the length and breadth of the Commonwealth. I make that statement without fear of refutation, however much it may be contradicted. But for the very large number of such persons holding subordinate positions at election time, 50 per cent, of the members representing the other side in this Parliament would not have succeeded in being elected. I believe that our elections have to a great extent been corrupt by reason of the fact that the persons having sole control of little country polling booths have been our political opponents. </para>

                        <para>- I am speaking of the whole Parliament, and not merely of this branch of it. I feel very sad that I should have only four honorable senators opposite to tackle. I can mention concrete instances in support of what I have said. I am morally certain that but for the action of those who had the counting of the votes two seats which were lost to the Labour party would now be in their possession. I refer to the districts of Riverina and Hume. I believe it was through the inability of the candidates of our party to find scrutineers to look after their interests at polling booths in the remote parts of those electorates that our opponents gained those seats. Had we the means of contesting the validity of these elections in the highest Courts of the land, I believe that my suspicions would be amply confirmed. </para>

                        <para>- But the Honorary Minister did not contradict his colleague. I say there are ample indications to justify the belief that, at least, one of the referenda proposals submitted at the recent general election was carried if the votes were honestly counted. I refer to the proposal to amend the Constitution so as to enable the Commonwealth to legislate more effectively in regard to trusts. According to the published returns, that proposal was defeated by 7,000 or 8,000 votes. Nevertheless, I am firmly of opinion that if an honest scrutiny of the votes could be made, my statement would be found to be correct. I believe, further, that in New South Wales at least two seats, possibly more, would be found to have been won by the Labour party if the elections had been conducted in a straightforward manner. I refer to the electorates of Riverina and Hume. </para>

I say that the money of our opponents - I do not know where they got it, but I think I can guess pretty accurately - has been used in scores of illegitimate ways to further their interests. In this connexion I would like to relate a little incident which came within my own personal knowledge. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Richard</inline> Parkhill, general secretary of the Liberal Association in New South Wales, wrote a letter to a newspaper there, which was being run in the Labour interests, but which happened to be called <inline font-style="italic">The Liberal.</inline> Thinking that it was being conducted in the Liberal interests, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Parkhill</inline> forwarded a circular letter to it, in which he stated that he was pleased to know that a journal under the good old name of <inline font-style="italic">Liberal</inline> had been started, and in which he offered to supply it with leading articles, promising that any article so supplied would not be furnished to any other newspaper in the same town.

That was their motto all round, and they acted up to it most diligently. Even the most pleasant men in private life circulated all sorts of distorted misrepresentations of the Labour policy and the Labour movement. But our opponents did not stop there. They attempted to squeeze into the position of presiding officers and poll clerks some of the most biassed men to be found in the Commonwealth. Within a few miles of where I live I know one member of a family, the whole of whom are active supporters of the Fusion party, who was secretary to a Liberal candidate while acting as presiding officer at a polling booth. </para>

                <para class="block">SenatorRAE. - Yes. It was in the Nepean electorate. In addition to being secretary to the Liberal candidate, this same individual squeezed one of his sons into the position of presiding officer at a smaller polling booth. Such practices were rampant all over the State which I represent. The blame which rests on our party is that when it was in office it did not go far enough towards clearing out all of these persons whose biassed, and in some cases corrupt, conduct is largely responsible for the existence in this Parliament of any remnant of the  Liberal party. I trust that a change will be rapidly made, and that we shall not again be called upon to witness the spectacle of fathers, brothers, and sons being poked into the position of presiding officers and poll clerks whilst openly advocating the cause of particular candidates at a general election. One of the reasons why this sort of thing has not been more effectively dealt with is that the Electoral Department can deal only with charges which are actually proved against an officer. The Returning Officer in each electoral division appoints his subordinates, and unless a specific complaint is made and sheeted home in regard to any one of them the Chief Electoral Officer of the Commonwealth takes no action. The power has to filter through so many channels that the central authority practically exercises no effective control over these officials. If our friends opposite who&#39; so loudly profess to desire electoral purity desire to touch the spot which is sore, they will make a complete alteration in this system. If they wish to insure purity in our elections, that is where they can exercise their talents to greater advantage than they can in libelling the electors of this country. </para>

                    GOULD (New South Wales) &#91;9.48&#93;.- The honorable senator who has just resumed his seat has complained of mudslinging, but in a quiet way he has been slinging a great deal of mud in regard to the last election. In the first place, he made an attack on
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Parkhill,</inline>
                    the secretary of the Liberal Association in New South Wales. He has quoted from his recollection of what somebody has told him regarding a letter which
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Parkhill</inline>
                    is alleged to have written. I dare say that there was a letter addressed to newspapers in different portions of the country offering to supply them with leading articles if they so desired. But I do not believe that the instruction was given to sling mud at the Labour party. The man who would write that sort of thing would be a very great fool. If the letter in question existed,
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Rae</inline>
                    would have it in his possession. He would not be approached by a person who would tell him &#34; Such a letter is in existence, but I will not give it to you.&#34;

The policy of the Liberal party in&#39; New South Wales was not a policy of misrepresenting the Labour party. It was a fair, honest, straightforward fight from beginning to end. I have no doubt that when we do manage to get to the people again, it will be found that the verdict recorded the other day will be repeated. The electorates to which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Rae</inline> has alluded were fought very hard, but the fight was straight. The men returned for those two constituencies would be incapable of lending themselves to anything that was unfair. We ask for proof when these charges are made. If honorable senators opposite will take the trouble to read the letters that were written by the late Minister of Home Affairs, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. King</inline> O&#39;Malley, with reference to the appointment of presiding officers, they would conclude at once that these lambs - these sweet, innocent, white, pure lambs - who represent Labour, were not quite so unsophisticated as they make themselves out to be. </para>

                    <para>. - I should like to know what action is being taken in connexion with the erection of a new general post-office at Perth. Some time ago, an area was resumed in Wellington-street for the purpose of the building. I understand that plans are in course of preparation, and almost completed. Recently, the Chamber of Commerce, Perth, passed a resolution asking the Government not to erect the post-office in the centre of the resumed area in the new street proposed to be cut through from Wellington to Murray streets. The meeting desired that the post-office should be erected right on to Wellington- street, and an agitation to that end is still proceeding in Perth. The further suggestion has been made to the State architect of Western Australia that the Federal Government should abandon the site, and build the post-office on another one in James-street. As so much uncertainty surrounds the position, I should like the Minister to inform us where it is the intention of the Department to erect the building. I notice also that a bonus of &#163;4 is to be paid to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. H.</inline> -Li.  Hine, mechanical electrical engineer, Perth branch, in recognition of a suggestion made by him for an improved type of bicycle parcel carrier. Does the Minister consider that &#163;4 is a sufficient reward to an officer of the Public Service who has suggested something which the Department considers to be good, and on which it has acted? I do not think thai so meagre a reward offers any encouragement to officers to make valuable suggestions for labour-saving appliances. </para>

The plans are not finished. I will give <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Needham</inline> an undertaking to keep him posted with reference to the matter, and to let him know what stage the negotiations may reach in the near future. With regard to the other matter mentioned, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Needham</inline> will agree with me that I cannot be expected to say straight off whether &#163;4 is a sufficient reward for the suggestion made by the officer in question. The amount of the reward must obviously depend on the value of the improvement effected. I may, however, say that I approve of the principle of rewarding officers for such useful services. </para>

                    <para>.- I venture to ask a question of the Minister representing the Postmaster-General, and trust that he will so far unbend as to give me the information I desire. Lovett, in Tasmania, is a thriving township. Widespread and profound dissatisfaction has been expressed from time to time by its inhabitants on account of the present mail service. Representations have been made to the members of this Parliament and to the  Deputy  Postmaster-General, but, so far, no improvement has been effected. The mail service, having regard to the size of the township, and the importance of the district, is absolutely the worst, not only in southern Tasmania, but in the whole island. It is altogether behind the requirements. The people are afforded only a single service - out in the morning and back at night. The revenue is within &#163;150 per annum of that of Franklin, an adjoining town. But Franklin has an up-to-date double service by motor. Lovett, on the other hand, has an inadequate horse service of a particularly unsatisfactory character. I suggest that it should be given a motor service in accordance with the size and importance of the place. Will the Minister have inquiries made, and instruct his officers to see whether something can be done for this part of the State which he represents. </para>

                    <para>. - I wish to draw attention to a matter which has engaged the attention of many people in Tasmania for a long time, and of successive Commonwealth Administrations, all of which have exhibited a curious paralysis, or rather, hesitancy, in regard to it. The south-west of Tasmania is one of the most inhospitable regions in the whole Commonwealth, and uninhabited by savage or civilized man. In recent years there have been several disastrous shipwrecks there. In one case&#62; an unfortunate sailor was marooned on the south-west coast, just like Alexander Selkirk on his island, and it was several months before he was discovered. Negotiations were proceeding at one time between the Commonwealth Government and the Tasmanian Government in regard to affording telegraphic or telephonic communication with Port Davey, where the Tasmanian Government has established a depot containing food for prospective shipwrecked mariners. But the Commonwealth Government has hitherto failed to furnish a service such as is absolutely essential to the relief of unfortunate mariners who may be cast upon that grim and desolate shore. Throughout the period of the previous Government, the curious hesitancy to which I have referred was particularly exhibited. One or two Scandinavian vessels have been completely lost on this coast. It is known that the crews reached the mainland, but evidently in an effort to penetrate this inhospitable region the unfortunate sailors perished in circumstances which it needs no stretch of imagination to realize were the most pitiable that could be conceived. </para>

                    Conder, who is operating in connexion with the Mines Department&#39;s scheme of prospecting, has recently stated that if a little alacrity had been displayed by the Commonwealth Government they would have been enabled very easily to construct a telephone line simultaneously with the making of tracks that he was cutting for the State Government. This would have given that communication which is absolutely essential if relief is to be afforded in such cases as I have described.
