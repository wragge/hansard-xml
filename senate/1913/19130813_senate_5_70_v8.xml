                <para class="block">In submitting the motion I feel that very few words on my part are necessary. Ex-Senator Vardon came to the Senate six years ago, bringing with him the reputation of a citizen, who, whatever political differences might have parted him from a section of those amongst whom he lived, at least carried with him their hearty good-will and support.  His  services in this Chamber enhanced the reputation which he brought with him, and I venture to say that we on many occasions were strengthened in our deliberations by the sound and matured advice which he tendered. Personally, I felt that in ex-Senator Vardon, on whichever side of the chamber he might be seated, we had one whom we could not only respect, but admire, and, indeed, love. I am certain that the Senate will accept the motion in the spirit in which it is submitted. </para>

                    <para>. - It is always with a deep sense of sorrow that honorable senators have to pass a motion of this description. We know that the feelings of members of the Senate and another place with respect to a departed colleague are always of the kindliest nature. It never matters to any of us whether the deceased gentleman was a member of one party or the other, and that is, I think, a feeling which ought to be encouraged in our midst. I knew ex-Senator Vardon for very many years. As a citizen I am sure that his life was exemplary, and no doubt Australia has lost one who had the best wishes for its welfare. The members of his family deserve our sympathy and condolence, and, therefore, I have very much pleasure in seconding the motion. </para>

                    <para>. - I desire, as a senator from New South Wales, to add a word. The late <inline font-weight="bold">Sir William</inline> Lyne, whom we all knew, either personally or by repute, was, as is generally known, on a bed of sickness during the time of the last election campaign, and I have no hesitation in saying, as far as any one can truly prophesy, that he would again have been member for Hume had he been able to visit the electorate in person. I deeply regret, not only the loss of that fine specimen of Australian manhood, but also the fact that party fighting was played so low down that when that gentleman was on a sick bed reports were circulated to the effect that he could never again occupy his place in Parliament. Those reports did much to prevent his return. I have been all the more disgusted on account of the amount of sentimental sympathy which has been displayed in connexion with the death of the late lamented gentleman by some of those who did their best, by the most unfair means, to prevent his return to the other House. I have no doubt whatever that if he had had a fair opportunity in the campaign his life would have been prolonged. I deeply regret that he was so unfairly treated in the party warfare which recently occurred. </para>

There was consequently great deal of alarm in the community. Is the Minister aware that there is a wireless telegraph station at King Island, and will he take such steps to work it that the island may be kept in continuous communication with the rest of the Commonwealth ? </para>

                    <para>I give notice that when the Senate meets today I intend to move the adjournment of the Senate for the purpose of calling attention to a matter of urgent public importance, the statement of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McColl,</inline> as reported in the <inline font-style="italic">Argus</inline> of the 21st July, 1913, as follows :  - " They had even resurrected the dead to vote. (Laughter.) The Ministry was trying to get to the bottom of it, but it was found that while the parties which passed the Electoral Act, and were responsible for the conduct of the elections, had left as many doors open as possible for wrong-doing, they had practically shut every door which would enable the mischief to be traced to its sources. Now they were saying that they were all anxious for an examination, and desirous of putting down wrong-doing. Very well, it would be seen, a little later on, whether these people would help an investigation. It was intended to devise measures and devices by which impersonation and double voting would become impossible, so that at the next election there might be a clean and straight fight." </para>

Formal business which may be entered upon includes the fixing of the days and hours of meeting, the appointment of standing committees, and any motion under standing order 360. I cannot by any stretch of imagination call this notice regarding the adjournment of the Senate mere formal business, and I suggest to the honorable senator that if he desires to move the adjournment of the Senate, the proper course for him to pursue is to move that the Standing Orders be suspended in order to enable him to do so. He will require an absolute majority of the Senate to move, without notice, to suspend the Standing Orders. </para>

                            <para>. - Of course, it is a fact obvious to everybody that on this occasion, as on others, the Senate is absolute master of its own procedure, but I ask senators to be slow in the exercise of the power they possess in suspending the Standing Orders unless there is clear necessity for it. The motion brought forward now is that we should suspend the Standing Orders, probably, for a very proper purpose; but I submit there is no public justification for it. </para>

                                <para>- I appeal to those senators who regard the procedure of the Senate as even above party questions. The Standing Orders have been shaped for the proper and orderly conduct of the Senate; and, though it is true there is power to suspend them, I appeal to honorable senators not to exercise the power I freely admit they possess and suspend them on insufficient justification. The honorable senator is under no disability, because, if he wishes to bring the matter forward he will have ample opportunity by allowing the ordinary conduct of the Senate to proceed. He has full assurance given to him by the Standing Orders, and by your presence in the chair, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. President,</inline> that he will not be denied the opportunity of bringing forward the matter in due course, when the proper occasion under the Standing Orders is reached. </para>

                                <para>- The honorable senator can follow the ordinary procedure under the Standing Orders, and surely he can see that there is no gain in pursuing the course he is asking the Senate to adopt. I readily understand, as an old politician and party member, that where an advantage may be scored it should be availed of, and I make no plea in those circumstances; but in this case, where it is the mere matter of the conduct of the business of the Senate, I ask honorable senators to co-operate with the Government to see that that business is carried on as properly as it can be, and in accordance with the Standing Orders. If this motion is carried now, as it is competent for the Senate to do, it is laying down a precedent of suspending the Standing Orders at any time senators choose, and then we may as well start by tearing up the Standing Orders altogether. </para>

                            <para>. - I am very much touched by the appeal of the honorable senator. I admit that those who have giant strength should not always use it like a giant ; but, owing to the peculiar constitution of Parliaments generally, one House is very largely dependent on the actions taking place in another, and, consequently, if opportunity of refuting a calumny is neglected now, when it presents itself, the chance may not arise again. We have the opportunity now of refuting a scandalous statement calumniating a section, nay, a party, in this Senate, and also many of the citizens of Australia, and the sooner it is dealt with, and the real facts are brought before the public, the sooner will a very regrettable chapter in the history of the late elections be disposed of. I shall be pleased at any time to upset the Standing Orders, or precedents of any kind, if by so doing we can get results sooner than by attending to all the obsolete forms that bind a Parliament. </para>

                            <para>The worst of it was that a lot of people voted twice. They had even resurrected the dead to vote. The Ministry was trying to get to the bottom of it, but it was found that while the parties which passed the Electoral Act, and were responsible for the conduct of the elections, had left as many doors open as possible for wrong-doing, they had practically shut every door which would enable the mischief to be traced to its sources. </para>

                        <para class="block">We can quite understand men, in the heat of a political campaign, sometimes making statements which we perhaps should not take too literally, but this case differs from any one that I know. After the elections had taken place, there were certain accusations levelled by various persons, and by newspapers, in nearly every part of Australia. Almost all the charges made, either from the platform or in the newspapers, were levelled against one party only, and that was the Labour party. Where a statement was not direct, the insinuation was that the Labour party availed themselves of every method of wrong-doing which was possible under, or even outside, the Electoral Act. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McColl</inline> was not in the position of an ordinary man speaking in the heat of the campaign. Following the elections where, I may mention, he managed to get into this Chamber by the votes of a minority of the people of this State, he was successful in obtaining a seat in the new Ministry. There devolved upon the Ministry the duty of making an inquiry into the allegations made, unfortunately, by too many people, and often by people in authority, They passed a regulation empowering the Chief Electoral Officer practically to compare the rolls used at the general elections, in order to ascertain whether any wrong-doing in the form of people voting more than once had occurred. Although strictly it was not a Committee appointed for the purpose, yet practically it was a body of men who were considered by the Government to be the best, and, probably, the most efficient to carry on the work. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McColl</inline> not only considered the advisability of this course being taken, but subsequently, as a member of the Executive Council, he indorsed the decision of the Cabinet. There is an impression in the minds of the people of Australia that the Fusion Government did attempt to put on their trial the members of the Labour party and our supporters for illicit behaviour at the recent elections. Having appointed a body of men to try a certain cause, at least one might have expected the members of the Government to wait until a verdict had been delivered. I have no doubt that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McColl</inline> regrets that he did not await that event. Had such a transaction taken place in a Court, it would have been a case for an expression of sympathy and regret for the impetuosity of the honorable senator. The charges against the Labour party are, first, that we " resurrected the dead " for the purpose of voting, evidently against <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McColl;</inline> second, that we opened the doors to wrong-doing - that is, that we amended the Electoral Act in certain directions to admit of wrong being done; and, third, that we shut the doors, evidently by an amendment of the Act, for the purpose of preventing any reasonable inquiry being made into the wrong-doing. I do not know that any more serious charges could be levelled against members of Parliament and their supporters. In the case of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McColl,</inline> with his boasted twenty-seven years of parliamentary experience, can we for a moment believe that it was the impetuosity of youth or undue excitement which led him to make these rash statements ? Has he ever brought forward any proof in support of them ? Seeing that he has often boasted of his parliamentary experience and his knowledge of subjects outside the Electoral Act, can we accuse him of ignorance ? I would not care to make such an accusation, in view of his long experience in Parliament and his well-known ability. What was his real desire in making these charges against members of the Senate and their supporters? I believe that he was actuated by pure malice - by a desire to injure members of the Labour party aud misrepresent them in the eyes of the people of Australia. </para>

                                <para>- The motive is to justify any action I took at the election; and I want to make <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McColl</inline> justify his conduct, not only then, but since, in making statements which he knew to be deliberately untrue. I ask the honorable senator, as a responsible Minister of the Crown, on what ground he accused the members of the Labour party, or any other party, or any individual, of having " resurrected the dead " ? By that phrase I suppose he meant that some persons had voted for myself who should have been allowed to rest at peace in their graves - in other words, that the living had voted; in place of the dead. It may be possible that some persons whose names were* placed on the roll died subsequently, and' that others may have voted in their names. But what is there in the record of any members of the Labour party in Victoria to lead <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McColl</inline> to assume that we would be guilty of perpetrating such a crime in the eyes of the people of Australia? Again, what virtues does he, possess to entitle him to mount a pedestal* to lecture us on morality and the best means* of conducting an election in this State?' It seems to me to be, not only the height of impudence, but decidedly unworthy of-" any Minister of the Crown. Now, what were the amendments of the Electoral Act which, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McColl</inline> said, opened' the- door to wrong-doing ? It is true that the Government of which I was a supporter did bring down proposals to amend that Act. I have a copy of the measure, before me. I have looked carefully through it, and I want to know in what way this Act opens the door to wrongdoing. In amending the previous Act in order to abolish postal voting, we did our best to kill wrong-doing, and to bring in a cleaner system. We amended the Act to give power to the Chief Electoral Officer to strike names off the roll when he had reasonable proof that they had no right to be there. We took that action for the purpose of purifying the rolls, and not in any way for the purpose of loading them. We also intrusted certain powers to the electoral officers which were requisite to the carrying out of their duties under the Act. Did that open the door to wrong-doing ? There are one or two&gt; other amendments which were made at our instance. We did extend the absent voting facilities, so as to enable any person who would be absent from the electorate where he resided to vote at any prescribed polling-booth in Australia. If that power was used corruptly or wrongly, then <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McColl</inline> was the gainer by the corrupt action, because he secured a majority of the absent votes iu this State. That is a rather serious thing to allege against his own supporters. I wish to emphasize the fact that in the State of Victoria <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McColl</inline> secured a larger proportion of the absent votes than did any other candidate. He secured a larger majority of them than he did of persons who voted at their own polling booths. It is surely rather rough for him to say now, " I am here by a corrupt system of voting." Surely he is not prepared to maintain that his return was secured by means of an improper use of the absent-voting provisions ? There was another mode by which it might be said that we opened the door to wrong-doing, and that was by permitting a person who was leaving the Commonwealth to vote before doing so; but I have not heard of any complaints of wrong-doing being made under that head. Consequently, I need not discuss it. On the other hand, there are directions in which, undoubtedly, we shut the door to wrong-doing. For instance, we inserted in the Act a provision enabling the Chief Electoral Officer to be directly represented in any proceeding affecting the validity of any election. Section 196a of the Act reads - </para>

                        <para class="block">That gave a power which did not exist previously to a competent man like the Chief Electoral Officer to be represented in Court when any wrong-doing was alleged. I do not desire to continue the discussion at any great length, beyond saying that unfortunately before the previous elections, and subsequent to them, all sorts of charges were hurled by members of the present Ministerial party and their paid organizers against the present Opposition. I regret to say, also, that the newspapers, which were, generally speaking, if not actually, under their control, at any rate largely their supporters, repeated those charges. They were made against one party in the Commonwealth, and one only. I deeply regret that in consequence of them, some very worthy persons were misled. We cannot wonder at that, when the charges were repeated by a Minister of the Crown. We had the case of a clergyman denouncing the Labour party even from the pulpit on the assumption that the charges were correct. That sort of thing makes them all the more serious. Probably if this clergyman and others who have made similar statements were asked for their reasons, the reply would be, " Were not the charges made by a responsible Minister of the Commonwealth?" Surely that should be sufficient proof that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McColl</inline> ought to have been much more guarded in his choice of words at public meetings. But evidently he was actuated by one desire, and that was to continue his three months of mud-slinging after the elections were over - to get an extra month wherein to prolong that campaign of misstatements, slurs, and misleading accusations against the Labour party in which he had been indulging. I do trust that now that he is brought face to face with the charges, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McColl</inline> will either publicly justify them in the Senate, or will adopt the manly course of withdrawing them and apologizing. </para>

                                <para>- I will relate the incident that occurred. One day towards the end of last session I walked into the Senate chamber. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Russell</inline> was sitting at the table. We spoke of the coming elections, and he then said, " We are going to have a hard and strenuous campaign, and I am going to fight your party very hard, but I hope that no personalities will be indulged in." I said, "I am delighted to hear you say that, and I cordially agree with you." I did not mention the honorable senator's name throughout the whole campaign until at a certain meeting he told a deliberate untruth about myself. </para>

Honorable senators are aware that after the elections the whole of Australia was in a ferment as to the way in which they had been conducted. </para>

If I had had anything like notice that this subject was to be brought forward, I might have been prepared with proof, but I did not know that the honorable senator intended to take action until a few moments before the Senate met to-day, and therefore have had no opportunity whatever of preparing for the attack. Now, let me come to the meeting at Fitzroy. </para>

I have nothing more to say. I think that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Russell</inline> was the last man who ought to have said what he has done, in view of his own conduct at the last election and his references to myself. He decried me on every occasion. He sneered at me, alleging that I was only here by a minority vote. At the previous election, when I fought the honorable senator, I beat him by 53,000; but I never said that he was here by a minority vote. I never sneered at him in that respect. Seeing that I was only some 2,400 votes behind him, and that he polled within a few of 300,000, I think it is very much to be regretted that he should have made use of such means. As to the attacks that have been made on my personal character, I have to say that my reputation is before the people of this country, where I am known as a straightforward and truthful man. I have only to express my regret at what has occurred to-day, and to say that it is a great pity that any member of this Chamber should delay the business of the country for the purpose of venting his spleen and spite by making such ridiculous charges as have been launched. </para>

                                <para>- It was a meeting of the so-called Liberal Association. There was, we are told, a Liberal rally. We all know the wild and whirling statements which were made with respect to the way in which the recent elections were conducted. Certain newspapers that have always shown their hostility to the Labour party went out of their way to make serious charges, by innuendo, of course, against that party. Those statements having been made, the Government, with the support of the Opposition, rightly decided to have an inquiry made into them. That decision having been arrived at, any ordinary man would have had the decency to await the result of the inquiry before getting upon a platform and repeating parrot-like the statements made by newspapers, and by a number of political bounders and busybodies. I direct the attention of the Vice-President of the Executive Council to a few statements I propose to make. The honorable senator said, " They had resurrected the dead." Whom did he mean by " they " <inline font-style="italic">t</inline></para>

                                <para>- Here is a gentleman occupying a very important and responsible position who has had a report presented to him as the result of an inquiry, and yet he has the cold-blooded audacity to get up in this Chamber, and, as a responsible Minister, to say that as the result of that inquiry it is shown that there have been 5,000 cases of duplicate voting. I say that the report does not show anything of the kind. It merely shows that 5,000 apparent irregularities took place. The honorable senator tells us that before the inquiry was proceeded with, he knew of his own knowledge of a number of cases of persons who voted more than once. That is an extraordinary statement for an honorable man to make. </para>

                                <para>- The elections took place on 31st May, and this is 13th August. We were told that immediately the Government came into power they would cause inquiries to be made, and they were going to prove up to the hilt the statements that had been made in respect of the last elections. One case specially referred to was that of the election for Fremantle, in Western Australia. The defeated candidate said that he had names and addresses, and could prove beyond any shadow of a doubt that about 4,000 persons recorded votes which they had no right to record. We have seen as the result of the inquiry that there were, I think, only 130 such votes recorded at that election. </para>

In order to do so, he must attach his name to a document; and it must be remembered that the Electoral Department possesses the signature of every elector enrolled. There should not, in the circumstances, be the slightest difficulty in tracing any man who voted as an absent voter and also voted in the division for which he is enrolled. </para>

                                <para>- The Minister of Defence got off a ticket, or his party put him off it. The statements made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McColl</inline> are absolutely incorrect. If he is not aware of the fact, he ought to carefully peruse the official documents which should be in the possession of every member of the Government. The statements he made in respect of the conduct of the elections, and especially in regard to the late Government, are so outrageous that I consider that, as a responsible Minister, he should apologize to all the electoral officers intrusted with the work of carrying out the elections on the 31st May last for having made them.  His  statements constitute, not only an attack upon the late Administration, but upon every officer of the Electoral Department. With <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Russell</inline> I say that, whilst <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McColl</inline> may treat this matter lightly, and may not be disposed to take it too seriously in this Chamber, he may rest assured that the last has not been heard about it. He will either have to withdraw the remarks he has made inside this chamber or will live to see the day when he will regret having made them. </para>

                            <para>. - I think that the thanks of the Senate are due to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Russell</inline> for the action he has taken in moving the adjournment, in order to direct attention to the statements made by a member of the Australian Parliament. There is one advantage which we on this side can secure to-day which we could not secure under other conditions. I refer to the fact that any remarks we may make will be truthfully recorded in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard.</inline> It has been our experience from the inception of our party until to-day that, no matter what statements we may make from the public platform, they are not truthfully recorded. As a matter of fact, they are misconstrued. The honorable senator who to-day has been placed in the pillory by the motion moved by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Russell,</inline> and the party with which he is associated, have always had behind them the powerful capitalistic press of Australia. Almost every breath they draw is recorded in that press. It has been amusing, if not interesting, to me this afternoon to contrast the attitude of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McColl</inline> when trying to defend himself from the charges launched against him today with the attitude he no doubt assumed in the Fitzroy Town Hall when he made the statements complained of in the congenial company he found there. It strikes me that when a man occupying the honorable senator's responsible position has a chance to "sling off" at his opponents where he is not immediately responsible, and may not be faced with the consequences of his remarks, he can be very brave. But the honorable senator comes here to-day, and, honestly, I was sorry for him when he stood up at the Minister's table as Vice-President of the Executive Council, to endeavour to reply to the charges made in connexion with his statements about double voting. I think the time has arrived when public men should at least be fair, and should at least be truthful. </para>

If my scriptural quotation is not altogether correct, it at least fits itself to the senator opposite. There is a phase of the question he might seriously consider. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McColl,</inline> who momentarily occupies a Ministerial position, and a very precarious one at that, is not the only gentleman who has made these statements at public meetings about double voting, and that the Labour party were responsible for it. I remember a statement made by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hedges,</inline> the ex-member for Fremantle in the House of Representatives. He had the audacity to state, in the public press that in the South Fremantle division of the electoral division of Fremantle every person in one street, where there were 312 voters, voted twice. What is the result of the inquiry instituted by the present Government? Out of all the votes recorded in Western Australia, totalling over 135,000, there were only 556 irregularities; and in the particular division of Fremantle, where there were over 28,000 votes cast, there were only 156 irregularities discovered. </para>

                            O'LOGHLIN.We did well, but without any resort to impersonation or duplicate voting. However, in the press, which was wholly behind the Fusion party, these allegations appeared for several days after the elections under scare headings, and every possible publicity was given to them ; but later on, as it was found there was small possibility of substantiating these statements, excitement subsided, and we heard very little about them after the inquiry was started. When the result of the inquiry was made public those portions of the press which gave such prominence to the accusations placed the reports of the returning officers in obscure corners of their papers, and in the smallest type possible. I wish to call attention to another  matter. Senators who have preceded me have pretty well ventilated this subject, but I would like to know why the Senate candidates were ignored in this inquiry.

But I would ask why Senate candidates were ignored in the inquiry when they were equally concerned in regard to these charges, and in regard to the conduct of the election? I hope that if any Minister is going to speak to this motion he will give me information on this point. I rose particularly to direct attention to it, and I do not propose to further discuss the question so fully ventilated by other senators. </para>

Possibly I may be permitted to say the statements were knowingly inaccurate. I am not particular as to words used so long as they convey my meaning. While we may deplore this exhibition in Victoria of what I am not allowed to call malice on the part of Ministers of the Crown, we must realize it is only a small sound compared with the general volume of malicious utterances which proceeded from every responsible individual. Throughout New South Wales similar utterances were made every day. A campaign of misrepresentation was entered on by every so-called liberal-minded man. </para>

It is a reflection, a disgrace, and a disaster to Australia, that the present Government should hold office, considering the means by which they attained it; it is an absolute disgrace to the manhood of Australia that they should, even for twenty-four hours, hold office; it is a reflection on Australia that the Government should be there, from the topmost of the Ministry to the humblest member of it, when they scored their majority by a campaign of calumny, falsehood, and misrepresentation, with which they flooded the Commonwealth from end to end. It is to be deeply deplored that, after the battle is over, in the absence of excitement and party feeling which may, perhaps, lead a man astray during a campaign, when there is no excuse or reason for excited utterances, this kind of thing should be repeated in cold blood after the Government, of which the honorable senator is a member, had submitted the matter to some sort oi judicial inquiry. It simply shows the inability of the honorable senator concerned to recognise the decencies of public life; and it is that alone which prevents him from apologizing to the Senate and the country for the disgraceful statement he made. </para>

                            <para>.- If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McColl</inline> has had a bad time this afternoon, he can only blame himself. It is not the first time he has fallen in by adopting tactics such as are challenged here this afternoon. No honorable senator, so far as I can remember, has been more often put into the stocks for things such as we are questioning here this afternoon than the same honorable senator, who seems to take a delight in attending certain gatherings and making statements of a similar kind. He has been doing it all the time he has been a member of the Senate, and I am not at all surprised at his doing it since he has attained a certain position. He has been making political blunders all the while. There has been sufficient said, I think, about the remarks of the honorable senator which have been challenged ; but there is one portion of the speech to which attention has not yet been called, and that is the portion in which he speaks of members of the Labour party as men who are always talking labour, but who never labour themselves. It is quite in his usual good taste. I do not know a single member of the Labour party, either today or in the past, who may not be justly described as a Labour man. I think that every Labour senator who is present this afternoon can be spoken of as a genuine  Labour man, as one who has laboured with . his hands from his boyhood up to the present time. When I hear of a man boasting of being a Liberal, and posing as one who labours, and in the next breath admitting that he has been a member  of" Parliament for the last twenty-seven, years, I wonder which kind of dry-farming he has been doing. It has been exceedingly dry indeed. </para>

                                <para>- If that is so, sir, I shall not be able to make any further criticism. I have only to offer one word of advice to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McColl,</inline> and that is to try to be a little more cautious-, when he gets on the rampage in the rallies which he is so fond of attending. By exercising a little more caution, and keeping statements of this kind out of the press, he will get into less trouble. He need not think that we will tolerate these statements all the time, and not make a protest against them. We have had too much capital of this kind made against the Labour party. We realize all the time that we are fighting at a disadvantage. We know that the press of Australia isin the hands of our political opponents, and that they make full use of it to circulate such statements as have been found fault with here to-day, and are made so frequently by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McColl</inline> and members of his party. </para>

                                <para>- Does not slander involve a quarrel ? I am sorry that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley</inline> is such a precisian in the use of language. I only want to take exception to a certain statement made by one of the senators for South Australia, and also, I believe, by one of the senators who preceded him. They accused the Liberal party of making statements about the unclean manner in which the recent elections were conducted. That language is used to imply that the Liberal party have made allegations of irregular and improper conduct against the electoral officials. I have heard no responsible Liberal  speaker  make any statement of the sort in connexion with the conduct of the elections by the regular electoral officers, but I do know that a member of the late Ministry - and this matter particularly concerns Tasmania - was the only public man, I will not say of eminence, but of temporary prominence, who made any allegation or took any direct action in connexion with the conduct of the elections by the electoral officers. He went so far as to indulge in Czar-like action, and suggested the removal of some of the electoral officers. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley.</inline> - What has this to do with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McColl'</inline> s speech? </para>

He has made his defence. But I am here to defend the Liberal party against the charge of having made allegations against electoral officers. We have made no such charges. The only overt act hostile to them of which we have cognizance is that of the late Minister of Home Affairs, who took an attitude from which he had to recede, and not by any means gracefully. </para>

                    <para>. - When the motion standing in my name with respect to days and hours of meeting was called on, I said " Not formal," for the reason that, following the custom of the Senate, the motion differentiates the time of meeting on Wednesdays and Thursdays. We have been in the habit of meeting at 3 o'clock on Wednesdays and at half-past 2 o'clock on Thursdays. The reason for that was that it was desired to meet the convenience of honorable senators, particularly from my own State, who arrived in Melbourne on Wednesday, and who wished to have time after the arrival of the train to prepare for the meeting of the Senate without an unnecessary rush. But I wish to suggest to honorable senators whether it is worth while, for the sake of that half hour on Thursdays, to differentiate between the time of meeting on those two days. My suggestion is that we should meet at 3 o'clock on each day. The extra half hour is not of very great value, and even when we meet at 3 o'clock we have nine, ten or eleven hours' work in front of us - quite sufficient time to do our business. I think that it will meet the convenience of honorable senators if we meet at 3 o'clock on both Wednesdays and Thursdays. </para>

                        <para>- I am agreeable to that if honorable senators so desire. It is worth while considering whether the extra half hour is worth bothering about. I can assure those who have been recently elected to the Senate that after they have been sitting here during the whole afternoon till 11 or 12 o'clock at night, they will feel that they have done quite enough to suit the most industrious of them. Accordingly, I move the motion in the following form - </para>
