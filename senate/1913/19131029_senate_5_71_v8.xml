I think that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Rae</inline> suggested that some supplementary information should be sought other than through the ordinary official channel. I have endeavoured, and am now endeavouring, to see if there are possible phases of the question which have not been brought under review. I hope before the Senate adjourns this week to be able to make a definite statement as to the course of action taken from the beginning to the end of the prosecution. </para>

                            <para>- I ask the indulgence of the Senate to go outside a mere answer to the question. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> recently said it was contemplated when he introduced the last amending Defence Bill, that certain provisions would substitute military detention for incarceration in a gaol. I am advised by the Attorney-General's Department that that good intention did not materialize as the Bill became law. The matter is now under review for the purpose of seeing  whether we cannot remedy the defect which experience has shown to exist in the amending Act, and in doing so, I propose to submit to the Senate such a clause as will meet the point raised by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Rae,</inline> as well as the major one to which I have referred. </para>

I have only to say at this juncture that the statement that the discharge of the men was due to the failure of the Melbourne office to supply plans is without foundation.

A portion of the mails arrive here at 11 o'clock, and another portion at a later hour. As the return mail for Tasmania closes an hour or two later, the practice adopted is a source of great inconvenience to honorable senators. I ask whether the Minister will see that the same practice shall be adopted in the delivery of the Tasmanian mails as is followed in the delivery of mails for Parliament House from South Australia and New South Wales. I might add for the information of the Minister that I have made several complaints to the Department concerning this matter, and no later than to-day there has been a recurrence of the evil complained of. </para>

                    <para>With reference. to the question asked by the honorable member, a report regarding the matter has been received, and it appears that the cooks were incensed at some statements regarding the rations which the reporter made in his report on the camp, published in the <inline font-style="italic">Toowoomba Chronicle,</inline> with the result that, when the reporter again visited the camp, one of the men threw a bucket of water over him and several others chased him out of the camp. </para>
                    <para>Whether the criticism of the reporter was justified or otherwise, the assault upon him can only receive the severest condemnation. The only possible excuse that can be made for the men concerned is that they are mere youths of 19 years of age, who probably did not realize the seriousness of their action. </para>
                    <para>With regard to the allegation in the press that the commanding officer and other officers of the unit were fully aware beforehand that something in the nature of an assault upon the reporter was contemplated, and that no steps were taken to prevent same, it is considered that there is no evidence of this. The commanding officer apparently thought there might possibly be some trouble, and he advised the reporter to forego his detailed visit to the kitchens, but it is hard to realize what other action he could have taken beforehand to prevent something which might or might not occur. When the affair actually occurred, it took place so quickly that there was no time for the officer to intervene. The man who actually threw the bucket of water has been summarily dealt with and punished by his commanding officer. Under these circumstances, it is not considered necessary to take any further action in the matter. </para>

                    <para class="block">As the Senate knows, we have nearly arrived at the final stage of this </para>
                    <para class="block">Bill, and I want to take the opportunity of offering, even though some may. think that I have said too much on the subject already, a few more remarks in connexion with it. I hope that I shall not be misunderstood, or that, any phrase that I may use will not be construed unfairly in relation to my intentions, when. I venture again to suggest to the Senate that I think we have committed something like an error of judgment in regard to our action upon one clause of the Bill as it was presented. For that I hold myself entirely responsible, if honorable senators please. Since the Bill was last before us I have gone into the question again with some of the law authorities, and I do venture to say that in my opinion - not speaking as the Minister in charge of the Bill, but as an ordinary senator - the Senate has made a mistake. I am, therefore, going to ask that the position shall be reconsidered. I say unhesitatingly that I hold myself personally responsible, because the clause which the Senate threw out is so good in itself, and so desirable to be inserted in this measure, that I feel that I must have seriously failed, having such a good case, to convince the Senate and the Committee that it ought to pass. Let me ask honorable senators to look at the matter in this way. I believe we are all agreed that there is nothing of a party nature in this Bill. It is divided into two parts, the first dealing with the question of a. month's Supply when Parliament meets, as it often will do, in July. With regard to that, we have all agreed that it is a matter of convenience, especially for Parliament itself, that we should make the alteration which the Bill affects. We agreed to that part of the measure, which was passed without demur. When we passed that, we agreed to something which, after all, simply made for our own convenience. When we came to the second part of the Bill, what was proposed in it? It was something that, in my opinion, made for the proper conduct of our financial affairs, especially in regard to the purchasing of stores. I believe that it will be recognised by all honorable senators opposite who opposed the clause to which I refer, that the proposition was a sound one, and that it was in itself worthy of their support. What it meant we know. It was a proposition whereby we could get into more complete control, and, perhaps, under better management, all business connected- with the expenditure of Commonwealth money in the purchasing of stores. If we had passed that clause we should have done something that would have made for the welfare of the Commonwealth generally. I make that statement because just now I alluded to the fact that the first part of the Bill, which we did pass, merely made for our own convenience. In listening carefully to the remarks which were made in Committee, and in the Senate, I gathered that there were practically two objections to the clause in regard to the purchasing of stores. One was that it ought not to appear in an Audit Bill, and the second was that it gave the Government too much power in regard to regulations. Throughout what was said, those two criticisms embodied the spirit of the objections. Let me deal with them again. First, as to the position of the clause in an Audit Bill, I have been confirmed in the opinion that I expressed emphatically here that the clause ought to be in such a Bill. Subsequent  inquiries  which I have made confirm that opinion, which is supported by the opinion of the Law Department. Let me again remind honorable senators that what we contemplate is the securing of extra vigilance and greater care in the purchasing of stores, and in the expenditure of public money upon them. Surely it is a necessary corollary to that that the expenditure should be checked, and should in some way come under the scrutiny of the Auditor-General. </para>

                            <para>- Under this Bill he could not. When we submitted this proposition we had this idea in mind - to provide a more effective machinery for purchasing stores and expending public money. Who is to guarantee to the people of Australia that that money is properly expended ? In our opinion, the Auditor-General. It is just because we cannot effectively secure what, I believe, we all desire, namely, sound business system in regard to the purchase of stores, that we provided to connect the Auditor-General with that work. It is for that reason that we put the provision in an Audit Bill. Examples, I know, are not binding on any of us, but I may tell the Senate that precisely the same provision is made by New South Wales in the Audit Act of that State. But even if it were not so, we are not bound by precedent. I urge that intrinsically, on its merits, this matter of the purchase of stores and the checking of the purchases should obviously be connected in some way or other with the Auditor-General. There should be some connecting link with him. </para>

                            <para>- The matter of regulation is the second of the two points that I have mentioned. I indicated that there are two - one that the clause was inserted in an Audit Bill, and the second that the clause took power to make regulations. I am now trying to show that, in my opinion, and, I believe, in the opinion of the Senate - in the opinion of every one who thinks about the subject - it is appropriate that such a clause should appear in an Audit Bill. It must be connected with the Auditor-General in some way. Consequently, we proposed in this Bill to give him an opportunity of enforcing his supervision in regard to the purchase of stores. Let me show what happens at the present time. Honorable senators, perhaps, do not realize it. We shall presently be voting enormous sums of money under the Estimates, a considerable part of which money will be expended in the purchase of stores for the use of the various Departments. </para>

                            <para>- But, perhaps, many honorable senators do not know how it is done. There are different ways. Stores are largely purchased, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> knows, under Ministerial authority. They are practically purchased under the authority of the heads of the various Departments. Where does the Auditor-General come in ? He has to check all these purchases - but how? A sum is appropriated for doing something or other. As far as the Auditor-General is concerned, he has merely to know that a certain sum of money voted by Parliament has been properly expended in the purchase of such-and-such stores. </para>

He has not to investigate the manner or the method, or, if you like, the wisdom or the machinery whereby the money has been converted into goods; nor should he. What did we propose? Our proposal was that, instead of leaving the matter to Ministerial authority, that is, practically to the heads of the Departments, we should lay down, certain regulations to govern the conversion of money into stores, and we should then be able to say to the Auditor-General, " Those are the conditions which you, as Auditor-General, must see have been complied with in the purchase of stores before you pass them." That would be a most useful check. It would be an effective guarantee towards efficiency in purchasing goods on proper lines, and getting proper value for the money. </para>

What we can do now is to say to the Auditor-General, " Check the expenditure of certain money which has been appropriated; never mind whether the purchases have been made wisely or foolishly. If there are goods to correspond with the money, that is all you have to seek to ascertain." I contend that we ought to go further than that. Any business man would lay down certain conditions under which his money should be converted into goods. </para>

                            <para>- Is it worth the while of the Opposition, when they can see practically the whole merits of the proposal, to say, " We want two amending Bills; you ought not to have put the provision in this Bill, but to have brought in another Bill to amend the Audit Act in another way " ? That would not be a wise method of dealing with legislation. I come now to the question of regulations. I think that honorable senators on the other side must recognise that there can be no subject more appropriate to be dealt with by regulation than the appointment of a Supply and Tender Board. I promise that, so long as I remain the representative of the Treasury here, I will specially draw the attention of the Senate to the fact that I am laying on the table regulations under the Audit Act, and seriously advise honorable senators to consider them, and should they contain anything debatable, to discuss them. I suggest that the present measure is a very -useful piece of legislation, and it is not worth while for honorable senators opposite to throw it out simply because they think it ought not to include a certain provision, if they approve of it, as I believe in their hearts they do. Speaking now as a senator, I would much sooner that the Senate restored the provision now than reconsider its decision when the measure is sent back from the other House. I am not speaking now as a Minister. I divest myself of that position. I think that I have done my duty. I admit that I ought to have been able to persuade honorable senators opposite to vote for the whole Bill. What puzzles me is that I have failed in my duty. I feel that I have such a good case that the Bill ought to be passed unanimously, but I find that the Opposition are all against me. If there is a  chance of redeeming my fault by that means, I suggest to the Leader of the Opposition that he. should move the adjournment of the debate. </para>

                            <para>- I have made a brief reply, but I am afraid that it is of no use. I have said that we take the power of making regulations in practically every measure that is passed. I have gone into the question, and tried to see if it would be possible to bring in a measure that would -cover all contingencies which might arise, but I am quite satisfied that it could not be done. I feel that if we were to bring in a measure to meet the case, we should still have to take that power. It is taken in all measures, and .1 do not know of any measure in which there is a greater necessity for it than there is in an Audit Bill. I do not know of any subject which would not be dealt with incompletely if we did not take that power. I suggest to the Leader of the Opposition that on this occasion there is no principle involved, and that if there is a chance of the Senate reconsidering its attitude the provision asked for should be made. </para>

                        moves the adjournment of the debate, I desire to say a few 'words, as I have not spoken on this Bill. What has struck me is that while the debate has turned on the question of appointing a Supply and Tender Board, there is not a word about that matter in the Bill. Of course, it is implied that, in the regulations to be made, power will be given to appoint a Board. It is a marvel to me that the Commonwealth has gone on for so many years without a Board of that sort being created. I think we are all agreed that it is absolutely necessary, particularly now when the Commonwealth is undertaking a large number of very extensive public works, that there should be a Board to supervise purchases. We on this side agree with honorable senators opposite that a Board should be appointed, but not in the way proposed by the Government. We are so seized of the importance of having such a body to supervise purchases that we think that its appointment should be dealt with in a separate Bill, when we would have an opportunity of saying how it should be constituted, and defining its powers. I am inclined to agree with
                        <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Clemons</inline>
                        that, even if a separate Bill is brought in for that purpose, an amendment of the Audit Act will be necessary. I should not have objected to vote for the Bill as it stands, if we had had an assurance from the Government that they would bring in. a separate measure, and so give us an opportunity of saying how a Supply and Tender Board should be created, and defining its powers. I put it to my colleagues that the proposed amendment of the Audit Act, or a similar amendment, is required, even if this Bill be defeated. I think that
                        <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Clemons</inline>
                        has made out a good case for an amendment of the Audit Act on the lines of this Bill. He has made a very plausible and courteous appeal to the Senate for further consideration, but I do not think that there is any likelihood of honorable senators on this side agreeing to the Bill being passed in its present form, unless they get an assurance that a separate Bill will be brought in on the lines I have suggested.

One honorable senator will, probably understand my allusion to certain matters having cropped up which*, justify my support of the provision. I appreciate the reference from the other side to this not being a party matter. It. is a measure essentially in the interests of the Commonwealth. Evidence has been disclosed to me quite recently which has confirmed me in the belief that it is essential that the Auditor-General should, be brought into the closest relationship with the purchase of the stores on behalf  of the Commonwealth.

I consider it sacrilegious of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Rae</inline> to rejoice at the suspension of law and order. We are the law and order party on this side, and we are at present endeavouring  by  every means to assist the Government in the conduct of business. Every honorable senator on this side appreciates the statement of the Honorary Minister in respect to the work of Parliament.

                    <para>. - I am not  going  to oppose this motion, but I was wondering why <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gould</inline> did not rise to oppose it. Hitherto the honorable senator has held that the Standing Orders should be regarded as unalterable as the laws of the Medes and Persians, but whenever a suggestion comes from his own side for their suspension the honorable senator is mute. The proceedings to-day supply further evidence that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McColl,</inline> and other members of the Government have no justification at all for the statements they make repeatedly that the Opposition are blocking business in the Senate. There is evidence also that the Senate is useful to enable the Government to pass Supply Bills. The present session opened on the 9th July last, and up to to-day, 29th October, this great National Parliament has been successful in placing on the statute-book two' Supply Bills. During that time the Senate has had to adjourn on three or four occasions, and has been called together only for the purpose of passing Supply. I shall be glad to assist the Government in their efforts to put business through the Senate. I shall be found willing to assist them every time they have business to place before this Parliament, but I hope that they will endeavour to pass some legislation other than Supply Bills. </para>

                    <para>. - I rise to enter my protest against the suspension of the Standing Orders. In doing so I am merely following the course I followed when the Government I supported was in office during the last Parliament. On no occasion, when I was present, did I permit the suspension of the Standing Orders without entering my protest against that method of transacting business. The Standing Orders represent the crystallized wisdom of the Senate as to the best means to be adopted for conducting its business. We have established a Committee to devise a system for the proper conduct of our business, and it is not right that Ministers should set that system aside to suit their own convenience. The members of the present Government are no greater offenders in this respect than their predecessors have been. It would be better in the circumstances that we should have no Standing Orders at all. If we are to be consistent, in view of the practice which has so often been adopted, we should pass a resolution suspending the Standing Orders for all time. We could then go on with whatever business the Leader of the Government in the Senate might put before us without going through the farce of solemnly adopting a motion to enable us to do so. As every month comes round we are asked to set the Standing Orders aside, because they are inconvenient. If they are inconvenient, wherever a matter of urgency crops up, I should like to know what advantage they are to the Senate at all. I have risen to enter my solemn protest against the practice of thoughtlessly, and without seriously considering their importance, setting the Standing Orders aside to suit the convenience of the Government. Some members of the Government have been very active at Fitzroy, Bunyip, and other places in condemning the Opposition for obstructing business. </para>

I have no doubt that if I called for- a division we would have the representative of Fitzroy or Bunyip, or some other place, declaring at a public gathering that the Government were anxious to pay the public servants of this country, and that the Senate deliberately prevented them doing so.' As a matter of fact, the Estimates for the whole year could have been passed ere this had the Government desired to pass them. I enter my protest against the procedure that is being adopted, and I hope that the Ministry will take the hint that they have about reached the limit of human endurance in the' matter of suspending our Standing Orders. to. suit their own convenience. </para>

Otherwise there are some of us who will probably turn upon him. </para>

In order that I may be consistent I intend to support- the motion. In the last Parliament we frequently suspended our Standing Orders for the purpose of enabling us to do some work. During the current session we have suspended our Standing Orders because we are doing very little work. As a matter of fact, unless we suspend them we shall have no legislative record whatever. It seems to me that we might well describe the present Government as the Suspension Government. They are accustomed to suspend, officers who do not happen to agree with them in politics, to hang up public works if they are not in the right constituencies; in short, to suspend everything and everybody. They have done little else since they took office. </para>

                        <para>- I am astonished at my own leader endeavouring to add to my reputation in that direction. I always consider that rules, regulations, and Standing Orders are made to facilitate action, and that when they stand in the way of progress they should be ruthlessly and remorselessly swept aside. I believe that regulations are intended to help us to get somewhere. It is a piece of ridiculous bunkum to worship rules and authorities for their own sake. If they do not accomplish a good purpose, I like to see them " biffed " out without ceremony. At the same time, I resent the action of the Government in pretending to value our Standing Orders when a motion is brought before us relating to any matter of concern to the vast majority. When a majority of this Senate desired to suspend the Standing Orders to facilitate the appointment of the Chinn Select Committee or of a Committee of Inquiry into the Fitzroy Dock, or into our Electoral . Administration, we had protests from the Government side of the chamber against such sacrilege. </para>

                        <para>- I quite appreciate that fact. It was incidentally alluded to by me; and was enlarged upon by my disorderly friend opposite. There is good reason why, when it is known that in the lapse of time another Supply Bill will be necessary, notice concerning it should be tabled by the Government. What is to prevent that being done? </para>

                        <para>- That contingent notice of motion which also appeared upon the business-paper when the late Government held office seems to me to be a permanent licence to break the rules of Parliament. But a more serious aspect of the matter is that we are so constantly suspending our Standing Orders, and so frequently adjourning the Senate, that we do not have an opportunity to proceed with the little business which appears upon the notice-paper. I think that we should devote ourselves to our work until we clear the business-paper, and then have a good holiday. At any rate, we should do whatever is to be done without any further adjournments of the Senate. </para>

                    <para>. - I think the proper course to pursue on this occasion is to support the proposal of the Government. They are certainly advertising their inability ti carry on the business of this country, and I do not know that there is any advertisement which reflects that fact more strongly than these continual appeals for the suspension of the Standing Orders, which are invariably followed by a week's adjournment. By their action they declare to the country how inept they are, and how incapable they are of transacting any business whatever. No sane man would for a moment say that there is any business on the notice-paper which has anything whatever to do with the development of the Commonwealth. </para>

                    <para>. - Honorable senators should not object to frequent Supply Bills, because they afford them a monthly opportunity of reviewing the political situation which obtains at the present time, and also of calling the attention of the Government to grievances throughout the Commonwealth. The principal work of the Ministry appears to me to consist in going from Dan to Bersheeba, and endeavouring;, to misrepresent for party purposes the action of the Opposition both here and in another place. That fact has been made manifest by the newspapers recently. We have had different Ministers at different times doing the same thing. </para>

                        <para>- The practice is becoming so frequent that it will soon be worse than the small-pox epidemic in New South Wales, and' probably will lead to the Commonwealth being politically quarantined. To my mind, the Vice-President of the Executive Council is one of the worst offenders in this connexion, and is guilty of the most foolish utterances. For instance, quite recently he endeavoured to convey the impression that the small-pox epidemic in Sydney had been made a party question in this Parliament by the Opposition. I emphatically deny any intention of making that epidemic a party question. We have much more important matters affecting the welfare of the country to consider than to wish to make the people believe that trifling matters of that description ought to occupy our time. I hope that in the future the Vice-President of the Executive Council will refrain from such foolishness, or, if he does indulge in it, will give proof of his assertions, and not be always compelled to back down, as he has been doing in the Senate for the past few months. The other offender is the Prime Minister himself. Only within the past few days he went up to his own constituency, Parramatta, and told the people there that the late Government spent every penny it could lay hold of. When it was clearly pointed out that the late Government came into office with a deficiency from the previous Government of nearly £500,000, and went out leaving a surplus of £2,653,000, the Prime Minister, although confronted with the fact, has endeavoured to make it appear that the surplus of £2,653,000 could not be utilized by the present Government, because commitments compel them to spend the whole of it during this year. The facts are entirely against the Government. The Prime Minister ought to ascertain the truth before he makes statements of the kind. I wish to point out that the head of this Government, like some of his colleagues, is prepared to tell the partial truth, which in this, as in every other part of the world, is often worse than a downright falsehood. As for the statement that the commitments of the late Government threw a responsibility on the present -Ministry which devoured the surplus to which reference has been made, I wish to point out that the only commitments of any great consequence amounted to £702,000, connected with the Fleet Unit. Deduct that sum from the £2,653,000, and the Government were still left with a surplus of £1,950,000. If the Prime Minister has any respect for the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, he will look a little further and tell the public what the real facts are. He will admit that the only commitments to be deducted from the large surplus left by the late Government are the £702,000 to which I have referred. During the administration of the late Government, and partially within the term of the present Government, in the last financial year, there was unexpended in connexion with the ordinary annual services of the Commonwealth a sum of, approximately, £353.000. If that amount was unexpended on the ordinary annual services of. the Commonwealth last year, and if the present Government exercised the same economy in the present year - if they exercised the economy about which they have boasted so much to the people of Australia - the saving this year would be still greater. Upon Works and Buildings last year there was a saving of £863,000. I admit that that sum might be deducted from the £2,653,000. But if that amount was saved in consequence of the lateness of the passage of the Estimates last year, the present Government will have the same advantage this year. Consequently, I deny that that sum ought to be deducted from the £2,653,000. There is another item to which I will call attention, in connexion with the amounts paid to the different States. I do not desire that any reduction should be made on that account. I should like to see the various States of the Commonwealth prosper and increase in population to such an extent that an item of this kind need not appear. There was a sum of £41,180, not saved, but overpaid, connected with the amounts distributed amongst the States from Customs and Excise revenue. I do not desire that that should continue. But, altogether, these sums would make up a total of £1,175,000, to be deducted from the £2,653,000, and that would leave a balance of £1,477,545 which the present Ministry received as a legacy from the late Government, and which passes over to the financial year 1914-15. Therefore, I counsel Ministers, when they again make statements about the administration of the late Government in comparison with their own works, to be charitable enough to give credit for greater ability to the late Treasurer than, so far, they have been disposed to do. I notice that there is no Treasurer's Advance provided for in this Bill. In the last Supply Bill we were asked for an advance of £300,000. The Treasurer was accorded. that advance Will.ingly °y this branch of Parliament. Owing to no Treasurer's Advance being asked for on these Estimates, the month's Supply seems much less than would be the case under ordinary circumstances. I have advocated that a Government should have more courage, and ask for Supply for two, or even three, months. In the State from which I come the first Supply Bill of the year is always for three months. Consequently, there is no necessity there for suspending Standing Orders, or for continual , discussions on Supply. My experience in this Parliament has, however, driven me to the conclusion that it is a wise thing to curtail the grant of Supply to a Government, so as to afford members of both branches of the Legislature every opportunity of ventilating grievances, and advising the. Government with respect to the best manner of providing for the wants of the people of a great Commonwealth like ours. I hope that honorable .senators will take fair advantage of this opportunity of discussing Supply, and that the Government will be successful in carrying their Bill before we disperse to-day. </para>

                <para>Commonwealth to the other, when the change of Ministry took place, there were people who, misled by those speakers and reports, were of opinion that there would be, not only a change in administration, but that government would be so economically administered by the incoming Ministry that we should get down to bedrock in respect of the cost of living. We were led to believe that the condition of the worker would be improved in consequence. At present the worker who, through his union, has secured better wages, finds, nevertheless, that he is not in a very much better position than he was before, owing to the fact that the power-holding class, which has a monopoly of the food supplies, and nearly a monopoly of the housing of the bulk of the people, has so increased prices and rents that nearly all that has been won by the worker by organization has been discounted by the increased cost of living. 1 should like the Minister in charge of this Bill to tell us in his reply how it is that a Government which came in to give us cheaper administration, in spite of the fact that it had a surplus and the Trust Funds at its disposal, was not content with the £20,000,000 coming .in to the revenue, and with the £2,000,000 left by the previous Government, but at once asked Parliament to consent to a large loan. </para>

Surely a party who promised from every platform to cheapen the cost of living, who told the people that the whole cause of the high cost of living was the presence of the Labour party in office, are not going to come here month after month and ask for Supply, not on the same scale as their predecessors did, but on a larger scale, without taking the Parliament and the country into their confidence as to what steps they intend to take to make living cheaper to the people ? Will they take any steps to reduce the house rents in the cities? According to the Statistician for New South Wales, for a house which in Bathurst can be rented for 7s. 4d., a person has to pay 15s. 6d. in Sydney; for a house which in Goulburn can be rented for 7s. 8d., a person has to pay 15s. in Sydney; while for a house which in Newcastle can be rented for 7s. 2d., a person has to pay 15s. in Sydney. I appeal to the Government, who, on the hustings, held the Labour party responsible for the high cost of living, to say whether they intend to deal with that subject at all? Are they satisfied with having won the right to control the affairs of the Commonwealth, and won it, too, by the slanders of their press and their party throughout the Commonwealth ? Are they satisfied to allow the poor people to continue to labour under the great hardship of increased and increasing rents? It is the duty of the Government, when they ask for another month's Supply, to foreshadow, in some form, what steps, if any, they propose to take to lighten the burdens of the people. Do they for a moment imagine that their mere presence at the head of affairs will bring about a sufficient change to make the people appreciate it? If ever a Government came into office pledged from every platform in every constituency to better the conditions for the people, and to make living cheaper, the present Government did. I ask the Minister in charge of this Bill has he taken any steps to bring about that reform ? One of the Bills with which we have been called upon to deal was a measure to increase the profits arising from the rich sugar lands of Queensland by paying bonuses to men who are making more money out of 1 acre of sugar land than a potato-grower can make out of 10 acres of land. Have the Government shown in any way that they are desirous of making sugar cheaper to . the people by taking off the duty ? "Do they intend to take off the duty? </para>

                        <para>- I have never in any way connected myself with the so-called Free Trade parties in this country. I have been trying to get the Minister, in his reply, to indicate, not vaguely, but definitely, what steps the Government intend to take to cheapen the cost of living in this country. They not only gave such a promise to the people of the Commonwealth, but they led people, in many cases, into the belief that the high cost of living prevailed only in Australia, that the presence of a Labour Government was the cause of it, and that, with the advent of the Opposition to power, there would be a cheapening process. But what has been the result of a lengthy investigation of their charges that the Labour party increased the cost of living? According to the Budget papers we have had from Great Britain, the increase has been smaller in Australia than in other countries where this subject has been inquired into. In England. Germany, France, and America, the cost of living has increased enormously more than it has done here. If we had a further examination into the wages paid in Australia, the fact would be made apparent that the increased wages paid to artisans - not only the increased wages paid to individuals, but the increased aggregate earnings of workers - are enormously higher to-day than the wages of five years ago. The working man of Australia is in an infinitely better position than is the working man in other countries, because the cost of living to him has not increased by so much, while, side by side with that fact, his wages increased proportionately a great deal more than did those of the working man not so fortunately situated in other countries. But, notwithstanding that position, there is still room for a huge betterment in the condition of our workers. The present Government came into office pledged to improve that position. Parliament re-assembled on the 9th July, and we have been more than patient. We have sat here week after week, and, even by suspending the Standing Orders whenever asked, we have enabled the Government to bring their measures before the country as rapidly as possible. We have been content to sit here without complaining. We have given the Government every opportunity to develop their proposals, and it is about time that the Minister who now asks for Supply stated definitely what steps the Government intend to take to make living cheaper, to prevent exorbitant charges for houses in great cities, and to prevent a monopoly of the food supplies of the people. If Ministers intend to let these matters drift, if they propose to sit idly by and allow things to go on as they have done for nearly four months, it is " up to them " now to make a definite statement. For four months they have been in office, and nothing has been done in that direction: Not one finger has been raised to give effect to their platform pledges to the constituencies. I do not desire them to carry out their promises in a week; I did not expect them to do much in a month; but, after the lapse of four months, it is reasonable to expect a Minister, when he is asking for a month's Supply, to give the country an indication of the direction in which they are going to move to cheapen the cost of living. If they intend to do nothing, and imagine that their presence in office has accomplished what they said they would do, let' the Minister say so clearly, but if they have in view any scheme, whether it is one for removing duties or not, let us know what it is. I know that at the recent elections three honorable senators for New South Wales were returned chiefly because they were Free Traders. The reputation they had earned in the old Free Trade party still stood to them, and the people believed that by returning them they would get cheaper living. </para>

                        <para>- I am very sorry  that the provisions of" our Constitution should be such, that when all parties in both Houses desire a united appeal to the country, that cannot be immediately brought about. If there is one  thing  which more than another every member of the Senate is anxious to do, it is to go through the ordeal which some of them went through three or four months ago. As my time here will expire in a  year  or two it would not make very much difference to me if we went to the country immediately, and I should prefer to go to the people in opposition to a Government that is discredited : by having been in office for four months without lifting a finger to redeem its pledges. </para>

                        <para>- I am reminded that the Minister who controls the Post and Telegraph Department has done something to show his loyalty to the Old Land by altering the design of the postage stamp which was adopted by the late Government. I understand that the discarded design was chiefly offensive to the Government because it represented a White Australia. For some time past they have been obliged to stamp all their letters with a representation of a White Australia, and they have valiantly availed themselves of the first opportunity to replace that with a representation of  His  Majesty. </para>

                        <para>- No; if we had such a great man here I should be prepared to follow him in any reform he undertook. The so-called Liberal party has been more properly named the AntiLabour party, because they are against everything intended to benefit the people. They have appealed to the constituencies in the name of Liberalism, and have induced the people to believe that they are in touch, and are marching side by side with, the great Liberal party across the water. But when the question of land taxation crops up do we find them following the great Liberal leaders of the Old Country, or opposing their policy ? What do they do when it comes to a question of dealing with house rents? They are Liberals in everything that does not affect the pockets of the wealthy people who keep their organizations going. </para>

                        <para>- I hope before many months are passed to be in a position to give the honorable senator a good deal of information as to where the wealth behind the so-called Liberal party comes from. I should like to know where the money came from to pay the many hundreds: of paid professional canvassers who were at work on behalf of the party at the last elections. Will the honorable senator deny that in New South Wales there was one, and sometimes two, canvassers, at work for weeks, prior to the election, in every town or village of more than 500 inhabitants. </para>

                        <para>- I would not impute that any member of the Senate or another place was supplied with funds, but I do make the statement that to keep professional organizers at work for the whole year round, to print a volume of literature unheard of before, and to supply each polling booth in New South Wales with rolls containing 400 or 500 names, which scrutineers were asked to object to during the election, must have cost thousands of pounds. That money came from somewhere, and I hope I am not offensive in saying that it came from the wealthy section of the community, who have a Government in power to-day to represent them. As the Anti-Labour party's sinews of war have been provided by the wealthy section in Australia, there is little hope that the promises of the Government to lower the cost of living to the workers will be given effect. They have had four months of uninterrupted and  unharassed  occupancy of office. There never was an Opposition more easy to manage than the present Opposition in the Senate, and in view of the way in which this Chamber is constituted at present, I have been surprised that the Government have not asked the late Vice-President of the Executive Council, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor,</inline> to accept a position on the Treasury bench. </para>

It is, of course, unthinkable that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor</inline> would accept such an invitation, and I intended only to show that there has been no justification for the action taken by some' members of the Government in complaining, 'at outside places, of obstruction from this side, in view of the fact that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor</inline> has met them more than half way in assisting them to conduct their business. As the Government have not been prevented . from carrying on their business in the most expeditious manner,, and have now been in office for four months, I trust that the Honorary Minister, in replying to this debate, will give the Senate and the country some indication of what they propose to do to make the cost of living in the Commonwealth cheaper. </para>

                    LARGIE (Western Australia [5.21]. - A few moments ago, in addressing the Senate, I referred to the Government as the. " suspending " Government. I understand that in the interval the Government have in another place been themselves suspended. The only thing they have done since they came into office has been to suspend everything they could, and seeing that they have met with that fate themselves, I should like to know what they intend to do with this Supply Bill.

                        <para>- But why pass it? Surely we have a right to know, in view of the position of the Government, who is going to spend this money? As the Government are now a defeated Government, I do not see what claim they have to ask this Chamber for Supply. We should have a Government in office, even if they are not in power, before the Senate is asked for Supply. I respectfully suggest that we should suspend the consideration of this Bill until the Government have considered their position. We know the extremely narrow majority by ' which they have been clinging to office . for so many months. It is useless in the circumstances for <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> or any other member of the Senate to be talking about the policy of the Government. To assume that they will do anything to cheapen the cost of living, or to pass any useful legislation, is to expect too much. Instead of talking about the policy of the Government, we should consider what ought to be done between now' and the making of the announcement which the Government must make in the near future. Before granting Supply the Senat  should wait events in another place. I do not see that we are entitled to pass Supply for a Government that is non-existent. They have been defeated in another place, and we know that they do not exist in this Chamber. </para>

                        <para>- The Government have abused the power of the purse for a long time in a most autocratic and shameful manner. They have exercised the control of the money power in a manner which is little short of disgraceful. They have 'insulted the Senate in every way they could. Having control of the public purse they have refused the funds necessary for the conduct of business which the Senate desires should be done. In face of these facts, the only course open to the Senate is to refuse to go on with this measure until we know what is to be the outcome of the  situation  that has arisen in another place. I do not wish to enlarge upon the matter. It requires to be considered, and if the Honorary Minister desires to make a statement, I am prepared at once to sit down in order that he may do so. </para>

                        <para>- A division that can occasion no surprise. When we have a Government relying, as the present Ministry has had to do from the first, on the casting vote of the  Speaker,  we may reasonably expect such a contingency to arise at any moment. I seriously ask the representatives of the Government whether, in the circumstances, they are going to press for Supply. I hope that we shall have a statement from them in order that we may know what to do. I do not wish to place honorable senators opposite in an awkward position, but I fail to see what claim they have upon the Senate to grant Supply in the light of what has happened in another place. I ask them to say what they intend to do. </para>

                    <para>. - Honorable senators opposite, when the <inline font-style="italic">occasion</inline> has seemed to them- to be fortuitous and satisfactory, have insisted upon the fact that the powers of this Chamber are co-ordinate with those of the other branch of the National Legislature. We have before us at the present time a measure of urgency, to which the consent of another place has already been given. The national services in the matter of proper disbursements are, to a certain extent, dependent upon the passing of this Bill, and honorable senators opposite, who, as I have said, when they think the occasion is satisfactory, will insist upon the coordinate powers possessed by this branch of the Legislature, are unnecessarily lowering the dignity of the Senate by asking us to take notice of a matter of which we have no official cognisance - of something that has transpired in another place, which may be regarded as a mere accident of political chance - and to suspend our functions because of it. Jealous as I am; as I told you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. President,</inline> on a previous occasion, of the privileges of this Chamber, I decline to accept the statement that anything has transpired that should cause us to suspend the exercise of our functions. </para>

                    <para>. - I have no objection to the passing of this Bill. I do not agree with honorable senators on this side who hold the view that we ought to delay the passing of Supply whenever the fate of a Government is in danger. We must have Supply for the Public Service of the country, so that, even if the Government dropped out of office to-morrow, as it ought to do if it had its deserts, it would be necessary to grant Supply. The matter does not affect the Government as individuals, but it does affect many individual members of the community. I think this is an appropriate occasion on which to refer to a few matters of public concern. At the outset, I shall reply to an interjection by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gould,</inline> in which he said that the money referred to by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> as having been used for the organization of the Labour forces was supplied by the Australian Workers Union. I am glad that he has a proper respect for that organization. I am prouder of my membership of the Australian Workers Union than I am of the fact that I am a member of the Senate, although the one may have, an intimate association with the other. </para>

                        <para>- The organization is great in -numbers, but it has also been great in accomplishment. Its history is a credit to the Democracy of Australia. The pride that I have in my membership relates, not so much to its mere strength as to the fact that I have been associated with it from its inception some twenty-seven years ago, and that I have assisted to bring it to its present position. I did so even in that little island which has been so misguided as to return <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bakhap</inline> as one of its representatives. There appears to be an entire misapprehension - whether it is due to ignorance or malice I am not prepared to say - as to the position which honorable senators on this side take up in regard to contributions to party funds. I have not the slightest objection to any person who believes in that queer conglomeration of principles called " Liberalism," in this country, supporting the Liberal organization if it fulfils their political ideals or represents them in any way. They have the right as individuals to expend as much as they think fit in helping it to win success at the ballot-box. I am in no way averse to any statements that are true as to Labour supporters having contributed to the funds necessary to return Labour candidates to Parliament. That is not, and never has been, the point at issue. The point is that, on one hand, there are persons contributing to an organization because they believe in the political ideals which it seeks, however imperfectly, to express, and, on the other hand, bodies of men and organizations which contribute to a political party because it helps them to wring profits from the general community. </para>

                        <para>- I wish that the honorable senator would not be so persistent in his interjections, which serve only to confuse the issue. The Labour party stands for legislation and administration which it believes to be in the best interests of the manhood and womanhood of Australia, whereas the majority of those who form the fighting force and provide funds for the organizations of honorable senators opposite are out as private speculators to amass wealth at the expense of the community. That is the great dividing line between the two  parties ranged in opposite camps in this Parliament. It is not what our opinions are in regard to an Audit Act or other matters of necessary legislation which come before this Parliament. The root principles that differentiate us are that whereas this side represents the forces that are making for the general uplifting of the people and for the better distribution of the wealth of the country amongst that section of the community which creates it, honorable senators opposite, whatever their personal integrity may be, are nominees of a political force which is out to exploit the people in order to make profits and amass fortunes for the few. It is the recognition of that fact on the part of an ever-increasing number of people that makes our position as a party absolutely secure in the future, notwithstanding the temporary mishaps with which we may meet. Our contributions are given openly, and are published in our annual balance-sheets. Our contributions, instead of being concealed, are gladly stated in any of the publications belonging to our political and industrial organizations. </para>

                        <para>- That is an irrelevant and a foolish gibe. We do what they like, not what we like with them. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gould</inline> and many of those with whom he is associated have such a confirmed habit of misrepresenting industrial organizations and their methods of government, that I believe they are almost incapable of understanding the true position of affairs. Whether this incapacity is wilful, or whether it is their dense ignorance that blinds them to the absolute facts of the situation, I cannot say. As the result of an almost lifelong connexion with the Australian Workers Union, I can say positively, however, that every member of that organization possesses equal voting power, and that every possible opportunity is afforded for giving effect to it. Every officer must annually submit himself for election, and there is the most perfect system of voting that can be de vised, so that any change can be made according to the will of the members. Furthermore, the whole policy of the organization can be reviewed and altered annually. Any member of the organization can send along suggestions through the proper channels, and those suggestions must be dealt with by the annual Parliament of the Union. Consequently, all these stories about the use of force and coercion are inaccurate, and, if made wilfully, are absolutely false. The Australian Workers Union gives the utmost publicity to all its actions, to its financial transactions, and to its method of government. Any one, from the  president  of the Pastoralists Union to any honorable senator opposite, can obtain a copy of the rules and constitution of the organization whenever he desires. </para>

It is part of the policy of the present Ministry to repeal those provisions of our arbitration law which permit the rural workers to bring claims before the Arbitration Court. The Rural Workers Union is now amalgamated with the Australian Workers Union, and we hope, at no distant date to bring the united forces of the organization to bear to compel a just recognition of its claims. Therefore, those who know the power of industrial organization would not be much concerned' if the legal privileges given by the arbitration, law to the rural workers were swept away, but we must, object to any attempt, to destroy equality of industrial opportunities such as is proposed. Quite recently in New South Wales a section of the rural workers has attempted to secure, by industrial action, higher wages and shorter hours, and I believe that the movement will become so widespread that those who, by the misrepresentation of the aims and objects of the Labour party secured many votes at the last 'election, will find that they are unable to prevent the recognition of the Rural Workers' </para>

In some parts of New South Wales the rural workers have taken matters into their own hands, by refusing to accept the conditions which have hitherto obtained, and there is to be united action to secure better terms. The party which is now supposed to be in power will find that the bogy which it used so successfully during the last election to frighten the farmers will no longer be of service. I have no confidence in electioneering . proposals for the reduction of the cost of living, and of rents, or the cheapening of money. The forces behind honorable senators opposite would unhesitatingly consign them to oblivion if they attempted to give effect to such proposals. I shall not flog a dead horse by blaming them for not doing what every one with the slightest political enlightenment knows that they cannot do. But the time is fast approaching when the electors will ask why the Government is not carrying its programme into effect. The people will realize that nothing can be done under the present political conditions, the Administration having no majority worth speaking of in the House of Representatives, and an immense majority against it in the Senate, and they will demand a change of Government, so that a party with a definite and substantial programme may again assume the reins of office, and continue the line of policy which has been departed from. </para>

                    GOULD (New South Wales) [5.47].- A good many gibes have been uttered this afternoon at the expense of the Government and its supporters, which make it necessary that the public should realize that it was the present Leader of the Opposition who, after the election, threw up the sponge, asserting his inability to carry on the business of the country any longer, and that the present Prime Minister was then sent for. If he has not given effect to any important part of his policy the reason is abundantly clear. It is farcical to talk about the Government having failed to carry out its pledges. No Government can do more than it is allowed to do, and the present Government has not a majority upon which to come and go. Parties are so evenly divided in the other House that the Government cannot pass an Electoral Bill, providing for large and important reforms which are called for in the public interest. The

                        <para>- The members of the Labour party here, and in the House of Representatives, discuss in Caucus the various matters which are to be submitted to Parliament, and when a determination is arrived at, though by a majority of only one, every one of them is bound to support it in public. The Caucus meetings are held in secret conclave, there being no opportunity for the press to give publicity to any of the arguments used for or against the conclusions that are come to. Our electoral law was amended during last Parliament, but the opposition to the proposals of the Government of the day was futile, because the Government proposals were supported by the Caucus, and the members of the Opposition were too few in number. The present Government having taken office, it is part of its policy to repeal some of these amendments, and for that purpose it has introduced a Bill in the other Chamber. Of course, we expected that that Bill would meet with opposition, but the Government have not been allowed to take a vote upon it. If it were to summon up the whole of its supporters, and get its provisions carried through the other House, what would happen when the Bill came here? It would be foolish to suggest that seven </para>

                <para class="block">Ministerialists, in a House of thirty-six, could do anything against the majority. I have no objection to it being said that the Government has not a majority entitling it to carry out its policy, and that it must get that necessary support before it can expect to give effect to its policy, but I object to the constant chiding of the party to which I belong for not carrying out proposals for which they get no assistance from the other side. It is an act of gross injustice that the sick and infirm are prevented from recording their votes. When we put the case before the people of Australia, the party that went to the country with a majority was returned in a minority. That, I hope, is the beginning of the end so far as the retrogressive and tyrannical rule of the Labour party is concerned. I am prepared to support all progressive legislation, but legislation giving privileges to one class of the community alone is as tyrannical, so far as the country at large is concerned, as was the legislation of the Tories of a couple of centuries ago. In the whole of the legislation carried into effect at the instance of the Labour party there was not a single idea calculated to benefit more than one class of the community, and that the class which happened to come within the sacred ringed fence of unionism. </para>

                        <para>.-That is no justification -for denying justice to those who stand outside. The honorable senator who last, spoke charged the Government with having been extravagant in finance. The Government, however, have simply honoured the obligations placed upon the country by their predecessors. I presume that it is the duty of any Government to honour obligations entered into by their predecessors and countenanced by Parliament. </para>

                        <para>- We must all recognise that the. defence policy which lias been adopted by Australia must add increasingly to the expenditure. During the elections, I admitted frequently that we were involved, in a policy that must entail considerable expense. The Government was bound to honour the obligations already entered into, and, as far as I can see, the demands are of such a character that more money will have to be found every year. I have seen it pointed out by a Minister that, whilst the Labour party managed to increase the expenditure of the Commonwealth by lis. 3d. per head during each of the last two years of their term of office, the present Government has only increased the expenditure by 2s. 6d. per head. That is a material reduction on the previous increase, and was only caused by the growing demands entailed by carrying out necessary services to the country. There is, I understand, an increase in the defence expenditure alone of something like 4s. 9d. per head. If that be taken into account, it will be seen that there has absolutely been a reduction in the general expenditure of the present Government. The naval and military expenditure is, I presume, necessary. It is our duty to protect ourselves, and to be in a position to assist the Empire to defend itself. Whilst money is wisely and prudently expended iu this direction, it will have my support, no matter on which side of the House I may be sitting. Although exception was taken to my remark that the Trust Funds money was earmarked, it is nevertheless correct. The money may not have been earmarked for individual items of expenditure, but nevertheless if a policy of earmarking had not been acted ~ upon, the money must have been paid away to the various States. </para>

                        <para>- I know that that money has to be applied to the purposes for which it is voted. I do not object to that. But I do object to honorable senators saying that that is an amount of money that has been spent by this Government upon commitments which they have entered upon. The commitments were those of their predecessors, and such as were involved in the legislation of the country. It is unfair and unjust for the present Ministry to charge them with the expenditure of trust money. Some personal matters have been introduced in the debate to which I do not intend to allude. I hope that at the present juncture honorable senators will realize that the money asked for has to be voted in order to meet the ordinary services of the country. It would have to be voted if Ministers handed in their resignations to-morrow. </para>

                        <para>- At all events I am sorry that the honorable senator got up, because if anything is calculated to delay the passage of this Bill it is the speech just delivered. The honorable senator has given us a  lecturette  on what we should do, and has accused our party of being Caucus pledged and Caucus bound. I wish to remind him that every member of the Liberal or Fusion party must, before approaching the electors, submit to a selection ballot. I believe that he himself underwent that process. Prior to the 31st May, every man who came out under the auspices of his party had not only to' undergo that process, but also to sign a pledge. ExSenator <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Josiah</inline> Symon and ex-Senator Cameron refused to sign the pledge. </para>

                        <para>- I shall deal with the Caucus in time. I should now like to refer to the famous Willoughby selection of a candidate for the State Parliament in New South Wales. An attempt has been made by the Liberal party in that State to secure a change of leadership, and to bring <inline font-weight="bold">Sir William</inline> McMillan once more into the political arena. Five times in succession has <inline font-weight="bold">Sir William</inline> McMillan vainly attempted to secure selection as a candidate under the protective wing of the Liberal party of New South Wales, and on the last occasion, according to the press, a dispute arose as to the choice of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Fleming.</inline> So high did feeling run that a sort of riot or Donnybrook fair took place, and police protection had to be sought. If such an incident had occurred in connexion with the selection of a Labour candidate, the columns of the press would have teemed with condemnation ; but in this instance there was only one little paragraph in an obscure little corner. </para>

                        <para>- That is 'so; and it is too late in the day for <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gould.,</inline> who has vast experience of this and another Parliament, to tell us that, because the Labour party have a selection ballot we are doing wrong, seeing that he himself is a member of a party which resorts to the same system. It is said that we on this side are bound by all the decisions in Caucus. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gould</inline> was a member of- the Fusion party when <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Joseph</inline> Cook and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deakin</inline> joined forces. On the death of the late respected <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Frederick</inline> Holder, it became necessary to elect another honorable member to the Speaker's chair, and the party with which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gould</inline> is associated met in secret caucus to decide the matter. I am not going to say that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gould</inline> was present at the Caucus, because I do not know; but it is on record that the meeting was held, and that certain names were suggested for proposal on the floor of the House of Representatives. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Agar</inline> Wynne, the present Postmaster-General said, after that meeting, that if it had not been for the fact that he was present, and that it had been determined to nominate <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Carty</inline> Salmon, he would have stood for the position. Thus the "chickens come home to roost," and it is no good for <inline font-weight="bold">Senator</inline></para>

Our friends opposite, on the other hand, have no platform and no policy. When a Labour man stands on a public platform, and seeks the support of the electors, he makes certain promises, and places before them a policy and a programme, and if the electors return him, that policy is no longer his own, nor that of his party, but is the policy of the people who have sent him here, and he is in justice bound to cany it into practice. </para>

If that be so, where do the electors come in? We have had ample evidence to-day that the Fusion party have copied the system - and it is a good system - of the Labour party, inasmuch as they have a selection ballot and a caucus, and that <inline font-style="italic">they</inline> come  to both Houses determined to act in accordance with the decisions of their party meetings. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gould</inline> has praised the Electoral Bill now before another place as a progressive measure; but I ask him whether he thinks it is progressive to compel every man or woman who goes to the polling booth to sign his or her name on the butt of the ballot-paper, thus enabling the vote to be placed at any 'time? </para>

                        <para>- The honorable senator was too clever to do so; but he praised " the Bill, the whole Bill, and nothing but the Bill." Will the honorable senator say, either here or outside, that the secrecy of the ballot can be preserved when every , voter has- to sign the butt of the ballot-paper? I shall wait an opportunity to hear the honorable senator defend that portion of the Bill. The honorable senator also attempted to justify the increased expenditure under the present Budget. If the honorable senator, when on the hustings, had been as candid as he has been to-day, probably the representation on that side of the chamber would have been even smaller than it is. </para>

                        <para>- I accept the honorable gentleman's word ; but throughout the whole of the last campaign one of the principal charges hurled' against the Fisher Government was that of extravagance. But when honorable members opposite, and those with whom they are associated, are asked to show in which Departments expenditure could be curtailed, the reply they give us is a Budget which increases the expenditure by over £5,000,000. I admit that the increased expenditure is necessary. The expansion and the demands of Australia are such that each year we must necessarily increase the expenditure in our great spending Departments ; but it was absolutely cowardly - to use the mildest term I can get - to stand on public platforms at the last election and say that the Fisher Government were indulging in a " financial drunk " in their expenditure of public moneys. I said during that campaign, and I say it now, that during the years 1910 to 1913 Australia could  not have been governed cheaper than it was. I find now that the present Government cannot govern Australia cheaper than could the Fisher Government. I do not cavil at the proposed increased expenditure, but I wish the people of Australia to understand clearly and distinctly that the requirements of Australia must necessarily demand in? creased expenditure. In conclusion, I hope that honorable senators opposite will be just as candid on the hustings as they are" in the Chamber, and not make the cowardly statements indulged in by some of them. </para>
