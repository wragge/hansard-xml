You have for many years been a member of the Senate of the Commonwealth Parliament of Australia, and during that time those who have been privileged to work with you, and who have therefore been in a position to judge, will join with me in saying that you have demonstrated the capacity necessary for the task you are now called upon to perform. As you have remarked, the position to which you have been called is undoubtedly one of difficulty, more particularly in view of the peculiar composition of this Senate. That you will approach your task with a full determination to discharge it in the way you have indicated we all readily believe. I agree with you in saying that the task can only be satisfactorily performed with the hearty and sincere cooperation of honorable senators on whichever side they may sit. I believe that that assistance will be readily given you. So far as honorable senators on this side are concerned, they will endeavour to do what they can to assist you in the performance of the difficult duties which undoubtedly confront you or any one occupying your present position. I desire now only to add my personal congratulations to you upon the distinguished position which you have been called upon to fill. </para>

With the composition of the Senate, to which allusion was made by the Minister of Defence, I am thoroughly satisfied, and I know that you will receive all the assistance that is necessary to enable you to carry out your duties satisfactorily.

                        <para>- I desire to ask the Minister representing the Prime Minister whether the attention of the Government has been called to the following extract from a paragraph appearing in yesterday&#39;s <inline font-style="italic">Age,</inline> and headed &#34; The Fruit Commission. Labour majority&#39;s report. Commonwealth Line of Steamers. Government Depots in Europe. Liberal minority&#39;s scheme of reforms.&#34; - </para>

                        <para>The Labour members seemed bent on building up the case for the Government&#39;s  Commonwealth  steamers policy, and had mental visions of injurious combines and rings, which were victimizing the producers at nearly every port of shipment, and particularly in Tasmania. B&#39; 4en therefore, the Chairman&#39;s first draft was circulated, with most sweeping condemnations of existing conditions, it was only to be expected that the Liberal members should intimate that they could not assent to it, and must prepare a minority report. The Commission accordingly has for some weeks been a divided body. The </para>
                        <para class="block">Labour members, through <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Finlayson,</inline> the Acting  Chairman,  have presented to the Governor-General a majority report signed by Messrs. F. Foster, Finlayson, Lynch, and Ready. The Liberal members are now completing a minority report, which will be signed by Messrs. Sampson, Thomson, and Gordon, on Wednesday or Thursday, and presented to  His Excellency  the same day. Until the minority report has been handed to Lord Denman, the&#39; Prime Minister withholds the Labour Commissioners&#39; report from publication. </para>
                        <para>The two reports are not mutually destructive documents except as regards certain principles of policy. The Liberal Commissioners dissent from the recommendations of their colleagues which support the Labour party&#39;s scheme of Commonwealth-owned steamers and Federal depots in London on the ground that the evidence does not warrant such desperate remedies for the grievances under which the producers suffer with respect to the Inter-State and foreign fruit trade. They intend doing much more, however, than dissent. They will submit a carefully-drafted scheme of their own. </para>

                <para class="block">As a recruit to the legislative phalanx of which you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. President,</inline> are the head, I wish to congratulate you upon having been elevated to the high and dignified position in which you are now placed. You will never find me lacking in deference to your rulings, or failing in a proper recognition of the very high privileges attaching to the responsible office which you so worthily fill. You will find in me, sir, a zealous - indeed, I may say, a jealous - supporter of any assertion you may think it wise to make of the constitutional rights and privileges of this honorable Chamber. If at present I lack anything in regard to a sense of the responsibility devolving upon me through having been deputed to assist in regulating the political affairs of one of the world&#39;s continents, I hope, nevertheless, that I shall soon acquire that proper sense of responsibility in the atmosphere of this Chamber.I suppose that no amount of talent for political affairs, no volume of knowledge, and no endowment of natural capacity could be too great to enable the possessor thereof to exercise his energies worthily in relation to the government of this great Commonwealth of ours. To address myself to the matters referred to in the Speech of  His Excellency  the Governor-General, I may remark that it is chiefly an indication of great things to come. It has been quite openly and properly intimated that the present sitting of Parliament is being held for a specific purpose, namely, to enable the Government to be supplied with the necessary financial means to continue in an orderly fashion those great national services which are collectively known as the King&#39;s government. I understand that that is the sole purpose for which Parliament has been called together on this occasion. No reasonable being would expect that any Administration could, so soon after having been called upon to assume the responsibilities of office, satisfactorily mature measures for presentation to Parliament. The task of so doing would have been impossible of accomplishment within so short a space of time. The responsibilities of the position are great. The needs of the situation are great. The obligation of careful consideration is great. I understand that Ministers intend at the present stage to ask Parliament to grant them the necessary time in which to mature those great measures the existence of which has been indicated. I hope that those measures when they are brought before Parliament will be found to be fraught with benefit to the people of the Commonwealth in general, and, may I say, to the State of Tasmania in particular; because, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. President,</inline> it is the State of Tasmania that I have been particularly deputed to assist in representing in the Senate. Honorable senators are quite well aware of the specific purpose for which Parliament has been called together. They appreciate the situation. A preliminary debate upon matters of policy would at this stage be out of place. Controversy would be inopportune. It is an open secret that it is the desire of Ministers that this very necessary session of Parliament should be brought to a speedy conclusion, in order that the paladins of debate may be enabled in the interim to prepare themselves for the discussion of those great issues which will shortly occupy our attention. Such being the case, I shall on the present occasion content myself by moving the adoption of the Address-in-Reply in this formal manner, and shall reserve for a future occasion the exposition of those stores of political wisdom which I have accumulated. </para>

I think that honorable senators will readily agree with me that, in view of the peculiar circumstances in which we find ourselves, it is necessary that Parliament should afford Ministers time in which to prepare the measures which they will have to bring before Parliament. Under the circumstances, in seconding the motion in this brief form, I rely on the good sense of the Senate, and merely remind honorable senators that in passing it they will not be depriving themselves in any shape or form of the full right to discuss later on any matters which they may desire to ventilate in Parliament. </para>

                    <para>. - Before the motion is passed, there is one matter which I should like to ask Ministers to look into. I refer to the Arbitration Act and the provisions under which public servants are given an opportunity to approach the Court. An award has recently been given in connexion with the electricians. I understand that one section of the Act provides that an award of the Court, when given, shall, if Parliament is sitting, be laid on the table in both Houses, and if Parliament be not sitting, then within fourteen days of the assembling of Parliament. I learn that the award to which I refer was not among the papers laid upon the table of the Senate to-day, and the question arises whether the fourteen days after the assembling of Parliament within which such awards must be laid on the table in both Houses, will expire within the adjournment, which I understand is to be agreed upon at the termination of this day&#39;s proceedings. I wish to know whether it will be possible to comply with the law in this matter, and have the award laid on the table after Parliament re-assembles upon the conclusion of the adjournment. </para>

I ask for nothing more. It has reference to provision for medical attendance, and, if possible, resident medical attendance, for the benefit of those employed in the construction of the Naval College at Jervis Bay. Complaints are frequently sent in in connexion with the matter, and I have myself made many representations upon it at different times. I understand that what is asked for has&#39; been blocked by departmental officers. I should like Ministers to undertake to inquire whether the matter may not receive attention at as early a date as possible, and even before the Senate reassembles after the proposed adjournment. </para>

                    <para>. - Before the motion is agreed to, I should like to draw the attention of the Minister in charge of the Bill to the fact, which he will doubtless remember, that last winter a united deputation of members of the Senate and of the House of Representatives from Tasmania, waited upon one of his predecessors in office, the then Acting Postmaster-General. We pointed out then the way in which the present contractors for the mail service between Tasmania and the mainland were fulfilling the obligations of  their  contract during the winter months. We confidently hoped that, as the result of our representation, there would be no recurrence this year of the very unsatisfactory provision made, to alternate during certain months of the year with the steamship <inline font-style="italic">Loongana.</inline> This year, however, we have found that we have been doomed to disappointment, and that the <inline font-style="italic">Rotomahana</inline> is again replacing the <inline font-style="italic">Loongana</inline> for half her trips. She is no more satisfactory this year than she was last year. I had a little experience of her recently, and am inclined to say that, if anything, she has deteriorated in value and efficiency during the twelve months. </para>

During this period another vessel is to be placed in the trade in conjunction with the unsatisfactory <inline font-style="italic">Rotomahana.</inline> We may not have an opportunity to ventilate any grievance in connexion with the contract for some time, in view of the contemplated adjournment, and I wish, therefore, to impress upon Ministers the desirability of taking some steps, such as the Honorary Minister desired his predecessors in office to take, during the period of adjournment, to ensure that the contractors for this service shall fulfil in the spirit and to the letter the obligations of their contract; and that, so far as mail and passenger traffic between Tasmania and the mainland are concerned, every facility shall be granted that is reasonable, and that the contract requires the contractors to pro-  vide. I think the matter needs only to be mentioned; but I should like some assurance from the Honorary Minister, or from one of his colleagues in the Government, that no time whatever will be lost in giving attention. to this subject, which is very important to the people of Tasmania, and to all on this side of Bass Strait who have any relations with that State. </para>

                    <para>.- Replying, first of all, to the remarks and inquiry of the Leader of the Opposition, I may say that I was very pleased to hear, and appreciate the full effect of the announcement made, that the Opposition purpose assisting the Government in the passage of the Supply Bill. As to the specific inquiry the honorable senator submitted, I have to inform honorable senators that it is the intention of the Government that, at the close of this debate, I should move the adjournment of the Senate to the 13th August, or five weeks from to-day. On resuming then, it is intended that a full statement of the Ministerial programme for the session proper shall be submitted to honorable senators. As the debate on the Address-in-Reply has been adjourned, it will be competent for honorable senators, on resuming that debate, to take full cognisance of so much of the Government programme as attracts their attention. With regard to the inquiry by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> in connexion with the Arbitration Act, I think I am correct in saying that the obligation upon the Government in respect to the paper to which he referred is to lay it upon the table within fourteen sitting days of the assembling of Parliament. It has been decided that the fourteen days refer to fourteen sitting days, and, acting on that assumption, I can assure the honorable senator that the section referred to will be carried out. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Rae</inline> raised a point in connexion with the operations at Jervis Bay. I am unable to speak definitely from my own knowledge upon the subject; but I can promise the honorable senator that before twenty-four hours have passed over I shall have an inquiry made to see how the matter to which he directs attention can be dealt with. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating</inline> has spoken of a matter which I leave <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Clemons</inline> to deal with, as it is one to which he has directed his personal attention. </para>

                <para>That this Bill be now read a second time. </para>
                <para>The circumstances under which the Bill has been introduced are well known to every member of the Senate. It is a Bill to provide for the services of the current year. The total amount involved is &#163;1,687,967. The term for which such grant is deemed sufficient is six weeks. I recognise that the Bill has been in honorable senators&#39; hands only within the last few minutes, and I assure them that, so far as its details are concerned, they are based carefully on the Estimates of last year, and should, therefore, be above suspicion and criticism. But if it is necessary for me to anticipate any one item in the Bill about which possibly questions may be asked or some criticism offered, I gladly, in advance, direct the attention of members of the Senate to that one item which, I think, is possibly likely to provoke question. That is the item &#34; Advance to Treasurer, &#163;400,000&#34;; and this is what I would like to say in anticipation : On the occasion that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor,</inline> three years ago, first introduced a Supply Bill in this Chamber, the amount involved in the Bill was just a trifle under &#163;750,000; but the amount for which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor</inline> then asked as an advance to the Treasurer was &#163;250,000. I further remind honorable senators that on that occasion <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor</inline> asked for Supply for one month only, and if members care to do a rapid sum in arithmetic, they will see that the amount <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor</inline> then asked for in respect to Treasurer&#39;s Advance was one-third of the total. I submit that on this occasion we are probably removed from any likelihood of harsh criticism because the &#163;400,000 does not come to one-third of the total amount we are asking for to-day. We ask for a Treasurer&#39;s Advance of &#163;400,000 in respect of a total of &#163;1,687,000. If any honorable senator wishes to have details in regard to this Treasurer&#39;s Advance, I shall be glad to supply them in Committee. </para>

                    <para>. -  I would draw the attention of the Committee to a sum of &#163;3,000 provided for advertising the resources of the Commonwealth. Every one who knows anything about Australia knows perfectly well that the resources of this continent are unbounded; but if honorable senators were willing to tell the truth exactly as they know it, they would also be willing to admit that, while our resources are so great, they are, to a comparatively large extent, tied up. We have had a number of good seasons in Australia recently, trade has been good and the community has been prosperous; but, at the same time, the various State Governments have been borrowing largely, and, in some cases, spending lavishly, and we must recognise that that sort of thing cannot last for ever. We may have droughts. I think it almost inevitable that the State Governments will not be able to continue their borrowing-spending policy, and in a comparatively short period we may be up against a period of bad times. I have no objection to the Government spending money to advertise Australia; but I have objection, and a very strong objection, to bringing people here without being able to provide work for them or land for them. I understand that the number of unemployed is increasing in almost every portion of Australia. We have them in Melbourne, we have them in Sydney, we have them in every large city of the Commonwealth, and that is a state of affairs that is not to be contemplated without serious misgivings. If when everything is booming there is such a large number of unemployed as we are assured by some people exists in the various capitals of the Commonwealth and elsewhere, what is going to be the case later on when borrowing is stopped, and when, probably, we have a bad season or two? Then, with regard to land, I understand that out of about 20,000 immigrants who have come to Victoria within the last few years, ostensibly to settle on the land, only two or three hundred have done so. There is no doubt it is exceedingly difficult, not only for people from the Old Country, but, unfortunately, for people who live in Australia, to get land to settle upon. I need only refer to three instances which took place in the mother State within the last few months. In one case fifty-six Crown areas were thrown open for selection, and there were 1,322 applicants. I think it will be admitted that this fact discloses a most unsatisfactory state of affairs with regard to our land. Then, again, nineteen portions were thrown open for selection afterwards, and there were 637 applicants; while within the last few days four portions were submitted by the Government, and there were 350 applicants. In the last case, I believe, 250 applicants were allowed to go to the ballot. </para>

                        <para>- In the case of the nineteen areas, the land agent at Blayney declared that the unsuccessful applicants had over &#163;200,000 among them which they were prepared to invest in land, not for speculative purposes, but for use, if the land were available. The only conclusion that can be arrived at when one considers these facts is that there is a land famine in Australia; that we are in want in the midst of plenty; and the reason for that is apparent to any one who cares to face the facts as they exist. I see that the Leader of the Senate - I do not know whether he is the Leader of the Senate or what he is; but if he is not the Leader, at least he is the nominal Leader - is smiling. </para>

                        <para>- It is not the fact that people are applying for land that I am objecting to. It is the fact that they cannot get on it even when they apply. I do not wish to detain the Committee, because an arrangement has been come to between the Government and the Opposition that this Bill is to go through with as little discussion as possible. I merely draw attention to the fact that we are advertising the resources of Australia in Great Britain with the intention of inducing people to come out here as workmen or as settlers on the land. I have no objection to that, if work is provided, and if laud is available for them when they arrive; but if there is neither work nor land, then I say there is something very rotten with our administration. I wish to impress upon every member of the Committee the necessity for launching out into some policy which will not only provide employment for persons who desire to earn wages here, but also give every man who likes to come to this country, and every man who lives here, the opportunity of getting land without difficulty. </para>

It is not necessary for me to relate what has occurred in New South Wales in connexion with the building which was recently occupied by the Governor-General, but I think it is desirable to know if it is the intention of the Government to take any steps to make provision for a Governor-General&#39;s establishment in New South Wales. Exception, of course, has been taken - I myself took it some years ago here - to the singling out of any particular State away from the Seat of Government for such a provision. It was then pointed out that New South Wales was generously giving the use of Government House, in Sydney, for the housing of  His Excellency  whenever he was in that State, but I think it is desirable that we should know what it is intended to do in regard to what has transpired there - whether it is intended to revert to the principle that prevailed since the establishment of the Commonwealth, and have two Government Houses, for the maintenance and upkeep of which the Federation is responsible, namely, one at the Seat of Government and one at Sydney, or to have only one Government House for the Governor-General, and that at the Seat of Government. </para>

                        <para>. - I take advantage of this opportunity to congratulate the members of the Government upon the position which they occupy. It is fairly evident to most of the senators in opposition that they are diffident about saying very much. In fact, they scarcely say &#34; aye &#34; to their own propositions. I have heard one or two &#34; noes &#34; on that side. They have been so much accustomed in the past to say &#34; no &#34; to every proposition that was put before the Senate that they can scarcely leave off the habit. Besides congratulating our esteemed friends on the Government benches I sympathize with them to a very considerable extent, their numbers are so small; but I believe that they are doughty representatives of the principles of Conservatism, as exhibited in this Chamber in the past. It was trumpeted all over Australia within the last two or three months that there was a policy of freedom, progress, and fair play to everybody to be brought before Parliament if the late Opposition went into office. They are in office now, yet even the outlines of that policy have not been presented. </para>

                            <para>- It was an ice cream that the Governor-General presented, not a policy at all. I sincerely hope that when we reassemble, after a month&#39;s adjournment, the promises of the Leader of the Government here will be given effect to, and that no grumbling or dissent will be given expression to when members of the Opposition, in fulfilling their duty to those they represent in the country, exhaustively deal in the debate on the Address-in-Reply with the provisions that the Government propose to introduce for the benefit of the people of Australia. We hope that full and free discussion will be allowed. We trust that, after a month&#39;s adjournment, we will not be accused of wasting time either by the Government, by their supporters, or by the newspapers in Australia that have been so persistently and consistently backing them up. Because, if there were any intention after we resume of blocking fair discussion in any direction, it certainly would not be right for us as an Opposition to submit to the adjournment at all. We are freely giving the Government every opportunity to bring forth the best that is in them in the interests of the people of Australia; and we hope that when the time comes that they do bring forward measures, they will have no objection to our analyzing and criticising their policy in a fair and exhaustive manner. I trust that the motion will be carried, and hope that the Government will be in a position to fulfil their pledges to the country. I hope also that the prosperity of Australia will not be hampered in any degree by the policy of this Government. </para>

I wish to give my honorable friends my sincere assurance that I believe it to be an extremely bad habit. Looking back over the events of the last few years, I regret that we have been addicted to it.

I am glad to receive it, or any such small mark of approval, but beg to state that I shall judge of the quality of his sympathy by following the division lists later on. Coming to more serious matters, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor</inline> referred to the fact that while the Liberal party had for some weeks - months, I think he said - been putting before the people of the country a policy which I am glad to say they by &#39;their votes have approved and indorsed, he was nevertheless somewhat surprised that the Government were not ready to submit that policy in legislative form for the consideration of Parliament. </para>

                            <para>- The Fisher Government had an interval of three months. The election, three years ago, took place on the 13th April. Within a week, the Deakin-Cook Government resigned office, and only retained &#39;charge of business pending the formation of a new Ministry. Then they handed over the control of the Departments to their successors. The Fisher Government did not meet Parliament until the 1st July. That was three months after they took office, and it was recognised at the time that they were entitled to that period for the purpose of preparing their Bills. </para>

Previously they were only too ready to allow them to go without any comment at all. </para>

                            <para>- No, it does not : but what it does point to is this - that whilst when they were on this side of the House honorable senators opposite appeared - to be anxious not to discuss measures at all, we are now told that they will insist on discussing them. 1 welcome the fact and attitude which now marks honorable senators opposite. To put the matter in another way, I look upon the burden placed upon this party heretofore of discussing public measures as having been a heavy one, and am particularly pleased to see that honorable senators opposite now recognise how unfair it was, and are prepared to share the burden with us. I should like to say, in conclusion, that I quite recognise - as every one must - the very peculiar position that exists owing to the composition of the Senate. I recognise that fully. I am, however, hopeful, from the attitude which has marked the Leader of the Opposition &#34; this afternoon, that while recognising the composition of the Senate, and while adhering to the principles to which they are attached, and remaining faithful to the pledges which they have given to their constituents, honorable senators opposite will also recognise that the business of the Senate must be carried on, and will, as far as it is possible to do so, in accordance with our rules and procedure, assist the Government to get their business through in the most satisfactory way possible. </para>

                        <para>Many Commonwealth Government  employes  at Cockatoo Island  dockyards  are  wondering what object the authorities have in view in discharging  men  each day. </para>
                        <para>For several  days past Boilermakers, many  of  them old bands, have been dismissed, 14 being discharged yesterday. In the face  of  this  the  dockyard authorities are advertising  for  300 boilermakers. </para>

                    <para class="block">It has been recently rumoured in Sydney that the officials at Cockatoo Dock are going to enforce what I call the silly regulation which obtains in the Government railway service, where employment is not given to men over forty years of age, or to men with one eye - although I worked at this trade myself for many years with one eye, and could always do my work - and where also men on attaining a certain age are discharged. That rule has never been enforced in the New South Wales Government shipbuilding yards at Cockatoo Island. There, as long as a man is able to do his work, no matter whether he has one eye or two, his services are retained. I quite recognise that it is essential that officials travelling in charge of a train should have their full powers of eyesight, but it is not at all necessary in the case of men engaged in shipbuilding or locomotive work. The rumour is that this rule is to be enforced at Cockatoo Dock, where shipbuilding for the Commonwealth is being carried on. I ask the Government to consider this matter, and to see that men who have been employed continuously for a great many years get a fair deal, and are not discharged simply because they show signs of becoming grey-headed. </para>
