As honorable senators know, there is a matter connected with the Naval Board now under consideration, and I do not think it is desirable at this juncture to refer particularly to one member of the Board or the other. I only want to say that a great deal which has appeared in the press lately has been utterly without foundation or warrant. It is a compliment merely to the imaginative powers of the press writers. </para>

                                <para>- I would again ask the Senate, and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Rae</inline> particularly, to recognise that it is not possible to answer a question of this kind without giving a very good idea of what is under review at present. I do submit that it places in a rather false position those gentlemen whose names are mentioned in this direction. </para>

I then made the statement, and repeat it now, that nothing of the kind has happened because of the failure of the head office here to supply plans and drawings for work at the Fitzroy Dock. For the rest, a statement has been forwarded to the acting manager with a request that he will supply a report as to the allegations contained in the press paragraphs dealing with the subject. </para>

This is a Bill which proposes the appropriation of £3,268,569 for additions, new works, and buildings. In connexion with matters of a similar kind, here and elsewhere, we have heard a good deal lately about extravagance. </para>

                            <para>- No; I repudiate nothing, but I repeat that, in my view, it is not sufficient for any one standing where I stand to-day even to sheet home accusations of extravagance against a previous Government. I recognise very strongly indeed that the responsibility rests with the Government now in power to justify their own Estimates, and their proposals for new works. </para>

                            <para>- I admit also that I did not when in Opposition realize that the Minister in charge of a similar Bill felt such a sense of responsibility. Every penny of the money proposed to be appropriated by this Bill has to come out of revenue. I do not expect it will be denied that the time is rapidly approaching when any one who considers the financial position of the Commonwealth will admit that we shall have reached the high-water mark of expenditure on additions, new works, and buildings. If that statement seems somewhat strong, I can give honorable senators the reasons which induce me to make it. </para>

                    <para class="block">For the present I offer them a comparison which I have made, and which I think will be found of interest. I am going to compare the amounts appropriated by Bills similar to that now before the Senate during the last three years, and in previous years. Let me say that I do not make the comparison with the amounts appropriated during the last three years, because the predecessors of the present Government were in office during that period. There is a reason for doing so, quite apart from the occupancy of the Ministerial benches by any party. Honorable senators are aware that, as we might say, the Federal Parliament three years ago came into possession of its own, or, at all events, into possession of a very much larger revenue than it ever previously had at command. It is perfectly true that the increased revenue enabled us to spend much more upon additions, new works, and buildings than had been expended during the years prior to 1910. I direct the attention of honorable senators to the figures I intend to quote. Omitting the odd hundreds the amount set down in the Appropriation (Works and Buildings) Bill of 1910-11 was £2,324,000; in 1911-12, £2,791,000; and in 1912-13, £2,789,000. The amount proposed to be appropriated by the Bill now before the Senate for 1913-14 is £3,266,000. I go back still further, and make a comparison covering altogether about nine years. In 1904-5 the amount set down in the Appropriation (Works and Buildings) Bill was £404,000; in 1905-6, £416,000; in 1906-7, £479,000; in 1907-8, £686,000; in 1908-9, £720,000; and in 1909-10, £1,054,000. </para>

                                will see that his remark is scarcely called for, in view of the fact that I am deliberately proposing the second reading of a Bill to appropriate the largest amount we have ever attempted to appropriate by any of these Bills. But I do suggest that this is a subject for serious consideration.

                            <para>- I am not electioneering now, and I do not like electioneering. I would much rather speak here in the Senate. But I recognise that I am addressing honorable senators, who have themselves to shoulder a certain responsibility, and under whose consideration these matters ought to come. I am endeavouring to point out what a serious pitch we have reached in regard to our expenditure. I admit that it is desirable that this money should be spent out of revenue. But if similar sums are to be spent out of revenue in the future, we shall at once be confronted with a very difficult problem. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> has already made reference to this subject, and I was anxious to reply to him, but the opportunity to do so was not afforded me. He referred to a subject which is akin to this, namely, the cost of living, which touches closely upon the question of taxation. It is a dangerous thing for anybody dealing with finance to attempt to prophesy, but I venture to say that we have no reason to hope that the amount of revenue which we have been receiving during the past two years from our existing sources of taxation will be maintained. </para>

                            <para>- Yet I do not shrink from it. I am armed with one or two reasons, at any rate. In the first place, I would refer <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Barker</inline> to our main source of revenue, that of Customs taxation. During the last year or two we have derived a large revenue from Customs simply because the States themselves have been large borrowers in London. Quite apart from any Tariff consideration, to that one cause is largely due the inflation of our revenue. </para>

                            <para>- The States have borrowed, and we have benefited by their borrowing. Their borrowing has had a lot to do with our. enormous Customs revenue. What have we to contemplate in the future? Personally, I do not think there will be any borrowing in London on the part of the States to compare with that which has been going on during the last few years. None of us has any reason to believe that the existing state of things will be continued, and consequently our revenue from Customs must diminish. I have offered these few general observations because I think they are well worth considering. So far as the Government are concerned, they fully realize the very large amount which they seek to appropriate under this Bill. They have found it practically impossible to cut down the expenditure upon public works to any appreciable extent. I say - and I do not expect any exception will be taken to my remark - that to a good deal of that expenditure we found ourselves committed. </para>

                            <para>- Justifiable, if <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Barker</inline> wishes it. I come now to another topic. A good deal has been said about the question of extravagance, but I venture to affirm that when that term has been used there has been a certain amount of confusion of ideas. The object in the minds of most men who use the term is to apply it in a sense condemnatory of somebody or something. It is not used as a term of praise or of approval. But I think there can be an extravagance of method as well as of amount. By that I mean to , say that nobody is justified in readily using the term " extravagance " merely because a large sum of money may be involved. On the contrary, the term might very often have aptly been used if an inquiry had been made into the method of expenditure, even though a much smaller amount were involved. I am making no accusations whatever against the late Government. I am merely drawing a distinction between the use of the term " extravagance," lest I should be met by my honorable friends opposite with the statement that if ever there was extravagance in the matter of expenditure it is to be found in this Bill, seeing that it provides for a record expenditure in a Bill of this description. What the present Government chiefly aim at is to discover any extravagance in method. In other words, what we desire as a Government is to receive adequate value for the money which we spend. The nearer we approach that ideal the farther we shall get away from any just accusation of extravagance. That applies to every Department. </para>

                            <para>- The honorable senator is not going to draw me into a discussion of the past. I am more concerned with the future, and with the aims and objects of the present Ministry. Seeing that expenditure upon defence constitutes one of the most important items in this Bill, I may perhaps be permitted to make a few remarks on the subject of defence. I do not think the Government have any greater desire or any higher ambition than to render our present Fleet efficient. If there be any service in the country that we wish to see efficient, so that we may worthily uphold the traditions of the British race, that service is to be found in our Navy. If efficiency be not our chief object in respect of our Navy, we ought never to have established it. If we do not strain every effort to secure its efficiency, we are unworthy to have a Navy. </para>

                            <para>- No' words too strong can be used to condemn any Government whose Navy evidences inefficiency. Let us look for a moment or two at the history of the British Navy, upon whose past records we are so proud to build. Any one familiar with the history of England knows that before she became the greatest naval power in the world, it was not so much the size of her Navy of which she boasted as it was its magnificent efficiency. That is the one feature which has redeemed her Navy, from its very smallest beginnings until the present time, when it has attained such formidable dimensions. In other words, when her Navy was small it was great - great because of its efficiency. With regard to the expenditure of money in connexion with the Navy, whether on public works, or in other ways, the honest desire of the present Government is to make the Naval Forces efficient. I turn now to suggestions which have occurred to me for effecting economy in other directions. The great spending Department of to-day is the Home Affairs Department. I think it is desirable that serious consideration should be given to the method of expenditure which has been followed for a considerable time. The Home Affairs Department also carries on the expenditure for other Departments. I doubt whether that is a very satisfactory state of things. I admit that the remedy is rather a difficult one to find. But unsatisfactory as it is, I do not feel inclined to avoid the subject merely because it is difficult. Let me point out the lines on which I think improvement might come. The present method of allowing the Home Affairs Department to do practically all the construction, not only for itself, but also for the other Departments, produces a state of centralization which I do not believe honorable senators like any better than I do. Instead of the Defence Department, for instance, obtaining a vote for £10,000, and asking the Home Affairs Department to spend that amount for it, I should like to se© a healthy rivalry set up between the Departments, if possible, so that the Defence Department might spend the £10,000, and invite in friendly profitable rivalry a comparison between its efforts in spending money and those of another Department. </para>

                            <para>- Yes. But I doubt if we would have that state of things in a worse form if my suggestion were carried out. I feel that I am speaking to sympathetic ears. I am quite certain that the Commonwealth has not got, and is not getting, proper value for the expenditure in various directions. I make no accusation against any particular Government. That sort of thing is going on under the present Government as it has done under previous Ministries. My suggestion involves no party question. I invite honorable senators to consider the method of expenditure. The Government will consider it, and if it be possible for us, at some other time, to produce such a scheme, I would welcome the sympathetic assistance of honorable senators opposite in the endeavour to bring about a reform which I think would make largely for the benefit of the Commonwealth in expenditure. I think it is unnecessary for me to say any more in regard to the Bill. I could, of course, repeat the figures which it contains, but on referring to the abstract, honorable senators can see at a glance the total sums which are allocated in the schedule for each Department. In Committee, the Ministers in charge of the Departments will be extremely glad, and I believe quite ready, to meet every question of detail. </para>

                        <para>. - I congratulate the Honorary Minister on the very moderate tone of his second-reading speech. I should imagine that his colleagues will appreciate the nice way in which he apologized for incidents which are occurring all" over Australia now and have been occurring for months past. It is all very well for the honorable senator, when he is introducing a Bill for the expenditure of an enormous sum, to say that he has no sympathy with remarks reflecting on other Governments or this party with respect to extravagance. I believe that the Honorary Minister feels that way at present. I believe that he has always felt that way with respect to accusations hurled from one set of politicians at another. But that does not get away from the fact that members of the Ministry, even at the present time, are continuing that practice. Not only that, but, unlike the Honorary Minister, they are continually endeavouring to shelter themselves under the excuse that they are compelled to do this because the previous Ministry initiated certain principles in connexion with the development of Australia. The Honorary Minister does not do that, hut his colleagues are continually doing it. Any statement that the Estimates covered by this Bill are those of the previous Ministry is evidently incorrect, because all that the present Ministry could have got from their predecessors was the official Estimates for the different Departments as submitted to the last Government for either approval or disapproval; and as the last Government had no opportunity of going through the Estimates conclusively and adopting them, altering them, or rejecting them, it is, I think, playing it very low down for any members of the present Ministry to shelter themselves under the statement that these were the Estimates of the last Ministry. I hope that other members of the Government will be as fair minded as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Clemons</inline> - I was going to say as generous, but no generosity is really required. Any statement of that kind made in the past, or to be made in the future, should be discounted everywhere in Australia. I was pleased to hear the Honorary Minister give a <inline font-style="italic">resume</inline> of- the expenditure in the years gone by. He went back to the time when the amount expended on works and buildings was under £500,000, and compared that expenditure with the £3,266,569 provided for in this Bill. I do not think that the Honorary Minister was, in that matter, absolutely fair. He said that then the Government had not the money to enable them to go further. I admit that they had not control of the purse to such an extent as the Government have at present. It was not want of money in the early days of Federation that prevented the legitimate development of the Postal and other Departments, but it was the want of courage on the part of the Government of the day. I do not think for a moment that the Honorary Minister had any intention of telling half the truth. I do not think it ever entered his mind - it could not be expected to enter his mind occupying the position he does at present - that up to 1910 the various Governments had £6,059,000 which they could have spent in the development of the country if they had had the courage to do so. Consequently it is idle to tell us to-day that the Government, prior to 1910, had not the money to spend, and that their Estimates could not be of such a character as the Estimates have been for the last three or four years. I know that after 1910 the Government of the day had large sums at their disposal; but I deny that, except in one direction, they increased the taxation of the country. It was not an increase of taxation, but an increase of prosperity, during the three years of the Labour Government that increased the revenue. With the exception of £1,400,000 derived from the land tax the taxation was increased in no other direction. That fact should be emphasized when statements are made that it was because "we increased the taxation of the country that we had more money to spend. Honorable senators, and I am sure the general public, know that it was the expiration of the Braddon section that gave us control of considerably more money. I would like to put this position to the Government, the Senate, and the country. When times are prosperous and the revenue is coming in, when the country can afford it, that is the time to carry on developmental work. I have heard it said that we ought to provide for a rainy day. Did past Governments provide for rainy days when they needlessly parted with £6,059,000 that should have been appropriated for national development? When the Commonwealth enjoyed a large revenue it was our duty, as faithful administrators of the affairs of the country, to carry out, to the best of our ability, all the developmental works for which we could provide for the defence of the country and its welfare. Had that been done, we should have been saved the necessity of deploring our neglect. It is not when bad times come upon us and our revenue is small that we have the best opportunity of providing for our defence. We ought to rejoice in the fact that the revenue of the Commonwealth enabled us to spend money to advantage in recent years. We ought to rejoice that the wisdom of those in authority induced them to carry out that policy from 1910 up to the present year. I consider that money spent on works and buildings for the benefit of Australia in many directions is wisely spent. I do not believe that there is a single honorable senator who will object to the money now proposed to be spent. All that we object to are the comparisons that it has endeavoured to draw between the Government that has gone out of office and the present Administration. I have heard such comparisons made. They have been read to me out of the public prints. Members of the Government and their supporters, both inside and outside Parliament, have made, and are to-day making, comparisons as to the increase in the expenditure and taxation during the last three years. We have been told by a very high authority in the Government, and by one of their supporters in another place, that the burden of taxation was increased by lis. per head of the population during the past three years, whilst this year it is only being increased by 2s. 6d. or 3s. 6d. per head. I discredit all such comparisons, because they do not take into consideration the £3,080,000 that it is proposed to borrow and spend this year. I should like to ask whether it is not in the interests of- the Commonwealth that, as far as possible, our obligations should be met out of our income rather than that they should be met out of money borrowed from some other people, by which posterity will be saddled with a responsibility that we are not prepared to carry ourselves. Surely it is rather in the interests of the country that our obligations should be met out'of revenue. Yet, because this year the taxation is only to be increased by about 2s. 6d. or 3s. 6d. per head, we are asked to believe that the country is being better treated, and to forget the amount of loan money that is to be obtained and the burden that will be imposed upon the people henceforth and for ever. If honorable senators will look at the actions of the past Government and at those of the present Administration, they will have no hesitation in coming to the conclusion that the methods of the late Ministry were far more in the interests of the people than anything of which we are aware at the present time. There are other honorable senators who are practically interested in various appropriations for works and buildings made by this Bill, and who are anxious to express their opinions upon it. The Minister of Defence ought also to supply us with answers to questions that have been asked and insinuations that have been made as to his own Department. I hope that those explanations will be furnished, and that when we get into Committee other explanations that are demanded will be made by members of the Government. I trust that we shall have a full and fair discussion of the Bill in Committee, and that it will be carried into law as expeditiously as possible, so as to enable the Government to proceed with the works that are contemplated. </para>

                        as to what I may term the general financial position. I take it that matters of that kind will be more appropriately dealt with in the discussion on the Budget-papers and on the General Estimates. But I think that the time is not inopportune for me to give the Senate some particulars in answer to questions that have been asked.

                            <para>- I wish to take advantage of this opportunity to give the Senate information which every one recognises that it is entitled to get, and which was specifically requested from me a few days ago, particularly by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Russell.</inline> I have, therefore, risen at this early stage; and I desire to say that if, after I have given the information which I have available relating to the position of the Defence Department, there are still points which are obscure, I trust that it will be possible for me, when we get into Committee, to supply supplementary information, so as to place honorable senators in possession of the fullest details which I have at my disposal. Dealing with the Defence Estimates, and particularly with those affecting the Naval Branch of the Service, I desire at once to utter a word of warning as to some' of the criticisms which have been directed towards the expenditure contemplated under this Bill. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Russell,</inline> T think, the other day - I hope that I do not misinterpret him - seemed to lay special stress on the fact that, as he supposed, it is intended to cut down expenditure at Westernport. In one of the local journals, a short time ago, a similar suggestion was made, followed by one that, whilst we were cutting down expenditure at Westernport, there was to be increased expenditure on naval affairs at Sydney. The suggestion that seemed to be made was that parochial, and not national, interests should determine the localities where the money was to be spent. Now, I hope that in dealing with defence matters no expenditure will be viewed from that stand-point. </para>

I simply connected <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Russell's</inline> statement, where the honorable senator pointed out that, as he supposed, there was a reduction of expenditure at Westernport, with a statement published in one of the morning newspapers of this city, which assumed that, while we were reducing expenditure there, we were increasing it in Sydney. No reasonable man could demur to the conclusion at which I arrived - that there was a connexion between those two statements and a suggestion that we were starving Westernport in order to favour Sydney. I think that every honorable senator will agree that I have justification for expressing the hope that in determining any expenditure of public moneys with regard to defence, no consideration will be paid to merely local interests. </para>

                            <para>- Perhaps I am wrong in referring to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Russell</inline> at all; but, as I said before, I am trying to connect his statement with one which appeared in a Melbourne paper. It is a curious thing that only a little while before that statement was made here I was being accused, in Sydney, of trying to defer naval works there by the action which I took in regard to Cockatoo Island. I say again that this tendency to regard matters of defence from a purely local stand -point is to be deplored. It is not peculiar to this city. Of course, there is a liability wherever public money is to be spent - a natural, but regrettable, liability - to consider the interests of those who live in the neighbourhood, rather than the interests of the country as a whole. But I want to give the assurance that, as far as we are concerned, I have not in the allocation of expenditure considered the interests of any particular portion of Australia, but have considered solely the interests of the defence policy of the Commonwealth. I am of opinion that the interest of the defence policy itself ought to rise superior to all local considerations. I desire to say also, and I hope that I shall not be misunderstood, when I say that works carried on for defence purposes ought not to be used for the purpose of finding employment. I admit at once that all public Departments, when employing large bodies of men, should endeavour so to order their affairs that they will consider, as far as possible, the interests of those employed. But I do not think the Defence Department ought to be called upon to continue works, or to undertake works, merely for the purpose of giving employment. If it is considered desirable at any time by the Commonwealth Government to start works, or to continue works merely for the purpose of finding employment for labour, I' say that the expenditure upon them ought not to fall upon the Defence Department as such. </para>

                            <para>- The question as to what is an equivalent of a word is one upon which opinions may vary. I know the facts. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Kelly</inline> said that certain works being carried on by the Defence Department had been completed, and that the time had arrived for works to be undertaken by the Department of Home Affairs, for which plans and specifications were now being prepared. Plans of that kind are necessary when work is being done by one Department for another. Under such circumstances it is, of course, necessary for the two Departments to come to an agreement. But <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Kelly</inline> did not use the word " quarrelling," in explaining the reason why the plans were not yet forthcoming. </para>

He is aware that I explained that I did not anticipate that his questions would be raised on the motion for the printing of the Budget-papers, and that when we came to deal with this Bill specifically providing for the work I should be ready with the information. In the circumstances, to say that I refused the information is a gross misuse of words. </para>

                            <para>- If the honorable senator would subdue his prejudice a little he would see that while it is possible, and may be desirable, to set down a particular vote for a post-office at Ballarat or at Orange, it is quite a different proposition when we have to deal with a series of works such as those at Westernport. It would be most undesirable in a Budget to tie down a Department to spend a particular sum of money oh each building forming a portion of a whole scheme. Because of that, a lump sum is put down for certain work, and the Department intrusted with the expenditure has then some elasticity in applying it. If one portion of the work is not proceeding as rapidly as another, it will then be possible to devote some portion of the lump sum to work which can be gone on with. </para>

                            <para>- I have already explained the reason for that. The honorable senator might just as well object to the vote for  a particular post-office, and say that there should be a detailed vote for the bricks, the mortar, and everything else. When we have to deal with a naval base, where barracks, earthworks, and wharfs have to be provided, honorable senators will see at once that by putting down a lump sum the Department administering the vote is enabled to proceed with the work as circumstances require. </para>

It would be an extremely foolish thing to say, with regard to a particular work, that so much of the amount appropriated should be spent on a particular building, so much on another, so much on roads, and so much on drains. Parliament is asked to appropriate a lump sum, and honorable senators can, if they wish, get all the details of expenditure. It would be a very foolish thing to shut up the various amounts in a series of watertight compartments. </para>

                            <para>- I take very strong exception to that also. There may be room for a difference of opinion as to the method proposed for the expending of the money, but I do not think the statement that we are starving expenditure on naval works can be supported by the facts, or by a comparison of the figures of last year's expenditure with those of the expenditure proposed for the current year. We have in the schedule to the Bill now before the Senate proposals to hypothecate £337,000 for these works, to be expended by the Defence and Home Affairs Departments, against an expenditure of £249,000 proposed last year by the previous Government. </para>

                            <para>- Still I have given the vote proposed for the year's expenditure. We are providing this year for an increase of 35 per cent. on that expenditure, and I am unable to see that the use of the word " starving," in view of these figures, accurately describes the position. If it is starving these works to spend £135 on them, it must have been more rigorous starvation to spend only £100 on them. Surely the honorable senator's sense of proportion is not altogether dead, and he must admit that when we propose an increase of 35 per cent. on the expenditure for last year we should be relieved of the imputation of starving these works. I leave out altogether the question whether we are spending the money in a way which meets with my honorable friend's approval, but it is clear that the use of the term " starvation " was an exaggeration, and quite inappropriate in view of the figures. </para>

It might be alleged that we are not finding enough for these works, but it does not come with a good grace from those who found 35 per cent. less than we are proposing for the same works to say that we are starving them. I should be extremely pleased if the road ahead were a little more clear, and we could push on with greater rapidity with some of these works, which I hold to be absolutely essential for the safe working of our Navy. </para>

                    <para>I should like to point out, with reference to the suggestion that we are inclined to favour Sydney, which I take notice of, because I happen to be a New South Welshman, why the expenditure, which I regard as urgent in that port, finds a place in this Bill. There are two or three items to which I need not specifically refer, as their purpose will be disclosed as I proceed. But I may tell honorable senators that to-day we have no means of satisfactorily, safely, and efficiently handling the <inline font-style="italic">Australia.</inline> We could not to-day put that vessel under the only sheer legs - those at Garden Island - capable of lifting a big load out of her. She could not go near them. If we could do' so, and required to lift heavy machinery out of the vessel, it would have to be lightered over to Cockatoo Island, but there are no sheer legs there capable of lifting it out of the lighters, and the <inline font-style="italic">Australia</inline> cannot go alongside the wharf at Cockatoo Island. It does seem to me that the most urgent work of the Department is to equip our appliances so that we shall be in a position to handle the ships we have got. </para>

                            <para>- She might be put into the dry dock at Cockatoo Island under one condition, and that is that the boat is absolutely on an even keel. If anything happened which gave her a list to one side or the other, she could not go into the dock. There would be only a margin of 8 inches on either side of her in the dock, and that will be admitted to be a sufficiently small margin for a boat of the <inline font-style="italic">Australia's</inline> dimensions. It seems to me that it is necessary that we  should, as quickly as possible, complete our equipment, so that we may be able to handle the vessels we already have. I am not saying that that is a reason why we should go slow with other works, but I do put it forward as a justification for what we are attempting to do in the way of more efficiently equipping the Cockatoo establishment, and of extending the wharf at Garden Island. I come now to some of the details, which, I hope, will prove not uninteresting to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Russell.</inline> But before passing away from this subject, I would like to remind honorable senators of what will be the total expenditure upon naval defence this year. As will be seen by reference to the Estimates, the Government are asking the authority of Parliament to spend £2,384,132. Last year the expenditure was £1,462,000, so that provision is made for an increase of 63 per cent, in our naval expenditure in one year. I again ask <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> whether, in view of these figures, he can justify the use by him of the word "starving"? It seems to me that when our expenditure on this one branch of defence has been increased by 63 per cent., whilst we may be open to a charge of having submitted inflated Estimates, we cannot justly be accused of starving the service. </para>

                            <para>- I admit that the honorable senator may find some fault with the apportionment of the expenditure. It may be urged that we ought to have spent less on drill-halls, or in some other direction. But when our Estimates show such a considerable increase upon the expenditure of last year, we cannot fairly be charged with starving the Naval Forces of this country. </para>

                    <para>I come now to the question of the Naval Bases. I do not know that any honorable senator will  be  particularly concerned in regard to the smaller items. I take first the naval expenditure, which is contemplated under the control of the Department of Home Affairs. There are some items there such as " Garden Island " and " Spectacle Island," which are quite small affairs, and if any honorable senator wishes information in regard to them, I am in a position to furnish it'. As, however, the amounts involved are so small, I do not propose to give details unless requested to do so. In one case, the amount involved is only £10,000, and in the other it is about £14,000. I turn now to the larger expenditure. Under Division 5, subdivision 7, there is an item,  ' Naval Colleges, Naval Barracks, Submarine Depot, Naval Gunnery and Torpedo School, Naval Training School, £120,000." This covers expenditure on the Naval College, Jervis Bay, and also provides for the erection at Westernport of the following structures: - Four smoke sheds, drill shed and gymnasium, seamen's barracks, single officers' quarters, warrant officers' quarters,- barracks for petty officers, workshop buildings, and other smaller buildings. </para>

                            <para>- I was just about to make a few observations in regard to those workshops. The estimated cost of all these buildings is £192,000, but it is anticipated that on that amount we shall save £72,000. At first glance that may seem too sanguine an estimate. But in regard to the very buildings to which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> has directed attention, I wish to say that, in my judgment, they are in excess of the requirements necessary to give effect to Admiral Henderson's proposals. While I am anxious, and the Government are anxious, to carry out Admiral Henderson's scheme, I do think we should be guilty of extravagance if we attempted to go ahead of it. . </para>

                            <para>- It will. But, in my opinion, they have been plotted out with a design that is much larger than is necessary to give effect to what Admiral Henderson contemplated. Therefore, although their cost is set down at £62,000, which is the estimate for the works designed at the moment, it seems to me that I am entitled to assume that two things will happen. In the first place, I believe that buildings more in keeping with the base, will be adopted - that will mean a considerable reduction of expenditure on this item ; and, secondly, whatever plan is adopted will not, I believe, be completed during the current financial year. The item of £120,000, with a number of smaller items for which Parliament is asked to appropriate £51,000, make a total proposed expenditure of £171,000. I do not know that on that schedule I can add anything more. If I have overlooked any details, I think I have the information with me, and I shall be glad to supply it. I pass now to the other expenditure - that which the Defence Department will have under its own control. If honorable senators will look at Division 12, they will find, under the heading of "Naval Works," these items: " Naval Works, including labour and material, £98,000," " Machinery and plant, £112,000," " Naval College - machinery and plant, £5,721," a total of £215,000. Upon that sum it is estimated that there will be a saving of £50,000, and, consequently, we shall spend about £165,000. When <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Russell</inline> was dealing with this matter some time ago, he quoted figures which led him to conclude that we contemplated spending only £18,000 at Westernport. At the time, by way of interjection, I questioned his conclusions, and I hope now that I have set his doubts at rest. During the course of the same debate, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> arrived at the conclusion that we had only £48,000 available for expenditure at the Naval Base. He did so by assuming that the whole of that £112,000 for machinery and plant would be spent this year. I wish to inform him that that anticipation is not likely to be realized. Those who have the contracts for building the dredges are not likely to be able to complete the entire work this year. </para>

But if those who have accepted contracts for the building of these hopper barges are behind with their contracts, there is no reason why I should assume that the whole of the money provided for these works will be required this year. <inline font-style="italic">The</inline> honorable senator's calculation was perfectly correct on the assumption on which he proceeded - an assumption which he was entitled to make at the time. It was reasonable to suppose that the contracts for these dredges would have been completed this year. But difficulties in obtaining labour, &amp;c , have made the contracts fall behind time, and consequently we shall not require the whole amount set out on these Estimates to the extent that I have mentioned. </para>

                            <para>- But my honorable friend must not assume that all the money is to be spent there, and all the savings are to be effected at Flinders Naval Base. The sum of £165,000 is to be - expended upon these naval works. Since these Estimates were prepared there is reason to suppose that we shall hardly be able to do anything in connexion with some of the amounts which go to make up the total expenditure. But we have placed them all under one heading, so that if we do not require the money in connexion with one item we shall have authority to utilize it for another. In other words, we shall not be tied to the expenditure of a particular pound on a particular work. It is anticipated that we shall effect a saving of £50,000 on this total of £215,000, and I am entitled to assume that there will be a proportionate reduction in the case of the sub-heads. There has never been a time when all the money voted for particular works has been expended. Take the item of £112,000. From the advice given to me I formed the opinion that we shall not want within £25,000 of that amount. I am taking off the amount, because I happen to know a little as to the difficulties which are being experienced in completing the contracts. If we take £25,000 off there it leaves Another £25,000 to come off the £98,000 provided for naval works, leaving £73,000 available for that purpose, and not the £18,000 which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Russell</inline> figures out, or even the £48,000 which was the result of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce's</inline> calculations. </para>

                            <para>- A sum of £80,000 is provided on these Estimates. The item of £5,000 is merely for machinery and plant, and I doubt very much if we can spend that amount this year. It is no good to buy machinery ahead of the buildings in which it is to be installed. At the same time provision is made in case we should be fortunate enough to be able to put the plant in. I wish to present the figures in yet another way. For expenditure on naval works there is a sum of no less than £197,000 provided. I am taking the percentage of saving to be the same for all the items. I assume that there will be spent in regard to each work the same percentage. In that way I arrive at the conclusion that the amount which will be spent at Westernport by the Home Affairs Department is £70,000, by the Defence Department £40,000, and on dredges £87,000, or a total of £197,000. If my honorable friends will compare that with the amount spent last year, they will say, I think, we are not unfairly proceeding with this very important sphere of naval activity. </para>

                            <para>- That is immaterial. It is for one Government, and one country, that the work is being done. It is all part of the formation of a Naval Base at Westernport. When we are finding a sum considerably in excess of the sum found last year I think that we have fairly discharged our obligations to the country and to the naval defence scheme. </para>

                            <para>- £197,000 is the amount which I said will be spent this year, but the amount which we will have authority to spend is in excess of that sum. I am not able to appreciate the argument that we are acting unfairly, because, on some particular item, we are not spending as much as was spent last year. I have endeavoured to show both on the Naval Estimates as a whole and on the Estimates for Westernport in particular, that we have provided for a larger expenditure this year than was provided last year. Whether it is to go in one particular form - a building or a wharf - seems to me quite immaterial. The wharf and the building are equally essential to the complete scheme. </para>

                            <para>- The honorable senator will readily admit that it is worth while to look into the matter of the workshops and to see that an unduly lavish expenditure is not incurred there in order to save a few weeks of time. It takes a little time to see how far expenditure on works can be carried on properly and economically. I can assure my honorable friend that if I had thought it was possible there to spend more money judiciously a larger sum would have been provided on these Estimates. I feel that the position in relation to the workshops is a justification for the statement I made. It was rather necessary for me to make myself familiar, not merely with the large general scheme going on there, but to some extent with the details, in order that I could come forward and say that I at least was satisfied that they were an essential portion of the Henderson scheme, and that the scheme was being carried out with a due regard to the economical handling of the people's money. </para>

                            <para>- I do not want to be extravagant. I think that there is very much required to be done in connexion with defence. It is little short of a crime to waste a pound, because for every pound we have there are a dozen opportunities for profitably spending it. That is the whole attitude I am taking up. 1 feel free to say, however, that if I had thought it possible to carry on more work there advantageously, with a due regard to business considerations, a larger sum would have appeared on these Estimates under the naval headings. </para>

                            <para>. - In my remarks I have no intention of attempting to make defence a party question, to try . to make capital out of the difficult path which I know my honorable friend is travelling, particularly on the naval side, nor do I wish to pose as the superior gentleman, who, having tried my apprentice hand at the Department, knows better than anybody else knows what ought to be done. I am actuated by the very reason which the Minister set out in the beginning of his speech. I think that on all sides of the Chamber it is agreed that efficiency must be the keynote of the Navy particularly. We have not only to remember that the Navy consists of ships, but as the Minister pointed out, that the ships are useless unless they have bases from which they can work, and that therefore everything should be done to see that bases are provided at the earliest possible moment. I wish to justify the statement I made the other day, that in my opinion the Minister and the Government are responsible for the policy of starvation on this very essential business of providing the necessary bases. The Minister is not quite fair in his figures, and I propose to check the statement he made. I exclude such items as drill halls and slip-ways for the Naval Reserves, because the total amount for those purposes would not provide a Naval Base or assist the Fleet in any way. The Minister has said that for Naval Base works the present Government have put 35 per cent, more on their Estimates than the Fisher Government put on theirs last year. That statement is not correct. </para>

Last year the estimated expenditure on naval works was £100,156 under the Home Affairs Department, and £208,050 under the Defence Department, or a total of £308,206, being a difference of £29,090, or only 9 per cent., not 35 per cent., as the Minister said. </para>

                            <para>- That is correct; he expects to save £50,000 out of £210,000, whereas last year out of a vote of £208,000 - nearly the same amount - wc spent to within £29,000. I wish to thank the Minister for his courtesy in supplying me in advance with the details of the items in regard to naval works. There is a sum of £98,000, to be spread over the following works : - Flinders Naval Base, Henderson Naval Base, Port Stephens Naval Base, Garden Island, Spectacle Island, Brisbane, and the Northern Territory. Then there is a sum of £112,000 for machinery and plant. The expenditure at Brisbane is only £1,000, for the levelling of the parade ground and a sea wall. Of the three Naval Bases Flinders Naval Base is very important. , The Henderson Naval Base is that which Admiral Henderson recommends to be the Fleet's primary base - the most important of all. Port Stephens is to be similar to Westernport, except that at Westernport we are to have a torpedo and gunnery school. On that division,  the Minister expects to save £50,000. The division includes £98,000 for works, and £112,000 for plant and machinery. Of that plant there is on order at the present time, or provided, £35,000 worth. The contract time for the delivery of that plant expires within the present financial year. That expenditure is on dredges. Then there is expenditure on hopper barges, £50,000, the contract time for which also expires in the present financial year. Other plant is to cost £15,000. There is £5,000 for other plant already ordered. In connexion with the Henderson Naval Base there is £12,000 for the reconstruction of a dredge. The time prescribed for that dredge was shorter than for the dredge to be constructed in Sydney. So that if that dredge is completed to time - and I think the time was nine months, which must be about up, because the order was given far back in the last financial year - it will have to be paid for during the present financial year. That dredge is simply to be put together here, and no work of any other kind is to be done upon it. </para>

                            <para>- So far as the dredges are concerned, they will have to be completed. I think the time fixed for the English dredge was nine months. That dredge is to be put together here. The time for the Sydney one was longer - I think it was either twelve or fourteen months. Consequently, the money will have to be provided in this financial year.  </para>

                            <para>- Yes. It will be seen that there cannot be a very great saving upon that £12:000, unless the Minister is to be a consenting party to a considerable extension of the time for the delivery of the dredges. If he does that, I am quite prepared to admit) that he will save not £50,000, but very much more; because, if he does not get the dredges, he cannot do the work for which they are essential. If he is going to be a consenting party to delaying their delivery, he can congratulate himself that he will save very much more than £50,000. </para>

                            <para>- One at Westernport and one at Cockburn Sound. I want to show why more work should be done at these Naval Bases this year than was done last year. The honorable senator knows too well by this time the nature of the division of work that is agreed upon between the Home Affairs Department and his own Department. There is an agreement that the Naval Branch deals with works which impinge on the water, or are actually within the water; whilst works which are entirely on the land, such as buildings, even at the Naval Bases, are constructed by the Home Affairs Department. For instance, at Flinders last year, before the Home Affairs Department could get to work at all, the Naval Branch had to prepare the land for them to do the excavating and other works. It had to prepare for the Home Affairs Department, and there was £100,000 on the Estimates last year for the Home Affairs Department's purposes in this respect. It was impossible to spend any of it at the Flinders Naval Base until the preliminary work was done. But that work is done now, and that is why the honorable senator has discharged men from Westernport. Therefore, this year, not only can the Home Affairs Department proceed with the erection of the buildings, but the Naval Branch can proceed to dredge and to sheet-pile the wharves and erect workshops at the base itself. So that this year the Minister will be able to get on with works which last year neither of the two Departments could tackle. Owing to the fact that the preliminary work is now done, both of the </para>

                    <para class="block">Departments can get to work, and can do so without interfering with each other. Consequently, this year the Minister could double the expenditure, because he has an opportunity of doing what could not be done last year. That also applies to the other bases mentioned here. The Minister has set down an item of £10,000 for the Henderson Naval Base. I am going to refer later on to the report which the Government laid upon the table in another place, in which the gentleman whom he sent over to Cockburn Sound to report upon the base there said that all the preliminary work of surveying and the necessary data were completed, and that nothing more of the kind was necessary. The wording here is misleading - " to compete survey and necessary data ' ' ; unless the Minister has decided not to take that gentleman's report. Because, as I have said, his report was that no further preliminary data was required. </para>

                        <para class="block">Westernport is to have a torpedo and gunnery school. This question of workshops was one which came up when I was at the Department, and was rather disturbing to me. I would advise the Minister in quite a friendly spirit to scrutinize closely the proposals for expenditure submitted to him for Westernport, especially in regard to workshops. How can you justify putting workshops of a character which are to cost £62,500 in a place which is only to be a torpedo and submarine base? Look at what the Minister will be committing the country to if he is not very careful. If such workshops are necessary at Westernport, they will be necessary at every one of the Naval Bases where a torpedo and submarine depot is to be established; and if they are not necessary at Westernport, they will not be necessary elsewhere. Apparently, an endeavour is being made to make Westernport something more than Admiral Henderson recommended it should be. I throw out that hint for what it is worth, and I am sure the Minister will follow it up. With regard to some of the remarks of the Honorary Minister, I wish to say that I agree with him that there is a number of items in this schedule that have no right to be in such a Bill at all. We have been up to the present paying for our works out of revenue.  We are not in the same position as the States, because we have very few reproductive works. But we have some; and I do think that the time is arriving - and I have made no secret of my views on the matter - when we shall have to consider whether some of these works should not be paid for by posterity as well as by ourselves. </para>

                            <para>- There is a limit to which you can tax. Here we have a Post and Telegraph Department, and a sum of £1,079,700 of the expenditure may be put down as reproductive. Then we have the Treasury, £4,860. The Treasury is now a reproductive Department; the Bank Note Branch and the Stamp Printing are both reproductive. </para>

                            <para>- Coming to the External Affairs Department there is a vote of £68,930 set down, and much of that is for the Northern Territory. I venture to say that if we are to develop the Northern Territory, which is one of the biggest divisions of the Commonwealth, it is futile to hope that we can do so entirely out of revenue. We shall be compelled to borrow for the development of the Northern Territory, and the sooner we face the fact the better. The Home Affairs Department is expending for other Departments on works of a reproductive character £171,975. So that in the schedule to this Bill there is included expenditure amounting to £1,315,465 on works of a reproductive character out of a total expenditure of £3,266,569. I do not believe we can go on in that way very much longer, but I agree with the Honorary Minister that the position is being forced upon us. </para>

                            <para>- I think that we are. The fact that the revenue from these Departments is increasing is an indication that we are getting better off. We have been able by expenditure out of revenue to give -the public great additional facilities. We have been able to establish  penny postage, cheaper . telegrams, .and better postal facilities all round, because by carrying out the necessary works from revenue, rather than from loan, we have saved the interest on the cost, which would have had to be provided out of revenue. One other matter referred to is of a non-party character, but we have a right to give our attention to it. I refer to the present division of works between the different Federal Departments. I take the Departments of Defence and Home Affairs. The Minister of Defence has in his Estimates provision for the engineering services, a very necessary branch of the Defence Force. They could not be cut out, as in time of war they will form one of our most necessary arms. In time of peace the men in the engineering staff have to do theoretical work. They cannot do practical work, because, if the Minister of Defence put an engineer of his Department to superintend a work for the Department, he would have a long memorandum from the Home Affairs Department referring- him to Works regulation so-and-so, and informing him that the work was within the province of the Home Affairs Department. In the  establishment  of rifle ranges we have arrived at <inline font-style="italic">m.</inline> almost comic opera position. </para>

                            <para>- I could mention a man who tried to do so and failed. I do not know whether <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> has tried, but I wish him luck if he does try to deal with the matter. A military rifle range is constructed by the Defence Department, but a rifle range for the use of rifle clubs is constructed by the Home Affairs Department. If a rifle club desires the establishment of a rifle range, they are supposed to look up a suitable spot in their district, and send an application for it to the Department of Defence. They may inform the Defence Department that Murphy's Paddock would be very suitable for the rifle range they require. The Defence Department sends up . an inspector, who reports as to whether a rifle range could be safely constructed there. If his report is favorable, the Defence Department requests the Home Affairs Department to construct a rifle range there. The Home Affairs Department then sends up an inspector to plot out the range. He may conclude that the spot chosen was not suitable for a rifle range, and may send in a recommendation that another spot should be selected, and the whole rigmarole has to be gone over again. If the two Departments agree as to the suitability of the site selected, the Home Affairs Department proceeds to construct the range. When it is finished, it has to be formally handed over to the Defence Department. That Department has to be satisfied that it complies with all the requirements, and if it does, the rifle club is then allowed to use it. When honorable senators hear of all this circumlocution, they can understand how it is that members of this Parliament receive so many letters complaining of delay in the establishment of rifle ranges. This arises solely from the fact that, although we have in the Defence Department an engineering staff quite competent to do the work, they are not allowed to do it. </para>

                            <para>- That is so. We have the same difficulty in evidence now at Westernport. We came to an agreement there that the Naval Branch should carry out works of a marine character, and the Home Affairs Department works of a land character. We had a vote on the Estimates for expenditure by the Defence Department, and we started to excavate the site for the buildings. If the Minister of Defence has any spare time, and I do not think he has much, he can peruse some interesting and lengthy memoranda which passed between the Departments as to whether or not the Defence Department had infringed the province of the Home Affairs Department in carrying out these excavations and levelling the site. I am not clear now that the Defence Department had a right to level the site, but we did it, and none of us was executed. Nothing fatal happened, though we may have broken regulation 67 or some other regulation. Although the Minister of Defence was correct in saying that some of the men who were discharged at Westernport were not suitable for the new work to be done, there are men engaged there by the Defence Department whose employment might be continued if the new works were pushed on with. There are labourers there, and a large amount of labouring work will require to be done when the new works are taken in hand. The whole thing has been hung up in this way. Another difficulty arises as to who Is to say what character of building is required for naval work - the Naval Branch or the Home Affairs Department. The authorities of the Naval Branch say, " We ought to know best what kind of work we want, and we have a right to submit to the Home Affairs </para>

                    <para class="block">Department the class of buildings we require." The authorities of the Home Affairs Department, on the other hand, say, " If you want accommodation for fifty men, tell us so, and we shall plan it out." The Naval Branch may say, " We want barracks of brick or of iron, or of one story or two stories," and they may have good reasons for what they propose, but the Home Affairs Department say, " We do all that. Tell us how many men you want to accommodate, or how many machines you want to put in, and we will arrange it." If the Minister of Defence looked into the matter, I should not be surprised if he found that the whole of the delay at Westernport is due to the fact that the Departments are quarrelling as to who should have the right to plot out certain buildings. </para>

                            <para>- I do not know that we can call it a quarrel, but each Department wants a place in the sun, and each is afraid that if it gives way its glory will be diminished. I wish to say that the Honorary Minister's statement, that the present Government are practically committed to these votes, is correct in one sense, but not in another. Honorable senators on the other side cannot escape the fact that during the elections, and subsequent to them, they accused the late Government of extravagance. We always challenged them to place their fingers upon particular items of extravagance in connexion with which they would reverse the policy of the late Government, but we could never get them to do that;, I can refer to particular items in the  schedule to this Bill which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen,</inline> when in Opposition, challenged time after time. He is now in a position to reverse the policy of the late Government in respect to these matters, and he must accept responsibility if he does not reverse it. There are, for instance, the military factories. It is quite opposed to the protestations qf honorable senators opposite that the Government should have their own factories. They could sell them to-morrow at a very substantial profit, and let the work out by contract. A large amount of expenditure is put down for the Naval and Military Colleges. These colleges are free under the policy of the late Government, but the present Government might make them reproductive by charging fees. If the present Government are against the policy of the late Government in these matters, let them show it by altering their Estimates accordingly. </para>

                            <para>- There is nothing easier. Businesses as big as the Clothing Factory change hands very frequently. There is a large expenditure included in the Estimates for providing accommodation and buildings for horses for the Field Artillery. That is due entirely to the policy of the late Government in acquiring horses for the Field Artillery. The present Government are not bound to carry out that policy. They can sell the horses, and go back to the old system of hired horses. I am not saying that they are in favour of having hired horses, but I am pointing out that these are things in connexion with which the late Government made departures which involved the Commonwealth in heavy expenditure, and, although the members of the present Government have gone round the country denouncing the expenditure of the late Government, they continue to carry it on now that they are in office themselves. These are the items which caused our Estimates to mount by leaps and bounds. I notice that an effort is now being made to make a side attack on our defence scheme by declaring that it is costing more than Lord Kitchener and  Colonel Legge  estimated. That is perfectly true, and these are the items upon which that excess expenditure, is being incurred. Lord Kitchener did not include in his estimate the establishment of a free Military College. He contemplated that each student would pay £8f&gt; a year. He did not anticipate that we should purchase our own horses and 'build, our own factories. </para>

In each of our Budgets, provision has been made for the purchase of horses and the erection of Naval and Military Colleges. These things were not provided for, either by Lord Kitchener or Colonel Legge. Lord Kitchener dealt only with the actual, maintenance of a defence force, and not with these things, which are incidental, to it. </para>

So far as Cockburn Sound is concerned, the Government have that data. But they have not got it in regard to other places. Take Jervis Bay as an illustration.

I venture to say that he has no material at all bearing upon these points. </para><interjection>

                            <para>- Whilst the Fisher Government were in office, I made inquiries from the Naval Board in regard to establishing a dockyard there, and I know that they had not the desired information then. If they have obtained it since, they have been remarkably expeditious; they have secured it with a very small staff and with great secrecy. Does the Minister of Defence know that the very firm with which <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Maurice</inline> Fitzmaurice is associated, when called upon to report upon the making of a harbor at Fremantle in  1891,  was engaged for more than  a  year prior to submitting their report in making tidal observations? I do not think that any tidal observations have been made at Jervis Bay. What is <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Maurice</inline> Fitzmaurice going to report upon' at Jervis Bay? The Government, in including Jervis Bay in the list of places upon which he is to report, have probably something in view in the direction of ultimately establishing a dockyard there. If they have, then I venture to say that the report of <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Maurice</inline> Fitzmaurice cannot touch it. </para>

                    </quote><para class="block">The late Government came in for some severe criticism in respect of the Henderson Base at Cockburn Sound. We had a staff of 140 or 150 men engaged for months there in obtaining the desired information by means of borings, soundings, tidal observations, &amp;c. The work cost about £20,000. If Admiral Henderson's scheme be carried out, Port Stephens will be of just as much importance as is Westernport. Yet the staff which has been employed there consists of only four or five surveyors. I do not think that any boring has been done there yet. If this data is necessary in the case of Cockburn Sound, surely it is just as necessary in the case of Port Stephens. </para><interjection>

No statement on the subject was ever published in the press here, nor was a statement made in Parliament. So far as the press of Melbourne and the Parliament were concerned, it was absolutely a secret expedition. It was from a chance paragraph in the Western Australian press that we learned that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Ramsbotham</inline> had been instructed to carry out that work. That being so, we naturally asked that we should be allowed to see his report, and that opportunity has been provided by the House of Representatives.

                            <para>- Nor would the honorable senator say that we ought to have put up the workshops before we did the exploratory work. I venture to say that when he read that paragraph it must have very seriously discounted the value of the report, and led him to wonder whether he had sent the right man to report. The report contains one or two interesting things, which I propose to quote. I find that the total expenditure has been £23,575. A charge has been levelled against me, not by the Minister, but by others, that I pushed on the works for a special purpose. It was said that I was anxious to influence the Fremantle election; that I rushed on the works in order to get a large number of men at Fremantle, so that they could vote there against <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hedges.</inline></para>

I should think that, with that knowledge in our possession, we would be rather cautions, and the engineer of any Department, if he had any sense, would be very cautious to thoroughly probe the strata below, especially when it is generally known that it is the same as the limestone strata through which £200,000 of public money tumbled, leading to the abandonment of the dock scheme. </para><para>Existing offices and shops. - These are of a temporary nature, and unsuitable for carrying on the construction of large public* works such as are contemplated.

                        <para>Public works are being held up because of it. The Opposition knows that quite well. The whole of the public works are held up till all these Estimates are passed. The rule has been to treat these matters as urgent. As soon as the Budget has been delivered it has been the custom for many years past to proceed immediately with the works proposed, and put them through. Four months of the financial year have already gone, and there is no sign of these matters going through. </para>
                    </quote><para>Is any Minister in this Senate prepared to say that the whole of the public works of the Commonwealth are held up until these Estimates go through? Is there anything to prevent Ministers from going on with public works? He knows that there is not. I am surprised that the Prime Minister should go about the country making statements which are entirely incorrect and beside the mark. Any other observations which I have to make I can reserve for the Committee stage. I may say, in conclusion, that I hope that the money that is voted by Parliament under this measure will bo spent, and that the works will be carried through. I think that there is an unfortunate tendency on the part of Departments to hang fire with works in the early part of the financial year, and then to have a terrible rush towards the end of the year to get the money spent. That leads to a good deal of friction and to waste of money. I trust that the votes set out here will be spent, and that the works will be pushed through as expeditiously as possible. </para></speech>

                            <para>- As I cannot castigate the Government on this occasion, I shall have to find some other opportunity of doing so, and shall devote two or three minutes to castigating my own side. I take the opportunity of expressing my sentiments on a point which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> has brought up with regard to a borrowing policy.  His  observations seemed to meet with approval from some honorable senators on both sides, as far as they applied to works of the character indicated under many of the items of this Bill. I trust that no such policy will be adopted. I should like to see a complete line of demarcation drawn between those who are content to build up a borrowing policy in Australia and those who are determined to set their faces absolutely and resolutely against anything of the kind. I contend that there would be no justification whatever for the Labour party claiming that it is against borrowing for defence purposes if it is willing to borrow for any other purpose. Say that a man has an income of £500 a year, and finds it necessary to spend more than that in order to carry on as he desires. Suppose that he says, " Under no circumstances will I ever get into debt for bread, meat, and clothes, but I will float a loan in order that I may have money to spend on my personal amusements, my luxuries, and the education of my children." I say that it is absolutely immaterial whether the man pays cash to the butcher and the baker and borrows for the education of his family and his" own pleasures, or whether he pays cash for education and pleasures and borrows to pay his butcher's bill. In any case he has spent more than he has earned. In other words, his expenditure has exceeded his revenue, and he has made up the deficiency by borrowing. I hold that it is purely farcical to pretend that we are paying cash for defence if we are going to borrow money for other purposes involving other Departments. The party in Great Britain which has been noted for reducing the public indebtedness has been the Liberal party, whilst, for many years past, the Conservative party has been inclined to increase the national indebtedness. The policy of Liberal finance, from the time of Peel and Gladstone down to Liberal Ministries in our own time, has been to reduce the national debt, although increasingly larger commitments for naval and military purposes have had to be met. If they had adopted the policy of saying, " We will always pay cash for naval and military services, but will borrow for other expenditure," they would have no case at all. They recognised that. Their idea of economy was to reduce the public debt continually. When any comparison is made between British and Colonial expenditure, it is said that the national debt of Great Britain was accumulated by war expenditure, but that, on the other hand, we had spent borrowed money on railways and developmental works; so that we have assets to show for our expenditure, whereas Great Britain has not. But, on the other hand, we must recognise that these public assets of ours, these State enterprises which are supposed to return a profit, are not fixed and invariable assets in the -sense of being always worth what they cost us. Side by side with the growth of development in modern countries under civilized conditions there is a continual necessity to adopt new inventions. Consequently, assets upon which borrowed money has been spent tend to depreciate. The result is that the idea of handing down to posterity the burdens that we are incurring, on the ground that we hand them down assets also, is largely fallacious. Many of these so-called assets will be on the scrap-heap before posterity will have a chance of coming into possession of them. </para>

                            <para>- It is, but that is no excuse for handing burdens on to posterity when we do not know, and it is impossible for any individual to tell, the value which will attach to the assets which we hand over as a return for the borrowed money. Take the case of wireless telegraphy. We can easily imagine that cables will go down in value; possibly, telegraph lines also. Every improvement tends to render less valuable the assets upon which we have spent our money. I wish also to point out the fallacy of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce's</inline> argument in his comparison of public with private finance. He says that a man often finds it advantageous to invest borrowed money for one purpose while he is paying cash for another. Well and good ; but that is because an individual wants to amass wealth or increase his worldly possessions, and enters into purely speculative means of raising money. If he can borrow money at  5  or  6  per cent., and sees a prospect of making  10  or  12  per cent, by so doing, that is a good investment. But that is in no way analogous for the operations of  a  Government acting for the community. We do not, as a general rule, go in for purely speculative expenditure. But take the analogy as far as it will apply to an individual and to the State. What does an average man do in this or any other new country who acquires a farm which has to be developed by his own labour and expenditure ? He devotes the greater <inline font-style="italic">p&amp;vt</inline> °f his life *° gating that place in working order, in order that he may leave it to his posterity free from encumbrances. Though we may consider that in some cases people who deny themselves and their families many of the requirements of life in order to do that overdo things to a certain extent, we all admit that that constitutes what we are accustomed to call good citizenship. We applaud a man who devotes his energy and resources to the development of his property, and to doing all that may be necessary to leave it free of all encumbrance to those dependent upon him. Yet we are asked to believe that it is the summit of wisdom on the part of the State to lay burdens on the future Australian citizens, and that the great and noble edifice we are building up here should be built up at the expense of posterity. We have often been told that, as posterity had done nothing for us, we should not go out of our way to do anything for them, but I contend that, as we have to a large extent benefited by the industry, energy, and talents of previous generations, our noblest aim should be to hand down to our posterity, not a legacy of debt, but a lighter burden than ours has been, so that they may have a better time generally. Politicians of every school almost entirely ignore the fact that, while we do build up material assets, to some extent we destroy the natural  asset3  with which the country we inhabit is endowed. </para>

                            <para>- Very well; I shall circumscribe my remaining remarks. I say that we have a right to consider that in building up these material assets there are two aspects from which the matter must be viewed. First of all, they cannot by any means be set down at their face value, as even if maintained in working order their value is depreciated to an enormous extent by their displacement by more up-to-date inventions to effect the same purpose in a better manner, and by the destruction of the natural assets with  which the country is endowed. When we are urged to rapidly develop the country at the expense of posterity, I say that I should prefer that its development should proceed more slowly on more honest lines. No party shall ever commit me, under any circumstances, to support a borrowing policy for the Commonwealth. I am opposed to it, not only for the reasons I have already advanced in a hurried manner, but also because I say that by adopting it we should be building up the fortunes of a few at the expense of the many. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Clemons,</inline> I think, referred to the fact that it is impossible for us to rely upon our revenue increasing in the future in the same ratio as it has done in the past. He gave as a reason the probable curtailment of borrowing by the different States, which in the past has undoubtedly helped, directly and indirectly, to swell our revenue from Customs. If we are not to have in the future relatively as large a revenue as we have had in the past to meet the requirements of public expenditure, it is clear to me that we must supplement our revenue by taxation. </para>

In my view, all the talk about the land tax only amounts to an admission that we have initiated a good scheme. There is reason for disputing the claims we make in regard to it, because we had not the sense to make it very much greater than it now is. We failed to rise to the opportunity afforded us in neglecting to make the tax infinitely more heavy than we did. </para>

                            <para>- Then I have no right to complain. I cannot yet expect more than is given to a Minister. We must realize that our public works expenditure depends on the revenue available, and if we are not to raise revenue by taxation, the only alternatives are that we should borrow or should curtail our public works. I contend that what we raise by way of loan does not permanently make us any better off, because our interest bill is continually mounting up. The various States comprising the Commonwealth have up to now incurred an indebtedness by borrowing . £300,000,000, and it is my intention, whenever the opportunity offers, to make a protest against the Commonwealth adding another to the list of borrowers. I am for the spot cash system all the time. It seems that we are in clanger of a falling-off in our Customs revenue, and I say that we should meet that by increasing the taxation of wealth. I shall always oppose every increase in the number of the idle class who live on' the interest of borrowed money, which we use as it is used in other countries for the purpose, on the one hand, of increasing the value of the estates of those who already possess wealth, »and of enabling them to avoid taxation on the other. I say that a borrowing policy is entered upon merely for the purpose of enabling those who can now afford to pay taxation, and who will benefit chiefly by public expenditure, to dodge their responsibilities, and to pass them on to their helpless posterity. </para>

It would be better to pay rent for the use of State property if we must use it. If a State should take offence at something done by the Commonwealth authorities, or wish to adjust its own business, we might be told to go, and be in the position of evicted tenants. </para>

I have now ascertained that since its inception the Justices of the High Court have occupied their present premises free of charge. The Government have agreed that this money shall be spent upon additions to the existing accommodation, and, in return, they are to obtain a ten-years' lease of the present buildings, with these additional offices, free of charge, with a probable renewal of the lease at the end of the term. </para>

Is lie to have entire control of the works at the Federal Capital, or is he to be merely responsible for the planning of the city ? I would point out that we have a Works Department, which has a complete staff. For instance, we have a Director-General of Works, who is responsible for the carrying out of all plans. Is <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Griffin</inline> to supersede the Director-General of Works in that regard, or is he merely to be the designer of the city and buildings? Is it proposed, for instance, that 'he shall design the Parliament House, or is that work to be done by the Department, or is it to be thrown open to competition? </para>

                        <para>. - I listened with attention to the enumeration of the duties of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Griffin,</inline> and I find that a very large amount of detailed work is involved, that is, after he has made up his mind that, in certain directions, he will require some assistance to carry them out, and to furnish the plans and designs to be operated on. Where is that assistance to come from ? Is he to have the services of the draughtsmen and other officers already in the Home Affairs Department, or is he to have the selection of a new staff, principally for his own purposes ? The amount which is to be given to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Griffin</inline> for his services I do not consider excessive, but if he is to be surrounded by a host of new officers to carry out his plans and designs, that will involve a considerable expense, while the officers already in the service of the Commonwealth will have much less to do than they would have if they had to carry out all that work. </para>

                        <para>.- I do not wish to resurrect the question of the Federal Capital, but I cannot give a silent vote on the amount which is allocated in these Estimates towards the cost of its establishment. I am speaking in a non-party manner. In my opinion, that is too large a sum to vote on these Estimates. I feel sure that some honorable senators on the other side concur in that opinion, because I have a very vivid recollection of reading in the daily press, prior to the 31st May, that the Labour Government were abused on many platforms for the so-called lavish expenditure and waste of public money on the Federal Capital. It was called a " bush " Capital, a "desert" Capital, and other abusive names. If it was wrong for the Labour Government to spend about £147,000 last year, it must be doubly wrong for the present Government to expend this year £285,000. I protest against the expenditure of such a large sum, because I think that the time is not ripe for launching out on that lavish scale. </para>

                            <para>- In Melbourne - the hub of the universe. I rose to object to the expenditure of £285,000 this year, because I think there is a certain amount of hypocrisy on the part of some members of this Parliament, and some members of the present Government, in voting for the expenditure of £285,000, seeing that they bitterly opposed the expenditure last year of a sum , not approaching that amount. I do not wish to speak in a parochial spirit. I am not opposed to the Canberra site at the present time, although I was opposed to it when it was undergoing the fire of selection. I recognise that the Parliament has decided - and, in my opinion, the question has been settled for all time - that the Capital shall be established at Canberra, but I sincerely believe that £285,000 is too much to expend this year. </para>

                        <para>. - I find no fault with the amount set down in these Estimates for the works necessary for building the Capital. I recognise that the people of Australia entered into a compact, when they voted for the Constitution Bill, that there should be a Capital for the Commonwealth, and that it should be in New South Wales. This Parliament, in its wisdom, decided on a certain place for the Capita], and if it has come to the opinion that the site is a suitable one, and that a Capital is an essential to the Commonwealth, I believe in a city being built as speedily as possible. I do not agree with some people in different parts of Australia that it is an unbusiness-like proposition. If a company were floated to-morrow on the Stock Exchange, and it was put forward as a business proposition, I would put my last shilling into the proposition, because I realize that it would be a highly profitable enterprise within a very short period. We must not forget that we obtained an immense area of Crown lands from New South Wales. We must not blind ourselves, either, to the fact that, as soon as the building of the Capital is proceeded with, and Government establishments are erected, there will be a fairly large population there, and that immediately the land values will rise. There will be a demand on the part of different folk to embark in businesses. With the increase in population, the erection of the buildings, and the fact that Parliament will assemble there, a very substantial revenue will be derived from the leasehold lands, and the longer we delay building the Capital, the longer we shall deny ourselves a substantial source of revenue. That is by the way. I want to be absolutely clear on this point: That <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Griffin</inline> is to be solely responsible for the laying-out and planning of the Capital. I want to be clear, also, as to whether he is to be intrusted wholly with the architectural designing of all the Government buildings, and that the Government are not going to give an opportunity to any Australian architect in respect of any of the buildings which are to be erected. If that is the purport of the agreement, we ought to know it. I have not one word to say about <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Griffin.</inline> I believe that his qualifications are excellent, and that he is a man with a wide range of experience. We all know that he won the first prize for a design of the Capital. At the same time, I think that there are in Australia a number of architects highly qualified to do some of the work that will be required in connexion with the city. As an  Australian, I am not narrow or restricted in my vision in the least; I am essentially a cosmopolitan. At the same time, I believe that there are Australians who know Australian conditions, and the tastes and desires of the people, who are as well qualified to do some of the work as is <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Griffin.</inline> I wish to know whether they are to be denied an opportunity of doing any of the work that has been laid down for that gentleman ? </para>

                        <para>. - Personally, I think it was a very good idea that the winner of the first prize design for the Federal Capital should be invited to place his services at the disposal of the Commonwealth Government. As soon as he won the prize, I thought it would be a good thing to invite him to visit Australia, because I do not think the ablest man in the universe could do such effective work on what may be termed hearsay evidence as he could do by actually seeing the country and its surroundings. I wish to emphasize the excellent sentiments expressed by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley</inline> in regard to the expenditure on this "bush " Capital. When we use that term we must remember that nearly all the Capitals of Australia were in the bush less than a century ago. I would rather find fault with the fact that we are not pushing forward rapidly enough. Instead of spending £285,000, I should have preferred to see £500,000 spent, not merely because the Capital is in my own State, but because I recognise that, having once fixed upon a site, the sooner we lay out sufficient money to make the place habitable for the purposes for which it is intended the sooner we can hope to get back revenue. For this reason it will be good business to spend even more money than is placed on the Estimates. </para>

                            <para>- I do not believe in spending loan money. As I have said before, whether you borrow for one thing or another, the effect is just the same. I wish to know how this money is proposed to be spent. Is the whole £285,000 for the actual purposes of the Capital, or is a portion of it intended to pay for land resumptions within the area? There is a considerable amount of privately owned land, some of which has been resumed. Various holders of land are clamouring - and justifiably so - to know what the Government are going to do. The sooner the whole of the privately owned land in the area is resumed the better. At present, a land-holder cannot use his land as he would do under ordinary circumstances, because he does not know what the Government are going to do with it. These men are in an unsettled condition. They do not know where they are. I should like to know whether the </para>

The owners are entitled to know, not merely whether a portion of the £285,000 is meant for resumption purposes, hut whether the Government intend to pursue a definite policy with regard to the whole of the resumptions. I should also like to know whether this money is mainly to provide a water supply from the Cotter River, or whether it is intended to road the place ? We should have some detailed information. I do not mean that we should have the expenditure itemized, but we should know generally what is to be done. <inline font-style="italic">X</inline> should also like to inquire whether it is the intention of the Government to provide for those persons who live in the Territory not continuing to be in the position of Chinese or other aliens, or whether voting power is to be given to them ? </para>

                            <para>- If my honorable friend regards my remark as a reflection on him, I most willingly withdraw it. I do not intend to put forward any arguments as to why this vote should be reduced. The main question having been decided, I am a convert to the idea of establishing the Federal Capital as soon as possible. The sooner this Parliament gets up to Canberra the better for Australia, even if at the beginning we have, as <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. O'Malley</inline> suggested, to live in tents. I congratulate the Government on their conversion to the principle laid down by the previous Administration - that the land within the Capital area should all be leasehold. It is pretty well understood that the policy initiated by the Fisher Government is to be strictly adhered to. </para>

                            <para>- It is a remarkable fact that the Government have recognised that the only statesmanlike way of dealing with a vast territory such as we have at Canberra is on the leasehold principle. Many honorable senators representing various States support this expenditure for no other reason than that they believe that this system of taking the unearned increment for the people will make the Capital a payable proposition within a few years of its inauguration. The rise in rental values will be such that it will finance the great bulk of our undertakings. </para>

He also wished to introduce a costing system, by which the officers in charge of various works could tell fairly accurately what each building cost to erect. It came under my own notice that workmen engaged at Williamstown had not even to fill in time-sheets. There was a happy-go-lucky style of going to work. Painting work was charged to carpentering, and so forth. I brought the matter under the notice of the Minister of Home Affairs, and it was promptly remedied. I understand that it is the common practice not to have specifications, and that there is no costing system. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> has alluded to the muddle that exists, the result of which is that work is being held up. </para>

                        <para>. - <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Rae</inline> wishes to know how this money is to be spent, and I may inform him that none of it will be spent on the resumption of land. Before the actual building of the Capital can be proceeded with, a great deal of preliminary work requires to be done. We have to provide power for the various machinery which will be used there. In the next place, we require to make provision for roads. Then a water supply must be provided, and we have next to provide for electric lighting. I have here details covering the expenditure of every £1 of this vote, which honorable members are at liberty to see. Money is to be spent on: - Buildings - administrative offices, Administrator's residence, quarters No. 7, Commonwealth Bank, bank manager's quarters, temporary hospital, post-office, provision for workmen's location. Power plant and power house - power house and accessories, coal storage, erection boiler-house plant, engine-room plant, alternator. Electric supply - transmission lines and electric pump, mains and electric pump. Roads and transport - Acton-road and bridge, road development generally, Murrumbidgee bridge, rock crushers, traction engine, railway from Canberra to Queanbeyan, road Cotter River. Water supply - Acton water supply, dam and reservoir Cotter River, tunnel from reservoir to pump, service reservoir, Red Hill, pipe head reservoir, cast-iron pipe mains and pumping plant. Sewerage - Acton sewerage, main sewer from city boundary, storm-water sewers. Materials and stores - brickworks, purchase of timber for seasoning, quarrying development and Tharwa quarry, manufacture of cement, building for stores, workshops and plant, materials for stock. Running expenses and miscellaneous. Health, administration, education, engineers, draftsmen, and others. Afforestation and surveys. With regard to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ready's</inline> remarks, it is unlikely that, under the present management, any building will be erected at the Federal Capital without proper plans and specifications. The fact that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Griffin</inline> is to supervise the erection of all the larger buildings is a guarantee that proper specifications will be prepared. I shall bring what the honorable senator has said forcibly under the notice of those who will have charge of this expenditure. </para>

I wish to know now if <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Griffin</inline> is to have the right to perfect his own plan, or is to follow the composite plan prepared by the Committee I refer to. There has been a good deal of expenditure in connexion with the appointment of the Committee to meet travelling expenses alone, and I should like to know whether all their work is to go for nothing. </para>

It was somewhat difficult to say how far Mr.Griffin's ideas were being followed. There was considerable 'confusion, and it was thought better, if the city was to be erected on right lines, to bring <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Griffin</inline> to Australia. Since he has been here he has been in constant communication with the Committee appointed by the late Government to consider the best plans for the Capital. Various points were in dispute, but the local experience of the Committee has been added to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Griffin's</inline> knowledge of the original plan, and I believe that an understanding has now been arrived at as to how the work is to be done. </para>

                        <para>.- I believe that I am right in saying that the major portion of the works now being carried out at Canberra is being carried on under the day-labour system. The late Government provided the necessary plant and equipment for that purpose. Some of the members of the present Government have stated publicly that it is their intention to abolish the day-labour system, and to introduce the contract system. I should like to know whether, in the expenditure of this money, it is the intention of the Government to replace the day-labour system by the contract system, and, if so, whether they propose to sell, lock, stock, and barrel, all the equipment which was acquired by the late Government, in order that the day-labour system might be adopted at Canberra ? </para>

                        <para>. - I was somewhat astonished to hear the order in which, according to the Vice-President of the Executive Council, the works are to be undertaken at the Federal Capital. According to the only record that we have of the creation of the universe in the English language, a start was made with the words " Let there be light," and it struck me that if the Government intend to make provision for light at the Capital as the last of the works to be undertaken, working in darkness, we cannot expect that they will make very much speed. I have not been to Canberra since the formal ceremony of naming the Capital, but I understand that the late Government provided for the manufacture of bricks for use in the building of the city, and that, comparatively recently, they were seeking to find material from which cement might be manufactured in the neighbourhood of the site. I should like to know whether the provision made for the manufacture of bricks has been so far completed that bricks are now being turned out at Canberra? I should like to know, also, whether the works are to be gone on with, or the present Government intend to reverse the methods adopted by the previous Government ? I do not suppose that they would do so without due consideration, or without taking Parliament into their confidence. It is difficult to draw the line between what are and what are not preliminary works, but I should like to know if it is contemplated that all the preliminary works necessary can be done by this vote of £285,000? If my ideas were carried out, we should commence the work of building the Federal Parliament House as soon as we know where the actual city is to be, so that as soon as possible we could all be on the spot and in direct touch with the operations carried out at the Capital. If that were necessary, I should prefer that even the erection of a temporary Parliament House should be begun as soon as possible, so that members of this Parliament might be able to exercise, not an officious interference, but an intimate supervision in connexion with what is being done. The sooner the Federal Parliament is established at the Capital, even though it should be in temporary premises, the sooner we may expect the influx of population which will make it a valuable asset, and facilitate its settlement. </para>

                        <para>. - A question has been raised as to the attitude of the Government in the matter of constructing public works by day labour. The position of the Government has been made 'abundantly clear. They do not possess the whole-hearted faith in the day-labour system which animates my honorable friends on the other side of the chamber, but it would be ridiculous on that account to say that they must necessarily carry on every public work by contract. Even my honorable friends opposite, who are very much given to wobbling in their political faith, whilst professing a whole-hearted belief in the day-labour system, frequently when in power resorted to the contract system. When we are dealing with works which have already been commenced under the day-labour system, and for which a plant has been provided and a staff assembled, and especially works in connexion with which, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ready</inline> has said, complete specifications have not been provided, it is impossible for us to step in and substitute the contract for the day-labour system. I find that as at the Federal Capital there are some works in progress for my own Department, for which a plant has been provided and the staff assembled. We should be wanting in regard for the interests of the workmen at present engaged in the work if we set them and the plant aside in order to give effect to our views on the contract system. </para>

                            <para>- I am endeavouring to make clear the attitude which the Government take up. We have a preference for the contract system, but we are not therefore going to tear up all the work- that has been done, throw a plant idle, put men out of employment, and thus bring about an interregnum until we can get contractors to undertake that work. But in all future undertakings the Government will, as far as possible, have resort to the contract system. </para>

The honorable gentleman has said that he does not like to interfere with existing arrangements. Will he give us his assurance that in all new undertakings on behalf of the Commonwealth, the day-labour system will be abolished, and the contract system substituted ? </para>

A good deal of material has been left over from that building. In such a case it would be absurd to turn round and call for tenders for the erection of these complementary buildings. The same policy will be followed by the Government in respect of other undertakings. </para>

I fought it vigorously, because I did not regard the site as the best available one. Now, as the result of the deliberate vote of the Vice-President of the Executive Council, it is proposed to expend £285,000 upon that site. I have recently returned from a keenly-contested election campaign, and on every conceivable occasion - after having voted for the selection of this site - <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McColl</inline> has urged that we should refrain from spending money on Yass-Canberra. He declared his belief that the time is inopportune to incur such expenditure. Yet we are now asked to vote £285,000 for the purpose of undertaking certain works at the Federal Capital. </para>

                            <para>- Yes. To-day the Honorary Minister very ably pointed out that, in his opinion, our revenue had reached the high-water mark. Judging by the way in which his remarks were received, I take it that that is the consensus of opinion in this Chamber. What I really think we ought to know in connexion with this matter is where we are going, and to what will the expenditure of this £285,000 commit us ? Probably it will commit the next Government to an expenditure of many millions upon the Federal Capital. Will it commit us to an expenditure from time to time of £200,000, £300,000, £400,000, or £500,000? We ought to have some explanation of it from the Vice-President of the Executive Council, who, during the recent election campaign, practically preached throughout the country that the late Government were extravagant, and that one feature of their extravagance was their expenditure upon the Federal Capital. If the late Minister of Home Affairs was guilty of extravagance by spending £147,000 upon the Capital, surely the present Government must be extremely extravagant, seeing that they propose to spend £285,000 upon the same project. If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Clemons</inline> be right in his prophecy that our revenue has now reached high-water mark, we shall either have to continue to spend money upon the Capital because we are committed to it, or we shall have to abandon the work of building the city, or borrow money for the purpose. </para>

It is certainly significant that, after all his denunciation of the Federal Capital, and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. O'Malley's</inline> expenditure upon it, he should submit for our consideration an item which doubles that expenditure. I shall vote for the item, because I do not wish to be regarded as taking up a parochial attitude on this matter. But at an early opportunity we should be given a reasonable idea of the extent to which we are committing this Parliament to expenditure there. I am prepared to vote for the expenditure of any reasonable sum, because I believe that the work should be proceeded with. If we continue to expend £300,000 a year for twenty years, we shall simply be wasting the money if the works constructed are permitted to lie idle. But I believe that the day is not far distant when the Federal Capital will be more than self-supporting. If that be so, we ought to have a settled policy as to whether the Capital is to be constructed in five or ten years, and not merely spend from time to time a small sum on the works, and then allow the expenditure to remain idle, earning nothing, practically, for a considerable number of years. </para>

                            <para>- I am not particular about that. What I want to see is a definite policy. If there is a chance that by opening up the Capital in five years it may become revenue-producing I am prepared to support the expenditure. I am not even going to say that I would not support to that extent a borrowing policy, because I believe that the Commonwealth will get a wonderfully good asset there. I think it is a waste of time to play with the question by merely, from time to time, throwing a certain amount of money, so to speak, into the sea. I do hope that at the earliest possible opportunity we shall have a definite announcement as to when the Government expect to have the Capital constructed and ready for Parliament to meet in, and what our total commitments are likely to be. </para>

                            <para>- I am not going to let the item go, because my honorable friend may take a wrong view of what I intend to say. My object is to test the policy of the Government on the question of day labour labour <inline font-style="italic">versus</inline> the contract system. I was one of those in the Senate who strongly opposed the building of the Federal Capital at Yass-Canberra. We had a strenuous fight on two or three occasions, and as one of the vanquished, I admitted that as the National Parliament had determined to build the Capital at Canberra, I would assist its erection in every possible way. It is one of the most important undertakings on which the Commonwealth has ever ventured. The Liberal party, in season and out of season, have said that day labour was a wrong system, and that if they were returned to power they would carry out all works by the contract system. As a matter of fact, there is an announcement to that effect in the policy statement with which they met this Parliament. This afternoon several questions were put to the Leader of the Senate, but on neither occasion was a definite statement made as to the intention of the Government. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> has said that in some instances day labour is good, but in other instances it is bad. The inference to be drawn from his remarks is that in some cases contract labour is good, and in other cases it is bad. I want to challenge the Ministry on a principle of theirs. I do not think that any member of the Ministry, or any member of the party supporting them, can get away from the fact that it was their avowed principle to abolish day labour in connexion with all Commonwealth undertakings, and to substitute the contract system. As we are going to build a Capital which, I believe, will be a credit to Australia, and as the Fisher Ministry commenced the work with the system that they avowed and applauded - the day-labour system - I am submitting this amendment to test the sincerity of the Government. The Capital, I contend, can be built under the day-labour system, and I think that it ought to be so built. The replies of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> this afternoon indicate that the Government, per medium of administration, intend to abolish the system of day labour in building the Capita] if they can. We have to realize that we are getting near the end of a session. I dare say that the Ministry will get into recess; they would like to get there, and are doing their best to that end. Nothing that may happen will probably prevent them from realizing their desire. During the recess they will be- able to do anything they like under cover of administration. The Prime Minister has said, time and again, that, as regards legislation, he was hampered by the position in another place, but he was glad to say that, in the Departments, Ministers had full control. Here is an opportunity for us to test the sincerity of the Government on a principle. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley</inline> has interjected that this is not the item on which to raise the issue, but I submit that it is. I say, advisedly, that if there is going to be built a city that will do credit to Australia it can be built under the day-labour system. As the erection of the Capital was commenced under that principle, I contend that it can be continued and completed in the same way. If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> had been more definite in his replies to questions this afternoon I might not have submitted this amendment. I ask my honorable friends to assist me to carry the proposed reduction, because it is idle for honorable gentlemen who occupy responsible positions to get on the platforms and tell the electors that they are in favour of a certain principle to which they pledged themselves unless they carry out that principle when they are in power. </para>

                            <para>- I admit that the Government are in office, and not in power, so far as legislation is concerned. But if they get into recess they will be in office and in power,-- and it is during that period that the damage will be done. No matter what attempt may be made it is quite evident that Ministers intend to cling to their positions in order to reach the haven of recess. If ever there was an opportune time to test the principle of day labour it is in connexion with the construction of the city. A Labour Ministry carried out a number of great undertakings in consonance with the principle of day labour as against the contract system. They started the great undertaking of building the Capital under that principle. Are the present Ministry going to depart from that policy? I think they are. The replies of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> this afternoon indicate they will do <inline font-style="italic">so.</inline> once they get into the safe haven of recess. He would not make a direct statement, because he knows his position while Parliament is in session, but once it is in recess the Government will use their administrative power to carry out their principle behind the back of Parliament. </para>

                        <para>. - I do not think it was quite fair on the part of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Needham</inline> to raise this issue on the item for the Federal Capital. It is quite dear to everybody that the two parties here differ, and differ radically, on the question of day labour versus, contract system. We, on this side, have taken up precisely the same attitude with regard to the contract system as the members of the Opposition have taken up with regard to the other system. Between us, therefore, on a matter of principle,. I am afraid that there is a hopeless gulf, and I do not suppose that either of us can change our view. If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Needham</inline> chose there is practically not one item in the Schedule which he could not have attacked in a similar way. I do not think it was fair on his part to single out the item for the Federal Capital. More than once he used the phrase " get into recess." That gives me an opportunity to say that I cordially agree with the remarks of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Russell</inline> about the more than desirability, practically the necessity, for this Government, or, for that matter, any other Government, to formally enunciate a definite scheme with regard to .the building of the Capital. I agree with the honorable senator that we ought not to go on voting year by year, varying sums, that the time has come, even if it had not come before, when we ought to be able to say, "Here is our scheme; it involves an expenditure of so much money; we intend to expend the money over a certain period." I venture to say, on behalf of the Government, that if we do get into recess we will certainly give to that point very earnest consideration, and I think I may give my assurance that if the Government meet Parliament next session we will, with regard to the building of the Capital, come forward with a definite statement as to what we mean. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Needham</inline> knows that the matter is fixed and certain, as far as we are concerned. I hope that it is irremovable. I trust that he will recognise the position, and will not do anything to sacrifice this expenditure, which must, at any rate, go on for the present. </para>

                        <para>. - With regard to the question of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Rae</inline> with respect to bricks, I may say that a good deal of experimental work has been going on with the object of finding good brick-making material. At last some has been found, and excellent bricks can be made. Hitherto we have been working with open kilns, but we are going to put up Hoffman kilns, at a cost of about £30,000. The amount required this year is £10,327, and £3,327 has already been spent. The kilns will admit of tile-making as well as brick-making. I should like to point out, with regard to the whole subject, that it would no doubt be desirable to give an estimate of expenditure, but it is impossible for me to do so now. It will be wise to lay down a system of expenditure for the future. These are practically all items preliminary to the construction of the Capital itself. Certain buildings have to go up, such as administrative quarters, power plant, a dam across the Cotter River for water supply purposes, sewerage, and other matters. </para>

                        <para>The estimated cost of cement works for a. 50,000-barrel (per annum) plant is £40,000. The expenditure is not likely to exceed , £10,000, because the machinery will take over a year to install. Not much of the plant can be expected for delivery before next June. Geological report by Pittman, Government Geologist, New South Wales ; and Mahoney, Melbourne University; and Griffith Taylor. Limestock rocks sampled and analyzed. Shales also analyzed by Department of Mines, Victoria. Portland cement then manufactured therefrom in experimental furnaces. Results give high efficiency tests. Gibson (consulting engineer, cement manufacture) advises 50,000-barrel plant. Estimated consumption of Portland cement within ten years, 560,000 barrels. Estimated cost of cement at works, 10s. 3d. per barrel (six barrels to ton), after providing sinking fund and interest to write off capital cost in ten years. Present price of cement at Queanbeyan, 14s. 6d. per ton. Saving on 560,000 barrels , £112,000. </para>

                        <para>. - As to the vote for lighthouses, I point out that the sum seems to be small, considering that we have taken over lighthouses. Last year the amount on the Estimates was merely for work already taken in hand by the States. Since that time we have had a report by Commander Brewis, who has recommended a large number of new lights. As the amount proposed is just the same as last year's vote, it cannot include any money for the new lights. A Director of Lighthouses has been appointed, at a salary of £1,000 a year. I should like to know whether the Government intend to act on Commander Brewis' report, or whether this sum simply provides for ordinary maintenance ? </para>

                        <para>. - I have a serious matter to mention connected with the lighthouse business. Can the Minister tell us whether improvements are contemplated in the service as regards the treatment of the officials who look after the lights ? I have had personal knowledge of some of those engaged as lighthouse-keepers, and I know that the conditions existing in some States are simply scandalous. In the first place, I contend that these men are not paid well enough. Secondly, they are labouring under serious disabilities. Lighthouses which are off the mainland are frequently difficult of approach on account of there being no haven. The men are compelled to pay heavy fares to get away for holidays, and they suffer from serious inconveniences with respect to educational facilities for their children, and in being removed from one lighthouse to another. Instead of a common-sense course being adopted to provide furnished dwellings, the lighthouse-keepers have to take their furniture from one place to another. It is knocked about, and frequently destroyed, by the primitive means available for landing at these places. Very frequently they have to get their supplies of perishable products, such as vegetables and potatoes, in the most haphazard way, and these are sometimes partially or wholly destroyed without any compensation being given to the lighthouse-keepers. I have said that they have to pay excessive fares for being taken to and from their lighthouses, and I know of one case in which a man allowed his leave to accumulate for a term of years, because if he had taken his holidays when they were due he would not have had the means to enjoy them in view of the cost of removing himself and his family from the lighthouse. It will not be possible to entirely avoid some of these inconveniences, because of the places on which some of our lighthouses are erected, but well-considered measures should be taken to provide adequate payment, and the most liberal conditions possible for those engaged in this arduous and trying occupation. Some people imagine that lighthouse-keepers have little to do beyond keeping their watch, but in some cases the lighthouses are undermanned, and in painting the structures and constantly cleaning the windows those in charge of them are kept constantly busy. There are so many disabilities attaching to the occupation that it is not surprising to hear that some of the best men are unwilling to continue in the position of lighthouse-keepers, and there are complaints also of favoritism in connexion with appointments made in the service. The low wages of all but the top-rank men, and the arduous conditions of the service, are notorious to those acquainted with the facts. I hope that the Commonwealth will set a better example than the States have hitherto done in the treatment of these men. We should recollect that it is trying, even to the sanity of men, to be isolated for years on these miserable, storm-swept spots. They perform some of the most necessary works that could be performed in the interests of the community and of all who have to navigate our coasts, and they should receive  exceptionally liberal treatment. In the case of one man, who had a family, and was stationed on Solitary Island, I know that he was told that he might leave his family ashore if he did not like the conditions under which they would have to live at the lighthouse. If he did so it would have been necessary to board them out at great expense, and he would have been deprived of the comforts of his home. If single men only are employed, their position is extremely trying when they have no other society than that of their companions. </para>

                            <para>- I can mention the case of a man who was stationed at the lighthouse on South Solitary Island on the New South Wales coast for some years in excess of the time a man is supposed to remain in such a place. While at the lighthouse his daughter, a young woman, eighteen years of age, took ill with typhoid fever and died. The island is only an acre or two in extent, and the corpse had to be kept in the lighthouse building, occupied by the family, for several days before any means could be provided for its removal to the mainland. Such primitive conditions are, in this age, a disgrace to any civilized community. The lighthouse-keepers should have periodical holidays, and the fares to be paid for taking them from their lighthouses should not be at the discretion of the shipping companies, as they are at the present time. The man to whom I referred as having allowed his leave to accumulate was told ultimately that under the regulations he had forfeited his leave by not taking advantage of it when it was due. I hope that nothing of this kind will obtain under the Commonwealth management of this important service. </para>

                        <para>. - I am in thorough sympathy with all that has been said by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Rae.</inline> I recognise that lighthouse-keepers have to spend a very lonely life, that they should be well remunerated, and should be given proper holidays. A supervisor of lighthouses has been appointed in the person of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Ramsbotham,</inline> and four men are to' be appointed to supervise different portions of the coast. It is believed that those in charge of all our lighthouses will be much more in touch with headquarters than they have been in the past. There was a vote of £15,000 put down, under this heading last year, but only about one-half of the amount was' spent. The balance is being re-voted this year, and £7,462 is a new vote for the year. I shall have a note taken of the remarks made by honorable senators, and we will send them to the Minister of Trade and Customs, under whose charge the 'lighthouses are. ' The total amount of the vote is £15,000. Of this amount £7,538 is a re-vote, which will be absorbed by the following works, which are almost completed : -In Bass Strait, alteration to light at Gabo Island, new optical apparatus at Wilson's Promontory, new light at Citadel Island, and a new light at Cape Liptrap. The sum .of £7,462 for new services covers the construction of steel towers for lights at Westpoint, Tasmania, and on the inner passage of the Great Barrier Beef at Clark Island, Piper Island, Chapman Island, T. T. Reef, Heath Beef, Dhu Beef, and Coquet Island; also at Emery Point, Northern Territory, and at Cape Don. The total cost of the scheme, as outlined by Commander Brewis, is estimated at: New lights and alterations to existing lights, £319,000, and four lighthouse steamers, £240,000, or a total of £559.000. It is proposed to spread the Cost of new lights and alterations over a period of six years, averaging an annual expenditure of £50,000. </para>

I agree that it is rather unfortunate that members of the party to which the honorable senator belongs should stoop so low as to try to make political capital out of such an unfortunate disaster as the wreck of the <inline font-style="italic">Yongala.</inline> It is well known that when that disaster took place members of the honorable senator's party were the first in the field to lay the cause of it at the door of the Labour party because they had not done more than they did in lighting the Queensland coast. That is why I direct attention now to the necessity of the Government of which the honorable senator is a member doing something to provide the necessary lights on that coast.

                        <para>. - In regard to the request preferred by. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ready,</inline> I wish to assure him that there has been no delay' whatever in the matter he mentioned. The motion which he carried did not affect me. It affected the Minister of Defence. Whatever cause may have prevented the earlier production of the papers in question, if I can do anything to remove it, he has my assurance that I will do so. As a matter of fact, I will seethe Minister of Defence either to-night or to-morrow morning, and tell him what the honorable senator has said. </para>
