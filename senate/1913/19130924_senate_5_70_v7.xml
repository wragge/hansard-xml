                        <para>- I can answer a portion of the honorable senator's question now. The Government have obtained that advice. The gentleman who has responded to our invitation, and who is coming to Australia, is named Fitzmaurice. I am not quite certain as to either his Christian name, or, if he has one, as to his title. It is anticipated that he will leave Great Britain on the 10th October. As to the matter of the terms arranged upon, I would ask the honorable senator to give notice of a question. </para>

In this matter, the Government were not at all influenced by the claims of one portion of Cockburn Sound as against another portion. That was not in any way the reason which induced them to invite the assistance of an expert engineer. </para>

                            <para>- If that question alone embraced the point which influenced the Government in the action they took, there might be some justification for asking the officer for an explanation of a minute which he submitted. It was not that factor alone, but many factors, which induced the Government to call in outside assistance. Therefore, I do not see any reason, at the present moment, for asking any member of the Naval Board to explain the grounds which induced him to put down in black and white the opinion he has expressed. </para>

                        <para>The experience of the Willoughby and Mosman Liberal Leagues in connexion with the work of candidate selection has strengthened objection to the present system. In Willoughby about 700 names, out of a total enrolment of less than 4,000, have been objected to by one or other of the various candidates in the field. At Mosman the work of revising the rolls has proved very unsatisfactory. There were 500 names objected to, and when the lists were thoroughly examined many names were found for whose membership tickets no butts could be discovered. </para>

                        <para>- I speak, of course, on the spur of the moment, but my recollection of the case is that the lad was proceeded against some months ago for having failed to comply with the conditions of the Defence Act, and was detained as the result of a decision given against him in the local police court. I believe he was released before the period of incarceration was completed. As he still failed to comply with the conditions' of the Act, further proceedings were taken against him, and he was again detained. I issued a direction that, having served twenty days, the boy should be released, but that, of course, does not release him from his ultimate obligations under the Act as it stands. </para>

I desire to say that, in view of the composition of the two Houses, it is not the intention of the Government to introduce in this Chamber measures which involve . the principles they submitted to the electors, until they have first been submitted to and approved by the other branch of the Legislature. To do so would be, as 1 am sure honorable senators recognise, to deny to the Government the opportunity to ascertain the wishes of another place upon those measures. </para>

                    <para>- In connexion with the reply which the Minister of Defence has just given, I wish to ask him, without notice, whether his statement that no Bill involving the Government policy will be introduced in the Senate until such time as it has been passed in another place, does not mean totally ignoring the Senate, which has coequal powers with the other branch of the Commonwealth Parliament? </para>

                has been good enough to waive his right to continue this debate in my favour. I intend to confine my remarks to paragraph 6 of the Government policy, which sets out that, in view of the very large sums of money involved in the construction of dock yards, &amp;c, Ministers deem it advisable to secure high professional advice of the best type as to the plans to be adopted, and as to the immediate and ultimate cost of the scheme. Whilst the Minister of Defence was unable this afternoon to give the Senate information of which he, as the responsible head of the Department, ought to have been in possession, I have been able to obtain that information from statements made elsewhere by another Minister. We were told by the Minister of Defence that an expert named Fitzmaurice has been appointed to report upon Cockburn Sound, and the other naval bases. I understand that he is connected with the firm of
                <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline>
                Coode. The Minister did not give ' the Senate information as to the fee to be paid to this gentleman, but the Prime Minister has stated - and the announcement is now in the public press of this city - that it is to be 4,700 guineas. It is very singular that the Minister who is responsible for the administration of this Department, and who sits in this Chamber, was unable to supply us with that information, whilst a Minister in the other branch of the Legislature is able to inform its members of the fee which is to be paid. Of course, that is only on a par with the general attitude adopted by the Government in ignoring the Senate, and in thus indicating that the question of the fee to be paid is not  our business.

                        <para>- Apparently he is the only gentleman who is prepared to say anything on this subject. Some Ministers probably hold the opinion that he says too much. However, I do not doubt that he will say less in the future. I wish now to say a few words regarding the necessity for obtaining this professional advice at such a high fee. It is somewhat significant that, in reply to questions which I put to him, the Minister of Defence stated that not only was this expert to advise the Government as to a site in Cockburn Sound, but he was also to advise them in regard to the operations to be undertaken at Westernport and other naval bases. When the present Ministry took office, there were 168 men employed at Cockburn Sound, but to-day there are only 30 hands employed there. The Government have attempted to justify i hair action in practically closing down the works by pleading that, until they had procured expert advice, they could not proceed further. But the Minister of Defence has also stated that the expert is to advise them as to operations at Westernport. There are 377 men employed there to-day, and in June last there were 394 men engaged there. So that, apparently, the Government are carrying out quite a different policy at Westernport from that which they are pursuing at Cockburn Sound. Although they are going to call in this high professional adviser to advise them in respect of operations at Westernport, they have not discharged men there, whereas, at Cockburn Sound, they have taken the drastic step of closing down the works. Before proceeding to deal with this question, I wish to illustrate what I intend to say later <inline font-style="italic">b?</inline> means of a rough map which I have here. It is a map, drawn roughly to scale of Cockburn Sound and its vicinity. It shows th9 Fremantle Harbor to the north, and Woodman's Point, which is 6 miles south. Cockburn Sound extends for a distance of 12 miles south of Woodman's Point. </para>

                </continue><para class="block">To the west is Garden Island, which forms the shelter from the west of Cockburn Sound, and to the north there are two sand-banks, running across from the land and completely closing the mouth of the Sound. There is another sand-bank running south across the mouth of Jervoise Bay, and behind that we have the sheltered water known as Jervoise Bay. Mangles Bay, which a prominent member of the Ministry has said is the best site in the Sound, <inline font-style="italic">lies</inline> immediately to the south. The South Passage is not available to ships of any draught. Not only is it partially closed, but it is partially closed by rock, whereas the entrances to the north are merely blocked by sand-banks. The red, round ring3 on the map indicate the sites of bores put down in 1887 at1 the request of no less an authority than <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> Coode himself, who came out and personally inspected this harbor, and reported upon it. Now the Government are asking an understrapper of the same firm to come out here and report on the work of his head, at a fee of 4,700 guineas. The dots marked in red on the map indicate the bores put down to a depth of 30 feet, to enable <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> Coode to supply his final report, which was supplied in 1891. The rings marked in blue, and the transverse marks across the sand-banks, indicate bores which have been put down by the Naval Board in conjunction with the State Government, they contributing the sum of £1,000, and lending the dredge <inline font-style="italic">Governor,</inline> which was returned to them in November, 1912. Those bores were put down to a depth of 40 feet, and the information regarding them was in the possession of the Naval Board before February, 1913, and also in their possession when they at their meeting came to the conclusion to recommend to me Jervoise Bay as the site for the naval base. The bores were put down to the depth of 40 feet without encountering any substance with which a dredge could not easily deal. When <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> Coode came out in 1887 - he had previously been here in 1877 - the proposition put to him was that the Government of the day required a harbor for Fremantle. He reported on the advisability of the harbor being put at the mouth of the river, at  Arthur's Head, to the north of the Success Bank, which is the northerly bank, the southerly bank being the Parmelia; and finally on the project of putting a shipping harbor between the northerly and southerly banks, with the subsequent cutting of a channel through the Success Bank to the north. I propose to read <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> Coode's report, and Captain Archdeacon's report, and to show that one of the highest professional men in the British Empire has already reported on this subject; and to quote what he says on Jervoise Bay. </para><interjection>

                        <para>- I shall give the date of everything I read. When in the early part of 1912 I, as Minister of Defence, called on the First Naval Member to come with me to Western Australia - and he was accompanied by the Director of Naval Works - we had a conference there with the Minister of Works, and had before us then these reports of <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> Coode. After the last debate in the Senate, I telegraphed to the Minister of Works, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Johnson,</inline> and have now received the reports that were then before us, and am able to read them to the Senate. Before dealing with them I propose, in order to show what we have to put up with in this matter, to refer to a statement by the Treasurer, not made in another place, but telegraphed to Western Australia. In this he stated that, whilst Admiral Henderson had recommended Jervoise Bay as the best site, " the present Government is acting on the advice of Admiral Henderson, and on the advice of no one else, and I believe is so acting with the concurrence of the Naval Board. There is no one on the Naval Board who could have been in Admiral Henderson's service when he made the recommendation that expert advice should be obtained ' to thoroughly examine Cockburn Sound with a view to locating the site of the future naval dock-yard.' " That is absolutely incorrect. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Manisty,</inline> the present Financial Member of the Naval Board, was Admiral Henderson's right-hand man, went right round Australia with him, acted as his secretary, and was in possession of all this information, and so was Admiral Henderson when they made the report. The Treasurer, furthermore, found fault with the previous Government, because he said they were going on with the works without conducting the examination that Admiral </para>
                    </talk.start>
                </continue><para class="block">Henderson recommended. The money for the bores, and the whole of the money that has been spent, with the exception of that for a mile of railway, has been used for exploratory and survey work, as recommended by Admiral Henderson, and all of it was available before we made t"he final choice of Jervoise Bay. The Treasurer said, further, in the same" telegraphed statement, that the dredging of the two channels across the bank would probably cost £500,000, and the dock-yard and buildings quite £1,500,000. I should like to know where he gets those estimates, because the estimate supplied by <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> Coode in the reports which I have with me places the total cost of the channels at only £200,000. </para><interjection>

Four years ago at Bombay the <inline font-style="italic">Simla,</inline> a modern dredge, cut its own channel through land at some places above water level, 300 feet wide, 30 feet deep, and 3,000 feet in length, the actual dredging time being only 250 hours, which is about equal to a month of eight-hour working days. As before stated, the length of channel estimated to be deepened by <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> Coode is roughly about 16,000 feet, which, on the above figures, could be cut 30 feet deep and 300 feet wide by a modern dredge in from five to six months - that is, providing no rock is encountered. Of course, the channel across the banks will be much wider, and at least 5 feet deeper, but -even allowing for the extra "work involved, it may safely be stated that the work could be completed with two such dredges in twelve months at the outside. It has been stated that, given two dredges of the same capacity as the <inline font-style="italic">Simla,</inline> and working together, a navigable channel could be cut of a width and depth equal to the Suez.

It will be observed that they consist almost entirely of sand, and judging from the results of the borings it would appear not improbable, that a line for a channel might be selected across either of the banks named, to afford a. sufficient depth for the navigation of ocean steamers without encountering rock. Unfortunately, the borings, which were made with a different object, were not carried to a sufficient depth to enable me to determine this point now with absolute certainty - </para>

                    <para>By the courtesy of the hydrographer I have been enabled since the receipt of your letter of the 24th ultimo, to compare the outlines of the Success and Parmelia Banks as shown on the plot of the survey made bv Captain Stokes, R.N., in 1840, with those indicated on the plan of 1873 by Captain Archdeacon, R.N. It would certainly appear from these records that but little change in the actual configuration of the banks in question has occurred in the interval of 33 years between the two surveys. </para>
                    <para>Success Bank is open to the full stroke of (he seas from north to north-west. From the latter point to south-west it derives considerable shelter from Rottnest Island, the Stragglers Reef, and the adjacent rock patches. Southward of south-west there is ample shelter. It should be noted that with a beam wind and sea, in steaming through a channel across the bank, shelter would be afforded by the outlying rock. The most unfavorable conditions for using the channel would be with a heavy northwesterly wind and sea, when only the' shelter afforded by the bank itself would be available. </para>
                    <para>A channel through the Parmelia Bank might be considered as sufficiently sheltered from the sea for navigation purposes by large steamers in all weathers. </para>
                    <para>The heaviest gales in this locality commence from north, to north-west and travel westerly to about south-west, by which time they usually abate. The prevailing winds are northerly in winter and southerly in summer, so that Success Bank is open to the winter seas over the arc above described. </para>
                    <para>A channel through Success Bank to be of any real utility, having regard to the foregoing conditions, would require to be of abnormal width and depth, in order to allow for the effect of beam winds and the " scend " and direction of the sea. </para>
                    <para>I am of opinion that if a channel is to be formed through the bank it should be on the line indicated on the plan, that it should be straight throughout, and have a bottom width in the first instance of not less than 300 feet, and the depth below low water of summer levels along its course should be 35 feet, in order to admit of navigation during the winter seasons, and to allow a sufficient margin for shoaling due to sand and silt being drawn into the Cutt, which will inevitably arise. </para>
                    <para>By increasing the bottom width to, say, 500 feet, thereby entailing an additional expenditure to corresponding extent, there is every reason to believe that the channel could be navigated safely in all weathers and under all conditions. </para>
                    <para>If a channel is to be formed through the Success Bank it would certainly appear that the proper mode of procedure, and that which would produce the most satisfactory result, would be to dredge a corresponding channel through Parmelia Bank, and to erect a pier in Jervoise Bay in the north-east bight of Cockburn Sound, about six miles south of Fremantle, where, judging from the chart, a depth of six fathoms at low water is available close in shore, and perfect shelter would be provided from the north and north-west by Woodman's Point and the Spit to the westward thereof, whilst Garden Island and the rocks to the northwards would thoroughly protect such a pier from other quarters. </para>

Most harbor experts, before committing themselves to harbor projects, consult eminent navigators, who advise them as to the dangers of the proposals made. I do not suppose that Captain Archdeacon is heard of so much now as he was in 1891, when he was looked upon as an eminent authority in that regard.

It is protected from winter gales by Woodman's Point and spit extending therefrom; but somewhat exposed to westerly and south-westerly winds, generally prevailing during the summer months, which at times blow wilh considerable strength, sending in a considerable jobble for a few hours, and, therefore, it would be necessary to run out a pier of open pile work from some point of mainland southward of Woodman's Point in a north-westerly direction ; and, with the removal of the three-fathom rock alluded to by <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> Coode, you would have a harbor that would afford perfect safety to vessels of any class during all periods of the year.

                        <para>- <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> Coode said that there is no reason to believe that they could not be kept open with very little dredging. Captain Archdeacon has stated that the prevalent currents will be sufficient to create the necessary scour. I may point out that at the present harbor, at the mouth of the river, where there is very little current, very little dredging has been found to be necessary. If the sand there had been of a shifting character, it would have blocked up the mouth of the river. I come now to some reports of local experts, and the first is from Captain Irvine. This is evidence, which was given by Captain Irvine, Chief Harbormaster of Western Australia, and Captain Morrison, Chief Pilot and Harbormaster at Fremantle, to Admiral Creswell, on the occasion of our visit to Western Australia, when we had a conference with the State Minister of Works on the proposed works at Cockburn Sound. It was taken in view of the necessity of securing all available information about Cockburn Sound. Captain Irvine said - </para>

As proof of this there was the fact that there was no break on the Success bank in two fathoms. Only in the heaviest weather was there a patch of broken water here and there. This showed that there was no weight of swell or "scend" in Gage Roads. He, therefore, judged from this that a channel cut through Success bank of, say, 500 feet width and 40 feet deep L.W.S., would be perfectly safe and easy for any ship in any weather. </para>

There was a heavy roll on the five-fathom bank outside Challenger Pass in heavy weather or after a blow, and this caused a lift in Challenger Pass which would make it in its present condition (with only 19 feet minimum depth) dangerous to vessels drawing over 14 feet. Vessels of 14 feet could pass out by it safely in- any weather. The removal of certain small patches (comparatively speaking, a small work) would vastly improve the channel and make it safe for vessels of 17 feet in all, or practically all, weather. Challenger Pass, with a channel 500 feet 'wide', having a depth of '40 feet at L.W.S., would be a good entrance for all vessels excepting in very extraordinary weather conditions. </para>

                            <para>- Yes; it would appear so. The part of Westernport that has been selected had to be chosen for various reasons. It is to be the main torpedo-destroyer and submarine base; and you must have special conditions as to shelter, safety, and calm seas, for such a purpose. The inlet which has been selected has had to be dredged practically to the whole depth required, because at low water it is, to all intents and purposes, a mere swamp. The expert, when he arrives, may say that that is the wrong place. What are you going to do, therefore? Are you going on with the work until he arrives ? The Government say, in regard to Cockburn Sound, that no more shall be done; they have stopped the work; they have put every one off until the expert arrives. </para>

                            <para>- It does seem ridiculous, after you have had a report from the head of the firm, who consulted with his  partner, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Mathews</inline> - because the firm is that of Coode and Mathews - and after he has made a report, and has said that Jervoise Bay is the best site anywhere round Fremantle for a harbor, that we should pass over his report and consult one of his employes. Acting upon his report, we have been boring and surveying at Jervoise Bay. Tests have been made which snow that there has been no movement in the bank for forty years, and the borings show that, to a depth of 40 feet, we meet with no obstacle but what a dredge can remove. In the face of all that information, the Naval Board recommended to me that Jervoise Bay should be selected. We approved of that. But, no sooner did this Government come into office, than it closed down the work, the reason being, they say, that the late Government went on with it without expert advice. Consequently, this Government propose to bring to Australia a member of the same firm that has twice reported on the harbor, to report on the work of the head of the firm. </para>

                            <para>- They must, indeed ?. I cannot find any reason for this action. I trust that it is not due to a desire to score a point off a political opponent. But it looks remarkably like that, because the Treasurer has made some very strong statements. He charged, me with going on with that work without obtaining the information which Admiral Henderson said was necessary. I have again and again asked the Minister of Defence to call upon the third naval member to furnish a report as to the injudicious expenditure that he says has been incurred at Jervoise Bay. The Minister has now promised to look into that question. I do say that, when a responsible officer reports to his Minister that there has been injudicious expenditure it is the duty of the Minister to ask him to be more precise and definite. All the work done - the work of survey and the work of boring - has been carried out, not by the Naval Board directly, but by the engineer who was appointed on the recommendation of the Naval Board, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Walker.</inline> If he has wasted the money of the Commonwealth it is the duty of the Minister to discharge him. </para>

                            <para>- If this officer is unfit for his job, the Minister should remove him from it. The Minister, however has slept upon that report ever since he used it in the Senate when we were discussing the Supply Bill. He has never asked the third naval member to give him any more information as to why he made this serious charge. If there has been injudicious expenditure at Jervoise Bay, I do not ask the Minister to shield me. I ask him to put the responsibility <inline font-style="italic">on</inline> the right shoulders. Let him give us the details. I should welcome them, because I am not one who would shelter any engineer if he has been found to be incompetent. The Minister has been rather lacking in his duty in not asking for details earlier. A word as to why we went on with the work. I say that the late Government did no work at all there, with the exception of the exploratory and survey work, apart from the building of one half mile of railway. I must again have resort "to the  map  to show why that railway was built. It branches off the line from Fremantle half a mile to Woodman's Point. By arrangement with the State </para>

                    </continue><para class="block">Government we got that half mile of railway extended, and that is the only thing that has been done in the nature of a permanent work at Cockburn Sound. With that solitary exception, the whole of the rest of the money has been spent in surveying and boring. And even if <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> Forrest's idea to construct the dockyard at Mangles Bay is carried out, we shall still need that railway. We must in any case link up with the railway to Fremantle. The line would, therefore, in any case have to be extended down to the coast. Wherever the dockyard is placed, whether at Jervoise Bay or Mangles Bay, that half mile of railway, which is the only permanent work we constructed at Jervoise Bay, will still continue to be needed. So much, therefore, for the Treasurer's charge that we had been going on with works without carrying out the recommendation of Admiral Henderson. I do not intend to weary the Senate with this matter any longer, but I thought that it was of sufficient importance to be ventilated to this extent. I am only sorry that the Minister of Defence is not present to make a reply. </para><interjection>

                            <para>- I cannot help thinking that the Minister has been misled in this matter. I believe that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> is too keen to take the action he has taken if he had known that these reports were in existence - if he had known that <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> Coode had already reported on this harbor, and that he had so strongly recommended Jervoise Bay. I can only assume that the honorable senator has either been misled, or has acted without a full knowledge of the subject. I have already alluded to the statements made by <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> Forrest. Having in view the fact that Fremantle harbor would have been at Jervoise Bay if <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> Forrest had not instructed <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> Coode not to plan a harbor there, but nearer to Fremantle, it is remarkable that he has shown the same antipathy to Jervoise Bay in this instance. </para>

                            <para>- Perhaps not. It is rather significant that the man who blocked the placing of the harbor at Jervoise Bay in 1891 is blocking the establishment of the Naval Base there in 1913. <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> Forrest tells us that he knows that Mangles Bay is a superior site. Let me point out, however, that those northerly winds to which <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> Coode  refers, the seas caused by which are broken on the banks shown on the map, will have a 12-milo sweep right down into Mangles Bay. What will be the effect? At Mangles Bay you will have as big a sea as you have when the waves strike Success Bank, which is right open to the strongest gales we get in Western Australia. I do not know what <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> Forrest's object can be in blocking this work on the north, and wishing to bring it down there. </para>

                            <para>- I cannot suggest, anything, either. I do hope, however, that the Government will get on with the work and reinstate the. men, because they already have this report of Siu John Coode in the Public Works Department of Western Australia. The plans and maps are there, the report is there, everything is there. This information was placed in Admiral Henderson's hands before he came here. Do honorable senators think that Admiral Henderson simply went down to Cockburn Sound in a launch, looked at Jervoise Bay,, and said, " That is the site for a dockyard?" Long before he came to Australia the Government of which I was a member wrote to the State Government, and asked them to make  available  whatever data they had in regard to a harbor; and that information was sent to Admiral Henderson at Colombo. He had the reports in his possession before he reached Australia. When he went to Cockburn Sound he had read them; he knew what <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> Coode had said, he knew all about the banks, and, in the light of all that information, he made Lis recommendation as to where the dockyard should be. I say that the Government are deserving of censure for their action in this regard, and I sincerely regret that they have taken such action. </para>

                        <para>.- I cannot -hope to add a great deal to what has been 'said during the debates on the Address-in-Reply in the Senate, and in another place; but because I have one or two considerations to bring before the Chamber, particularly as affecting Tasmania, I rise as a representative of that State to take this opportunity to add my quota. Looking over the document that has been presented to us by the Government, with the reflected glory of the late elections shining upon it, I wish to say at the outset that two things are conspicuous in regard to it. The first is that of the election promises made by the party now in office, but not in power, as <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Cook</inline> has aptly remarked, very few have been carried out. Secondly, in this document there is a deliberate attempt to cause a conflict with this branch of the Legislature in order to bring about, if possible, a double dissolution at a time suitable to the Ministerial party. </para>

                            <para>- It is from their point of view. But we are here to consider the view-point of the country. If the Government had brought down a programme containing a number of non-contentious measures such as would not have been calculated to provoke the hostility of this Chamber, a great deal of useful work could have been done for Australia; and the prime purpose of this Parliament is surely to look after the interests of Australia. </para>

                    <para>In Tasmania, during the election campaign, one of the chief arguments used by the Liberal party was that the Labour party was chiefly responsible for the increase in the cost of living. The Leader of the Liberal party, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Cook,</inline> in an appeal which appeared in the <inline font-style="italic">Launceston Examiner,</inline> of 29th May, made use of the following observation - </para>
                    <quote>
                        <para>Declare yourself for individual liberty of judgment and conscience, and for a reduction of the cost of living ; for sane and economical government. Who would be free must strike a blow. </para>
                    </quote>
                    <para class="block">Here is a plain declaration that the return of the Liberal party to power would have the effect of reducing the cost of living. I have searched the Ministerial policy again and again in a vain endeavour to discover any proposal by which they intend to redeem that promise. I want to know what the Ministerial party propose to do in regard to that pledge. If we are responsible for the increase in the cost of living, and my honorable friends opposite can reduce it, why do they not make the attempt? The electors of Australia have a right to expect an answer to that question. The increased cost of living was one of the points which were continually harped upon during the election campaign in the State which I represent. </para>
                    <para>There was a number of other points which were similarly harped upon, but time prevents me from dealing with them now. Some of the most despicable methods were adopted in Tasmania to belittle the Labour party. Deliberate falsehoods were circulated with that end in view. One lie which was circulated most industriously, and which the Liberal party have not had the common decency to repudiate, is contained iu a pamphlet headed " Political Tyranny," "A Startling Position," " The Labour Conference the real Parliament of the Country." This pamphlet was distributed throughout every electorate, but particularly in those divisions which are settled by farmers, who have not time to study political questions thoroughly. After dealing with the statement of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Minahan,</inline> the  president  of the New South Wales Labour Conference, the pamphlet states - </para>
                    <quote>
                        <para>Why was the Right Honorable Andrew Fisher not allowed to issue the official manifesto of his party recently without its being countersigned by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. David</inline> Watkins, secretary of the Political Trades Hall? Who is the real man in power - the Prime Minister or the Trades Hall_ secretary ? Independent electors, will you submit to this? Return to Parliament men who will cut Parliament clear of the Trades Hall caucus, and will restore free, public, and responsible government. </para>
                    </quote>
                    <para>The deliberate untruth contained in that statement is that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. David</inline> Watkins, the parliamentary secretary of the Federal Labour party, is the secretary of the Trades Hall. As a matter of fact, during his long and honorable career, he has never been connected with the Trades Hall in any official capacity. It would be to his credit if he had occupied the honorable position of secretary to that body. But the inference which the authors of the pamphlet desired the public to draw from that statement was that, before the Labour party could come to any decision in regard to legislative matters, it had to consult the secretary of the Trades Hall. The statement was authorized by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. E.</inline> L. Bailey. Yet those responsible for the circulation of this falsehood have never had the manliness to apologize for it. </para>
                    <para>I come now to a point which has already been dealt with by Senators O'Keefe and Long, namely, the failure of the present Government to propose the repeal of the land tax. This is a very surprising omission. I admit that I have not had the long parliamentary experience of many of my colleagues. But I always endeavour to believe that even honorable senators who occupy seats upon the opposite side of the House will attempt to give effect to their promises. Let me turn up <inline font-style="italic">Harvard,</inline> and read what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> had to say when combating the Federal land tax proposals which were introduced by the Labour Government in October, 1910. On page 4773 of that publication, in the course of a very bitter speech, he is thus reported - </para>

                        <para>By partial failure I mean to say that it was abundantly certain to any man who knew the Constitution and our powers that, by imposing a Federal land tax, grave and gross injustice must necessarily be done in individual cases.  . . In their frantic endeavours to promote closer settlement and to smash up large estates, the_ Government and the Labour party do not hesitate to overwhelm with ruin hundreds, perhaps thousands, of absolutely innocent men - men who have committed no offence against the community, and who are employing as much labour as their land can employ. </para>

For years the honorable senator was in advance of political opinion in Tasmania, but he is now content to drag behind political opinion in that State. I recollect the occasion when an article was published in the <inline font-style="italic">Monitor</inline> - which in those days was famous for its political articles, because the Labour movement was not then popular - and when a certain gentleman wrote to its editor congratulating him upon the article, aud affirming that the only fault lie had to find with it was that it did not go far enough. </para>

But what are the facts? I have them here,, not from any Labour source, but from the  Commissioner  himself. Although the tax is not as high as I should like to see it, it has accomplished more for closer settlement in three years, in little Tasmania, than all the Liberal Governments have done in the past twenty-five years. The figures prove this. In the first year of its imposition, £32,000 was yielded by it in Tasmania, and of this £16,000 was paid by ten persons. Those are the gentlemen .for whom my honorable friend opposite generally barracks. Those ten taxpayers were the following: - </para>

                            <para>- I make no secret of the fact that, as a member of the Senate, I should be quite prepared to make some of them pay twice as much. Desiring to ascertain the result of the tax, I wrote to the Commissioner, who very kindly supplied me with the figures as to the land sales, and the amount of land that has changed hands owing to the tax in two and three-quarter years. I was surprised myself, because, according to the Commissioner's statement, there were in Tasmania 862 sales, and £750,000 worth of land changed hands in two and three- quarter years as the result of the operation of the tax. The Van Diemen's Land Company are cutting up their estates. Some of the gentlemen whom I have named are also cutting up their land, whilst many others, whom I have not named, and who have smaller estates, are subdividing, as the result of the tax. </para>

                    <para>In a conversation the other day with a very well-informed and capable land valuator, I was told that in Tasmania, as the result of the tax, land values had undoubtedly decreased, particularly those fancy values that were attached to some of our rich chocolate soils - fictitious values, he called them - and I can assure the Senate that he is an authority on the matter. He told me also that the tax had not only had a steadying effect, and prevented land rising beyond its fair value, but that in many cases, which he named to me, it had had the effect of reducing values, and thereby steadying speculative values in land. That is something that we claim credit for, but our friends on the other side are very careful to dodge that aspect of it when they speak to the people on the subject.

                            <para>- That is so. Honorable senators opposite have the will, but not the courage, to repeal the tax; but if they were to make it one of the vital questions in an appeal to the people, our party would be anxious and willing to join issue with them. They talk in a large way when they are among their friends the big land-owners, and get a push behind to do something for them; but when it comes to taking steps towards repealing the tax, they are absolutely silent. </para>

                    <para>The most sinister clause in the so-called policy put forward by the Government is that which deals with the question of attacking unionism. They propose to repeal the section in the Arbitration Act which renders preference to unionists possible. They say - </para>

                    <para class="block">In Tasmania our opponents have been more daring, for they have thrown off the mask, and are going to fight the question in the State Parliament. That will make honorable senators on this side realize how serious this matter is going to be. </para>
                    <para>Some time ago the unionists of Australia wisely abandoned any idea of winning fair conditions and just remuneration by industrial means only, and decided that, in order to obtain the justice to which they thought they were entitled, they must appeal to Caesar by putting men into Parliament to make laws that would enable them to get their rights without having to resort to strikes. The movement by unions to obtain political power has not been confined to Australia. In a very excellent work by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Henry</inline> C. Vedder, professor of Church History in the Croser Theological Seminary, entitled <inline font-style="italic">Socialism and the Ethics of Jesus,</inline> an impartial and critical analysis of the principles for which Socialists stand, the author, dealing with the question of unionism, industrial and political, makes the following remarks, which go to prove that political unionism is a world-wide movement: - </para>

                        <para>In the struggle of unionism against capitalism, unionism seems certain to be defeated as long as the struggle is economic and financial only.  . . Between 1881and1900 there were  22,793  strikes, big and little, of which 50.77 per cent, were successful, while 13.04 per cent, partially succeeded, and 36.19 wholly failed. These  . . seem at first sight to be quite favorable to Labour. But the successful strikes were small affairs. . . . The unions go on in the same old way, challenging capital to a conflict where capital is invincible, save through its own blunders, and refusing to fight capital where it is vulnerable, at the ballot-box. In the ballot the American working man has a weapon that will insure him victory, whenever he has enough intelligence to use it. Capitalism is not afraid of strikes; it dreads the ballot, and does everything in its power to corrupt the suffrage and hinder the expression of the people's will. </para>
                        <para>Those sentences are very applicable to Australian conditions. Capitalism at the present time is not afraid of industrial unionism, but it has seen what three years of political work on behalf of the aspirations and aims of the workers will do, as shown by the achievements of the Austral ian Labour Government. Capitalists have realized that the adoption of peaceful means by the workers will compel those who hold the wealth to contribute more of it to those who produce it than they did before. Realizing this clearly, they are making a deliberate and concerted attempt to fight unionism. </para>
                        <para>In little Tasmania the representatives of capital are not so frightened of tackling this question as they are in the other States. I have here copies of two Bills which have been introduced in the Tasmanian Parliament this session, and which are really works of genius so far as they go. The first Bill is a very short one, which was introduced by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. N.</inline></para>

                            <para>- The Liberal party, of which the honorable senator is a member, subsidize that association. Through the Colonial Sugar Refining Company and other organizations they devote large sums of money yearly for political purposes. No attack is to be made upon these organizations, but, because the workers combine and form themselves into unions, a deliberate attempt is made to take away their rights and liberties by a party whose members get on the platform and mouth liberty and progress at every meeting they address. My honorable friends have not accepted the challenge to deny that the Liberal party subsidize this association, but I hope to prove, by quoting sworn evidence from the <inline font-style="italic">Age,</inline> that it is a tool of the capitalists - that it consists mainly of misguided men, who are prepared to sell their rights and privileges in order to curry favour with the masters. </para>

                    <para>His Honor : You must give the names. </para>
                    <para>Witness (hesitatingly) : One of the offers came to me from a party - a political party. It did not come direct from the secretary,' but from a gentleman whom I knew who happened to be with the secretary. I have nothing in writing. It was merely a verbal promise. Do you think it would be fair to disclose the name? </para>
                    <para>His Honor (sharply): Certainly; you must do it. </para>

                    <para>His Honor: No; we must have this public. (To witness) : Give me the name of the party. </para>
                    <para>Witness : This was an offer given to me - </para>
                    <para>His Honor : I have to find out that the application is made by a person interested. I want to know who are the two who have promised you assistance. </para>
                    <para>Witness : Will your Honor take them in writing? </para>
                    <para>His Honor: No; I will take them publicly. </para>
                    <para>Witness (after a .pause) : I have an offer from the Liberal Party, of which <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Wilson</inline> is secretary. The offer was made though a friend, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Serpell.</inline> I protest against this, your Honor, because it is private. </para>
                    <para>His Honor: Exactly; and it is because it is private that I want to bring it to the light of day. Who is the other person? </para>
                    <para>Witness : He is <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Packer,</inline> of the Independent Workers' Union. </para>
                    <para>Continuing, witness said that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Marshall</inline> had told him to call upon a solicitor, whom he named. He said it would be all right as far as the expenses were concerned. </para>
                    <para>There is clear proof, given in a Court of law, that these people were trying to squelch the workers who are out for their rights and a " fair deal," not a " square deal." </para>
                    <para>A deliberate attempt is being made to insure that the workers shall not get their rights, and that their personal liberty shall be taken away. The attempt is a gross reflection on the Liberal party. I am glad that we on this side are not associated with an attempt to take away political rights and privileges, or to interfere with personal freedom. A public meeting was held in Hobart by a number of Liberal gentlemen, who are always very anxious to get on a platform and point out the evil things which unionism has done. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bakhap</inline> was amongst those who got up. </para>

                            <para>- The Bill was introduced, but not passed, because the Legislative Council always heaved it out. No industrial legislation was passed in Tasmania until after such legislation had been agreed to in every other State. This outrage on the political and industrial interests of the workers of Tasmania, proposed by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Fullerton,</inline> will be perpetrated if the friends of the party opposite in that State have their way. </para>

                    <para>The position is that the unionists of Tasmania, the State which is most backward, politically and industrially, must make the fight of their lives if any attempt is made to infringe their rights. It will be made in the first place in the Tasmanian Legislature and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Cook</inline> and his followers will back up every effort made to interfere with the legislation passed in this Parliament. I hope that honorable senators who advocate the abolition of preference to unionists will be sufficiently logical to introduce a measure making it impossible by law for the employers of Australia to give preference to non-unionists - to Packer's brigade. If they do not believe in political unionism, and condemn unionists who subscribe to funds for political purposes, they should logically condemn the employers who subscribe to funds for the assistance of Packer's brigade. If unionists desire to return more members to Parliament they have a right to do so. </para>

                            <para>- There is more than that in the proposal of the Government, as we shall see by-and-by, if a single dissolution does not prevent the measure reaching the Senate. There is a proposal to remove rural workers from the protection of the Conciliation and Arbitration Court. Our friends have never done much for the farmers ; but they have gone round " smoodging " to them in Tasmania and frightening them with the prospect of having to pay big wages. The Australian Workers' Union is going to organize the rural workers of Australia industrially; but our friends on the other side would leave these organizations to the States. Do they really believe that the State Parliaments will pass any legislation <inline font-style="italic">1o</inline> deal with the rural workers? Does <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bakhap</inline> honestly believe that State legislation on the subject will be anything but repressive and unfair ? He knows well that the only alternative to the proposal of the Australian Workers' Union to arbitrate is the gospel and doctrine of the strike. That will be all that will be left to the rural workers, and, when they do strike, the honorable senator and persons of his kidney will be the first to tour Tasmania and Australia to condemn them for striking; though the honorable senator is prepared to join those who would take away the right of the rural workers to arbitration. I heard <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Roberts,</inline> the honorable member for Adelaide, speak in another place, aud he summed up the whole position when he said - " The Liberal party says that John Jones, in the city, shall have the right to arbitration, and shall not find it necessary to go to the extent of striking; but John Giles, in the country, will have to strike, or put up with the conditions as he finds them." That is an unanswerable statement of the Government proposal. </para>

                    <para>Our friends opposite do not attempt to really deal with the question. What they do is to appeal to - the class prejudice of a certain section, with the object of frightening them against arbitration. It has been repeatedly stated outside these walls, and on the hustings particularly, by our friends opposite that the Arbitration Court has not prevented strikes, and has therefore failed. They use specious arguments. They say that because a certain number of strikes have taken place within a certain time, and the number of strikes has been greater than it was a few years ago, the Federal Arbitration Court has failed. Where is the logic in that? When making the statement they know that our Arbitration Court has not power over one-eighth of the strikes, and our Act cannot be applied to them. If honorable senators would interview <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Stewart,</inline> the Registrar of the Court, they would find that, with the exception of the wharf labourers' struggle, when the men were out for three or four days, and some minor breaches of awards, there has never been a big strike which our Arbitration Court has been in a position to control. Still our friends will have the people believe that it has failed. </para>

This attempt reminds me of the famous " Statutes at Large," and I took the trouble to go to the Library to cull a few notes from it. It is on a par with the legislation passed from the 15th year of King Edward III. to the 13th year of King Henry IV. The chief provisions of this legislation were - </para>

                        <para>. - In submitting a motion for a special adjournment of the Senate, I should like to make an explanation. Tomorrow is one of the chief days in connexion with the Agricultural Show of this State. I. understand that the other House is to adjourn over to-morrow after noon. I remind honorable senators that it has been a usual practice for the Senate to adjourn one day during Show week, and that day has invariably been Thursday. I understand that a motion for an adjournment over to-morrow meets with the concurrence of a majority of honorable senators. But it is only fair that I should point out that it will be necessary on Friday to pass a Supply Bill. </para>
