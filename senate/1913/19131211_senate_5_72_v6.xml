                            <para>- I read the report of the question submitted by the honorable senator, but I am not quite clear as to what it is he complains of. From the history of- the case, there does not appear to have been any injustice or hardship inflicted. This cadet was non-efficient for the year 1912, that is to say, he did not put in the requisite number of drills. In the present year he was short twenty-four days out of twenty-five. Action was taken against him on the 1st December of this year, and the case was adjourned for six weeks to enable him to make up the deficiency. So far the cadet has not attended any parade since the Court proceedings, thus ignoring the opportunity afforded him by the magistrate to make good his default, </para>

It would appear to be a reflection on the conduct of the business of the Senate, of which, of course, I am in charge. Speaking from my own experience in the chair, and from what I have been able to ascertain as to the proceedings of the Senate at other times, there is absolutely no warrant or foundation in fact for the statement made by the Prime Minister. Further, I wish to say that I consider it highly undesirable and unworthy of the Prime Minister to make such comments on a branch of this Legislature coordinate with that of which he is himself a member. </para>

                                <para>- I am not going to criticise his conduct. If he thinks fit to say at a public meeting that the language used in this Senate is fit only for a pot-house, it shows that he is in the habit of frequenting pot-houses, and if he has not heard there any worse language than has been used in this Chamber,&#39; the position is not so bad. In any case, I am opposed to elevating an utterance by the Prime Minister to a position of undeserved importance. I would treat it with the contempt that it merits. We should not take any action until the Prime Minister has been asked by the Minister of Defence whether or not he has been correctly reported. We ought not to condemn a man until he has had a fair trial. </para>

In reply to the questions put by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Long,</inline> the Minister did not say that he would make representations in that connexion, and when <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Long</inline> persisted, the Minister replied that he would give no further answer. That strikes me as being a very wrong attitude for the Leader of the Senate to adopt. Every honorable senator should be jealous of the reputation of the Senate. </para>

                                <para>- What I am doing now is a reply to the challenge of the Leader of the Government here. I am attempting to defend the reputation of this Chamber, about which its Leader evidently does not care very much. This is not the first time that the Prime Minister has used language in which he has dubbed honorable senators men who are not fit to represent the people. On more than one occasion he has been reported to have made the same sort of statement. To-day the Leader of the Senate was asked several times if he would ascertain from the Prime Minister whether the report of his statements is correct, but he declined to do so. The position is a scandalous one. On this occasion we can well divest ourselves of all party feeling. </para>

                            (Victoria) &#91;11.28J. - As one of the young members of the Senate, I sincerely hope that no heat will be engendered over this matter. If we wish to maintain the dignity of the Chamber, we ought to treat the statement which is attributed to the Prime Minister with the contempt that it merits, and not act like a lot of school children. We ought to decline to notice statements made by certain gentlemen who are members of the present Government. We shall only belittle ourselves in the eyes of the public if we adjourn the Senate on every occasion that statements derogatory to it are made by the Prime Minister and some of his colleagues, and published in the newspapers. Regarding the censure which it is proposed to pass on the Minister of Defence, I think we should be guilty of puerile conduct if we agreed to it. In my opinion, that gentleman is not responsible for the utterances of members of the Government in another place.

                                <para>- The The Prime Minister is hardly a responsible person, in the eyes of the majority of the people of this country. I make bold to say that his utterances of this kind have been so frequent, and so numerous, within the last few months, that the majority of the electors of Australia hardly regard him as responsible in matters of the kind. I am satisfied that the people merely regard these utterances as exhibitions of pure party spleen and bias on the part of the Prime Minister. This is not the only instance of the kind. The statement made by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Cook</inline> is so utterly opposed to common sense, so absolutely contrary to the knowledge of the electors of Australia as to what the conduct of the Senate really is, so contemptible in itself, that it would be a pity, in my humble opinion, if the Senate were to take the course proposed. To do so would be to elevate the utterance of the Prime Minister into a position of importance that it does not deserve, because it was merely a contemptible and irresponsible utterance made for party purposes. Every time he makes a statement of this kind it must lose in weight, if it ever had any at the beginning. The more frequently he attacks the Senate in such language the better it will be, because the more he will be discredited. </para>

                                <para>- No; No; they did not take such a view of the utterance of a member of our party which was made outside; but, as I did not agree with the action taken in that respect, I cannot be  expected to agree with what is now proposed to be done in the Senate. What is more, I do not think that the utterance of the Prime Minister is parallel with that of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McGrath.</inline> In that case, there might have been some justification. In my opinion, there was. In this instance, there is no justification for the language used. My opinion is that the electors of Australia know that perfectly well, and that we can well afford to leave the utterances of the Prime Minister unnoticed. It will be better to&#39; do so than to give them a prominence which they certainly do not deserve. The best way in which we can show our contempt for <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Cook</inline> and those utterances of his, which are utterly devoid of truth, will be to treat them with the contempt which they merit, and not elevate them into a fictitious importance. </para>

                                <para>- The Minister had the case put clearly before him. In my opinion, he should at once have said, &#34; If the report be correct, I deprecate the language used, and deplore its use.&#34; But instead of doing that he said nothing. He neither challenged the correctness of the report nor admitted it. Therefore&#39; we are led to assume that he indorsed the language used by his colleague, the Prime Minister. I do not look upon this as a light matter. The Senate has its honour and dignity to preserve. If we do not ourselves see to the maintenance of our own dignity, there is very little chance of people outside doing so. If we do not ourselves set an example in protecting our honour, which has been assailed on the present occasion, we cannot blame others, if they show little respect for us. In this, instance, it is not the utterances of the man Cook that I. object to. I object to the Prime Minister of Australia, who stands in the premier position in this island continent, saying that language used in this branch of the Legislature is only worthy of a pot-house. </para>

                                <para>- Such a statement cannot be ignored when it is made by a man in the Prime Minister&#39;s position. It was Bacon who said that a man &#34; cannot contend coldly what he believes, earnestly&#34;; and when a person&#39;s honour is attacked it is not for him to sit still and turn the other cheek to the  smiter.  I think it is the duty of this Chamber to place on record in concrete form our condemnation, in the first place, of the Prime Minister, and, in the second place, of the Leader of the Senate, the former for impugning the honour and dignity, the good name and the reputation of the Senate, and the latter for not repudiating the utterance. I am heartily in favour of the course that has been proposed, and hope that the motion will be carried by an overwhelming majority. </para>

                            <para>. - This is not a matter which has been sprung suddenly upon us. The utterances of the Prime Minister concerning the Senate have not cropped up for the first time this morning. Any one who has watched <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Cook&#39;s</inline> public conduct, and has read his utterances at public meetings, must have observed many similar cases. He made an exceedingly strong statement about the Chinn Committee before a single word had been said by those who supported its appointment. It will be remembered that the motion for its appointment was passed in the Senate without any debate whatever. Yet <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Cook</inline> charged it with being a packed Committee. Practically, he charged it with corruption. He went on to criticise the Senate for appointing such a Committee. Since then <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Cook</inline> has been repeatedly following up that line of conduct. It cannot, therefore, be said that this is an isolated case. It is not the first instance in which he has deliberately insulted the members of this Chamber. </para>

If <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Cook</inline> were not in that position I am satisfied that those who have taken exception to his remarks would have paid no attention to them whatever. It is simply because the person who has so grossly insulted the Senate occupies this high position that we take notice of his conduct. I can treat <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Cook,</inline> and every other mau of his type, with contempt just as well as anybody else, but this matter has gone beyond a stage when it can be passed by silently. We have had too much of this treatment. If we allow the present statement to pass after it has been brought under our notice, then during the recess we shall have such remarks continuously hurled at the Senate. Why is this course being pursued ? </para>

                                <para>- We can show at the present stage that we resent the use of that sort of language, and what is proposed is, I hold, the only way in which it can be effectively resented. Had the Minister who is leading the Senate indicated that he did not approve of the use of language of this kind, had he shown any inclination to disapprove of the insult offered to the Senate, I am quite satisfied that the matter would have been allowed to rest. But his words and his demeanour gave me to understand that, in his opinion, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Cook</inline> had done something which was quite right or proper, or, at all events, that he had done something which we had no right to criticise or find fault with. When an insult is hurled at us in that secondhand way, the Senate will do right in resenting it. Although <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Cook&#39;s</inline> language gave rise to the initial stage of the motion, the present position has been brought about by the statement of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen.</inline> I do not know whether he so intended his remarks, but any one looking on could come to no other conclusion. </para>

                                <para>- I hope that the honorable senator will let me say a few words without interruption. This matter arose out of various questions by honorable senators, but I think it particularly arose out of a question by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bae.</inline> I believe that every honorable senator has almost forgotten the answer given to that question. I am not defending <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen,</inline> who, of course, is quite capable of doing that himself. This was his clear and distinct answer to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bae,</inline> and no other answer, 1 submit, could reasonably have been expected from a Minister. If honorable senators could only refer to the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> report they would see that what I am about to say is accurate. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> said distinctly that he would bring the matter mentioned by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Rae</inline> under the notice of the Prime Minister. </para>

Having given that answer to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Rae,</inline> I venture to submit that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> could have no answer to a dozen other interrogatories except that he had nothing further to say, and his answer to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Rae</inline> was final and complete. I hope that the Senate will now let the matter drop. </para>

                            <para>. - The motion is that the Standing Orders he suspended to permit something to be done, and the reason for this drastic motion is that the Senate has been grossly misrepresented by the Prime Minister, and that two Ministers have risen in their places here and, although they have not directly said so, have associated themselves with that libel on the Senate. If the Minister of Defence will, fail to lead the Senate, and uphold its dignity, it is. time that the business was taken out of the hands of such a leader. I hope that not only will this motion be carried, but that a motion will be carried, adjourning the Senate till such time as the language complained of is either explained as not being correctly reported or apologized for. I do not want to attempt to act in a drastic way on a newspaper report as was done elsewhere, but faced as we are with a gross libel on the Senate appearing in the press, the Minister leading, the Senate, without going back on his colleague, could have well upheld its dignity by dissociating himself from such language, by letting the public know that he does not approve of such statements, no matter from whom they emanate. Had he taken that course, no one at this stage of the session would have been anxious to interfere with the transaction of public business. Any one reading an account of what has happened here must realize that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Clemons</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> are upholding the gross libel on the Senate by the Prime Minister. We know that these gross libels are the stock-in-trade of his platform utterances. We know that he goes round to little places with his <inline font-style="italic">Telegraph</inline> and other reporters, spreading the most gross libels against the Senate, such as, to use his own language, &#34; one would not expect from a pot-house.&#34; When we find two Ministers in the Senate associating themselves with language of that kind, and refusing to repudiate it, the Senate ought to take, not moderate, but drastic, action, and that is to adjourn, say to the 10th January, or until such time as an apology is made to the Senate for the gross libel placed on it by the Prime Minister, and supported, as it has been, by two colleagues here, because a failure to repudiate the language or &#39;the libel associates them with it. The Senate will be lost to all sense of dignity and of public decency if it permits its business to be conducted for one hour by gentlemen who are not prepared to do what all leaders have done in the past. The seven .senators on the other side have been more than generously treated by an overwhelming majority, but what is the return that we get? We have suspended the Standing Orders at their wish, to enable them to get public business put through. We have taken every step to meet them in the transaction of public business. Even in regard to the very Bills that were sent up as an insult to the Senate, we &#39; have met the Government more than half-way. The Senate will fail in its duty if it does not take a drastic method of dealing with the Government, and that must be something more than censuring Ministers in the Senate, and then allowing them to go on with business. It must be a refusal to transact further Government business until such a time as an apology is offered, or a satisfactory explanation is made for the gross libel uttered against the Senate by the Prime Minister. </para>

                            <para>. - I am very sorry to hear any discordant note raised in the Senate at this late stage of the session. It appears to me that it could have easily been avoided if the Minister of Defence had, when the matter was first brought before him, given a more discreet answer and a less aggressive reply to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McDougall.</inline> I also wish to point out to my honorable friends on this side that it is not reasonable to expect that a Minister here will back down on a Minister in another place, especially on the Prime Minister. Therefore, I do not think it would be wise to move a vote of censure on <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> for doing what any Minister ought to do unless he is prepared to resign from the Cabinet. We must look at the matter in that light. When <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McDougall</inline> raised the question, the Minister of Defence, in his usual sneering tone, intimated that some time during the recess he would inquire from the Prime Minister as to the truth of the statement. </para>

If the honorable senator, even at that late stage, had indicated that he would immediately do something of that description, I am sure that it would have satisfied <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Rae</inline> and every other senator on this side. I have some feeling for <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> in the position he is in, and, therefore, if the present motion is carried, I would like to amend the motion given notice of by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Rae</inline> so as to give the Minister an ample opportunity of carrying out what is really his duty to the Senate and to every member of it. He ought to be prepared at any time to at least inquire into allegations of this description made against the honour and credit of the Senate. In the circumstances, when the motion for the suspension of the Standing Orders is carried, I shall move to amend <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Rae&#39;s</inline> motion. It is my intention to submit as an amendment that the Senate adjourn till to-morrow (morning at 11 o&#39;clock. Then the Minister of Defence will have ample opportunity to make inquiries, and when the question is repeated to-morrow he will be in a position to give an answer more befitting the position he occupies, and more in keeping with the reply which ought to be given to any request from a branch of the Parliament so important as is the Senate. </para>

                            <para>. - As the originator of this little storm, I might be permitted to say a few words. The statement of the Prime Minister to which I have taken exception was made on the 22nd November. I was travelling to New South Wales in pursuance of my public duties, and it afforded me a great deal of pleasure to be able to refer to the statement in question. I found it very useful. I have waited all this time for a denial by the Prime Minister. I always stated in my speeches that I did not know whether he said these things, but 1 was prepared for his denial of the report. My remarks to this effect have been published in numerous newspapers in New South Wales, and yet, in the three weeks which have elapsed, the Prime Minister has not attempted to deny the report of his utterances. I have thought it my duty to bring the matter before the Senate to see whether honorable senators are prepared to vindicate their honour. The remarks of the Prime Minister hurt me very much, not so far as I am personally concerned, but fancy the Prime Minister of the Commonwealth accusing -my dear old friend <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sir Albert</inline> Gould of using bad language! That is what hurt me. </para>

                                <para>- Look at our old friend the Vice-President of the Executive Council. I am sure that if the honorable senator were to hit his finger with a hammer in driving a nail, he would not even say &#34;Damn it.&#34; Yet we have the Prime Minister going out of his way to accuse these gentlemen of using bad language in the Senate. I have been a member of the Senate for some little time now, and I have never heard any bad language used here. I felt that it was very wrong that the Prime Minister should go out of his way to make such statements, and have them reported throughout New South Wales at a critical moment, accusing these dear and honorable friends of mine opposite with having used language that would not be fit for a pot-house. I do not know what a pot-house is; The Prime Minister may have a personal knowledge of a pot-house, and the language used therein. I have not that knowledge. I am told that people stand three deep in the bars of pot-houses in London, and that any language is permissible since a policeman could not possibly get into them. That suggests the inference that the language used in a pot-house is the worst that could possibly be used. I have not yet got over the hurt I felt that the Prime Minister should go out of his way to accuse my dear old friend <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sir Albert</inline> Gould of using language like that. </para>

                                    (South Australia) &#91;12.3&#93;. - The statements alleged to have been made by the Prime Minister are of such a character as to require that some notice should be taken of them. The honorable gentleman is reported to have said that the language used in the Senate is not fit for a pot-house. That is a reflection upon you, sir, as the presiding officer of the Senate, and it is also a reflection upon honorable senators generally, no matter upon what side of this Chamber they sit. This is not a party matter, as our honorable friends opposite are as much involved in the statement made by the Prime Minister as are honorable senators on this side. As the debate has proceeded, we have found the Leader of the Senate tacitly indorsing the statement attributed to the Prime Minister, and the Honorary Minister openly stating that he indorses that statement.

                                    If this statement as to the language used in the Senate came from an irresponsible person, we might overlook it. If it came from a member of the Senate, or a member in another place, or if it came from an ordinary Minister of the Crown, it might possibly be as well to let it pass. But coming from the Prime Minister of the Commonwealth of Australia, and reflecting upon every member of the Senate from the  President  downwards, it should not be passed over.

We are in the position that we do not know whether the Prime Minister made the statements attributed to him or not. I agree with

                                <para>- T - The Prime Minister has not been given that opportunity. We know that these reports of week-end meetings, when a speech of half-an-hour is condensed into a stick or two of printed matter, may not present the actual words used by the  speaker.  The course suggested by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor,</inline> that we should suspend the sitting to enable the Leader  of the Senate to consult with his chief so that we may know whether he made the statements complained of, and ii so, whether he has any explanation to offer with regard to them, is the best course to follow. But I do not think that it is necessary that we should suspend the sitting until 8 o&#39;clock this evening. The exigencies of the case might be met by a shorter adjournment. </para>

                                    GOULD (New South Wales) &#91;12.7&#93;.- I should like to preface what I intend to say by the statement that I deprecate remarks by members of any branch of the Legislature concerning the other branch, or the branch to which they themselves belong. It would be very much better if members of Parliament observed, as far as possible, the rule frequently laid down that there should be no reference made to another place which might have the effect of bringing about any acrimonious discussion. That is a good rule to apply in any statements we may think fit to make outside this chamber. The less we say about the House to which we do not belong the better tor all concerned. 1 wish honorable senators to realize that no matter what they may do in connexion with this business,- they will only be beating the air. What good can come of it? It has been alleged that certain statements were made by the Prime Minister. The Minister of Defence has been asked whether his attention has been drawn to them, and whether he will make inquiry on the subject, and he has said that he will make an inquiry.

                                    GOULD. - The Minister of Defence has explained that the reference to the recess did not apply to the inquiry he proposed to make of the Prime Minister. He said that he would probably read the newspaper report during the recess, but when asked whether he would bring it under the notice of the Prime Minister, his answer to that question was &#34; Yes.&#34; No Minister could be expected to say more. I say that it is in the highest degree unfair and unjust to attempt to force a colleague of the Prime Minister to condemn that honorable gentleman or any other of his colleagues for any statement he is alleged to have made.

                                <para>- The Minister has only three or four political followers in this Chamber. Is this ever done in regard to other matters <inline font-style="italic">1</inline> We are asked to suspend the Standing Orders. We are now at the close of the session, and we desire Parliament to be prorogued as soon as possible. I ask honorable senators whether an acrimonious discussion upon a matter of the kind is calculated to bring about harmonious relations between us? Assuming that we suspend the Standing Orders and pass a censure upon the Minister of Defence, shall we have vindicated our honour or brought the Prime Minister to book? Suppose that honorable senators opposite adjourn the Senate from time to time, what will happen ? By-and-by the Prime Minister will simply close Parliament, and it will go forth to the world that that action was rendered necessary because the Senate was not prepared to do what it ought to do. To my mind it is better that we should take no notice of statements made outside of this Chamber. </para>

                                <para>- I am not discussing what has occurred in another place. I want honorable senators to recognise that language has been used in this Chamber which is not calculated to excite the  pleasantest  feelings in the breast of the Prime Minister. I have heard remarks made of that gentleman which he would naturally resent, and which might reasonably provoke him &#39;into saying uncomplimentary things of the Senate. Take the debate which has occurred here this morning. Have not statements been made which any man would resent? </para>

I do hope that honorable senators will allow their common sense to sway them in this matter. We must always recollect that no matter what action we may take in this Chamber we cannot do anything effective so far as controlling the utterances of honorable members in another place is concerned. In these circumstances, why should we continue to idly beat the air ? </para>

                            <para>. - In this motion I think there are two questions involved. One is the action of the Leader of the Government, whose statement, as it is reported in the press, is undoubtedly a reflection on this Chamber. He is credited with saying that &#34; language has been used in the Senate which is only fit for a pot-house.&#34; Now, <inline font-style="italic">Webster</inline> defines &#34;pot-house&#34; as meaning - </para>
                        </talk.start>
                        <para>An alehouse ; an inferior or low tavern, or public house. </para>
                        <para>It is obvious that if the Prime Minister did make that statement he has reflected, not only upon the Senate, but upon its </para>
                        <para class="block">
                            <inline font-weight="bold">President,</inline>
                            because no honorable senator has been dealt with during the session for having used language of that character.&#39; Therefore, if the statement be true, the  President  cannot have given effect to the Standing Orders. The Minister of Defence was asked if he would ascertain from the Prime Minister whether he had been correctly reported. That was a perfectly fair question to put to him, and one which should have been answered in a calm way. The Minister should have promised to consult the Prime Minister instead of treating the question in a contemptuous fashion. The second question which is involved in this motion is - Is the Minister of Defence censurable because he will not dissociate himself from the words alleged to have been uttered by the Prime Minister? I do not think that he is. The Prime Minister is the head of the Government. He can dissolve the Government at any time by simply handing in his resignation. If the Minister finds that he cannot agree with the Prime Minister, there is only one course open to him, namely, to hand in his resignation.

We all have an opportunity of speaking upon this question, and I do not know that there is any necessity for us all to speak at once. I have a right to my own opinion, and I am simply stating it. At the same time, I do not see that there is any necessity for all these heated interjections. We are the guardians of the honour of the Senate, and if any person outside reflects upon this Chamber we are justified in taking any action that we may think fit. In the present instance, the statement to which exception is taken is alleged to be that of the head of the Government, and, therefore, it carriesweight. </para>

                                <para>- That does not justify us in acting upon such a report. Let us be as fair to our opponents as we would like them to be fair to us. All that we have before us this morning is a statement which is attributed to the Prime Minister, and which reflects on the Senate. The Minister of Defence might very well have assured us that he would bring that statement under the notice of the Prime Minister at the earliest possible moment, and ascertain whether or not that honorable gentleman had been correctly reported. That assurance, I understand, he has given in a somewhat defiant way. I was not present at the time ; but I am informed that the manner in which he gave it indicated that he regarded the matter as of no moment. </para>

                                <para>- The motion moved by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Rae</inline> would censure the Minister, and I cannot vote for it, because I think that the Minister could not remain in the Government and associate himself with a direct censure of his chief on a matter of this kind. What is more, we have before us only a newspaper report, and we do not know whether it is correct or not. It appears to me that the proposal submitted by the Leader of the Opposition affords the only way by which the Senate can - the subject having been brought under its notice - vindicate its honour, and show its resentment of terms of the character employed by the Prime Minister being applied to this Chamber. Therefore, I intend to vote for <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor&#39;s</inline> proposal. I trust that it will be carried. What is more, I agree with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gould</inline> that it would be well if these references to matters occurring outside were dropped. </para>

This is not the first occasion on which the Senate has been deliberately insulted by the same gentleman. I claim that it is the duty of the Leader of the Senate to protect its honour, and endeavour to maintain its dignity. To-day, when this matter was brought forward, had <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen,</inline> in reply to the question concerning the utterance of his colleague, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Cook,</inline> said, &#34; This is a newspaper report ; I do not believe it is true, but if it is true, I do not associate myself with it,&#34; the Senate would have been satisfied.

                                <para>- I withdraw it. I was giving that as an example. I have no doubt that many members of the Senate, in walking along the streets, have sometimes seen a little dog barking at the heels of a big mastiff, and seeming to say, &#34; Bite me if you dare, but if you bite me you are a coward.&#34; That little dog takes advantage of its weakness to defy the mastiff to resent its attitude. If I may be permitted to say so, that is practically the attitude which the Leader of the Senate has taken up in connexion with this matter. I feel that the Senate must, in some way, resent the insults that have been hurled at it by the Leader of the Government, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Cook,</inline> especially when the Leader of the Senate himself practically indorses those words by refusing to dissociate himself from them. </para>

                            <para>. - I should like to keep perfectly calm in the discussion of this matter. I think it desirable that it should be considered in a dispassionate way. There arises in my mind what I may, perhaps, call a hypothetical case. Suppose that a member of a House of Legislature publicly makes a statement that is considered to be disparaging to the House to which he belongs. Suppose that the Leader of that House comes forward, describes the statement as disparaging to the House, and that, on the strength of a newspaper paragraph, the member is expelled under circumstances that seem to some to indicate that the Chamber in question is violently indignant, and has risen in all its might to justify its honour. What is our position? We are to-day considering, on the kind of evidence that I have indicated, a charge infinitely more sweeping, and one which, if true, would disparage the members of the Senate to an infinitely deeper degree. Because I hold my honour as a man very dear. No man outside this Chamber has ever charged me with being a frequenter of pot-houses. No one has ever charged me with using language worthy of a pot-house. I have held that character unstained up to the present time. I say that my honour, as well as that of other members of the Senate, is impugned in those words of the Prime Minister. </para>

If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> feels that his honour is sullied by such a charge, are we to sit down calmly and pay no attention when our honour is assailed in language that has not been withdrawn ? </para>

                            <para>.- I will not keep the Senate very long, but there are some aspects of the matter to which I am entitled, even in this House, to direct attention. First, we have a motion brought forward by some honorable senators, who have lashed themselves into a frenzy of indignation because they allege that their honour has been assailed, though they have been mighty quiet about the stain upon their honour for the past three weeks, because this allegation, which has been brought forward here only to-day, first appeared in a newspaper three weeks ago, and, as shown by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McDougall&#39;s</inline> own statement, he has been nursing it in the meantime. </para>

He himself was well aware of it, but did not bring it forward before, although he now pretends to be lashed into a state of intense indignation about an assumed insult to his honour and that of the Senate. </para>

No more unfair question was ever submitted to a Minister than that which was put to me this morning by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch.</inline> I say that it was a designedly unfair question.

Those who have not restrained themselves in making allegations against me are indulging in a continual process of baiting rae when I am replying, as if they were becoming apprehensive. But I shall, as long as I am allowed to speak, put my case in my own way. They can, with their majority, refuse to hear me if .they like. </para>

He asked me whether I had read a certain paragraph, and then went on to read a certain portion of it. I said in reply that I had not .read it, but that I would do so. I candidly admit that I thought it was brought forward for the purpose of indulging in a little heckling, and was not regarded as serious, because if it had been serious <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McDougall</inline> could easily have handed the paragraph to me and let me have a look at it before I replied.

                                <para>- Ethics is a thing on which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Blakey</inline> and myself are not likely to agree. I am stating the matter, I think, fairly when I say that a question of that kind was one which ought not to have been submitted. The assumption is that when you put a question to a man, he is free to answer it. Supposing that I had indorsed the statement in the report, that I believed there was justification for it. Twenty-nine senators would have jumped up to move that I be suspended for contempt of the Chamber. This motion itself shows on what thin ice I am going every moment of my life when, because I will not repudiate my political chief, a motion is to be brought forward to censure me and to suspend business. </para>

                                <para>- The question was unfair in that sense. If I had repudiated the utterance of the Prime Minister; if I had ventured to censure him, it would have been an extraordinary action on my part to take. It is one which I am not prepared to take, and one which I will not take. On the other hand, supposing that, unfortunately, there was justification in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> for the statement which he made, and supposing that I, impelled by an almost irresistible attachment to truth, had said, &#34; I believe that he was justified in what he said,&#34; what action would the Senate have taken? If there is any fairness in honorable senators, let them consider that question. They would have either suspended me or expelled me until. I apologized for having given an answer to a question which could have been answered  in  no other way. </para>

                                <para>- I have done nothing of the kind. I have given neither one answer nor the other. So much so far as the censure of the Chamber is concerned as it applies to myself. Let me now deal with another aspect of this case. I have already pointed out that this matter has been allowed to rest for three weeks. I cannot resist the opinion that it has been brought in here to-day, not for the purpose of vindicating or removing any imaginary insult thrown on the honour of the Senate, but, in some way or other, to occupy time which otherwise would have been available to public business. For three weeks honorable senators have slept on this matter, and now, when there is a Bill with which they cannot delay dealing with much longer - apparently, they are frightened to come to a decision because there is a division in their ranks - they introduce a foreign matter to occupy time which ought to be devoted to public business. </para>

                                <para>- It may be remarkably funny to the honorable senator, but it is, to my mind, serious. If honorable senators opposite think that, by devices of this kind, they are going to put off the time when public business will have to be dealt with, may I say at once that they are making a very serious mistake indeed. There is public business to do. . The Government have accepted the obligation, and &#187;a responsibility rests upon them to see that the business is done. Therefore, while this motion may delay for a few days or for a few weeks the treatment of that public business, the Government will not waver, but will insist that an opportunity of dealing with the business be provided, if not before Christmas, then afterwards. I have dealt so far with the part which reflects upon myself, and, in conclusion, I do hope that nothing I have said will be accepted by way of an apology at all. I have not offered these remarks in that light. I feel this morning that the Senate has treated me, probably because it did resent the language which caused the original discussion, with a want of that fairness which I have a right to expect as a member of the Chamber, and which I might state, further, I have a right to ask, with an additional emphasis, by reason of the fact that we on this side stand in such an overwhelming minority. I do ask honorable senators - If there is ever a time when a man may appeal for fair play, is it not when he is in a minority? I ask honorable senators to put themselves in my position, and say whether any one of them, unless he was an arrant coward, would have ventured to give any other answer to the question of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch?</inline></para>

But in this case I have told honorable senators very frankly the unfair position in which they placed me by forcing that question. The only attitude I can take up is the one which&#39; I took up then, and it is that, in spite of anything that may follow, I decline to reply to the question submitted by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch.</inline></para>

                                <para>- The honorable senator says he has seen no evidence of fair play. Because the majority do not choose to agree with the minority surely that is not evidence of unfair play. I intend to make a brief reply. It is true that it is some weeks since the reported statements were made by the Prime Minister. During the interval, so far as I am aware, neither myself nor any of my colleagues in the representation of New South Wales has been in the Chamber. </para>

                                <para>- I wish that the Minister of Defence would not quibble, because we had not that opportunity. When we arrived in Melbourne, we were not aware that the Senate was to meet as I have explained, at other than the usual hour. Therefore, we were unprepared when we came here, and, as soon as we learned that the Senate was to meet in the morning, we determined to bring the matter forward. We came to that understanding, not by preconceived arrangement, but as the result of a remark made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McDougall</inline> to myself yesterday. The report in which the statement of the Prime Minister appears was published in the Sydney <inline font-style="italic">Daily Telegraph,</inline> of 24th November, 1913. The meeting took place at Parramatta on the previous Saturday; and the report is headed in this way - </para>

The Socialists had the country by the throat, and unless the grip was relaxed, the consequences would be direful. But what did the Opposition care? In the Senate it was happy enough - it was on strike on full pay. (Laughter.) A pity it was that the Senate could not be brought before the people.

                                <para>- That is so. I wrote out my motion in pencil in a very hurried manner, and not in the terms which 1 might have used if I had had more time. But I felt convinced, from the attitude adopted by the Minister of Defence, and the replies he gave, that it was his invention to ignore the whole affair, and to take no further action. Tt is true, as the honorable senator has claimed, that his promise to consider the matter in the recess&#39; was only made in reply to the question put to him by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McDougall.</inline> In reply to my question, he said that he would inquire about the matter in some way or another; I forget the exact words used. What I object to particularly was the suggestion that, in order to pacify me, the Minister intended to ask the Prime Minister whether the statement attributed to him was correct; but when he would have acquainted me with the result, the honorable senator did not indicate, lt is not an individual member of the Senate who is concerned, but the Senate as a whole, if this kind of abuse from outside is to be permitted to continue. I freely admit that I have not  been a model of good behaviour myself, and have not been &#34;very particular concerning what I said about any one, and especially about the Prime Minister. I have no doubt that exception might be taken to many things I have said, but 1 do not know that any member of the Senate has gone outside and spoken in an abusive and disrespectful manner of the House of Representatives. It is the attitude which the Prime Minister adopted towards the Senate as such, including you, sir, as the officer appointed to see that no &#34;pot-house&#34; language is used here, that made me follow up the question by the action I have taken. I quite realize the force of what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor</inline> and other honorable senators have stated, and that it might be advisable to, first of all, show the newspaper report complained of to the Prime Minister, in order that we might know whether he  repudiates it or Says that it should be modified in. any way. If he does not do either, I think it will be right for the Senate to take further action. I must altogether dissent from the views put forward by Ministers and by some ex-Ministers on this side. I think that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> went altogether too far when he made out that, because of the loyalty which is expected from one member of the Cabinet to the others, he should be prepared to indorse all that his colleagues may do. There is much difference between indorsing what a man&#39;s colleagues may do and say, and going out of one&#39;s way to condemn them. I never expected for a moment that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> would show any disloyalty to his colleague. The honorable senator has said that he is going to do things in his own way, and not as some one else wishes; but he formerly stated that he could not do otherwise than he had done, and that he must prove disloyal to his colleagues, or take the action he did. I think that the honorable senator might very well have made a general statement regretting that, in the heat of party conflict, statements should be made reflecting on either House of this Parliament. He could have done that without compromising his colleague, or his own dignity. The attitude the honorable senator took up was that because he was in a minority, it showed great courage on his part to defy everybody and everything, including the rules of common courtesy. He would have been well advised if he had promised to consult the Prime Minister, and had then, in a genera&#93; way, expressed regret that a member of either House should use such language as that complained of. </para>

                                <para>- I rise to make a personal explanation. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Rae</inline> charged me with saying in connexion with the loyalty of a member of the Cabinet to the Prime Minister that he should indorse any statements made by him. What I said was that the Minister of Defence could not be expected to disown or dissociate himself from statements made by the Prime Minister. </para>

                                <para>- I feel just as strongly on this matter as does any other honorable senator; but I take leave to doubt whether we are adopting the proper course. In the first place, I would point out that if the Prime Minister did make the remark which has been attributed to him, he made a most serious reflection, not only upon the Senate, but upon you, sir, as its  President.  In your hands, under the Standing Orders, is placed the control of this Chamber, and if any honorable senator had used language of the character described by the Prime Minister, I feel certain that you, sir, would have called him to order. Therefore, the charge, in the first place, is a most serious reflection upon you, and it is also a reflection on the Senate. The Prime Minister is alleged to have said that language had been used in this chamber which would degrade a pot-house. I have been looking up the dictionary, and I find that a pot-house is &#34;an ale-house,&#34; &#34; a low tavern,&#34; and if one cares to go into the ancient history of England, when pot-houses were very common, he&#34; will find that they were the resort of all the low, degraded, wicked, and thievish characters in the neighbourhood. He will discover that the language used there was the worst of Billingsgate, that obscenity was rampant, and that the people who gathered there used words which, if uttered in a public street either then or to-day, would assuredly land them in prison. That is the kind of language which the Prime Minister alleges has been used in the Senate. I say that this Chamber should have some respect for its own reputation, and also for your reputation as its  President.  But in this, as in everything else, we ought to begin at the beginning. At one time or another we have all been subjected to misrepresentation in the press. I have seen printed reports of speeches which I have made - reports which contained statements that were never uttered by me. Time and again that has been my experience, and 1 am sure that every honorable senator occupies exactly the same position. So much has that been my experience, that I never accept a newspaper report as an absolutely correct statement of what has occurred at a public meeting. Therefore, I say that the Prime Minister, like every other culprit, is entitled to the benefit of the doubt, and that the first step which the Senate ought to take, through you, sir, as its presiding officer, is to ascertain from the Prime Minister himself whether the report which has been read in this chamber is a correct record of his statement at that public meeting. </para>

                                <para>- But he has refused to do it, and I am not very sure whether it is the dufy of the Leader of the Senate. The honour of this Chamber is in the custody of its presiding officer. He is the one who should take the matter in hand if anything has been done to lower or degrade the reputation of the Senate, because he is the person who is primarily attacked. He is responsible for the maintenance of order, of decency, of good behaviour, of fair and reasonable debate, and for the observance of the amenities of debate. If any person in the position of the Prime Minister levels an accusation against the Senate, it is the  President  who ought to be intrusted with the duty of ascertaining whether he accepts the report as a correct one or not. If he does accept it as a correct record of his statement, it will then be for the Senate to decide what course it ought to adopt. In. the meantime, we are judging him on the most slender of evidence - evidence which none of us would accept as conclusive in regard to himself. </para>

It is quite within the bounds of possibility that the Prime Minister has never seen the report. In any case, it is our manifest duty to ascertain, &#39;before we do anything else, whether the Prime Minister accepts the report which has been read as a correct one or not. If we do not do that, . we shall be adopting a system of justice which was very prevalent at one time in a part of Scotland - what is known as Jedburgh justice. There they hanged a man first, and tried him afterwards. We want to give every man fair play. Justice is the rock upon which the Labour movement is built. </para>

                                <para>- Is any direct request to be made to the Prime Minister? The Minister of Defence says that he will not make any such request, and I say that it is not his duty to do so. It is the duty of the  President.  A charge has been levelled by the Prime Minister against the  President,  who is not only the custodian of his own honour, but of the honour of the Senate: To him ought to be relegated the duty of ascertaining from the Prime Minister whether the latter did say what is attributed to him. </para>

                            <para>. - This appears to me to be a very simple case. It arose out of a newspaper report which was read by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McDougall,</inline> and which purported to reproduce the language used by the Prime Minister in reference to this Chamber at a public meeting. I do not wish to traverse what has been said. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Rae</inline> proposed to censure the Leader of the Senate for his apparent indorsement of the Prime Minister&#39;s utterance. That motion has now been withdrawn, and in its stead a proposal has been submitted for the adjournment of the Senate as a protest against the language used by the Prime Minister, and its apparent indorsement by the Leader of this Chamber. We all know that the Minister of, Defence has been in close conversation in our presence with the very gentleman who is alleged to have used this offensive language, and he can ease the position by rising in his place and telling us whether or not the Prime Minister was faithfully reported. In the absence of that explanation - knowing as we do that the Prime Minister and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> have been in consultation together - the responsibility for the adjournment of the Senate will rest upon the Leader of this Chamber. He could have got up and said that the Prime Minister never used those words, or that he himself did not indorse them. But in the absence of any information from the Leader of the Senate, I shall vote for the adjournment. I wish to give one other chance for the Leader of the Senate to say whether the Prime Minister was rightly or wrongly reported, and whether, if he was rightly reported, he himself indorses the utterance of which complaint has been made. </para>

First of all, the motion is that the Senate adjourn until 8 o&#39;clock to-night. That is an unusual course. Eight o&#39;clock is an hour to which we do not usually adjourn when we are going on with ordinary business. What does it mean? As far as I can understand, it implies a protest. </para>

                                <para>- I am not concerned for my reputation whatever it may be, good or bad. But I am concerned with the position which the Senate itself is in. I am seriously concerned with that. I think we shall be making a great mistake in adopting this procedure. If, however, nothing that I can say will have the slightest weight with honorable senators opposite, I do not wish to say anything more. It is certainly not a pleasant task to be discussing the question at all. I am only speaking because I thought that, after we had carried our procedure to this extent, and had debated the matter for &#39; nearly two hours - that after we had suspended the Standing Orders - honorable senators opposite would think that they had given to the matter, however important it may seem to them to be, every consideration that it deserves. They have succeeded in directing a great deal of attention to it, and I thought that they would be content with having arrived at the point which we have reached. I hoped that anything which I have said, or which I left unsaid, would have resulted in clearing up the difficulty. But if honorable senators opposite are determined to carry the adjournment till 8 o&#39;clock, I have nothing more to say, except that I should like to have a clear understanding as to why we are taking this course. </para>

I said that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> has practically indorsed the statement of the Prime Minister. I called attention to his utterance. After stating his own case, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> made the statement - alluding to the alleged statements of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Cook</inline> - that, probably urged by an irresistible desire for the truth, he had said so-and-so. These words &#34; urged by an irresistible desire to express the truth &#34; were substantially what he said. </para>

But whatever he may have done in relation to the rules of the Senate, it does not follow that he did not imply meanings which honorable senators would have a perfect right to interpret as a reflection on the Senate. I contend that I have as much right to my opinion as to the meaning of the words he used as to you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. President;</inline> and I certainly understood that what he said was an underhand - and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> is a master at making statements which contain under -  hand inferences - indorsement of what <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Cook</inline> said, even though he may have escaped conflict with the rules. . We all know that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> has an ingenious way of saying things to convey implications which, if plainly stated, would be in conflict with the rules of the Senate. </para>

It is strange, under the circumstances, to say that- 1 am &#34; interrupting &#34; the proper course of debate in venturing to put my own view. I say again that I do think that I am entitled to ask the Senate to tell me clearly what this motion is intended to mean. Honorable members opposite started out with a motion of censure on myself. It was a motion aimed at a condemnation of something that I have done, or failed to do. </para>

                                <para>- Yes, it was, and that by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> himself, the Attorney-General of the late Government. I will show that when the proper time comes. What I am trying to elicit from <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor,</inline> however, is a clear statement as to why the Senate is asked to take this course of action. If it is merely for the purpose of ascertaining the truth or otherwise of this alleged statement of the Prime Minister, then there is no  justification for stopping the public business, for the transaction of which this Senate exists. I could quite understand that if honorable senators took a certain view, they were justified in expressing their condemnation of the utterance of the Prime Minister. I could even understand it when they further proceeded to the great and extreme length of proposing a motion condemning myself. But I fail absolutely to find any justification for stopping public business while certain steps, which the Senate wants to have taken, are taken. This morning, sir, you informed the Senate that it was vested with ample power to protect its own dignity and honour. It does not require to stop public business while that is -being done. There are matters of privilege which can be raised in a proper and regular way. Just what the powers of the Senate are I do not know, sir, but I am quite satisfied with your affirmation that it is vested with ample power to look after itself. </para>

Nothing that I can say or do will satisfy <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bae</inline> or those who think with him. I gave the honorable senator a clear, definite statement as to what I would do. He was not prepared, and his colleagues were not prepared,, to take that assurance. There can be no disputing the fact that the assurance was a definite one, because <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor</inline> now says that the object of adjourning the Senate is to enable me to redeem it. Here is a clear admission that, early this morning, I gave a distinct assurance that I would do all that it was in my power to do, all that I am prepared to do, all that I am competent to do, and that is to bring the matter under the notice of the Prime Minister. It was disputed at that time that I had given that assurance. It is no longer competent&#39; to honorable senators to dispute it. </para>

                                <para>- I will withdraw anything, sir. When <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Rae</inline> tells me that I made a statement to-day which he and others did not believe, it was tantamount to saying that I was telling something which was not true. If you, sir, object to me saying that that is telling a man that he is a liar, I withdraw the statement; but I leave it to the common sense of honorable senators to point out where the difference is. I think that, in this matter I can complain that the Senate has treated me in a grossly unfair fashion. A question was submitted to me, and I gave an answer which I have given in hundreds of cases where information has been sought. It is not in my power to compel an answer to my inquiry, but I did promise the Senate to make inquiries, and intended to do so. </para>

                                <para>- I intended to give the Senate the result of the inquiries I proposed to make, but it was not possible for me to do anything more. I am not armed with authority to arrest persons and drag answers out of them. In all sincerity, I undertook to make certain inquiries, but honorable senators have treated me in a most unusual and unfair fashion, and, having declined to follow the usual procedure, I am unable, therefore, to regard this motion as anything more than a make-believe, an effort to block public business for some motive of which I am not disposed to speak. </para>

                                <para>- We will see for how long. I hope that it will be only for two hours. I do submit that, if the Senate merely wanted to vindicate itself,  it could have succeeded in that object by placing on record a motion expressive of its disapprobation, either of the Prime Minister, or, if it pleased, of myself, or it could have proceeded, by way of privilege, under the powers which you, sir, say it possesses, and taken such action as might have seemed fit to it. But, after <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Rae</inline> questioned me, the effort clearly was to use me by some means in a quarrel which the Senate is disposed to take with the Prime Minister, to use me as the instrument in forcing that quarrel home. That is a monstrously unfair position to put me in. No answer that I might have given to the question of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> could have avoided putting me in trouble. </para>

                                <para>- A - As a senator, I have always prided myself upon being able to give fair play to any member of the Senate, and not to act with want of courtesy even if opposed to me in politics. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> has said that he has been treated in a distinctly unfair manner. I repudiate that statement. The whole of this turmoil could have been avoided if he, at the right time, had treated the Senate with that ordinary courtesy which it, as  a  body, might expect to get from the Leader of the Government here. I think that the position, instead of being as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> put it, is absolutely reversed. Two wrongs do not make a right, and if, on any other occasion, any honorable senators have not treated him with courtesy, that does not relieve him of the obligation to treat the Senate as* a body with courtesy. </para>

I am very sorry that it has developed to this stage. I intend to vote with the leader of my party on the motion. Still I say that the whole matter, going back to the first cause, has-been lifted into  a  prominence which it never deserved. As I said before, the Prime Minister, for months past, has been so much in the habit of making wild, unfounded statements about, his political opponents, that  the public are beginning to attach no importance to them, and the additional statement of the kind he has made takes away any weight which they might have had. It is because I think that we are elevating the whole question into a position of importance it does not deserve, and giving to the Prime Minister a position of importance he .does not deserve, that it seems to me rather a pity that the question has advanced to this stage. While holding that view, I intend to vote for the motion to give <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> an opportunity, if he feels inclined, to consult the Prime Minister, and then we shall see what the outcome is. </para>

                                <para>- If the Honorary Minister would restrain his youthful impetuosity, I would explain to him in a few words, but he is only prolonging the agony. Every honorable senator knows that when this matter was first brought before the Senate by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McDougall, Senator Millen,</inline> in the most indifferent and flippant manner, said he would read the &#34;newspaper report during the recess. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Clemons</inline> knows that, and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> knows it. Later, when the members of the Senate had been aggravated by the conduct of the representatives of the Government here, and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Rae</inline> put a question, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> did say that he would bring the matter before the Prime Minister. But there was nothing definite in that, and the Senate required something more definite. If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> had given that reply to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McDougall&#39;s</inline> question, the whole matter would have ended there. Senators Millen, Clemons, and McColl have had ample opportunity to interview the Prime Minister and the Attorney-general, because they were both here consulting with them after the discussion had started. But they never made any attempt to indorse, repudiate, or explain the conduct or words of the Prime Minister. I think that Senators Clemons and Millen ought to be very thankful to the members of this party, and particularly to myself, because the motion that was moved by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Rae</inline> was a direct censure upon <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen.</inline> Probably, the honorable senator would have liked that motion to be carried, because the matter would have ended there. But I think the sense of fair play amongst honorable senators led them to consider that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen,</inline> to a certain extent, was not responsible for his action. He was conducting himself like a little boy who, having been chastized, became petulant. The Senate has its own dignity and reputation to maintain. Ministers have directed attention to your statement that we have ample opportunity of dealing with these things, but I remind them that the Senate is dealing with this matter in the way it thinks best. The intention is to give <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen,</inline> or any other member of the Ministry, an opportunity, before 8 o&#39;clock this evening, the time suggested for the resumption of the sitting, to bring the matter before the Prime Minister, and when the Senate resumes, the representatives of the Government in this Chamber will be in a position to explain whether the Prime Minister was correctly reported or not. If he was correctly reported, and still maintains the same attitude towards the Senate, it is my intention, with the consent of the Opposition, to move that you, sir, on behalf of the Senate, interview the Prime Minister, and endeavour to get a proper understanding between that gentleman and the Senate. The Government profess to be very anxious that business should be proceeded with. Where is the business that we could not finish in half-an-hour if we were really in earnest? The anxiety of honorable senators opposite should be transferred to another place, in order that we may be put in a position to carry on the business. The Senate has assisted the Government on every occasion to do the business of the country, and I am sure that it is prepared to continue to do so when; there. is business here to be done. </para>

                            <para>- This morning, when we were discussing the motion for the suspension of the Standing Orders, I, while endeavouring to illustrate what I considered to be the attitude of the Leader of the Government in the Senate, was interrupted in the middle of a sentence and ruled out of order. I subsequently gave, in another form, exactly the illustration which I had been endeavouring to give, and it was found to be entirely inoffensive. I should not have thought it necessary to refer to the matter again, had not <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen,</inline> by way of interjection, when some one else was speaking, said that I had called him &#34; a cur.&#34; I wish to explain that I did not call <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> a cur. The thought was never in my mind that he was anything of the sort.I did not really mean to say anything offensive to him. </para>

                                <para>- Early in the proceedings this morning, I gave the assurance to the Senate that I would inform the Prime Minister of what had been stated here, and ask him whether he was disposed to make a reply to the question submitted by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Rae.</inline> Later in the day the Senate, or a section of it, having expressed a doubt as to whether I would carry out that promise, I stated that I felt absolved from it. However, with a view of removing any possible obstacle to the transaction of public business, I decided to carry out the promise which I originally gave, and from which I had not at that time any intention to depart. In pursuance of that promise, I addressed a letter to the Prime &#39;Minister, and have received a reply. I deemed it advisable to address the Prime Minister in this way rather than verbally, in order that the Senate might be fully and exactly informed of the case that I placed before him. The letter, of course, is of to-day&#39;s date, and reads as follows: - </para>

                            <para>.- I am not going to question the statements which appear in the apology made by the Prime Minister for the language he used concerning the Senate, but I think that, in justice to those members of Parliament whose names are mentioned, the least the Minister of Defence could have done was to indicate the pages of <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> where those statements are alleged to appear. Personally, I am perfectly satisfied with the apology the Prime Minister has tendered to the Senate, and with the statement he has presented, which indicates that, after the careful search of to-day - a search of six hours - they can only discover one reference made by one senator, namely, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Rae,</inline> to which <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Cook</inline> has been able to take exception. Surely that expression would not be termed anything in the nature of a grossly offensive statement. It was, of course, used in the heat of debate. It did refer to the Prime Minister in strong language - in such terms, indeed, as would justify the Prime Minister in asking <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Rae</inline> to &#34; call him that again.&#34; However, I feel sure that we are complimented by the explanation and apology made by the Prime Minister.. </para>

Any reflection that I may have cast upon <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen,</inline> as far as relates to the imputation that he did not intend to bring the subject before the Prime Minister, I must honestly withdraw under the circumstances, and I do so fully and freely. At the same time, may I make these two remarks in regard to the letter which we have heard read? Without questioning the correctness of the statement said to have been made by honorable members in another place, I point out that we have not had quotations of the violent language used by honorable members on the other side of that House. </para>

                                <para>- No, I do not desire to say anything of a flippant character on this subject. But there is a broad distinction between statements, however offensive, which may be made against an individual member of Parliament, and general statements which reflect upon a whole House of Legislature. That is a broad distinction which ought to be made. The statements of the Prime Minister contained a reflection, not only on individual members, who may have been deserving of strong reproof, but on the whole Senate; and they reflect upon the  President  of the Senate, who, if he permitted that sort of language to be used, would be much more blameworthy than honorable senators themselves. I, therefore, contend that we have a very good reason for reprimanding the offence committed by such a responsible man as the Prime Minister, which referred to the whole Senate in connexion with what were no more than individual expressions of opinion. </para>

To show how little there was to base his wicked statement on he actually fell back on all the strong language which was used in the House of which he is Leader, and used, too, in the heat of strong party debate. </para>

                            <para>- That such a collection of epithets should be brought here by the Minister of Defence in the way it has been, is, I think, typical of the manner in which Ministers are trying to degrade, not only the Senate, but the whole Parliament of this country. When the Senate asks whether a certain statement of the Prime </para>

                        <para class="block">Minister published in the press - a statement which no honorable senator, no matter where he sits, can for a moment justify, because it does not bear the semblance of truth - was true, what answer did the Minister of Defence bring back? It is that the Prime Minister delivered a speech at Parramatta, and had in his mind at the time an enormous number of strong expressions used against himself personally in the other branch of the Legislature. But, so far as the Senate is concerned - and. I have no doubt that <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> has been searched for strong expressions - only one instance has been cited. I suppose that if 1 were to attempt to adopt the language of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> I should try to excuse the letter from the Prime Minister by saying that it was &#34; an irresistible desire to tell the truth &#34; which caused him to use language of that kind. But I do not want to enter into a contest as to which side can best abuse the other, and gain a little advantage in the use of strong terms. What good is to be gained by the Leader of the Senate trying to excuse or bolster up the unpardonable conduct of the Leader of the Government in attacking the Senate? What good purpose is to be served by the Leader of the Senate recording in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> a collection of strong statements used in another branch of the Legislature? We have nothing to do with those statements. I do not think that in his letter the Minister of Defence asked the Prime Minister to recapitulate all the harsh things said in the other Chamber. Owing to the fact that the Prime Minister has not denied the statement, we must discuss it from the stand-point that, at a public meeting to serve his own party purposes, he deliberately slandered the Senate, and that when faced with the slander he is unable to prove it, but neither he nor <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen,</inline> so far as I can gather, has had the manliness to apologize. When a wrong has been done there is only one manly course to take. If a man cannot prove his statements he ought to have the manhood to apologize to the person whom he has slandered by making a false statement. According to  the letter read by the Minister of Defence, the Prime Minister has wilfully slandered the Senate, but has not had the manhood to apologize to it for having done so, or to withdraw his statement.

I would like the Minister of Defence to make it clear that what the Prime Minister now says in excuse of the statement attributed to him in the Sydney <inline font-style="italic">Daily Telegraph</inline> is that he was not blaming the Senate, and that language worthy of a ot-house did not emanate from the enate only, but came from the other House as  Well.  That, to some extent, mitigates perhaps the stronger things I have been saying about the Prime Minister. </para>

                                <para>- The letter, I take it, if it means anything, means that the Prime Minister, brought by the action of the Senate face to face with the fact that he made a gross and wicked charge against the Senate, is unable from the records of Parliament to show that, as regards the Senate, there is even the flimsiest foundation on which to build such a charge. I regret that the honorable gentleman has not in a straightforward and manly way admitted that, and explained that, at the time, he was suffering, shall I say mentally, from the abusive language heaped upon him, elsewhere. Honorable senators must know that, in the other House, he also can use strong language. If I may be permitted to recall an incident which occurred when I was sitting in the gallery there, he was compelled to withdraw a statement, and to apologize, because he had referred to two honorable members on the other side as &#34; a pair of dirty rats.&#34; It is on record that he had to withdraw the expression, and to apologize. </para>

                                <para>- If ever the time of the. Senate is always put to the good use of vindicating its honour and character, whether it takes, not days, but weeks, I shall never consider that the time is wasted. When we started out this morning, we had placed before the Senate a charge by the Prime Minister, which, owing to the important position he occupies, will not only find its way into the press of Sydney, but into the press of the world. It will be used by the press of the world as a &#39; criterion by which to measure the character, the capacity, and the ability of those who represent the Australian people here, and indirectly it will be used to measure the intelligence of the Australian people themselves. If the Senate has done nothing further than to vindicate its honour, I shall be satisfied, because, in the long list of strong language that is cited in the letter from the Prime Minister - evidently a carefully prepared letter - there is just one harsh statement, with nothing of a pot-house character about it, from my honorable friend&#39;s old colleague in the Labour movement, which, perhaps, goes beyond the bounds of ordinary debate. </para>

                                <para>- As the statement of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> conveys the false impression that I refused to sign the pledge of the Labour party, I desire, m personal explanation, to say that in 1891 I went to the State Parliament a pledged Labour man, and that in 1894 I was selected by the same Labour league, and sent back as a pledged Labour man. I was in the State Parliament until 1895. In justice to my own reputation, I am making this statement. Prom 1894 to 1895 I was a pledged Labour man, and I never attended one party meeting of the party with which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> was connected. I do not wish to get off on a side issue. Personal issues are nothing in a discussion of this kind. Here is a case in which the Senate has been grossly attacked by a gentleman who, when he is faced with the true facts, can produce only one instance of a senator having said something personal about himself, as a justification for having libelled the Senate in the eyes of Australia and the world, as being a place where the language used is below the level of a &#34; pot-house.&#34; I feel that a good deal of time has been taken up over this matter, but not wasted, because the very letter from the Prime Minister proves that his statement published in the <inline font-style="italic">Daily Telegraph</inline> regarding the Senate is not in accordance &#34;with facts, is not a truthful utterance, is not the utterance that a man holding a responsible position should have used in that relation. I hope that the &#39; Minister who conveyed so generously the request to the Prime Minister for a statement will let him understand that, having admitted by not denying it that he was guilty of uttering a most wicked and slanderous statement - calculated to take from the Senate its reputation - we loo&#39;k to him, from his place in the other House, to go one step further. Now that he has not produced one proof to substantiate the statement he made at Parramatta, we&#39; look to him to do the manly thing, and that is to apologize to the Senate for the gross outrage he committed in stating that the language emanating from it would disgrace a &#34; pot-house.&#34; I only wish to place on record the fact that this letter, which tries to bolster up an impossible position, proves that the Prime Minister was guilty, at a public meeting in New South Wales, of uttering a deliberate, and, I venture to say, a premeditated untruth, and that when <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> is examined by himself he can find no ground to substantiate it, but he has not had the manliness to come forward with a full apology for the wicked, malicious slander he uttered. </para>

                            <para>.- I feel almost called upon to apologize for the effort I shall make to prick the bubble of assumed indignation which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> has just blown. In the course of his remarks, he admitted that if the statement I interjected was correct, then his remarks largely went by the board.  His  contention was that the Prime Minister stood by the published report of his speech, although only able to find one quotation from the records of the Senate in justification of it. I just want to draw the attention of the Senate to the exact words which were used in the letter I read. And may I say that, in seeking a reply from the Prime Minister, I assumed that the Senate wanted to know, first of all, how far it was an accurate report of his speech. The reply to that is what he said - </para>

                        <para>. - At this late hour of the session many of us doubtless feel inclined to treat this leaflet legislation with contempt. But we cannot forget that this Bill was bludgeoned through another place, and that the representatives of the people there were denied an opportunity of expressing their opinions upon it, and of putting before Parliament the views of the electors whom they represent. Therefore, it is only natural that every honorable senator should desire to express his opinion upon it. In the first place I ask, &#34; Why has this measure been introduced?&#34; To that a reply was given by the Leader of the Opposition in this Chamber, when he said that it constitutes a deliberate attack on unionism. The desire of the present Government is to wipe unionism out of existence, because they realize its power in Australia to-day. We know perfectly well that there would not be one member of the Labour party either in the Commonwealth or the State Parliaments if it had not been for trade unions. The occupants of the Treasury bench also recognise that, and they desire to put back the hands of the clock - to stop the progress of unionism, and at the same time to stop the progress of this country. We are not at all surprised to find them bringing forward legislation of this character, when we reflect that they have been sent here to represent the interests of a class. Not only are they sent here to represent the interests of a class, but the so-called Liberal party have paid organizers travelling throughout every part of the Commonwealth - Liberal agitators they are generally called - who are endeavouring to the best of their ability to stir up class disputes, and, if possible, to breed class prejudices. We all know what unionism has accomplished in different industries. Previous speakers have referred to the improvements which have taken place during recent years in industrial conditions. To realize -this we have only to visit the cemetery at Broken Hill and look at the thousands of graves&#39; there - graves containing some of the finest men in Australia who were absolutely murdered by the industrial conditions which existed twenty and twenty-five years ago. We know that the conditions which obtain there to-day will bear no&#39; comparison with those which, existed at the period of which I speak. That improvement has been brought about by trade unionists, by the enthusiasm of those who for twenty-five years have made self-denying efforts to better the condition of their fellow workers, and to make things better for their children. </para>
                    </talk.start>
                    <para class="block">Let me point to the great pastoral industry as an illustration. Unionism has been the means of bringing about industrial peace in that industry, where there previously existed industrial war. Surely honorable members upon the opposite side of the chamber will admit that the pastoralists have gained more on account of the industrial peace which has been brought about in that industry than have the workers ? At the same time, the condition of  the worker in the pastoral industry still stands in need of a good deal of improvement. I intend to quote the remarks of a representative of the workers who was engaged in one of the sheds in New South Wales during the recent shearing season. The extract which I propose to read has a distinct bearing upon this Bill. In referring to  Toogimbie  Station, near Hay, he says - </para>

                        <para>The sleeping quarters, apart from the fact that it is utterly inadequate as regards space and bunks, is built in a swamp, and although we were fortunate enough to experience fine weather, there were several cases of sickness. The cook&#39;s quarters are also situated in low ground, and all through the shearing there was a pool of stagnant water lying at one corner of the hut. The oven in which most of the food was cooked was <inline font-style="italic">a</inline> crumbling mass of mortar and bricks, consequently one had to separate this from the dishes. The meat house is composed of scrap-iron and bagging, principally bagging, and is a miniature reservoir when it rains. The floor, being composed of ashes, is renewed every time there is a shower. The sanitary conveniences are disgraceful. This is absolutely the worst place I have ever been at; but one cannot wonder, seeing that it belongs to one of the  family  of land monopolists of this district, to wit, R. &#34;Falkiner, brother of the present member for Riverina. </para>

                            <para>- From the Sydney <inline font-style="italic">Worker</inline> of 17th September, 1913. Can <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gould</inline> contradict the accuracy  of those statements? When I find that the Pastoralists Union have direct representatives in this Parliament who are endeavouring to retain for themselves the opportunity to treat their men in that manner, I am not surprised that the present Government should introduce legislation of this character for the purpose of crushing unionism. Unfortunately, there are not many men in the Liberal party to-day who take the same liberal view of unionism as does the present Postmaster-General. . I find that he is prepared to admit that there is good in trade unions. Every thoughtful man will recognise that in any industry it is better to deal with one representative of the employes than it is to deal with every employe individually. In speaking at the opening of the Conference of the Postal Electricians Union yesterday, the Postmaster-General said - </para>

                        <para>He found it much better to come into direct, touch with the men, as by this means he could find out the root of their troubles. He preferred to get the employes&#39; grievances at first hand, as they always suffered in coming through the Department. He was anxious to do the right thing in every case, and would assist the union in every legitimate way. </para>

                    <para class="block">If he is prepared to support the union in every legitimate way, the best way in which he can do it is by extending to its members that preference to which he admits they are entitled. The men, by their self-denying efforts, have built up that union, which is of great assistance to the Department. Surely, after the statement of the Postmaster-General he will recognise that we will be doing our duty, not only to the trade unionists outside, but to the people of Australia, if we reject this Bill. I wonder at the change of front that has taken place amongst members of the so-called Liberal party. Only a few years ago some of them were advocating preference to unionists. They declared, not only that a preference should be- granted if a majority of the workers in any particular industry were unionists, but that it should be granted if a minority of unionists were employed in that industry. For instance, on page 7655 of <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> for 30th November, 1904, I find that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Fowler,</inline> the present  Chairman  of Committees in another place, said - </para>
                    <quote>
                        <para>If a preference were extended to a very considerable number, some of the non-unionists might very well object that it would seriously interfere with their prospects of employment; but where the organization making application comprised only a minority of those engaged in the occupation which it represented, I, as a non-unionist, should regard that rather as an advantage than a disadvantage. Tt should be shown, at all events, in a way that has not yet been attempted that the granting of preference is bound up in the giving of it to a majority of those engaged in the industry affected. It ought to be shown that the granting of a preference to a minority would be something in the nature of an injustice ; but no honorable member opposite has yet attempted to prove anything of the kind. </para>
                    </quote>
                    <para>Yet we find the Government declaring that preference shall not be granted to unionists, even if almost every person employed upon a work be a unionist. Take the case of the transcontinental railway an example. The men employed upon that work are . undoubtedly members of unions. I do not think it would be possible, at either end of the line, to find a non-unionist to-day. The Government intend to let a great part of that work on contract. The result will be that the contractor may be compelled under the Conciliation and Arbitration Act to grant preference to unionists, whilst persons employed upon that work who are in Government employ will be denied that preference. Those of us who believe that better and cheaper work can be accomplished under the day-labour system than under the contract system decidedly object to that position. We do so for the reason that if a contractor is obliged to extend a preference to unionists whilst the Government are not obliged to do so, the contractor will secure all the good men. The Government will get only the &#34;  riff-raff,&#34;  because all the good men are to be found in the unions. We all know that at the present time there is a union in Melbourne- some persons refer to its members as the &#39; &#39; Packerites &#39; &#39; - which is a &#34;scab&#34; union, a union that is subsidized and paid by the  Employers  Federation to destroy and break down genuine trade unionism. Many members of the Liberal party attend meetings of this bogus union, and deliver addresses to its members. The object of this Bill is to get the &#34; Packerites &#34; into the employ of the Government, and to squeeze out the unionists who are there at present. I know what has been the policy of the so-called Liberal party ever since the inception of responsible government in this country. It has not been one of preference to unionists, but of preference to non-unionists, and if I thought that this Bill would achieve its professed object it would, I say, be a good measure. But what will be its effect if it be placed upon the statute-book? Will not a preference be granted to non-unionists? I do not for a moment believe that a member of a union will have an opportunity of getting employment under the Government whilst a Fusion Government remains in power. The Bill will be only so much waste paper. The non-unionist will come along, and the head of the Department will know whether he is a unionist or not. After all, what is to be the penalty if a Minister is found to be granting a preference to non-unionists or to unionists ? What is to be the penalty if the head of a Department is found granting a preference  to non-unionists or to unionists? Is there any penalty provided in this Bill ? If a Labour Government were in power, and an Act like this stood upon the statute-book, it would, of course, be carried out to the letter. But there is no occasion for the Bill. Our object is, frankly, to give preference to those who have done so much to improve the industrial conditions of all classes in Australia. It is not only the workers who have benefited from the labours of the unions. Every business man, every shopkeeper has benefited as largely as the workers themselves. I hope that the Government will persist in endeavouring to obtain a double dissolution bv means of this Bill. I am satisfied that it was never intended that the machinery of the Constitution should be used to bring about a double dissolution purely for party purposes. Indeed, I doubt whether the Government are so anxious for a double dissolution as they profess to be?. A week or so ago I spent a fortnight in New South Wales. During that time I explained this Bill to the audiences whom I addressed. People said, &#34; Is that how the Government are carrying out their promises to remove the burdens of taxation from my shoulders? Is &#39;that the measure with which they -are going to bring down the cost of living?&#34; The people are anxious for an opportunity of dealing with those who have- so betrayed the trust reposed in them on the 31st May last. But 1 am convinced that the Government are not anxious for the dissolution. They will not go to the country till they get a mandate from their masters - till the Beef Trust and the Sugar Trust are satisfied that there is a prospect of their winning. The order will then be given to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Cook</inline> and his party to go to the country. The trusts will refuse to find the money till the time is opportune. The Government will have to obey the mandate given by the trusts whom they so faithfully represent in this Parliament. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Cook,</inline> at Albury, admitted that the Beef Trust and the Timber Trust are carrying on operations in Australia. </para>

The appeal will be made to a thoughtful and intelligent people, who have watched the growth of the Labour party for the last twenty-five years, and are aware of the improvements made in the condition of every section ot the community. The people will say, as they said in 1910, &#34; We are satisfied that they took up a proper stand .when they said that they refused to put upon the statute-book of the Commonwealth an insult, not only to the trade unionists of Australia, but to every thinking man and woman.&#34; </para>

                        GOULD (New South Wales) &#91;9.8&#93;.- It is time that some one said a word or two on the other side. A great deal of mist has been thrown over this Bill in the speeches delivered by honorable senators opposite. I will not say that there has been wilful misrepresentation, but I do say that honorable senators are absolutely mistaken in regard to the main object of the measure. The Bill is intended to do an act of justice to the people of this country, and not to penalize trade unionists. We know perfectly well, notwithstanding what honorable senators opposite have said about our desire to put down trades unionism and all the rest of it, that nothing of the kind is intended. We recognise the value of trades unionism when conducted on fair and legitimate lines. But we do not sympathize with the unionism that would not permit men to express or to hold their own political  views without having a hand thrust at their throats, and being told that unless they are prepared to swallow the opinions dictated to them they are not worthy of being regarded as unionists. In other words, we believe in trade unions as honestly conducted, but not in political unions. I strongly believe in combinations of workmen for the purpose of securing benefits for themselves in their own trade. Men have a right to combine. But when they go a step further, and insist that a man shall not hold his own political views, they are going beyond the line which marks what is fair and righteous. This Bill simply states that, as far as Government employment is concerned, no preference shall be given to any one. In other words, whether a man is a unionist or not, if he seeks employment under the Government, and his services are required, he shall, if the best-qualified applicant, be employed. That is the only fair Way of giving employment. The Government are trustees for the public. The expenses of government are shared by every person in the community, whether unionist or non-unionist. If the Government had put a Bill before Parliament to provide that only non-unionists should be employed, honorable senators would be perfectly justified in scouting it. But the object is to do a simple act of justice, and to undo an act of gross injustice in the form of the Executive act, which laid it down that no man should be employed in the service of the country unless he belonged to a union. Many men, perhaps mistakenly, do not believe- in joining unions. If they choose to assume that attitude no authority has any right to say to them that they shall not receive employment. How was preference in Government employ introduced in the first instance
                        <inline font-style="italic">1</inline>
                        It was not introduced in the open light of day,- but by a subterfuge. It was introduced underhand by Executive act. We are aware that that act has been set aside by the present Government. But when they go out of office a Labour Government may come in and reverse that decision. Here, however, is a Bill laying it down that preference shall &#39; be illegal. If it becomes an Act, and it is desired to make a change, that will have to be done in the open light of day by means of a further Act. Honorable senators opposite started the debate on this measure yesterday morning. They have since been very much concerned to point out that the Bill is a miserable little bantling, which ought to be laughed out. They say that it does not matter whether it is passed or not. Yet they have been opposing it most earnestly and consistently. If they had seen fit to take a division as soon as the second reading had been moved, and the Leader of the Opposition had replied, they could have &#39;defeated the Bill hands down. Why have they been opposing it so energetically, and yet pretending that it is of no use? There must be some object. I do not believe that they have been speaking merely for the pleasure of hearing their own voices. But they think that this gives them an opportunity of placarding before the people what good unionists they are, and how they stood up for a principle which has not been attacked by a single honorable senator.

                            <para>- I say that there is an honest desire to do justice to every man in the community, irrespective of his political views. It is important that the people of Australia should realize the fact that, no matter what Government is in power, this Bill will make it illegal to refuse to give fair consideration to every individual who is an applicant for employment. We are told that by means of this Bill it is intended to bring about a double dissolution. If that be so, let honorable senators vote against it; let them knock it out. Do not let them try to save their face by putting in some petty amendment which will enable them to say, &#34; We did not knock it out; we put in a&#39;n amendment to explain more clearly what we wanted.&#34; I should not be in order if I alluded to another Bill which they treated in that way. But let honorable senators come out in the open, whether the Bill leads to a double dissolution or not. Let them vote against it. There is a fair number of honorable senators who, if they exercise their own independent judgment, would knock it out at once. I say, as one of those who is going to support the Bill, &#34; Let them do so if they wish.&#34; If my honorable friends are prepared on each measure to bring the two Houses before the people, well and good. </para>

That is political tactics. A brave party of twenty-nine men want to save their faces, and that is the courage they are going to display. If honorable senators wish to have a fair fight over the Bill, let them do the straightforward thins; - vote against the second reading - and they will then have an opportunity to fight. </para>

                        <para>. - I suppose that all of us have watched the course of a stream flowing, to an ocean. We have seen how a little headland, jutting out, will cause a whirlpool, and perhaps in a little while divert the course of the stream. In human affairs there is a stream of human evolution from the savage to the civilized man. There have been little diversions in that course of evolution. In the state of industrial evolution we find the same thing. Events have happened which for a while have apparently set back the clock of time, but gradually the broad stream has overcome the obstacle, and flowed on stronger than ever. This little obstacle in the stream of evolution is to be compared to the dropping of a mosquito into the Amazon. It will have no more effect. Is it not singular that society emerged from barbarism in regard to some things hundreds, of years before it did in other things? It emerged from barbarism in respect to property long before it did in respect to human rights. Looking back over the history of civilization, we find that, in respect of property, at one time the rule of force was in existence. We find that the man who was strongest could take the property of another by the use of the club; might was right. </para>

                            <para>- Yes. &#34; And they should keep who can.&#34; But a time came when the property owner began to find that that was an expensive process,, and he did not believe it to be a just one. So society said, &#34;Let us do away with the reign of force, and have the reign of law; let us reason together, and if property has to be taken by one from another, let that one establish his claim to it before a judge.&#34; In that way, civil disputes emerged from the barbaric reign of force into the reign of law, and to-day the man who tries to take away my property by force will find himself in a criminal dock. Yet it, is singular that, in respect of human rights, the doctrine of force still obtains. We have the history of industrial evolution, which is simply the same story of the evolution of the reign of force to the reign of law, repeating itself in the industrial evolution of the race; because, if you starve a man, you are compelling him to do something by force just as truly as if you compel him to do it with a club. </para>

                            <para>- I shall come to that stage presently. Because, even under the reign of law it is necessary to have compulsion behind the law to make it effective. In our law we have to take away from the freedom of the individual in order to obtain freedom for society. In most civilized societies today we  see the greatest amount of law, and the greatest amount of interference by the law- with individual freedom; and yet the apparent contradiction is that in those very societies we have the highest freedom and the greatest liberty. My point is that, under the existing economic system, we have the employer and the employe. They are producing the wealth. And the industrial unrest throughout the world exists because of the disputes between those two classes as to the division of that wealth. That struggle has been going on ever since society evolved from barbaric times. It is intensifying as society becomes more and more interwoven under the methods of production. We have reached a stage to-day where that problem is becoming more and more complex. As soon as society began to reach that stage, those who had only their labour to sell found that by individual bargaining they were unable to stand up against the force of those who were buying ^ their labour, because the buyer of labour could bargain individually with those who had their labour to sell, and the person who was nearest to starvation lines fixed the rate of pay for the labour, not only for himself, but for all those who were in the labour market. So we had the struggle between Labour on the one hand and Capital on the other; Capital always fighting for individual bargaining, and Labour, as it became conscious of  its power, always fighting for collective bargaining. The barbaric weapon of force was used. The capitalist usurped and held to himself the right to say, &#34; If you will not work for me for the wages I fix, for the hours I name, and under the conditions I lay down, then I will lock the door of my factory. I will send you off my farm, and you must go elsewhere to work. I will &#39;not give you work. I will not give you wages.&#34; The employe, using the same method, said, &#34; If you will not give me the wages I want, the hours I desire, and the conditions I prefer, I will refuse to work for you.&#34; Learning the secret of combination - that in combination there was strength - the workmen came together, and formed trade unions. In those days, when the Parliaments were composed of capitalists, when the workers had no vote or voice in the making of the laws, what did the capitalist do? He made laws to prevent a combination of the workers, because he recognised that by collective bargaining the worker was placed in a better position to get from him a fair deal and a just wage. The Old Land has numberless Statutes, passed under the reign of the capitalist class, to restrict the right of the worker to combine. The capitalists recognised that so long as they could prevent collective bargaining, the power to fix the wage was theirs. They recognised that so long as they held that power the worker was in their hands, that each could fix his conditions absolutely, that an overstocked labour market placed the worker helpless in the hands of those who wished to buy his labour. In this land we realized that there were two methods by which the principle of collective bargaining could be utilized, namely, one through the industrial organization, and the other by political action through the industrial organization, because the worker saw that, whilst industrially he might be strong, and whilst through the industrial organization he might be able to get conditions that were good, wages that were fair, and hours that were reasonable, if he allowed the political machine to remain in the hands of the class that was exploiting him, politicians could take from him, through the laws, every advantage that he gained through industrial action. So, from 1891 onwards, the workers of Australia decided that not only would they work collectively and take collective action to protect their interests through the industrial organization, but that they would also combine that with political action through the industrial organization. We have reached this stage, that Australia and New Zealand are the first two countries to do in the industrial arena what every civilized country in the world has done long ago in the civil arena. They have decided that labour disputes shall no longer be settled by force, but that these, too, shall be relegated to a Court of law, and that a Judge shall decide which of the two disputants has right and justice on his side. That has found expression in the Arbitration laws of New Zealand, New South Wales, and Western Australia, in the Wages Board law in Other States, and, lastly, in the Common: wealth Arbitration . Act. That simply brings the worker and the employer under industrialism to the same stage of civilization that we have reached in civil disputes. It has simply said to the worker and &#34;the capitalist, &#34; If you dispute over the sharing of the wealth you have produced, you shall not settle that dispute by means of the lock-out and the strike; you shall go before a Court relating to industrial matters, and the Court shall settle that dispute for you.&#34; I can understand those who, recognising that that is against their class interests, are opposed to these industrial tribunals altogether. There are people, as there have been all along, who have fought strenuously against the passing of these measures, but the onward march of political thought has swamped them, and they have to recognise that now society will not allow barbarism to continue any longer in industrialism, that it has come to realize that law must obtain there just as it obtained in every other sphere of human activity. Having reached that stage, we find that those who, up to this time, have opposed the passing of such legislation, finding themselves defeated, have concentrated their efforts in two directions. One course they adopt is to mangle this legislation, to make it ineffective, and by hindering its free operation to make it, if possible, unpalatable to both worker and employer. Let us consider this question of arbitration. First of all, an arbitration law presupposes collective bargaining. </para>

In my opinion, the question arises under it whether the members of unions shall be recognised and given preference. I am unable to see how I could restrict the debate so as to exclude almost any reference that might be made to the methods and the benefits to the community of unions. </para>

                            <para>- I propose to show that this Bill is a blow at the- principle of unionism, and a blow at the principle of arbitration. I have said that an arbitration law is impossible without unions. There must be some one who can be brought before the Court. We cannot deal with hundreds of thousands of individuals. We must bring them before the Court in their collective capacity. Therefore, the operation of an arbitration law is impossible without the existence of unions. If society decides that arbitration is preferable to the strike and lock-out, then society says that we must have- unions. Here is the employers union on the one hand, and the  employes  union on the other. The employes union desires better wages, shorter hours, and better labour conditions. To attain that desire they must, under our arbitration law, approach the Court, file their claim, and submit their evidence. They must put into the box their witnesses, who must be employes of the employers, who are the defendants in the case if it be one cited by a workers union. We must remember that the employers have a right to withhold employment from the men who go into the witness-box to establish the case for those who are asking for higher wages, shorter hours, and better conditions. They have the power, if they are not prevented from exercising it, of absolutely starving those men, and of compelling them to leave the country. </para>

                            <para>- It. is a common experience of unionists. I have established the fact that if we are to have arbitration we must have unions. If the employers wish to prevent a case coming before the Arbitration Court, there is only one thing which they need do, and that is to prevent the establishment of a union. If they can prevent the establishment of a union, a case against them can never come before the Court, and they can fix for themselves the wages and conditions of labour. How can they prevent the establishment of a union?  A union is a corporate body. It must have a  president,  a secretary, and &#39;other officers. It must hold meetings, and must express itself in the form of resolutions which must go forward in the name of its officers. If the employers can say, &#34; We shall not employ any man who is, to our knowledge, a member of a union or an official of a union,&#34; they can not only prevent the formation of a union, &#34;but destroy a union after it has been formed. </para>

That being so, we have to ask ourselves the question : Is society in favour of arbitration, or is it not? Does it wish to go back to barbarism and the force of the strike and lock-out? If it does, wipe the Arbitration Act off our statute-book. That is the invitation I give to my honorable friends opposite. </para>

                            <para>- We have a law against burglary, but burglaries are still committed. There is not a law on our statute-book that is not broken by somebody, and let me say that very many of the breaches of the Arbitration Act have been brought about by the Conservatives represented by our honorable friends opposite, who have designedly introduced provisions into the Act to make it unworkable. I have shown the way in which employers may prevent arbitration, although Parliament has said there shall be arbitration. I can go further, and say that they have done it, not once, but a hundred times. Within the last two years we have had that proved by sworn evidence given in the Arbitration Court, established by Parliament, in the gas-workers&#39; case, the boot industry case, and more recently in the Brisbane tramway case, beyond all possibility of doubt. We have had it established tha/t, designedly and for the purpose of preventing the establishment of a union in order that a case might be brought before the Arbitration Court, employers have discharged the officers of a union as fast as they were elected, and their men, as soon as it was ascertained that they were members of a union. Now as to the application of what I have said to this Bill. In the last Parliament, we decided that the employes of the Government should have, the same rights as the employes of any private firm to bring the Government of the country - their  employer - before the Arbitration Court, and to ask the Court to decide whether the claim they put forward regarding their wages, hours, and conditions of labour is fair or not.  We must remember that the Government, as an employer, are to-day launching out into services which are beyond the ordinary services conducted by a Government. </para>

                    <para class="block">They are launching out into industries, and are, in many cases, taking the place formerly occupied by private employers. If the Government are to have a privilege which we deny to the private employer, and are to be permitted to do what we refuse to allow the private employer to do, I say that, to be honest, we should put the private employer in exactly the same position as the Government, or we should put the Government in the same position as the private employer. If we compel the private employer, as we do, to give preference to the members of a union, we should put the Government in exactly the same position. I have always contended that &#34; preference to unionists &#34; is a term designedly applied to describe the position by the enemies of arbitration. It is really a misnomer, and what is intended is the protection of unionism. It means, not only the protection of existing conditions under which labour is carried on, but for the labourer, unionist and non-unionist alike, every advantage that may be gained by the unions. </para>

                            <para>- We adopted the term of the enemies of arbitration, and in that, I think, we made a mistake. However, that is only a question of nomenclature, and is of little importance, whilst the principle at stake is of very great importance. The present Government have not the courage to go before society and say, &#34; We are against the rule of law for the settlement of industrial disputes. We believe in barbarism and the reign of force. We desire to put back the clock of time&#39;. We want to refuse to the workers the rights given to every individual in civil disputes.&#34; They have not the courage to do that, but they say, &#34; We want to put the employer in a position in which he will have an advantage over the employe.&#34; They wish to give him the opportunity of individual bargaining. They wish to make collective bargaining impossible, either by direct action or by legal action through the Arbitration Court, because if they can destroy the union they can, not only prevent it bringing a case before the Arbitration Court, but can prevent the workers from doing anything collectively in connexion with industry. The attitude of the Government in this matter is a mere hypocritical pretence. The Government are opposed to arbitration, and are ,in favour of freedom of contract. They wish to give the employer in this country, whether the Government or  a  private employer, the right to go to the man who is nearest to the starvation line and let him -fix the wages for the class to which he belongs. They wish to do that, but they have not the courage to come out and openly say so. They are proposing to sap the ramparts which society has built up between the employer and the employe, and upon which they can fight out before a Court of justice their respective claims. How do the Government commence their operations? First of all, by bringing forward  a  specious piece of sophistry. They say, &#34; Here is a certain amount of money contributed by all the taxpayers of .the country.&#34; Then they say that when that money is expended in the carrying out of public works, since it has been contributed by the whole of society, the whole of the workers in the community, nonunion and union alike, should be allowed to share in its distribution. That is  a  beautiful piece of sophistry. </para>

                            <para>- This money is to be shared by the workers who carry out the work. The same thing is done by the private employer, who gives a certain amount of employment for which he pays the money he has accumulated as the result of the labour of those who have worked for him, or of those from whom he obtained it. The same argument might apply there. The men who are working for the private employer may not have contributed any of the money which he pays for the work done for him. It  may have been obtained from quite other sources. The man who works for the Government is not treated as a taxpayer, but has precisely the same relation to the Government as the man working for a private employer has with that private employer. What does it matter to me, as a worker, whether I am starved by the Government or by a private employer? It is no consolation to me to know, if I am sweated, and the wages paid me are insufficient, if I am married, to enable me to bring up a family and educate and clothe my children properly, that that condition of affairs is imposed upon me by a Government. In my capacity as a worker, I should look upon the Government merely as an employer, and I should have the right to adopt exactly the same attitude towards them as I should be entitled to adopt towards a private employer. </para>

                            <para>- I do not know so much about that. We have a Government in the State of Victoria who are employing men in the railway service of the State at 6s. per day. I defy any man to marry, and rear a family decently - to live as a human being ought to live - with the present price of commodities in Melbourne, on 6s. a day. In the relationship between the worker and the employer, the Government stand in exactly the same position as does the private employer. The reason why we are opposed to this Bill is that, as the Government Service extends, the unions will have to speak, and will have to present their case against the Government before the Arbitration Courts exactly as they present it against the private employer. I venture to say that, generally speaking, Governments will give their employes a better deal than will private employers. But, if they should not deal justly with them, what are we going to have? Are we going to have the employes of the Government striking, or are we going to say to them, &#34; You must bring your dispute before the Arbitration Court &#34; ? If we say that, in order that they may be encouraged to comply with the law and to form a union, we must give protection to those who take upon themselves the responsibilities of office in that union, and who speak for its members. Otherwise, we shall have it said, &#34; Oh, So- and-so is an agitator ; he is always advocating an increase of pay &#39; &#39; ; and the head of the Department may say, &#34; Get rid of him.&#34; But it may be that that man, in making the representations that he does make, is acting only on the authority of the workers who have elected him to a position in his union. In principle, unionists say, &#34; You shall not get rid of that man, because he is merely voicing the collective opinion of those whom he represents.&#34; When employment is offering, we have on the one hand the man who has sacrificed his time and his money to build up a union which will enable our arbitration machinery to work satisfactorily, and which will prevent strikes and industrial disputes by availing itself of the legislation which Parliament has enacted for that purpose. On the other hand, we have the non-unionist, of equal ability as a workman, but one who has done nothing to provide machinery to make our arbitration legislation work satisfactorily. In all justice, which of these two should be granted a preference by the Commonwealth ? Surely it is the man who, recognising the law that the Commonwealth has enacted, spends his time, his money, and his energy, to provide the machinery which will enable that law to work rather than the individual who, by the fact that he is a non-unionist, would make that law absolutely useless and unworkable. To my mind, that is the sole reason why the Labour party must fight such principles as this whenever they are presented. As society is recognising that we have emerged from barbarism, even in industrial evolution, the day will come when people will look back on these debates and wonder that educated men, with the history of events behind them, could ever be found to stand up and practically advocate reverting to that barbarism which has long ago been dissipated in civil disputes, and in every other walk of life. </para>

                    <para>.- This Bill, which has been in circulation for some time, is a very simple one, and one that does not affect the Senate. It is a measure relating to the appointment of a Committee of Public Accounts, and applies only to the other branch of the Legislature. As honorable senators know, each House, at the beginning of every session, appoints Select Committees with certain functions that are usually described by the titles of those Committees, just as the Committee proposed to be constituted under this Bill will deal with the public accounts: But there are differences between them. As honorable senators are aware, the Committees that we appoint last only for a session. In this Bill, it is proposed that the Committee of Public Accounts shall last for the life of the Parliament. </para>

This Committee will deal with matters which are purely financial ; and, while I am not in the least desirous of minimizing the powers of that branch of the Legislature of which I am a member, I recognise that our Constitution gives the power to initiate money Bills to the other Chamber. We have to recognise that the custodian of the public purse is the House of Representatives, and that the Senate is not the custodian pf it to an equal  extent. </para>

                        <para>- I do not wish to occupy the time of the Senate by amplifying what I have already said in that connexion. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Rae</inline> is aware of the constitutional position as well as I am. The House of Representatives, I believe, with the concurrence of both parties, desires to have the power of appointing this Committee. But, inasmuch as its tenure of office will be different from that of an ordinary Committee, the introduction of this Bill has become necessary. I do not wish to quote precedents with a view to binding any honorable senator. But for this Bill precedents are to be found in Victoria, New South Wales, and in the House of Commons. In the Legislative Assemblies of New South Wales and Victoria there are Committees of practically an identical character. In the House of Commons there has been such a body in existence for some considerable time. In New South Wales and Victoria it has been found, even by members of the Legislative Council, that the existence of a Committee of Public Accounts is a necessity, and many tributes have been paid to a similar Committee in the House of Commons. I offer these as precedents which should guide us in deciding this question. I do not think I need occupy more time in dwelling upon the Bill or its provisions. There is one power that it is necessary to give such a Committee, namely, the power to take evidence upon oath. I move - </para>

                        <para>- I cannot remember all the efforts that are being made by this Government to fulfil the very extensive promises they made to the electors during the last campaign. I should like to have heard the Honorary Minister speaking in opposition to the measure. I am sure that he would have clearly pointed out that it is absolutely unnecessary, because this Parliament has provided for an Audit Commissioner, who has a very extensive staff for the purpose of looking after the accounts of the Commonwealth. I am not going to oppose the Bill, however. It is of so little consequence that it does not matter whether it is placed upon the statute-book or not. But I differ entirely from <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Clemons</inline> when he says that the Bill only concerns another place. In the Commonwealth, we are entirely different from the three great countries to which he referred -Victoria, New South Wales, and Great Britain - probably the three greatest countries on earth, with one exception; and, of course, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie</inline> knows what the exception is. The Second Chambers in New South Wales, Victoria; and Great Britain differ entirely from the Senate of the Commonwealth. The financial Bills that come before us may be classified under three heads. First, there are measures such as the Appropriation Bill and the Supply Bills, which relate to the ordinary annual services of the Commonwealth. We do not need a Public Accounts Committee to deal with them. The Senate cannot make amendments in Bills affecting the ordinary annual services, though it may make suggestions. . Secondly, there are the Bills granting Supply for works and buildings. The Senate has exactly the same power of amendment in connexion with Bills of that class as the House of Representatives has. There is a third and distinct class of measures, such as Loan Bills, as to which the Senate has precisely the same powers as the House of Representatives has. </para>

Seeing that it could only deal with works and buildings, and with Loan Bills, and seeing that the Senate can make amendments in those measures, if any honorable senator moves an amendment giving the Senate representation on the Public Accounts Committee, I shall support him.

                    <para>. -  I can welcome this Bill, although to a large extent it duplicates machinery already existing. We have appointed an Auditor-General, whose duty it is to scrutinize public accounts, and he provides a fairly good means of ascertaining  how  the money voted by Parliament is expended. But still I welcome the measure as an additional effort supplementing that watchfulness which the Auditor-General is exercising over the expenditure of the money of the taxpayers. While I agree that a Public Accounts Committee ought to be constituted, and therefore receive this Bill as a move in the right direction, I find myself at variance with the proposal of the Government in so far as it proposes that&#39; only one branch of the Legislature shall have a voice in the composition of the Committee. I cannot understand why the Senate, which is co-equal with the other branch, even in respect of money Bills, should be excluded. We have dealt with many taxation measures in the past, and by the exercise of the power of request which the Constitution gives to us we have made our voice very effective indeed. Though nominally we cannot amend money Bills, nevertheless we have a very effective way of securing amendments by insistence on our requests. Having that power, which has been recognised in the past by the other Chamber, how are we to regard this Bill, which proposes to strip the Senate entirely of all voice in and connexion with the scrutiny which the Public Accounts Committee is to exercise? This Bill seems tc me to have some curious indefinable connexion with what has been said so often by some of those who are standing behind  the present Government concerning the Senate. The Treasurer, for instance, has said on more than one occasion that the Senate is useless ; that it is failing to fulfil its functions, and that it is not carrying out the responsibility cast upon it by &#39;the Constitution. <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> Forrest on several occasions, in Western Australia, cast a deliberate slight upon this Chamber, and sought to reduce it in the eyes of the electors in importance and status. Having those declarations from members of the present Government, I feel that I am doing nothing more than exercising my right in drawing attention to the fact that this Bill appears to have a close connexion with the antipathies that have been manifested by Ministerialist&#39;s towards the Senate as a co-ordinate branch of the Legislature. The Minister has given us parallel cases from New South Wales, Victoria, and other countries. </para>

                        <para>- Quite so. The Minister, relying on that stock of knowledge to which we must always bow when he expresses opinions on such a subject, omitted to refer to the Senate of the United States of America, existing under a Constitution which was, to a large extent, a pattern from which our Constitution was copied. In the United States of America the Senate is a much stronger branch of Congress than is the other Chamber. The Minister might have referred -to that body in telling us what is intended to be done under this Bill. There the Senate, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Clemons</inline> knows, has powers such as are not exercisable by this Chamber. It has the exclusive power of ratifying treaties which the House of Representatives does not enjoy. It has the exclusive right of indorsing the appointment of ambassadors and other high officials. It has the power of ratifying the appointment of other officials, even down to country postmasters. </para>

                        <para>- Yes. Those powers are far in excess of those which this Senate possesses. But while that is true, it affords no warrant for curtailing the powers which the Senate does enjoy, as this Bill proposes to do. I have foreshadowed an amendment, the object of which is to give the Senate representation on the Public Accounts Committee. As the Constitution does not forbid the exercise of such powers, I maintain that we ought to push our rights to the full. We ought not to yield an inch to the controlling authority which this Chamber possesses. The Bill is, to my mind, a clear and deliberate attempt to bring about the surrender of powers which the Senate now enjoys. I do not like to base my assumptions on mere surmise. But I must call attention to the fact that the latest development in the politics of this country is that members behind this Government repeatedly speak slightingly of the Senate, referring to it as a Chamber that has failed to fulfil the expectations of its founders. I think that there must be some connexion between the feelings expressed in the past and this measure, which places a slight on the Senate. </para>

                        <para>- I hope not. I think it is time that we lived down this surviving relic of constitutional practice, that one Chamber can exercise an exclusive supervision over the taxpayers&#39; money. It originated in the days when the House of Commons was alone the sole mouthpiece by which the people could express their wishes. The House df Lords never sprang from the people - never was representative of them - and that is why the House of Commons  always enjoyed an exclusive control over the public purse. The off-shoots in the British Dominions have followed slavishly the standard set up in the Old Country. </para>

                        <para>- It was quite right and justifiable in the Old Land, but circumstances here are entirely altered. The causes which justified one Chamber having exclusive control over the public purse no longer obtain in Australia. The Senate is based on the broadest foundation on which a representative institution ever existed. It only exists by reason of the fact that the adult men and women throughout Australia, without  disqualifications, have expressed the desire that we should be here, and by no other means. Enjoying such a representative capacity and character as we do, I entreat the Minister not to push this Bill in its present form through the Chamber. </para>

My proposal is that the Senate shall be represented by three members, and the other Chamber by four members, each complement of representatives to be selected and appointed by their Chamber, and each Chamber to have control of its own component part. I accept the principle of the Bill. I believe it is a good one, although it may be a bit superfluous in a sense. At the same time, I insist that the Senate should not suffer the slight which the Bill will unmistakably cast upon it if it is passed in its present form. I hope that my amendment will be taken into sympathetic consideration by honorable senators. </para>

                    Lynch  has said, and I think that the Committee will probably do some good if its functions are properly carried out. One good thing that it will do will be to secure to its members a more intimate knowledge of matters involving public expenditure, and the business training which will come to them will be very valuable in discussing finance. No member of the Senate should be deprived of the opportunity to acquire that experience and intimate knowledge of the public accounts which will be gained from membership of the Committee. It is, to my mind, most peculiar that in a purely non-party measure any question of casting a slight on the Senate should have ever entered the heads of those who framed and introduced the Bill in another place.

I said just now that I would give favorable consideration to his amendment, and I am going to do so.

He may not like it, and I do not necessarily say that I do, but I am putting before him a practicable proposition. If &#34; he were to propose that the Committee should consist of five members from the other House and two from the Senate, he would, whether we like it or not, be carrying out as nearly as possible the proportion that obtains between the two Chambers. </para>

                        <para>- Good. There is also a little difficulty which can be got over, but it has to be got over. The powers to be conferred on the Committee are, as the Bill stands, to be defined by the other House by Standing Orders. That answers the inquiry of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Rae,</inline> too. If the Committee is to be composed of members of both Houses, there will hare to be some alteration made in that regard, because we cannot permit the House of Representatives, by its Standing Orders alone, to define the powers which the Committee will exercise. The Senate must have some say in the definition and the allotment of the powers. There are two ways of carrying out that idea. One way, of course, will be to incorporate a provision in the Bill. But I am not prepared at this moment to draft a provision, and I am not sure that it is the most desirable course to adopt. There is another way, and sometimes I think we find it a very convenient way, and that is to act by regulation. I cannot at the moment suggest anything better. </para>

                    <para>. - I wish to say a few words in reply to what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Clemons</inline> put forward when inducing <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> to accept the principle of a smaller number for the Senate than for the House of Representatives. I think the honorable senator is proceeding upon very unsafe ground. He might not be so well satisfied if later, in connexion with some matter of a party character, the same principle of representation were followed. I think it is a mistake to lay down a rule that, because there are seventy-five members in the House of Representatives, that House should have five representatives on the proposed Committee, and because there are only thirty-six members in the Senate, the Senate should be represented by two. On the same line of reasoning, we might later on, when dealing with other matters, think it necessary to object to the constitution of a Committee in that way. </para>

                        <para>- I cannot say what will happen in another place. In the constitution of Committees of this kind it is the invariable practice to give representation to the separate parties in a House. That can best be done by the Government submitting nominations. If it is left to a ballot, unless there be very close supervision beforehand, it might happen that the selection of the two Senate representatives would be from one side. It should be remembered that if the method of nomination is adopted, the Senate will have control of the matter, will be able to relent an objectionable nomination, and make a fresh nomination. I submit, in the circumstances, that appointment by nomination is the better plan to adopt. As an argument which I am sure will appeal particularly to honorable senators on the other side, if the system of election by ballot were adopted, a Government having a majority might exercise their brutal strength in order to secure that all the members appointed should be from their own side. </para>

I am sorry that I do not get more credit for my complacency, softness, and disposition to give in when I am asked to do so. I do not consider that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen&#39;s</inline> argument is conclusive. We are being asked to agree that of the two members of the Committee to be appointed from the Senate one is to represent the sacred seven, and only one the twenty-nine honorable senators on this side. I think that the principle of election should be adopted in these matters, and I am not satisfied that considerations as to the side from which the members should be appointed should prevent the adoption of that principle. </para>

Another Act  may be passed dealing with this matter, and it is necessary to safeguard it. Perhaps, as if another measure is passed to deal with the matter, we can consider its provision so far as it affects this measure, we may, in this matter, leave the future to look after itself.

I admit that it was debated here at some length, and that on the motion for the third reading of the Bill I endeavoured to induce my honorable friends opposite to restore it to the measure. I failed in my efforts, but I do not fail to hope that, after the consideration which this measure has received in another place, they will recognise the advisableness of adopting the course which I suggest. I still think that it is an appropriate clause to put in this Bill, and that its insertion will prove of benefit to the Commonwealth, so far as all those finances are concerned which are employed in the purchase of stores. </para>

There are many members on both sides of the House of Representatives who think that it is a good clause. The Bill has been returned to us from that Chamber without any division, and I would urge <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor</inline> to withdraw some of the harsh criticisms that he offered when the provision was previously discussed here, and to overlook its defects in view of the fact that he himself recognises that it possesses many merits. He stated that it was a good provision, but that it was in the wrong place. Practically, that was the whole objection urged by the Opposition to it. </para>

                    <para>. -  I am pleased to hear  all  the nice things which the Honorary Minister, has said about this amendment.  I  agree that nearly all the members of the Opposition have admitted that it would not be  a  bad thing to establish a Supply and Tender Board. But we do not want to create such a Board under  a  Bill of this kind, which does not specify its functions, its composition, or its control by Parliament. When dealing with a Supply and Tender Board we require to have before us a Bill setting out these particulars. I am quite sure that if that were done the Government would receive the support of many members of the Opposition. I would further point out that the reasons given by another place for asking us not to insist upon our amendment are not correct reasons. It is stated that there are Supply and Tender Boards in existence in Victoria and New South Wales, and an endeavour is made to induce us to believe that those Boards were constituted under the Audit Acts of those States. When the measure was previously under review in this Chamber, it was pointed out that that was not so. They were constituted under the Public </para>

                    <para>.- I had the opportunity of hearing the Attorney-General put his views upon this question before another place, and I came away more convinced than ever that in rejecting the clause the Senate had done the right thing. The need for a Supply and Tender &#39;Board is very great, but it must be constituted in such a way as to command the approval of the whole Senate. I hope that we shall take a division on this question, and that it will be dealt with in the same prompt way that it was dealt with on a previous occasion. No argument has been adduced to alter the attitude which I then took up. My complaint on that occasion was that we were passing a measure of such far-reaching importance that it should receive full consideration at the hands of the Senate. What was the position? The clause affirmed that the Auditor-General should have the control of the purchase and supply of goods. To my mind, his functions should be restricted to seeing that all moneys expended have been properly expended. He  should  not have any voice in the purchase of goods. His duty is to  Bee  that the purchases made are properly accounted for, and that no money has been spent for any purpose other than that for which it was voted. I am of opinion, particularly on questions of  finance,  in which the Auditor-General is concerned, that we cannot be too careful to avoid complicating his functions. It is upon that officer that we have to depend for the correct auditing of all the accounts of the great Departments of the Commonwealth, whose expenditure is annually growing, and will continue to grow. We know very well that, without being required to undertake the purchase of materials, the Auditor-General&#39;s time is fully occupied. That is abundantly proved by the fact that his report was presented to Parliament, only about three days ago. </para>

                        <para>- I quite realize that. No less an authority than the Minister of Defence pointed out recently, at Grenfell, what an iniquitous position that was. He blamed the late Government for the fact that the Auditor-General&#39;s report had not been presented to the last Parliament until the closing hours of the session. The fact that that officer&#39;s report was presented to this Parliament only a few days ago convinces me that he already has ample work to engage his attention and that of his staff. If we associate him with a Supply and Tender Board, I fear that we shall not get a report from him at all. There will be no occasion for it. The whole business of Parliament will be conducted under regulations, which will empower him to have a voice in the purchase of stores and supplies, in addition to requiring him to audit the public accounts. I have no intention of &#34;stone-walling&#34; this measure, but I do hope that those who rejected the clause on a previous occasion will repeat their action now. </para>

                        <para>. - I wish to ask the Minister of Defence a question. If he is not able to answer it to-night, perhaps he will obtain the information later.  Can he tell me who is supposed to be in charge of those employed on the Jervis Bay Naval College works? Is it the gentleman known as the Supervising Engineer, and, if so, is the timekeeper associated with him in the management of the labour conditions? My reason for asking the question is that I am given to understand by some dissatisfied workmen that the timekeeper, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. J.</inline> C. Wilson, exercises considerable influence in all matters brought before the Supervising Engineer. He puts in his appearance, and interferes in such a way as practically to &#34; boss the situation,&#34; to put it in the vernacular. Is that done  with the concurrence of the Department, or is the Supervising Engineer supposed to be in Bole control? </para>
