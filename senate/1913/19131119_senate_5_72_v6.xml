                    <para>The coast-line of Western Australia,; from Eucla to Wyndham, amounts to approximately  3,130 nautical miles. From Eucla to Fort Darwin is a distance of 3,300 miles, of which fully  3,400  miles must be considered imperfectly charted, and, in parts, entirely unexamined. </para>
                    <para>Accurate charts are obligatory for trade and navigation, and this is a most important coastal requirement. If two vessels proceeded steadily with this work, it would take at least fifteen years, and probably twenty years, to complete. </para>

If we are to wait forty years for the present steamer to complete her work, it is difficult to say what damage may be done in the meantime. </para>

                        <para>- I understand that the honorable senator desires to move the suspension of the Standing Orders in order to enable him to move the adjournment of the Senate in the ordinary way. If he had desired to move the adjournment of the Senate for the purpose of discussing a matter of urgent public importance he need not have taken this course. But the Standing Orders provide that only a Minister can move the adjournment of the Senate in the ordinary way. I assume that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor</inline> does not intend to move the adjournment for the purpose of discussing a matter of urgent public business, because he has not given me written notice to that- effect; as required by the Standing Orders. Consequently, it is necessary for him to proceed as he has done to enable him to move that the Senate do now adjourn. </para>

                            <para>- I wish to call the attention of the Senate - and I am not doing it with any desire to make party capital - to what this means. I ask the Senate, and especially an experienced and responsible leader like <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor,</inline> to consider carefully what the Senate is now asked to do. We are here to-day to do business. Whether the action taken by the Government in the past was defensible or otherwise is, no doubt, a matter for discussion. But I do ask the Senate to pause before deliberately closing these doors whilst business which is before us remains unfinished. </para>

I do not propose to say any more. There is the position. I appeal to honorable senators opposite to hesitate before . they ask the Senate to take such a course. </para>

                    <para class="block">Minister of Defence for the very wise and kindly counsel which he has given to as. But I think that if the honorable senator would take a few minutes to consider, he would come to the conclusion that the action of the Government in the past has given every reason for this course. In view of what has occurred, I am satisfied that the people of the country have a right to have some time given to them for the calm consideration of the position that has arisen. If any action of this kind was ever necessary, it is necessary now as a protest against the arbitrary conduct of the Government. Consequently, I hope that the people will take notice of the reason why we have adopted this course. </para>

                <para>In submitting the motion, as the Leader of 'the Government in the Senate may be desirous - as he was in connexion with the motion just carried - of obtaining some reason from us as to why this course of action is necessary, I wish to say that up to the present time honorable senators on this side have done everything they possibly could to assist the Government to carry on the business of the country. They have even gone so far as to assist the Government to adjourn the Senate when the representatives of the Government in this Chamber have thought it necessary. It has been stated by some one, and I am informed that the authority is the Prime Minister, that it was at my request that the last adjournment of the Senate was made. I emphatically deny that. I deny that at any time I have requested the representatives of the Government in- this Chamber to adjourn the Senate, although the Opposition have always been prepared to assist them to do so when they thought it was necessary. </para>

                        <para>- We get only misrepresentation, because it is gross misrepresentation on the part of the Prime Minister or of any other member of the Government to say that I or any honorable senator on this side has requested them at any time to adjourn the Senate. The Leader of the Government in the Senate knows very well the reason why it was adjourned on the 6th November. He also knows that from the very inauguration of the Federal Parliament, when a motion of no-confidence in the Government has been submitted in another place, it has always been the practice to adjourn the Senate. That has become a precedent of the Senate, and a parliamentary practice that is almost as binding as any section of the Constitution. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> is aware that in every other Parliament in the world the same course is followed, and is in keeping with the recognised relations of all Upper Houses to the more popular Legislative Chambers in every country. A statement to this effect was made on the occasion of the last adjournment of the Senate by Senate Millen, although I understand that some of his colleagues have said that if the honorable senator had had more sense he would not have taken the course he did. I do not know . that any of the honorable senator's present colleagues have one-half his sensed but that is the way in which the members of the present Government characterize each other when they are apart. What they, do when they are together' is, of course, a matter of secrecy. The Leader of the Government in the Senate knows very well that what I have said is a . fact, and that time after time the Senate has been adjourned for the very same reason, as. that for which it was adjourned on Thursday week last. He is aware also that at ' the very beginning of this session the Senate was adjourned for some time for an exactly similar reason. I wish to remind honorable senators that the motion, because of which the last adjournment of the Senate was made, has not yet been decided. In view of the fact that the Government are prepared, in this Chamber and in another place, to go on with the business of the country whilst a motion of np-confidence is hanging over their heads, it is time that some action was taken in the Senate to show the people of Australia that -the true friends of constitutional government at the present time in this Parliament are the members of the Opposition. That is why I have submitted this motion. </para>

                        <para>- Let me deal with the reason for the adjournment then, and the position which exists to-day. As I told the Senate a fortnight ago, and as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor</inline> has just reiterated, it has been the custom here, as I believe it is with every second Chamber in a bicameral Legislature, to adjourn when the Government is challenged in another branch. Following that practice, I did move a motion to adjourn the Senate, and I submit that I was entirely right in doing so. Here comes the point to which I desire to direct attention. The Government has itself to judge when it will accept a motion as one of challenge. </para>

                            <para>- I admit at once that I was not aware of the existence of the standing order. I only wish that there were more of such Standing Orders that we might fall back upon. The position remains that the Government, in the interest of business proceeding, took action which it had a perfect right to take, and thereupon went on with business in the other House. Just as we cease to do business here when they do, seeing the action the Government have taken there, we are entitled now to proceed to the discharge of public business. Honorable senators opposite are those who to-day are frustrating that effort, who are deliberately drawing a log across the track of public work. Here is the work now prepared to go on with, and honorable senators opposite must take the responsibility of deliberately and openly attempting to prevent business from being done. The Leader of the Opposition made a reference to the true friends of constitutional government. Search the history of constitutional government, and find a case where action has been taken like that which is being taken here to-day. I welcome it. There need be no doubt about the fact that the whole purpose of the Opposition since Parliament has met has been to frustrate public business. </para>

While that is their tactics in the other House, there is no need for similar tactics here, because the Government have not presented any serious business to the Senate until to-day. Now we are confronted with two serious propositions by the Government. The Opposition, carrying on in this Chamber, no doubt, the deliberate efforts, of their <inline font-style="italic">confreres</inline> in the other Chamber, seek to block public business. Confronted with the. question as to whether or not it will- suit the pros posals of the Government, the Opposition  turn round and say that, instead, they will close these doers to prevent any public business from being done at all. I welcome the action of my honorable friends. It is the clearest evidence that- we can have to put before the country that the Opposition, not allowed to rule, are determined that no other party shall. Whilst I regret, in the interests of the public, that this has taken place, I am perfectly pleased, speaking from a party point of view, that my honorable friends have committed this tremendous outrage upon parliamentary procedure. </para>

                        <para>. - I am really amused at the course of action which the Leader of the Government here has taken. I am surprised that he does not do the same thing: as is done in another place. If the Government suspend a few of the senators they can still have a quorum, and carryon the business they desire to deal with,, whether it is in the interests of the country or not. The Leader of the Senate, need not call the attention of the members of the Opposition to anything that the Government have done anywhere. The members of the Opposition, both here and in another place, are well aware of everything that the Government have done. I am sure that the great majority of the people of Australia are taking notice of the things that the Government are doing; and attempting to do. There is no necessity for the Government to delay for more than five minutes the -business of the country, either in one section of Parliament-, or in another. All that the Government have to do is to carry out their practice- for the last few weeks ; they can deal with the no-confidence motion, put on the closure, and defeat the motion in less than five minutes. If Ministers want to carry on the business of the country, they will' take my advice, and do something of that description. But we, as members of the Opposition, have a right to call public attention to the conditions existing, and this is the only way in which we can. do so. </para>
