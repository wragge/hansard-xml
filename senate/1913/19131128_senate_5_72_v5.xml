Clearing contractor states he is doing clearing on day labour, same wages and hours as ourselves. He is paying for firewood by the cord, similar arrangement as followed by cutting contractors on all wood tramways, and is paying one shilling more. Understand State Government obtains our sleepers on same system. Our contractor tried day labour, and one man took ten days to cut five and a quarter cords. </para>

First, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie has asked what information I can give him in regard to the progress of construction work on the railway. I regret to say that I have not that information this morning. If he did put the matter to me last night, I misunderstood the position; I did not gather from his remarks that he wanted a definite inquiry made on that point. However, I shall make inquiry, and at the next sitting supply him with such information as I can obtain. With regard to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Long&#39;s</inline> question, I do not think that he can seriously expect me to give an answer to it this morning. I did all that I could yesterday in pursuance of my promise to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Needham</inline> that I would investigate first of all the facts referred to in his question. I have supplied the Senate this morning with the official answer - and that is all I can do - to the question. Obviously, such an official answer could not contemplate the details mentioned by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Long</inline> - that is as to the quality of the timber and the labour involved in clearing and cutting the firewood. </para>

The bag is forwarded to the House immediately after the mails have been opened. It is, however, reported by the Superintendent, Mail Branch, that all correspondence for Parliament House from Tasmania is not enclosed in the special bag, consequently letters, &#38;c, enclosed in the ordinary bag&#39;s are not accorded special treatment, and therefore suffer delay. </para>

                            <para>. - If the Senate notice-paper were unduly crowded with business, and it were beyond the capacity of the Senate to dispose of that business in a day or two, there might be some reason for resorting to the practice which has been adopted on previous occasions. But at the present stage, and in view of the long adjournments we have had to indulge in, I do not think it wise to suspend our sessional orders yet. </para>

                    <para>. - Only on very rare occasions in the past have Loan Bills come before either branch of the Commonwealth Legislature. That has been very fortunate from the point of view of the people of Australia, because those who are continually crying out for economy would otherwise have increased the loan indebtedness of Australia up to about &#163;50,000,000 by this time, if we are to have regard to what their present action really means. It has been continually stated by the opponents of the Labour party, and by various newspapers, that our policy has been against borrowing. Where they got that information from I really do not understand, unless the idea has arisen in the fertile minds of such people as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gould</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bakhap.</inline> No declaration has been made by any member of the Labour party that we are averse from borrowing in all circumstances. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable senator cries with as many voices as the parrots in an Australian forest. The Labour party stands by its platform, and the platform of that party has never contained such a declaration as that we are entirely against borrowing. Our declaration is that we are in favour of a restriction of public borrowing ; and I hope that the party will always exercise that caution which ought to characterize any one who has the best interests of this country at heart. Representatives of the present Government, before they attained that eminent position, and their prominent supporters, have gone through the country declaring that the late Government was the most extravagant Administration in the world. They have characterized our financing as an orgy, and have applied other Bacchanalian epithets to it. They have said that we resorted to schemes of the most disastrous character. The present Prime Minister has repeatedly declared that the late Government spent every penny they could lay their hands on, and was looking in every direction for money to spend on other &#39; &#39; wild-cat &#39; &#39; schemes. </para>

                        <para>- There is no decency where there is nothing but mendacity. Those who made these reckless statements knew them to be untrue. If they did not, the slightest attempt at inquiry would have satisfied them of their untruth. But they go on making them; and probably the missing Ministers at the present time are in some portion of Australia repeating them as fast as they can. The Prime Minister was at Albury the other night, misleading the people in the most disgraceful manner. It has been the continual cry of the direct antagonists of the Labour movement in Australia that the late Government spent all the money upon which they could lay their hands. They assured the electors that if they were only afforded an opportunity to control the financial destiny of the Commonwealth they would institute such rigid economy that the people would be saved taxation, that the cost of living would be reduced, and that many other happy conditions would follow. By just the odd trick they succeeded in getting upon the Treasury bench, and now, instead of inaugurating the system of rigid economy of which they spoke, they have embarked upon a more extraordinary expenditure than was ever dreamed of by their predecessors. . They are prepared to spend about &#163;5,000,000 more than the late Government were prepared to spend, and yet they continue to charge that Administration with gross extravagance. The jocular feature of the business is that they dare not go to the people and say, &#34; If in certain directions you require development, those who will get the benefit of it immediately must contribute to the revenue to enable that development to take place.&#34; But instead, they say that the children of the present generation, and their children&#39;s children, snail contribute towards works of development which will benefit only the people of to-day. I hope that Labour influence is sufficiently strong in this Parliament to prevent the Government going outside of their own resources for any monetary advances for future development. In addition to the &#163;2,653,000 which the late Government left their successors, Ministers now ask Parliament for authority to spend &#163;3,080,000 during the current financial year. Now the Labour party have no desire to curtail the development of any portion of Australia if that development is in the interests, not only of the present generation, but of future generations. We have no objection to going to the money market to obtain support for the purpose of constructing works of a reproductive character, or of a character .that will enable the people of Australia to produce more than they are able to produce at the present time, even though there may be no direct return from that expenditure. But we must look at the way in which that money is to be spent, and how its repayment is to be provided for. We know that the Commonwealth is already committed to very considerable works of development. We know that we are at present engaged in the construction of a transcontinental railway, and we recognise that in the near future we shall probably be engaged upon another similar work. It would be unreasonable to expect the small population of Australia, out of the revenue of any one year, to make sufficient provision to cover works of this description. The amount which we are asked to spend under this Bill upon the Port Augusta-Kalgoorlie railway is &#163;1,400,000. The Labour party have never had the remotest intention of opposing such an item, because its members have always recognised that, to large undertakings of this character, posterity has as much right to contribute as have the people of the present day. As this is a work of a permanent and reproductive order, we are prepared to sanction the borrowing of money for its construction. If the Labour Government had remained in power they would have had to do precisely the same thing as the present Government are doing. In respect of the development of the Northern Territory, it will be recollected that at the instance of the Fisher Administration a Bill was passed by Parliament authorizing the survey of a line from Pine Creek to the Katherine River. If they had had no intention of ultimately carrying out the work they would never have agreed to that survey. Consequently, the Labour party have no intention of opposing the expenditure of the &#163;400,000 which is required for the purpose of constructing that line, which was practically sanctioned long ago. There is also in this Bill an item for the construction of a railway in Papua. Now, if any Territory belonging to a country is to be developed, it must be developed by modern methods, and in the absence of railways it is impossible to effect that development. Therefore, &#163;60,000 is only a reasonable amount to provide in this Bill for developmental works in Papua. <inline font-style="italic">I</inline> come now to another item, which is of a very questionable character - I refer to the proposed expenditure of &#163;170,000 for the purchase of land for post and telegraph purposes. I understand that this money is to be spent upon the purchase of post-office sites throughout Australia. I say that the Government ought to be able to undertake such purchases out of revenue, and without resort to borrowing. I admit that on one occasion the late Government borrowed money for the purpose of purchasing a post-office, site. But it must be remembered that that site contained actual improvements which were returning an interest of more than 5 per cent, per annum, and consequently our action was. amply justified. But here we are asked to sanction the expenditure of &#163;170,000 of borrowed money upon land for postal sites, from which no revenue will be derived other than that derived from postal business. This is an item, therefore,, of a very doubtful character. But, seeing that the Government confess their inability to economise in any other direction so as to permit of them purchasing these lands out of revenue, we shall be compelled to give our consent to it. The next item to which I wish to direct attention is one of &#163;300,000 for the purchase of land for defence purposes. I hope that no member of the Opposition will ever depart from the practice that we have hitherto followed. We have always contended that the cost of the defence of Australia, and of anything appertaining to it, should in times of peace be paid for out of revenue. We hope that every Government will be compelled to follow that course of procedure. I come now to an item of &#163;425,000 for the construction of conduits, and for laying wires underground. Heretofore, that class of work has also been paid for out of revenue. When we realize how quickly changes take place in telegraphic and other means of communication, we ought to be very cautious about running ourselves into debt in that direction without first giving the matter very full consideration. Yet the Government are in the position that these works must be carried out. They cannot help themselves. They say so. Consequently we cannot raise any serious objection to this item. Although we may complain of it, we have to accede to their request because of then inability to do the work in any other way . </para>

                        <para>- The proper way of doing it is to pay for it out of revenue, and to economise in other directions with that end in view. The next item in the schedule of the Bill is one of &#163;175,000 for the installation of up-to-date machinery upon Cockatoo Island. I believe that a certain amount of machinery there for ship-building purposes may be necessary. I also believe that a great portion of the machinery which is already installed there is of a very efficient and up-to-date character. When the island was taken over by the late Government they were well aware of all the conditions which existed upon it. But if the present Ministry affirm that they are not able to get the requisite machinery in any other way than is provided for in this Bill we shall be bound to support them. The last item in the measure is one for the expenditure of &#163;150.000 on the Commonwealth offices in London. I do not think that a single member of the Opposition will say that we ought not to make a fair show in our Commonwealth offices there. If, therefore, the Government honestly declare that they require an additional &#163;150,000 for this purpose their request will be granted. But I still maintain that the expenditure of &#163;300,000 out of loan moneys for the purchase of land for defence purposes should, in Committee, be excised from the Bill. </para>

                    <para>. - I do not intend to delay the Senate very long, but I do not care to allow the measure to go through without making a few remarks. Unfortunately, I think, the people of Australia are committed to a transcontinental railway policy in Western Australia, and also to a railway policy, in the Northern Territory, neither of which can, in the nature of things, be profitable for a long period, and both of which will most undoubtedly be, until then, a burden on the Commonwealth. I do not know if it is possible to depart from that policy now. So far as I have been able to discover, there is no likelihood of sane ideas in regard to these matters influencing the Federal Parliament; and, if the railways are to be built, I suppose it must be done with borrowed money. I think it is well within the knowledge of every one of us that the Australian public debt is a very large one, that it is continually increasing, and that the interest which is being paid at Home and abroad is also increasing very much every year, until now it has become a most serious burden on the people of Australia. Many persons will tell us that there is no alternative policy; that, if we are to develop our country, the only means by which it can be done is with borrowed money. I can remember very well that when the Labour party first began to take an active interest in politics it was opposed to borrowing; it had an idea that national works could be constructed without having recourse to loans. I know that since that time a very large number of Labour people have modified their opinion. I believe that every railway that is built ought to be the parent of another railway. If the land values which have been created in Australia by the expenditure of borrowed money in building railways, making roads and bridges, erecting telegraph lines, and doing all that sort of thing; if those values, which undoubtedly belong to the people of Australia, who are responsible for the moneys which have created them, passed into the public Treasury, instead of into the pockets of private individuals, our loan indebtedness would be a very simple matter indeed.. </para>
                </talk.start>
                <para class="block">But, of course, we are not now dealing with the general loan policy of Australia. We are dealing particularly with the loan policy of the Commonwealth, and, unfortunately, there are no land values in Western Australia on which we could levy to build a railway of the kind which is contemplated through that State; nor are there land values in the Northern Territory, and, so far as I can see, we must continue, for a time, at any rate, this unfortunate and wasteful policy of borrowing. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor</inline> referred to some money which is being borrowed to buy land, and to construct works in connexion with the Post and Telegraph Department. So far as I can see, there is not the slightest reason why a single farthing should be borrowed for any works in connexion with the Post and Telegraph Department. Our postal system ought not only to pay current expenses, but also to provide sufficient revenue for the purchase of land and the construction of all kinds of works. The other day the Department issued a balance-sheet, from which we find that neither the telephone nor the telegraph system is paying. I do not know whether I will be in order in referring in detail to that matter, but it seems to me to be one which is very closely allied with what we are now dis-. cussing. If we do not get revenue enough from the Department to do certain things, then inevitably we must borrow. But I submit that we ought to get revenue. Take the telephone system, for instance. We are losing heavily upon that. Is there any reason why we should do so? The telephone is one of the finest labour-saving appliances that I think has ever been discovered. It saves hundreds, perhaps thousands, of pounds per annum to many business firms in Melbourne. I believe that the landlords of this city are now capitalizing the telephone system, and increasing the rents on that account. The people of Australia are providing this fine system to our business men throughout the Commonwealth at a loss. I am not one of those who maintain that every public convenience should be called upon to pay its own way. I would not say so for a single moment. But if there is any convenience of that character which ought to be placed on a sound financial basis, 1 think it is our telephone system. Let us contrast the charges for the telephone service in Australia with those in other parts of the world. In Australia, I believe, the average rate is about &#163;5 a year. In London, it is &#163;13 6s. 8d.; in the northern provinces of England, &#163;9 12s. ; in Germany, &#163;9 10s. ; in New York, &#163;21 16s. ; in Chicago, &#163;16 16s. ; in St. Louis, &#163;19 5s.; in Philadelphia, &#163;24 15s.; in Boston, &#163;21 15s. ; and in Baltimore, &#163;20 10s. When we compare the population of Australia with that of those other countries, the obvious inference is that the telephone system ought to be maintained in them at a very much lower rate than in Australia, whereas, we find that here the users get the service for a comparatively small amount. The difference between the charges here and those elsewhere is so marked that, so far as I can see, and so far as the balance-sheet shows, we are providing a convenience for business people and others at much below its actual cost. That is a state of things which ought to be changed. The people who use the telephone ought to be called upon to pay fees sufficient, not only to cover current expenses, but also to provide for the extension of the services. I have not the slightest doubt that the invention of the telephone has added very materially to land values in our large cities. Those values are now going to the private owner. They ought to go into the public Treasury, and, if they did so, we would not then be under an obligation to borrow when we wanted to construct new works. We would have the community-created values with which to do that sort of thing; we would place our finances on a sound and solid business footing, on which they do not stand at the present moment. With regard to borrowing for defence, that seems to me to be one of the maddest ideas possible. It is a course which is not pursued, so far as I know, by any other community which makes the slightest pretence of maintaining its solvency. But, unfortunately, in Australia we are in this position, that we must either borrow or put an end to the construction of new works. If we continue to allow this immense leakage of community-created land values from year to year, then I say we must put ourselves in pawn. We are simply giving away with one hand, while we are incurring fresh liabilities with the other, and the fruits of those fresh liabilities are in turn handed over to the same old people. We are going on continuously borrowing and borrowing, paying interest and piling charge upon charge, while the private owners of land are reaping the benefit all the while. It seems to me it is time that we took stock of things in Australia, more especially in connexion with the affairs of the Commonwealth. We know now that our expenditure is very much greater than our income. We know also that, if that kind of thing continues, the borrowing craze will have to be resorted to more and more, or, as I have said, all works must be put an end to. I do not think that any honorable senator would like to see that brought about. We are all desirous of seeing Australia grow in population and prosperity. We are anxious to see the railway systems extended, and every modern appliance set up in our midst. But it is quite possible that, unless we have recourse to a sound system of finance, we shall land ourselves in a bog of debt, difficulty, and danger. I do not think that we ought to agree to borrow for purposes of defence. Every farthing we spend on defence should be found out of revenue. That brings me to this point: If we are to get the money out of revenue, we must have recourse to fresh areas of taxation. </para>

                        <para>- It is a very sound one. I say that the wealth of the country should provide the money for the defence of the country. If the working people are to find the soldiers, the brain and sinew, for defence, it is only fair that the wealth of the community should be called upon to pay the piper. The wealth of the community is not doing that now. Our system of defence at present is costing something like &#163;5,000,000 per annum. If it is developed along the lines laid down by our defence experts, in a few years the cost will run up to &#163;10,000,000 per annum. How much is the Commonwealth getting from direct taxation ? We are receiving about &#163;1,300,000 per annum, or barely one-fourth of what we are now expending on defence. If the policy of the Labour party is the right one to adopt, instead of getting &#163;1,300,000 from direct taxation, we ought to be getting &#163;5,000y000. If future Governments continue to develop the defence system on the lines now laid down, within ten years our revenue from direct sources of taxation should be, not &#163;1,300,000 per year, but &#163;10,000,000 a year. It is a sound, sensible, legitimate principle to lay down. </para>

If that is the case, what is the good of my being here; what is the good of our meeting here ; what is the good of it all ? I say that the whole thing is a solemn farce. </para>

                        <para>- I point out to the honorable senator that I did not say what he has credited me with saying.I did not say that he could not argue for the adoption of an alternative policy of borrowing. I listened to him patiently whilst he was talking in a very interesting fash ion on that subject. He was then quite in order; but the honorable senator will not be in order in discussing details of every other policy* on this particular Bill. If the honorable senator did so, and every member of the Senate exercised the same right in the discussion of this or any other Bill, our debates would be interminable. </para>

                        <para>- You, sir, have made it exceedingly difficult for me to go on. I have been trying to point out how money could be raised for the purposes of this Bill in other ways than that proposed. If I cannot do that, what is the good of my being here, and what is the good of us discussing anything. &#34;Unless I can show, as I think I am in duty bound to show, if I am to be faithful to the trust which the people have placed in me, that we should not borrow for purposes of defence, I cannot properly discuss this Bill. Let me repeat that we are allowing millions of community-created values to pass into the pockets of private individuals every year which ought to go into the public Treasury. If that money went into the public Treasury, we should have it for our own when we required to do certain things instead of having to borrow money to do them. Surely I should be permitted to point that out in discussing this Bill. To the policy of the present Government of borrowing for defence purposes I am utterly opposed. Surely I am within my rights in the circumstances in stating what I conceive to be the proper alternative to adopt.I have stated the position as I see it.I trust that the Labour party will not agree to borrow for the construction of conduits for the Post and Telegraph Department, because the expenditure upon such work should be met by securing an increased revenue from our telephones and telegraphs. The Government are proposing to borrow money in connexion with the extension of our telegraphic system. I say, in reply to that proposal, that we send telegrams at a cheaper rate in Australia than is charged in any other country in the world. A telegram can be sent from any portion of Australia to another for1s. That cannot be done for the money anywhere else on the face of the earth. Why should we distribute largesse in this fashion to people who are well able to pay very much higher charges both for telegrams and telephone messages than they are asked to pay. I know of numbers of people in Australia who are so rich that they hardly ever trouble to write letters at all. They send all their communications by wire. If they find that an ordinary telegram will not convey their communication as quickly as they desire, they will send it by urgent message. The fact is that ordinary individuals like myself, when they go to a telegraph office to send a telegram, find that they have to wait hours simply because the wires have been cornered by people who are rich enough, or whose business is important enough, to warrant them in paying urgent rates. If that be the case, I say, let them pay more for their telegrams and telephone messages. If our telegraph and telephone systems are made self-supporting, we shall be under no necessity to borrow money for works in connexion with these enterprises. </para>

                        <para>- I quite believe it. I thought for the moment that the honorable senator was going to say that the urgent wire was sent &#34; collect.&#34; It shows how willing many people are to pay double rates. I have said that our rates in Australia are lower than the rates in any other part of the world. That would be something to be proud of if our systems were paying their own way, but when the taxpayers of the Commonwealth are called upon to contribute in this fashion, I think it is time we called a halt. I do not intend to say very much mma on this subject. If I had my way the whole system of borrowing would be put an end to. I trust that we shall be able to stop borrowing, at all events for defence purposes and for the Post and Telegraph Department. Our telegraph and telephone revenue should be sufficient to defray all expenditure in connexion with those systems. That is all I intend to say on the matter at the present time. I trust that the items included in this Bill for defence and for post and telegraph works will not be allowed to pass. </para>

                    <para>. - I desire at the commencement of my opposition to certain matters included in this Bill to express my astonishment that a Government with such professions as those of the present Government should propose to adopt the principle of borrowing. As electors of the Commonwealth, we listened to their loud declamations against the extravagance of the previous Government. We were informed that if they were returned to power there would be the strictest surveillance of the financial position in connexion with the administration of every Department of the Public Service. Even the present Treasurer stated that he had become a confirmed economist. That was news to all who had any intimate knowledge of the political antecedents of the right honorable gentleman. Now we find that, in spite of all these loud professions of economy, and the condemnation of the &#34; extraordinary extravagance &#34; of a previous Government, the present Government have decided that the only hope of saving the Commonwealth is by following the old practice adopted in the different States of Australia. They propose to saddle the Commonwealth with as much indebtedness as can be brought about by the passing of all the Loan Bills that it is possible to put through this Parliament. There are some items in this Bill to which I raise very little objection. I raise none to those from which, at some future date, we may expect a tendency to productivity. But there are others that appear to have no  possible  hope of conducing to anything but permanent indebtedness. To those I stand in direct opposition. I entirely agree with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart</inline> that the telegraphic and telephonic operations of Australia should be placed on such a footing as to make them as nearly as possible remunerative. It is proposed under this Bill to construct conduits  out of loan money. In all fairness, those who profit by such instrumentalities should pay for them. We are aware that the business life of Australia is in a sufficiently sound position to pay for all the conveniences it gets. The item to which I call attention simply means saddling indebtedness upon the whole people for conveniences which are mainly used by the business people, and which others do not use probably more than half-a-dozen times in a lifetime. Why should that be so? Why should not those who use the facilities provide for their establishment? i </para>

                        <para>- No j I have never done so. I felt that in establishing penny postage we were taking a risk that was not justified. I stand in precisely the same position in regard to telegraphy. We have no reasonable ground for levying taxation upon those who do not use the telegraph wire in order that those who do may send their telegrams for ls. I remember when we used to pay 3s. or 4s. for a telegram. I am not an advocate of a particularly high tariff. But <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart</inline> hit the nail on the head when he said that business people had, to a large extent, discontinued the practice of conducting their transactions by letter because it is considerably cheaper for them to do them by wire. It saves them a considerable amount of employment. Because of that saving they use the cheap wire of Australia. Then the present Government come down and ask the whole people of Australia, regardless of the extent to which they use this method, to (ax themselves in order to ease the burden of the people who are well able to pay for increased facilities. The so-called Liberal party, during the elections, pronounced themselves to be, above all things, strict economists - men who were prepared to use every endeavour to place the finances of this country on a sound basis. Now we have them bringing down a Bill to raise &#163;3,000,000 by loan, in order that they may lay the foundation of a system of pawning the Commonwealth to the money lenders of the world. Of course, the whole political life of the Treasurer, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> Forrest, has been lived on loan money. I remember on one occasion hearing him tell a number of people that he had actually borrowed &#163;7,000,000 in one year, and that the country boomed on that money. Probably his intention is to continue that policy in regard to the Commonwealth. In this Bill, therefore, we have the beginning of a desire that will be further expressed by the Government as time goes on. We are asked to borrow an amount of money in order that we may develop our defence system. I take up the same position in regard to that as to all other projects of an unproductive character. No one would attempt to argue that defence is productive. It is absolutely nothing more than insurance. No stronger reason can be asserted for the proposition here made than that the man who insures ought to pay the insurance money. </para>

                        <para>- That is so, according to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bakhap.</inline> Of this &#163;3,000,000, &#163;300,000 is for the further insurance of Australia. I hold that up to the present moment Australia has carried out a very fine defence policy. We have been able, out of our revenues, to meet every legitimate expenditure for the purpose. I see no reason why we should depart from that system. If we want more money to perfect our defences, we should take from the wealth of our country what we need. If we are to go on borrowing for defence, the &#163;300,000 will be added to, and in time the people of Australia will be saddled with a continuous borrowing policy. I remember that in the early stages of Federation the same cult in politics, and the same persons who now occupy the Treasury bench, proposed to inaugurate a borrowing policy. They were curbed in their desire to launch Australia into endless borrowing. But now they are under the impression that they have reached the position when they will be able to assert opinions that have possessed them for years. I sincerely hope that the Senate will not allow them to accomplish their desire. I trust that we shall closely scrutinize the whole of the items set out in the schedule of this Bill. A few of these certainly give promise that the expenditure upon them will be remunerative. Consequently they are legitimate subjects upon which to expend loan money. But the proposals to spend loan money for purposes of defence, for the construction of conduits and for laying wires underground are absolutely indefensible. Our proper course is to reject those items, and to countenance borrowing only for works which are likely to prove of a reproductive character. If we insist upon that principle being observed we shall force the Government to discover new fields of taxation. </para>

                        <para>- It is for the Government to devise methods by which the revenue of the Commonwealth may be increased. It is sufficient for me to say that the borrowing of money for defence purposes in time of peace is quite unjustifiable. Our defence system is an insurance on the wealth of this country, and consequently that wealth has a right to pay the insurance premium. </para>

                        <para>- Exactly, and the present Government asked the people at the last election to turn down a similar proposal, because they urged the Fisher Government had been extravagant. They affirmed that that Administration had brought the finances of the Commonwealth into a condition of chaos. They exclaimed, &#34; Give us your approval, and we will find a means of remedying all the evils for which the Fisher Ministry were responsible. We will show you how the Commonwealth can be run upon a less expenditure, how the cost of living can be reduced ; in short, how every evil of which our predecessors were guilty can be remedied.&#34; We now find that their sovereign remedy is a proposal to float a loan of &#163;3,080,000. That is how&#34; they are going to redeem their promises to the people. I will oppose the items to which I have already objected. </para>

                    <para>- 1 believe that it had little or no review there. We now find that those who professed to teach us a better method of financing, and who so loudly denounced the extravagance of the late Government, are themselves the first to plunge into the most reckless extravagance. We may, therefore, very legitimately turn round, and say to them, &#34;Physician, heal thyself.&#34; We all know that they travelled throughout the length and breadth of this country proclaiming that the Labour Government had squandered every penny that it could lay its hands upon. But when they came into office they found a denial of their statement the very moment that they opened the Treasury books, and we have since had an acknowledgment that that statement was absolutely opposed to fact. I claim that it should be the duty of any Government to proceed on sound financial lines, in exactly the same way as a private individual would proceed in the conduct of his own business. In other words, they should never get into debt unless they have a reasonable prospect of extricating themselves from it, and they should never contract indebtedness unless it can be demonstrated that the expenditure is likely to be of a reproductive character. No sane man would borrow to pay an insurance policy unless lie felt that its payment would be of benefit to him. Yet we now find the Government proposing to borrow for the defence of Australia, which is really a provision for national insurance. Those who asserted that the Labour party were wrong in taking up that position must have already been humiliated a great deal more than any language of mine can humiliate them. </para>

                        <para>- I am not going to say that. At present I see only two honorable senators upon the Ministerial benches, so that the other five are with us only in an invisible form, if they are with us at all. I repeat that the policy which should guide any Government is that which a sound financier in commercial circles would adopt. Looking through the items contained in the schedule to this Bill, I find two or three which would not be commended by sound financiers. There is, for example, an item relating to the acquisition of land for defence purposes. I challenge honorable senators opposite to point to any civilized country in the world in which the Government float loans for defence purposes in time of peace. Fortunately for Australia, this country has led the way in many estimable things. But surely the Government are not leading the way, in the estimation of sensible people, when they stoop to do something which no other civilized nation will do, namely, to go to &#34; &#34;Uncle &#34; to enable them to pay for an insurance policy. </para>

His silence proves that on the principle he is advocating he stands condemned. I gather that the Treasurer, in introducing this Bill, was particularly careful to say that our financing should be based, not upon our most prosperous years, but upon our average years. </para>

                        <para>- When we adjourned for luncheon, I was dealing with the inconsistencies of the Liberal party in their condemnation of the methods by which the Labour party conducted the financial business of the Commonwealth, paying for all they did as they went, and even then leaving behind them a surplus of &#163;2,653,000, which, by our opponents, was called a &#34; financial debauch.&#34; There is a story of a man who, in olden times, said, &#34; Oh, that mine enemy had written a book!&#34; My political enemy, I believe, did write a book. I believe that it is inscribed by him as <inline font-style="italic">A Financial Carnival.</inline> I would like to put a position which arises out of the difference between the two policies that are really within the compass of this Loan Bill - the absence of a Loan Bill with the Labour party, and the result, a surplus of &#163;2,653,000, being described by our political opponents as a &#34; financial debauch.&#34; What language is denunciatory enough to characterize the utter absence of anything like a shadow of a policy, or even the lack of a dream that such a thing as a policy had ever crossed their brain? What language, I ask, is strong enough to denounce that which is only built up by having a Loan Bill here immediately after having consumed, in their first year, the surplus that was left to them ? I want honorable senators to think what the appeal really means. Here is a Senate, in which twenty-nine senators are standing behind the policy of no-indebtedness, and a solitary senator on the other side is representing a Bill to raise a loan of &#163;3,080,000. What language, what action, could be expected from us in denouncing such a proposal ? That we take it calmly is great evidence, I think, of the carefulness with which we look into these matters. We are not easily moved, otherwise I believe that something like political rage would be manifested on this side in denouncing this Bill. It is a question, not simply of why we should borrow, but of why we should commit persons who have not acquiesced in our action to take up the burden &#34; willy nilly.&#34; So far, in Australia, it has not been the policy to meet a debt when it fell due other than by renewing the loan. Persons with an intimate knowledge of commercial circles would at once characterize persons guilty of such an action as lacking in business capacity. If a man could only meet his bills by renewing them, and renewing them continually, very soon the lender would come to the conclusion that he was not fit to be trusted. So far as Australia is concerned, it is very rarely indeed that a liability has been met at the due date. In this Loan Bill we are asked to enter upon a borrowing policy without taking any precaution, without in any way shaping any ends, to meet the debt when it matures. We are simply resting on the hope that possibly by the date of maturity we shall be out of the world, and let those who follow us meet our indebtedness. </para>

                        <para>- Here, again, the honorable senator is prepared to commit the children without asking them whether they will share the indebtedness or not. If he was able to say that all the indebtedness he presents to them is more than covered by a realizable or valuable asset, there might be more justification for this proposal. With regard to one item in the Loan Bill - that of defence and machinery for defence purposes - I think he will not go so far as to say that those things will endure until the maturity of the loan. It will be seen at once that a rotten principle underlies this proposal. There is shown a carelessness that is worthy of old Micawber himself, who simply waited for something to turn up, who signed the notes of hand and said, &#34;Thank God, that is settled!&#34; That, it seems, is just the principle which the Government are adopting. If it can be characterized as wastefulness when Labour had a surplus of &#163;2,653,000, and had no loan hanging over them, except for transferred properties, I do not think it can be characterized as the clearest of honesty to go forth to the country, and represent that the Labour people had been guilty of borrowing, when the authors of the statement were fully aware that the only loans in existence were on transferred properties, and that the loans were transferred with the properties. It did not place before the public the whole truth. There may be a scintilla of truth in the statement that there was a loan over the Labour party, but it does not represent the whole truth when it is not made known generally that the loan in question was contracted before it was taken over by the Labour party. If our doings will not stand the clear light of day, it is time that we shaped them differently. The point I was leading up to has a bearing on our other loans. To a large extent in this Loan Bill we are issuing a second mortgage in this sense - that the States have already mortgaged their respective credits, and we come in as a seventh borrower, practically with the same securities to present. We are now asking the money lender, <inline font-style="italic">nob only</inline> through the States to lend money, but to grant on the same securities, and to the same people practically a second mortgage, with this result, if it has any effect at all, as I think it will, that it will weaken the value of the loans that the States may seek, and will also, by reflection, weaken our own opportunity of securing loans if we should really need accommodation. Let honorable senators bear in mind the very wise admonition I alluded to just before lunch, and I am sure that they will admit that it is wise, seeing that it comes from the mouth of the Treasurer himself. We should finance along the lines, not of our most prosperous times, but of our average years. We should not borrow up to the full limit of our possibilities, but act .well within that limit, so as to keep our securities good, and then should a time of stress occur we would be able to borrow to better advantage than we could have done if we had exhausted our credit during the time of peace. There can be no justification for Australia borrowing for defence purposes in time of peace. Such a policy stands condemned by all rational financiers, by . all men who have the welfare of their country at heart, and by all who seek to leave a true and honoured name to their children. We as Australians should never commit that which is, perhaps, the culminating crime in finance, in national finance at any rate, of borrowing for defence purposes in time of peace. Let me allude now to another point. Our opponents came into office with a flourish of trumpets. They proclaimed themselves as the saviours of this great nation. They were the prophets whose eye was undimmed, and could see beyond the clouds. They were to show us a more excellent way of governing. They proclaimed our administration of public &#39; affairs to have been a &#34; financial debauch.&#34; Yet they were the inheritors of a surplus of over &#163;2,000,000, and also of a possibility quite as great as that which presented itself to the Labour party three years before. They had all the opportunities, nay they had more, because they had the prestige that had been created by such sound financing as the Labour party had practised. They had that asset to go forward with. Almost their first political act has been to repeal what was done by their predecessors in office holding the same political opinions as themselves. They have practically reintroduced an Act which the Labour party repealed. It is almost politically unthinkable that a party who were turned down for their financial policy of borrowing to the extent of &#163;3,500,000 for defence purposes should now have the audacity and the shamefacedness to submit, as almost their first political measure, a repetition of the loan proposal which, to the honour of the Labour party, was repealed three years ago. What treatment can these people expect from the electors when they again appear before them ? If they have a political conscience left, they will seek the oblivion into which the electors sent their party three years ago. As Australians, we have a duty cast upon us which we should never fail to remember whenever legislation is put before us. I wish to impress on every senator the fact that we stand here, not merely as members of a political party, but as the defenders of the interests of the States. The Senate was called into existence to defend the interests of the States; in it each State has been given equal representation, so that the smaller&#39; States may not suffer from the aggression of the larger States. The object was to preserve some balance in the Senate to compensate the smaller States for the preponderating influence of the larger States in the more numerous </para>

                <para class="block">Chamber of this Parliament. That is a principle of our parliamentary institution which we should especially bear in mind when dealing with Loan Bills. We must not forget that a borrowing policy will bear most heavily upon the smaller States, whose assets are naturally of less value than those of the larger States. I wish the Honorary Minister, as a representative of the little State of Tasmania, to allow that view of this question to sink into his mind. By sanctioning the passage of such a Bill as that now before the Senate the honorable senator may jeopardize the interests of his State. He may, unwittingly, no doubt, by his support of such a measure do the State of Tasmania serious injury. Honorable senators on this side should resist any proposal&#39; of this kind in the interests of the States, as well as in defence of the non-borrowing policy of the party to which they belong. We should resist any proposal to borrow money concerning which we have not clear evidence that it can be justified by the development to which it will lead, and the results which will follow from that development. During the last election campaign the greatest stress was laid by our opponents upon the aggregate indebtedness of the States. It was not uncommon for them to trot out a stream of figures, which would remind one of the calculations that enter into astronomical measurements, in order to give the electors to understand the hundreds of millions represented by the aggregate indebtedness of the States. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gould</inline> i9 smiling, and I have not the slightest doubt that he, in his endeavours to illuminate the electors, told them how many hundreds of millions the States have borrowed in the aggregate, and then, passing on to his usual statement as to the wasteful extravagance of the Labour party, left them under the impression that the aggregate indebtedness of &#39; the States was in some way to be attributed to the work of the Labour party. The honorable senator and his friends forgot to tell the electors that the indebtedness of the States was due, not to the Labour party, but to the policy adopted in the past throughout Australia by the Conservative party, to which they belong. We have to consider, in dealing with this Bill, that the Government are proposing that we should add to, and not take  from, the aggregate indebtedness of the States. Our friends were pleased, during the elections, to refer to the loans borrowed by the Labour party, although they knew that not a penny of extra financial burden was laid upon the taxpayers of the Commonwealth because of those loans.&#39; They freely represented as loans the cost of the transferred property, although they knew that the properties were transferred with their loan indebtedness upon them. They did not tell the people that one of the first proposals they would make would be one to add &#163;3,080,000 to  the  aggregate indebtedness of the States. </para>

                        <para>- No. Some persons are rebelling against the taxation they are called upon to pay to-day, but our friends opposite do not tell them that they are adopting the very means which will make additional taxation necessary. They do not tell them that, in this Bill, the Commonwealth is being committed to a policy which, if pursued, must compel the taxpayers to undertake obligations representing many millions more in time to come. Getting into debt is very much like permitting water to leak from a reservoir. Once water through seepage, finds its way through the bank of a reservoir, it is not long before the bulk of the water in the reservoir breaks through the bank. Th* Government are here asking us to tread a very dangerous path. They are initiating a policy which, in times past, has forced other nations into the necessity of repudiating their indebtedness. I am sure that, as Australians, none of us desires that the Commonwealth should do anything of the kind; but we must be most careful in any action that we take at this juncture. We should be especially careful in this Commonwealth, in which we are building up what undoubtedly, in years to come, will be one of the first nations on the earth&#39;s surface. We should desire to escape the evils, difficulties, and handicaps that have hindered other nations. We know that the pawnbroker&#39;s claim must be paid, and paid in kind. It is when the hardest pinch falls upon a nation that it must be so paid, and the taxation then necessary falls upon those least able to bear it. Yet our honorable friends opposite jog merrily along. </para>

                        <para>- Yes, they jog along merrily, and enter into indebtedness without thinking for a moment of what must follow. I say that the lack of care on the part of our opponents in this matter is worthy of the <inline font-style="italic">strongest</inline> condemnation. They propose to borrow for the security and defence of the property of Australia. Is it not just and equitable that the property to be defended should bear the burden of its defence? To whom shall we look for defenders? We shall not search amongst the property -owners only; we will go to the children of the poor, to the man who has little of this world&#39;s gear, to the miner, the farm labourer, the man in the back-blocks. We shall ask them to rally, to drill, and to be ready to lay down their lives, if need be, to defend this country. Is it not just, therefore, that, through increased taxation, the property of Australia should bear the brunt of the cost of our defence scheme ? Honorable senators must admit that the division of responsibility which we propose is even less than fair. Even though the man of property may lose much, he will still have his life. It cannot be denied that the man who lays down his life for his country, who leaves his wife a widow and his children fatherless, is called upon to sacrifice infinitely more than the property owners. For the latter to attempt to escape their just responsibility is for them to be something less than men. They turn to the son of toil, and ask him to pay an equal share with themselves of the cost of defence, and expect him also, in the hour of need, to stand in the leaden hail of battle. Our friends on the other side might very well withdraw such a Bill as this. We were aware of their lack of a policy during the last election, and we can only regard this proposal as an indication of the same - I was going to say political imbecility, but perhaps I had better say of the absolute political bankruptcy of our honorable friends opposite. No land on earth is more prosperous than is Australia to-day, but because we like borrowing, we will go in for further borrowing. </para>

                        <para>- But there is a considerable difference in degree. The wealthy man is able to take comfort while he is amassing his wealth, as well as afterwards, whereas the poor man, while assisting to produce that wealth, has little, if any, comfort. How rarely do we find the worker able to take a trip to Europe? That consideration bears upon another point in my argument. It seems a most cowardly action for a man who is trying to escape paying his share to thrust it on the shoulders of another, who is already bearing heavy burdens. We cannot but wonder that honorable senators opposite do not cudgel their brains a little to find some other way than the one they have propounded here. To this borrowing principle there is no finality. We do not know where it will lead, except in the direction of the Insolvency Court. Take the State which I have the honour to represent. It is paying more than &#163;1,000,000 each year for interest alone. The greatest apologists for borrowing cannot but admit that if that &#163;1,000,000 per annum had been saved, and put into revenue, it would have been much better for the State. </para>

                        <para>- If it is a clear outlook it lies in the direction of oblivion. By establishing the Commonwealth Bank the Labour party entered upon a sounder policy than that advanced by our opponents. The bank gives to the people of Australia the benefit of the credit of Australia, whilst, when we borrow abroad, we give to the people at Home the benefit of our credit. In other words, we are putting Australia in pawn. We are allowing the pawnbroker to dip into our plate of porridge before we taste it ourselves. We are taking from our own sustenance to give to him. If the party opposite had the political intelligence to do so, they would see the advantage of using the credit of Australia to benefit Australia entirely. This financial principle lies at the root of all true success, and until we grip that principle we shall never get out of the habit of going to the pawnbroker for relief. If the party opposite would follow in the direction in which Labour has already blazed the track, they would not introduce such a Bill as this. In two directions already Labour has pointed out a safer track than Conservatism ever found. In one direction it has shown us that there was a source of revenue which had not been utilized, but could be utilized for the benefit of the people of Australia as a whole. I refer to the progressive land tax. In another direction it showed how the credit of Australia could be used for the benefit of Australia. Through the agency of the present banking establishment the sum total of the credit of Australia can be made available for Australia&#39;s use. If our friends would not be so obdurate, and if it were not so difficult to get a new thought into their minds instead of the crazy ones that have occupied them so long, they would see that in these two directions there is light and liberty for the people of the Commonwealth. Railway construction is foreshadowed in this Bill. I admit that there should be construction, either for developing our unused lands or for increasing the facilities for those who occupy lands already in use. The railway from Kalgoorlie to Port Augusta is to absorb &#163;1,400,000 of this loan money. I am not going to pass in review or call into question whether this is a wise policy or not. The railway is in course of construction. I shall not even leave the imputation that it is not a wise policy. The point that I wish to bring before honorable senators is this: A short-sighted policy has been adopted by Parliament in the past in regard to the facilities that will be given for development by means of Commonwealth railways. It is intended to hand over all those facilities to the people who purchase adjacent lands. They do not, in any sense whatever, pay for the facilities when they purchase. It is well known that land at a distance from a railway has a very small commercial value. It may have a good productive value, but that is another matter. This railway from Port Augusta to Kalgoorlie is going to benefit somebody; and I think the just inference is that that somebody who receives the benefit should return a substantial something towards the indebtedness that will fall upon the whole people. The great cities of Australia, from Perth to Brisbane, that will be linked up by this line must benefit considerably. The persons who are to gain should be liable to pay something towards meeting the expense. There are others along the route where development must take place who will benefit. The line will not benefit merely those contiguous to it. Other lands will be developed as a result of it. We can reasonably expect that branch lines will be connected with it. There will be development in the back country. I have not much to charge against this Government in respect to the &#163;1,400,000 they propose to spend upon the railway. But I do say that they should take into their cognisance, and bring under their purview, the benefits to be conferred upon individuals who will not directly contribute anything towards the cost. If something were done in that direction, I feel sure that not only would the action be justified, but that the burden would be met. Here is a strange point. Our party during the last election campaign was condemned wholesale for its policy. &#34;We commenced to build that railway without a Loan Bill. We have carried it through up to the present without borrowing money for it. </para>

                        <para>- That suggestion on the part of the Honorary Minister gives away the whole case. In this Bill we see the result of the failure of the Government to recognise the wisdom of their predecessors. I come now to a question of policy in regard to the construction of the railway from Oodnadatta to Pine Creek. In this Bill, provision is made for the construction of a small piece of that line. It is, therefore, incumbent upon us to consider the method that we should adopt in carrying out that undertaking. Are we to pursue a policy of borrowing all the time? Is it not better that we should think out these problems when we are not subject to the pressure of hard times ? How many of the States would be glad to retrieve some of their financial blunders. So far we have not had before us anything to show in what way this great railway is to be constructed. But if I may regard the evidence which is contained in this Bill as an indication of the Government policy, they intend to build it from the north end first. If so, I venture to say that they will be acting wrongly. At the present time, we have constructed a railway through the greater stretch of the desert portion of Australia - from Port Augusta to Oodnadatta. If that line were continued a few miles further, it would reach the great fertile tablelands of this continent. It must be patent to any man that if that fertile land were linked up with the ports which are already settled, and where facilities exist for the development of trade, two things would be accomplished. Speedier access to market would be given, and it would be easier to protect the Port AugustaOodnadatta railway from the Port Augusta end of it than it would be to protect it from the Northern Territory end. Lest calamity should overtake us in a few years - and it is a wise man who prepares for emergencies - it seems to me that we ought to go on developing along the lines which are most practicable. I have no hesitation in saying that, from the stand-point of development, the north-south transcontinental railway should be commenced from the southern end, and not from the northern. I do not desire my remarks to bear the slightest trace of opposition to the development of the Territory. I am merely stating what has been borne in on me by a close study of the position, and I should be glad if I could extort some remark from the Honorary Minister which would indicate whether the Government intend to develop the Territory in a sane way, or by the backstairs method which is suggested in this Bill. Probably he will feel inclined to say that the late Government authorized a survey of the line from Pine Creek to the Katherine River, and that the present Ministry are merely following in their footsteps. But it must be recollected that no intimation was given by the Fisher Government that they intended to build that line from the northern end. There are two or three big questions linked up with this one. We cannot expect to settle the interior of Australia in any better way than we can settle it by pushing forward with work from the southern end. It is well known that there is a very large artesian basin in that interior, and that water can be got over a large tract of country. Tens of thousands of miles there can be watered entirely by bores which may be&#62; sunk in the earth in that artesian basin. Just as it is anticipated that the Port Augusta-Kalgoorlie railway will tend to develop the Tarcoola mining district, so will the extension of the line  fom  . Oodnadatta northwards tend to develop the Macdonnell Range mineral district. I am well within the mark in saying that there is no spot in .Australia which gives promise of having larger mineral wealth within it than does the Macdonnell Range. Let us look for a moment at what has been the effect of the increased knowledge which we have gained during recent years in the matter of agricultural development. The introduction of superphosphates has practically shown us the possibility of profitably utilizing land which a few years ago was regarded as worthless. It is quite reasonable to expect that a few years more will .bring about even greater revelations, and still broaden this continent of ours so that there rises before one a vision of how the centre of Australia - at present an unpeopled land - may, by the extension of railway facilities, and by the application of knowledge coming to us from the chemical laboratory- </para>

                <para>Senior SENIOR. - I am endeavouring to point out how the measure involves a consideration of railway development. I say that our loan policy should have closely connected with it that developmental policy which is necessary for Australia. I would like to know whether the Government are really seized with the importance of having a base from which to start in this matter, or whether they intend to construct a few miles of railway here, and a few miles there, in a haphazard way, but always by means of borrowed money. Then I find that provision is made in this Bill for the construction of a railway from Port Moresby to Astrolabe, in Papua. Not only is money to be borrowed for this purpose, but it is also proposed to construct wharfs at Port Moresby and Samarai out of loan money. Glorious heritage! We shall presently borrow money for the purpose of paying for gas or electricity. </para>

                        <para>- I would not like to take that interjection as implying that, because he is Treasurer of the Commonwealth to-day, we are to borrow money with which to build wharfs. However, I give the Government credit for their frankness in telling us that they intend to borrow money for that purpose. But I certainly cannot commend them for their policy, nor can I give them a meed of praise for the fact that they are going to use borrowed money to construct such a perishable thing as a wharf, even at Port Moresby. </para>

                        <para>- If the honorable senator will kindly give notice of the question, I shall make inquiries, and I think I am -as much entitled to ask for notice as he is. What have we before the Senate? This Bill has been practically thrown on the table without any information to illuminate the minds of honorable senators. What have we had more than a bare statement that it is proposed to borrow money to build a wharf? There has been no enlightenment afforded concerning the item. We are expected to take the Bill or leave it. When we are inclined to leave the Bill the Government get angry and pettish like a spoilt child is very often, instead of taking us into their confidence, and telling us why the wharf is required, and what the justification is for spending public money there. Had they come down and told us that it was a part of their policy to reserve the oil deposits, and that they wanted a railway to connect with the port, we might have felt very much more inclined to yield to their request than we do at the present time. An honorable senator interjects that, apparently, the railway is required to open up a private copper mine. That is a point on which I hope we shall get some information at question time. I see by the clock that I must hasten to conclude my speech. We have another question to consider that is just as important as the one I have dealt with. In the schedule to this Bill, I observe an item of &#163;170,000 for land for post-office and telephone purposes, and an item of &#163;425,000  for the construction of conduits and laying wires underground. Practically we are asked to approve of the borrowing of nearly half-a-million pounds to put wires underground. Does the Minister of Defence, who is smiling at me, think that there is any sound finance about such a scheme ? It is well known that the undergrounding of the wires has become necessary on account of the influence of the electric cables. We know that very many of these electric cables are owned by private companies, and for their accommodation the Government have to bear the cost of removing the wires from the influence of the cables, so that they can converse by telephone. We are leaving the air free to private enterprise at present. Private enterprise does not come forward and say, as it should do, &#34; We will bear part of the cost of this work which we have made necessary.&#34; I believe that in similar circumstances <inline font-style="italic">private</inline> individuals would quickly go to law. I hold that private enterprise should bear, at any rate, part of this burden, and there should be no need to borrow nearly half-a-million pounds in order to bury our telephone wires. The policy laid down in almost every line of this Bill has little justification. In some instances it has no justification at all, while in others it is worthy of the strongest condemnation. One cannot receive the Bill as it should be received, and I may be pardoned for criticising it as I have done this afternoon, for the reason that it was given little criticism in another place. I do not wish to weary honorable senators, but ask them to go through the Bill and look at its contents carefully. </para>

                    <para>I have no doubt that the Senate has already anticipated the reasons why I am bringing forward the measure at this juncture. It is a common, and, I think, a desirable, practice that, between the submission of a motion for the second reading and the time when honorable senators are to discuss a measure, there should be a reasonable interval. I submit this motion now in order that its purpose, though I anticipate that that is already known, may be explained before we meet again next week, when, I hope, honorable senators will be prepared to deal with the measure with that increasing tendency to work that has marked our proceedings to-day. The Bill itself is a very short one; it is an old friend. At any rate, the older members of the Senate will recollect the animated debate which took place when the whole question of postal voting was under review in connexion with the Electoral Bill of 1911. </para>

                            <para>- The honorable senator said that it was very naughty, but we see nothing in it but a very useful adjunct to the electoral facilities of the people. I want to remind the Senate that, not only was postal voting very fully discussed then, but it did form a rather important subject for discussion during those proceedings which terminated on the 31st May. It was made, at any rate, by the members of the Government party, one of the grounds of appeal to the electors, and, having received  a verdict from the people in support of the policy then enunciated, the Government submit this measure as an effort on their part to redeem a pledge they then gave. The Government did hope, until a certain period of the session, that they would be able to present a larger measure of electoral reform. However, circumstances, which I do not want to particularize to a greater extent, presented themselves which seemed to suggest to the Government that, as so much time had then elapsed, it would be better to leave on one side, for the time being, the other electoral amendments, and to proceed with this one. It is in pursuance of that decision that this Bill, having passed the other House, is presented for the concurrence of the Senate. </para>

                            <para>- I promise to conclude my short address, in order to enable the standing order which, against our wishes, acts to terminate our labours at 4 o&#39;clock, to come into operation. I hope that I may be allowed to offer the few words I have to say on this point. I need not remind honorable senators of what the postal-voting system really is. It provides the opportunity of voting by post to three classes of electors. The first class includes every elector who, for certain reasons, happens to be more than a certain distance from a polling place on polling day. The second class includes every elector who, being a woman, will, on account of ill-health, be unable to attend at a polling booth on polling day. And the third class includes those electors who are prevented by serious illness or infirmity from attending a polling place in order to vote. A great deal has been said about the merits or the demerits of the postal vote, but I do not think that any one will be bold enough to say that it should not be the object of every political party to make provision for the three classes of electors to whom I have referred. The whole question about which the controversy raged was as to whether the postal voting facilities could be extended without opening the door to such irregularities as would in themselves represent an injustice to <inline font-style="italic">bona fide</inline> electors. The Government believe that there is no reason to anticipate in the future that those facilities will be abused. In the past, as has been proved, they were not abused. </para>

                            <para>- The complete answer to the honorable senator is that, at the time those statements were made, his friends were in possession of the legal machinery of the country. They had an Attorney-General, a member of their own party, who had simply to press a button on his table to call in officers, and set the law in motion against the evil-doers; and the fact that he did not may be taken, I think, as proof that, in his mind, at any rate, there waB no evidence to justify the setting of the law in motion. </para>

                            <para>- I certainly do not so intend it. I am bringing it forward as a Government proposal, as to the nature of which, I venture to say, every member of the Senate is fully informed. AH 1 have to do, in the circumstances, is to put it forward, and ask the Senate to deal with it, as no doubt it will in due course. There is one other word which I should like to add. It <inline font-style="italic">in</inline> said that this proposal has been objected to very much when under discussion before. So far as I could gather the effect of that objection, it was that postal voting was liable to be abused. Honorable senators are not opposed to postal voting, provided it can be shown to be free from possibilities of corruption. If that be so, I ask honorable senators to put this question to themselves: We may lay on one side the possibility of a case here and there of abuse of the system, but if it were as freely abused as has been stated, does not common sense suggest that there should be ample proof of that free abuse in the many prosecutions instituted in connexion with itf </para>

                            <para>- The system of . postal voting was in operation while our friends opposite had control of the electoral machinery of the country, and if they were unable to discover irregularities arising under it which entitled them to take action, I submit that the somewhat remote possibility of an occasional irregularity arising under the system is no justification for denying an opportunity to vote to the many thousands who, in the past, have taken advantage of the postal-voting provisions of our electoral law. </para>
