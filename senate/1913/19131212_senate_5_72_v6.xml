                        <para>- Anything mysterious is objectionable to me, as I believe <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ready</inline> knows. As a matter of fact, there is nothing in the delay that has taken place in regard to the signing of the contract which is of any real importance. I will take upon myself the responsibility of saying exactly what the position is. The Government desire that the new service should come into operation at the earliest possible moment. The delay that must take place is due, as everyone knows, to the fact that the new steamer, to comply with the conditions set out in the contract, has to be built. The delay, so far as there has been any delay in the signing of the contract, has been due to the hope that in the course of a day or two we might have been able to get a definite statement from the people concerned as to the date when the new ship would be completed and delivered in Australian waters. As <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ready</inline> will know, that date could not be fixed by the contractors or the Government, or any one else, until the first step was taken of obtaining tenders from ship-builders in England that would specify the date by which the new boat was to be built. There is the whole of the mystery. It is a simple mystery in a little nut-shell. The Government have simply the one desire, to hurry the thing on and to put into the contract itself a definite date. There is the whole position, and there is nothing else to say. </para>

                        <para>- The answer to the questions is -  1 and 2. At the time of Commander Brewis&#39; report the Western Australian Government had projected six new lights mentioned in that report. Of these, three are now in operation, and the apparatus has been ordered by the Western Australian Government for the other three. Eleven other lights were recommended by Commander Brewis, and these are now under consideration by this Government in view of the taking over of the coastal lights generally at an early date. </para>

                        <para>- The answer is -  1 and 2. It is in very rare cases that transfers of married men with large families from one State to another are approved, and then only in cases where it is clearly shown that the transfer is in the interests of the Public Service. </para>

                            <para>- It will be remembered that last night, through an inadvertence - I had spoken in reply to the motion for adjournment - <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor</inline> was prevented from putting a question which he communicated to me privately afterwards. It had reference to the desire on his part, and I suppose on the part of the Senate generally, to be informed as to the business which the Government are anxious to have completed before this session closes, that information being sought with a view to enable an estimate to be formed as to when we can close the labours of the session. It is the desire, and one which I believe is approved by both parties in the other House, that the session should terminate on Wednesday next. I understand, though I have not seen the Prime Minister this morning, that that represents the result of an arrangement made between the two parties in the other House, whose members desire to close the labours of the session on the day I have mentioned. The list of business on the notice-paper seems rather long, but it is not so formidable as it appears. The majority of the measures are not likely to demand much of the time of honorable senators. Many of them, such as the Defence Bill, can be disposed of in a few minutes. The Bills that are to come from another Chamber are limited in number, and with, perhaps, two exceptions, do not represent subject-matter which need occupy attention for a long period. Looking at the measures to be dealt with, I am of opinion that if we adjourn at the usual time to-day, and meet on Monday morning, we can clear up everything, and be ready to pass the Estimates when they reach us. I have every reason to believe they will be here on Monday, and we can then proceed to discuss them. </para>

As far. as the South Australians are concerned, I recognise that they are under a disability. There are two alternatives open to them. Perhaps the better course for them would be to allow the business to proceed in their absence on Monday morning. </para>

                    <para class="block">This is a little measure which can be disposed of in a very few minutes. It may be remembered that last year <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce,</inline> then in charge of the Defence Department, brought forward a Bill to amend the Act substituting detention in military custody for gaol,  where a sentence of imprisonment was imposed for offences in reference to the enrolment and training regulations. It was discovered afterwards, that, owing to a slight defect in drafting, that amendment of the law covered only certain offences, but not the whole of them. The result was that, with the best intentions in the world, its objects were not fully achieved. It was found that it was still possible for magistrates to send cadets to gaol for certain offences. The object of this Bill is to stop that little gap, which was left as the result of faulty drafting. If it becomes law, it will mean that no cadet can be sent to gaol for offences under the universal training regulations, but will, instead, be sent into military detention. That, I venture to say, is a proposal which will command the respect of the House, as did a similar proposition in the previous Parliament. A second amendment of the law made by this Bill is that contained in clause 3. This limits the period of detention which may be allotted to any defaulter to thirty days in any one year. It has happened that where a cadet has been proceeded against for a series of defaults - such, for instance, as failing to register, failing to present &#39; himself for medical examination, any default as to drills, and so forth - magistrates have imposed sentences which, in the aggregate, have amounted to much more than was intended. For instance, I have a case in mind wherein a magistrate sentenced a lad to thirty days for one offence, to thirty days for another, the two to run concurrently, and to an additional twenty days for a third offence, making a total of fifty days. It is obvious that if proceedings were taken for a repetition of offences in any one year, the penalties would pile up to a very serious extent indeed. It has appeared to me, as I hope it will appear to the Senate, that it is desirable to prescribe a limit to the period of detention which can be enforced against any cadet in any one year. That period I have put down at thirty days. </para>

                        <para>.- I trust that the Senate will pass this Bill expeditiously, because it is one of which I am entirely in favour, and which should, indeed, have been passed before. There is only one point which I wish to bring under the notice of the Minister. I believe that the time will soon arise when we shall have to have special magistrates in connexion with the Defence Act. The reason I make that statement is this : Under the present system unpaid magistrates throughout the Commonwealth deal with offences under the Defence Act. All kinds of decisions of the most conflicting, and sometimes of the most harsh, character are given. It has been found necessary, under the Old-age Pensions Act, to appoint special magistrates. </para>

What our experience would have been if we had had to depend upon the ordinary magistrates to deal with old-age pension cases, I do not know. The Minister might, during the recess, give consideration to the question of whether the paid magistrates who now administer &#39;the Old-age Pensions Act could not also administer the Defence Act, so as to give a consistent reading to the Act, instead of the many conflicting readings, resulting often in very harsh decisions, which are now given by magistrates. </para>

                            <para>- No. I have not. Another point to which I wish to refer is this:If this measure lessens the harshness which sometimes results from the peculiar interpretations placed upon the existing Act, it will do good. I agree with the reduction of the period of detention which may be inflicted in any one year. Indeed, if the period were made less than thirty days, it would be an improvement. This is an appropriate time to mention the fact that there is a good deal of unnecessary friction in the working of the Defence Act. It may be a matter of gratification to the Governor-General and others, when reviewing cadets and citizen forces, to notice the manly bearing of the troops, and their correct method of going through evolutions. But it is a cause of regret to many of us, who desire to see our defences become a success, to learn of the unnecessary harshness that has been introduced into its administration. When a complaint is made, the only sympathy one gets is to be told by some flippant officer, who probably never had to face any harshness in his life, that it is a good thing for the lads that they should be treated in this way, because it teaches them what they will have to endure in actual warfare. I have in mind several instances that have come under my personal notice, wherein a great deal pf harshness in the administration of the law has been displayed. Sometimes positive injustice and cruelty have been perpetrated. Much has recently been heard about the military encampment at Liverpool. I was assured by some who have- inside knowledge of what has gone on, that nearly all the trouble which arose occurred through the unnecessary harshness of the officer in charge, the man at the head of affairs. I find that in very many cases there is a tendency on the part of imported men to apply ideas of discipline which are modelled on those applicable to the standing armies of Great Britain and Europe. This breeds a spirit of discontent, which, in my opinion, will tend to militate against the success of our defence system, and may, indeed, lead to its breakdown. If this Bill will go any distance towards mitigating that state of things, I welcome it. No matter how perfect the Act may be, if we have unsympathetic, stupid officers in charge - pompous, overbearing, and arbitrary men, who deliberately try to inflict unnecessary hardship on the cadets in the name of discipline - there will be trouble. </para>

                            <para>- No, but criticism in Parliament is useful in calling attention to it. I trust that the Minister of Defence, and every man who occupies his position in the future, will not delay in getting rid of those who utilize their positions in that way. I am very much afraid that the tendency of the present Administration is to go in for more and more of the imported military official, the &#34; English Johnny &#34; sort of man. I hope that my suspicions are ill-founded, but I have a strong suspicion that the tendency of the Government is to increase the number of British officers employed in the service. It is, in my opinion, all fudge and nonsense to say that we must have a large number of these officers in order to provide the necessary training. The various volunteer systems in force for several years in the States were largely organized and conducted by imported military men, and there should be a sufficient number of capable men trained under those systems to give us all the help we need in inaugurating the new system in the Commonwealth. I think that too much reliance is placed on the supposed perfect knowledge and ability of the imported British officer. I hope that the Government, instead of increasing their number, will go in for giving Australians a chance which they have not hitherto had to the extent they should have had, and will not allow themselves to be influenced by the fetish and silly superstition that we can only get a man with brains by sending to England for him. </para>

                        <para>. - I have no desire to delay the passing of this Bill, but I take advantage of the opportunity to reply to what the Minister of Defence said the other day when I asked him some questions in connexion with the trouble that occurred at the Liverpool camp. The honorable senator said that the trouble there was caused by only about half-a-dozen malcontents. I ask whether it was fair and just that a whole camp of thousands of lads and young men should be penalized as those at the Liverpool camp were because of the outrages and want of discipline of half-a-dozen men. The men attending that camp came away from it tired and disgusted with the service because of the attitude adopted by an officer, whom I shall not name. If these occurrences are repeated in the early history of our defence system, they will tend to break it tdown. Our soldiers should be given an idea that there is something to be gained by military training. Even in the Old Country, the home of the permanent soldier, the Territorials are never treated as the lads who attended the Liverpool camp were treated. The Minister of Defence deprecated remarks which might have the effect of breeding discontent amongst our citizen soldiers; but while I have no wish to do anything of that kind, it is only fair that. I should say that I do not think they are in every case receiving the treatment which they should receive at the hands of their officers. In my opinion, we shall never succeed in blending the two services together, and we should look more to our militia officers than we do. The officers are disgusted at the limited opportunities afforded for promotion. No matter how diligent a man might be, he could not attain a higher rank than that of captain That is unfair and unjust, and the authorities Would do well to take this matter into consideration in the near future. </para>

I asked a question recently in connexion with the case of two lads named Size, who were incarcerated at Fort Largs, in South Australia. The Minister did me the courtesy to show me a copy of the report received from the officer-in-charge. I feel convinced that that officer gave the complaint sympathetic attention. I am not objecting to the Minister&#39;s action in that matter, but only a few moments ago I received a letter from a gentleman who is taking an interest in the case, which is creating some discussion in the State. He informs me that the statement with which I was able to supply him, through the courtesy of the Minister, was purely an <inline font-style="italic">ex parte</inline> statement of the officer-in-charge, and has been denied by the boys incarcerated at Fort Largs. He makes a suggestion somewhat on the lines of that made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce,</inline> that there be a permanent civil commission appointed to go into the merits or demerits of these cases. No matter how fair an officer of the Defence Department may be, if his action or statements be criticised by a trainee or the mother of a trainee who has come under his ban, he naturally &#34; puts the best side to London.&#34; I am satisfied that the universal training system is popular with the great bulk of Australian lads, but we should do what is possible to prevent friction in connexion with it, and the Minister of Defence might consider the suggestion which has been made. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McDougall</inline> referred to the trouble which occurred at the Liverpool camp, and I agree that we must take <inline font-style="italic">cum grano salis</inline> the accounts which have appeared in the press in connexion with that matter. I wish to refer to something that occurred in connexion with the camp recently held at Burrumbeet, 12 miles from Ballarat. According to the reports which have appeared in the press, a number of lads were marched on one of the hottest days in the season a distance of between 12 and 14 miles to that camp. </para>

                            <para>- I have a great admiration and respect for that little drummer lad, but every member of the force may not possess the physical strength, stamina, and heart of that lad. I do not -want our soldiers to be molly-coddled or to be cotton-wool soldiers, but there is such a thing as asking lads who are not in a good physical condition to march a little too far on a hot day laden with a heavy knapsack, and various accoutrements. I call attention to the fact that some public bodies in Ballarat  have  complained that one lad was practically kidnapped off the streets by the officer in charge of a particular  regiment,  and marched off to the camp. The lad was in civilian dress, and, so far as I know, this action was taken without any legal authority whatever. </para>

I admire and appreciate their efforts to build up a citizen army for the defence of the Commonwealth, but I object to what I am given to understand is the attitude adopted by some officers in dragooning the trainees and kidnapping them from the streets. I think that that kind of thing should be prevented, while I admit that it is fair and just that those who do not perform their drills should be punished. </para>

                        <para>. - I think we can say that our system of compulsory training has proved to be a great success. When we compare the number of those who willingly undergo the training with the number who neglect to perform their drills, the comparison is one we have a right to be proud of. I agree with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> that there should be special magistrates appointed to look into cases of offences against the Act by trainees, because much discontent and dissatisfaction was aroused by the harsh decisions of many of the magistrates who dealt with the first offenders brought before them. Possibly that would remove, npt only a good deal of the friction, but a good deal of the feeling which is being exhibited towards the Act, because of the punishment which is being meted out to some of the trainees. It would be a marvel, indeed, if there were not- a few unruly ones amongst the large number of lads who are now undergoing military training. At the same time, the arbitrary manner in which some of these offenders are dealt with by Area Officers can never be justified. Some parents, it is true, appear to think that they have cause to complain of our compulsory training system, when, as a matter of fact, they have no reasonable ground for any such complaint. Quite recently a number of lads who had been taken out to drill were caught in a thunderstorm, with the result that they got very wet. One man with whom I conversed on the subject suggested that it was a terrible thing that the Department did not provide the lads with overcoats or umbrellas to protect them from the storm. </para>

                            <para>- No; they rather welcome it, because it gives an opportunity to the players to indulge in what is known as &#34; fast &#34; play. As one who presided for eighteen months over a Children&#39;s Court, where the decisions of the magistrates are based upon the merits of each case, I hold that the justices who are called upon to deal with defaulting trainees should be clothed with similar power. Both honorary and paid magistrates possess certain traditions. They regard some offences as of a heinous character </para>

                            <para>- I do not think so. Our paid magistrates are brought up in a certain groove. They may view as serious the trifling act of a lad who has been practically tutored by his parents to object to the system of compulsory training. At one or two meetings which I have attended, I have heard the most outrageous statements made as to the way in which the boys are dealt with, and I have heard our compulsory training system denounced as conscription. The way in which our Defence Act was spoken of was enough to bring tears to the eyes of a stuffed Egyptian. </para>

I have been told that the funds of this league are contributed by the Cadbury Cocoa people in England for the avowed purpose of destroying our system of compulsory training. Whether that is so or not, I cannot say. It would be satisfactory if we could learn whether, apart from objections by a section of our own people, there are outsiders who are contributing money in an endeavour to break down that system. </para>

                        <para>. - Upon the whole, I appreciate the tone of the debate which has taken place on this Bill, and I am impressed with at least one of the suggestions that has been made. I would like to refer to one or two observations by honorable senators, taking them in the order in which they were made. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> has suggested the desirableness of appointing special magistrates to deal with defaulters under the universal training regulation&#39;s. I shall certainly give consideration to that suggestion. I may say that my own thoughts were running along lines not quite parallel, but leading in the same direction. It appears to me that a good deal of the trouble experienced under our compulsory training system is due, not so much to the magistrates as to the different officers who are charged with launching the prosecutions. What I had in my mind was not to attempt an alteration in respect of the magistrates, but to see if it were not possible to appoint in each State an officer whose special business it would be to deal with prosecutions. </para>

It is true that the Area Officers vary, but the duty of the special officer which I had in my mind would be to instruct the Area Officers, and to supervise prosecutions before they were launched. Such a system would, at any rate, bring about uniformity. Unnecessary prosecutions would be eliminated, and in other cases a postponement might be granted, and an intimation made to the Court as to the sense of gravity with which the Department viewed those cases. I shall consider side by side with that the suggestion which has been made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce.</inline></para>

                    <para class="block">I am concerned, there has been no alteration in the system of universal training since my advent to the Defence Department. But when a large staff is created upon which serious responsibilities are thrown, it is inevitable that there will be occasional acts of indiscretion. Upon the whole, we may congratulate ourselves that those acts have been so few. Having said that, I do not wish the Senate to assume that we have reached finality. In my judgment, we shall never reach it. Experience will gradually suggest where we can remove some little weakness, and provide for some little improvement. It will be the duty of the Minister of Defence for the time being to be continually looking round with a view to seeing if he cannot eliminate friction from our compulsory training system, the success of which must rest on the goodwill of the people themselves. I do think that those who are friends, of that system should be very slow to accept as substantiated either press statements or statements which emanate from the few discontented lads in any unit. I do not mean to say that officers never do wrong. But it is strong presumptive evidence that the system is working well when we find that, out of 500 boys who are being trained under one officer, 495 are contented, and make no complaints, whilst the other five are discontented, and full of complaints. </para>

                            <para>- Yes; and the individual who led them was a little boy who, if he had not been in uniform, would have been in knickerbockers. The fact that that little lad could lead t&#187; column without experiencing any discomfort is fair evidence that no hardship was inflicted upon them. In regard to the same camp, I wish now to deal with another statement by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Blakey</inline> to the effect that a military officer went into the town and kidnapped a defaulter. The information which comes to me is that there was a defaulter following the occupation of a billiard-marker in a saloon in Ballarat. He was required by the Court, and a policeman was sent to take him; but the officer who went with him went, not to act as arresting officer, but to identify the lad. It is easy to see that the journalists - they are after sensational copy, and that is why they occasionally come here - immediately listened to the grievance of the proprietor of the saloon, or the lad, or the lad&#39;s father. But there was nothing to complain of. The real point to be borne in mind is that the cadet was a defaulter. The fact that a military officer went to the billiard saloon with a policeman to identify the lad is no evidence, I venture to say, of harshness. </para>

                            <para>- I ask friends of the system to recognise how easy it is for statements of this kind - idle chatter, as much of it is - to find publication through the press. It is, perhaps, the duty of the press to publish these statements, but it is not the duty of the friends of the compulsory training to accept them as evidence, or worthy of repetition, until some inquiry has been made. I do not wish the impression to go abroad that I am closing my eyes to the possibility of defects in the system; I am not. Whenever anything appears in a newspaper that suggests improper conduct, the first and regular step is to call for an inquiry. I am doing that now in regard to the matter to which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McDougall</inline> has referred - the camp at Liverpool. I think that before it is all over I shall be able to make a public statement, which, at any rate, will not be designed to cloak anybody, if anybody has committed a wrong. But my statement that half-a-dozen were at fault had reference, as the honorable senator may possibly recollect, to the alleged revolt at the bridge. </para>

I know that I will be told that that is the maximum, but there is a great tendency on the part of some magistrates to impose the maximum. Then the expression in paragraph <inline font-style="italic">b</inline> of the sub-section &#34; commits a breach of discipline while ons parade &#34; is construed sometimes in a most flagrantly unjust and arbitrary manner. A tyrannically minded officer - and, unfortunately, there are such men - may construe the slightest act into a breach of discipline. </para>

                            <para>- The magistrate, as a rule, favours the view put forward by the officer. That is my complaint. The tendency is to exact the full penalty for what sometimes is very little more than an imaginary breach. The most trivial&#39; departure from strict etiquette on parade - for it is hardly more than that - is made an excuse for persecuting cadets, and I use the word &#34; persecuting &#34; advisedly. The most trivial things are taken notice of by the Area Officer, or whoever is drilling, sometimes- </para>

                            <para>- No; I am speaking in the interests of the cadets. The most paltry and the most, ridiculous departure from what the officer in charge thinks is the strict rule of militarism brings the weight of his vengeance down upon some poor unfortunate lad, who is hauled up before a magistrate. As a rule, I do not feel very much fondness for magistrates. The typical magistrate is not too sympathetic an individual, and he generally goes up to the maximum fine. </para>

                            <para>- I was in the Defence Force when I was a lad in New Zealand, and I never had a complaint made against me. I am speaking quite seriously in urging that the penalty in section 135 of the Act should not be so great. The last clause of this measure limits the period of detention for the cumulative charges that may be brought against the most refractory lad to not more than thirty days. That means a big reduction in what may possibly have been inflicted under the Act as it stands. If the Government are going to reduce the possible term of detention, they should make a <inline font-style="italic">pro raid</inline> reduction in the possible monetary penalty. Monetary penalties do not fall on the boys, but on the parents, and, consequently, we should not make the Act any more harsh than is possible. It is undoubtedly harsh when, for a mere imaginary breach of discipline, such as talking on parade, a strong martinet may haul the lad up before a magistrate, and such cases are not unknown. Whether it is desired to increase the Commonwealth revenue or not, I do not know. </para>

                            <para>- There was a tendency, perhaps, in the first instance, for magistrates who either took what, in my judgment, was a wrong view of the obligation imposed upon them, or did not quite understand what the Act provided, to inflict, perhaps, unnecessarily heavy penalties; but I cannot discover that there is any reason for that fear now. Personally, I have no great regard for a monetary penalty, but the alternative to that is confinement. There may be many cases in which a boy, or even his parents, would prefer to find a moderate monetary penalty than to have the lad sent into military detention. </para>

                            <para>- It is because the honorable senator would regard it as a nasty hit, that I am hoping that he will be a law-abiding citizen. There is nothing to warrant the alteration at the present time. I have not discovered any case of hardship, though if there are any they generally filter through to the Minister&#39;s room. But it is always well to recognise that you may have to deal with extreme cases; and where it is necessary for the Court to exercise some firmness it is desirable that this penalty should be retained&#39;. </para>

                        <para>.  - I think there is something in the contention with reference to the fine of &#163;5. It has sometimes been enforced in the past in hard cases, and will probably be again. I am aware that there is a provision that the penalty shall be governed by the condition of the parents of the offender, because ultimately the burden falls on them. But I point out that our defence system bears an appearance of harshness by reason of having these severe fines. If the maximum amount were &#163;10 it might not be enforced, but the fact that there was a &#163;10 fine imposable would conduce to arguments being used against the severity of our defence system. The lowering of the fine would not interfere with discipline, but it would remove a bugbear that exists in the minds of many people. </para>

                        <para>. - We all deprecate, and desire to remove, anything like class distinction in our Defence Forces, but reducing the maximum line from &#163;5 to &#163;2 will have no such effect. We can well understand that a boy whose parents are poor will, if fined, have to go to detention, because his fine would not be paid. But if the boy were the son of a solicitor, a doctor, or a merchant, no matter what he did his father would be able to pay the fine. If the fine were reduced to &#163;2 such a boy, if inclined to pay no regard to discipline, would be the more disposed to defy the law. Offences might be committed that would justify a magistrate in imposing the penalty of &#163;5. If the fine were paid the boy would not go into detention, but if the fine were not paid the period of detention would depend upon the amount of the fine. I am afraid that our democratic friends who want to reduce the fine are only playing into the hands of those who have no democratic instincts. </para>

                            <para>- The fine can be recovered, not from the parent, but from the lad. How is it recovered? You cannot imprison the bo)&#39; for the debt, nor can you proceed by distress; and, therefore, unless the lad consents to pay the fine cannot be recovered. But the length of the detention that is given as an alternative to payment of the fine is governed by the amount of the fine. If an offender is fined the maximum amount the detention would be for a longer term than would be the case if the fine were less. If you are going to cut down the amount of the fine you consequently cub down the length of the term of detention. There have been cases in which a heavy fine was absolutely required. I can give a few from memory. There was one of a youth in a rear rank who kicked a youth in the front rank, so that his eye struck his rifle, and was seriously damaged.  His  sight was impaired for life. It is all very well to have sympathy with the boy who indulges in horseplay, but I reserve my sympathy for the boy whose sight was damaged. We should sympathize with those who suffer as the result of the insubordination of an inconsiderable &#39;minority. I remember another case of a lad who threw a lump of rock through the window of a drill-room, and hit another boy on the head so as to stun him. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Rae,</inline> I suppose, would give his sympathy to the boy who .threw the rock. I give my sympathy to the boy who received it on the head, and say that the other one deserved a fine of &#163;5, or detention for the maximum period. </para>

                            <para>- No; under military discipline he can only be proceeded against under the Defence Act. I deprecate all this mawkish sympathy, this maudlin talk, which would exalt into heroes a lot of young larrikins who are a nuisance to those who are complying with the law, and who make it difficult to carry out the training scheme in a proper manner. That is the kind of individual who is the cause of others following a bad example, and bringing about a slackness in discipline. A number of lads of that kind in a company would corrupt the whole, lot. I have no sympathy with them, and I am not going to vote for an amendment which would make these &#39;offences appear trivial. There have been, and there are, offences arising from insubordination of the character I have indicated which a stiff penalty is required to meet. The maximum penalty is only imposed in serious cases. In the majority of instances no action is taken. You will not improve the magistrates by lowering the fine. You do not put common sense into a magistrate&#39;s head by making the penalty which he may inflict less than it ought to be in proportion to the offence. I am glad to say that the cases which severe penalties are required to meet are becoming more and more rare. But when they occur we should have the means of dealing with them. </para>

                            <para>- So is <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce&#39;s</inline> at the present time. He accused me of trying to make heroes of these fellows. Only the most lively imagination could construe anything I said in that way. I never said a word that implied that- I had any sympathy with offenders as such, or any desire to elevate to the rank of heroes those who kicked over the traces. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> may make up in imagination what he lacks in general logic. He says that because a magistrate might still under my amendment inflict a maximum fine of &#163;2, that is an argument for leaving the maximum at &#163;5. Though a magistrate may do an injustice under the penalty I propose, at the worst he could only inflict an injustice that would be &#163;3 less severe than the injustice which might be inflicted under the existing penalty. I remind honorable senators that offenders who commit grave breaches, involving the destruction of property, or it may be the maiming of any person, can be proceeded against under the common law. I take the instance cited by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> of a boy&#39;s eyesight! having been injured. No one would have more sympathy than I with the victim of such an injury, but a boy indulging in horse-play, and attacking another from behind, might do so a hundred times without inflicting any injury at all. There is no evidence in the case cited of a malicious attempt to wound. A fine of &#163;5 would do the victim of such an injury no good, and it would not prevent lads indulging In horse-play. The difficulty is that harsh or unfair magistrates may inflict a penalty out of all proportion to the offence, and, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Barker</inline> has pointed out, by so doing make the Act itself unpopular by inflaming people&#39;s minds with a feeling of resentment. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> is great in expounding the benefits which have followed from evolution, but I remind him that there has been evolution in the matter of punishment in the administration of justice, just as there has been in industrial matters, and as punishments have been reduced, offences against the law have decreased. It has been found that harsh punishments, by creating feelings of resentment, are provocative of further crime. </para>

                            <para>- I admit that. I am not trying to bring about an ideal condition of things, but to get as near to it as practicable. I do not suggest the <inline font-style="italic">reductio ad absurdum</inline> of Senators Pearce and Millen that we should abolish all laws, and legislators also, but I do say- that merciful consideration in the punishment of offences has the tendency to improve the behaviour of those who are in fault. I have sons who are being drilled, and not one of them has been subjected to. the slightest reproof for anything he has done, which goes to show that the breed is not too bad after all. I am not speaking with any personal feeling in the matter, but because instances of harsh treatment have come under my notice. Neither <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> nor <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> has replied to the contention that a reduction in the terms of detention, as proposed, justifies a <inline font-style="italic">pro</inline><inline font-style="italic">rata</inline> reduction in the fine. Monetary penalties and detention for the same offences should bear some relation one to the other. </para>

                    <para>SenatorRAE. - A man might commit twenty offences, for each of which he might be fined &#163;5, and my contention is that if, as is proposed, there may be a reduction in the term of detention which may be imposed in respect of a number of offences, there should be a corresponding reduction provided for in the cumulative pecuniary penalty. The Minister has admitted that he is not particularly keen upon any money penalty, and I am, therefore, unable to see why he should object to the reduction of the fine which I propose. If in very few cases it is found necessary to impose the penalty of &#163;5, we may assume that, as the system is continued, it will be found that a maximum fine of &#163;2 will be as effective for the purpose in view as the maximum of &#163;5 has been in the past. </para>

                        <para>. - I should not have spoken on the Bill if it were not for something which fell from <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce.</inline> I do not wish to be placed in the position of one who is opposed to compulsory training. I have always supported it, and am as strongly in favour of it as is any one in Australia, but I wish to see it carried out to the best advantage. I have known of abuses that have occurred in connexion with it, and I brought before <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce,</inline> when he was Minister of Defence, instances in which boys had been absolutely badly treated. We have a number of boys engaged in the coastal trade in Australia. In some of the places where these lads are trained a. syllabus is issued under which one section of the Naval Reserve is drilled on the Tuesday, another on the Wednesday, and another on the Thursday. The boys to whom I refer may have only one day in port in the month, and it is impossible for them to attend the drills. They are obliged to put in a certain number of days&#39; drill in each year, and in order to do so have to leave their ships and employment, and forfeit their wages. These disabilities do not apply to boys working on shore, who can put in their drills at night. It is right that breaches of discipline should be visited with punishment, but we had a case in Adelaide recently where an Area Officer assaulted twenty or thirty boys by knocking them round a room, and no punishment was inflicted upon him. </para>

                            <para>- What of that, if he was not fined or imprisoned? In very many cases where breaches of discipline occur, the officers are responsible for them. The schoolmasters in our public schools have the power to inflict punishment, but we never hear of them exercising it. They create such a spirit of loyalty in their pupils that there are no breaches of the discipline of the school. Honorable senators must admit that much depends on the character of the officers who have charge of the trainees. Any penalty inflicted upon trainees should be of a nominal character, and not such as is proposed in this Bill. </para>

                            <para>- In some respects it is sad, I admit, but not in all. There is, I venture to say, ample material in the history of Nor fork Island for the pen of a Robert Louis Stevenson. While I am not going to dwell upon that aspect of the matter, there is no reason why I should not appeal to every honorable senator to read - as I am sure he can do with great interest to himself - the early history of Norfolk Island. Its constitutional history is all set out in the preamble of this Bill, which has been written by a man who appeals even to this Senate - I refer to the Minister of External Affairs. In this measure we have adopted a procedure, which is a very welcome one, by inserting in it a long and interesting preamble which will tell any honorable senator who chooses to pay more than passing attention to it what has been the previous political history of Norfolk Island. </para>

                            <para>- The reference to Orders in Council seems very much like it. Norfolk Island was discovered about 140 years ago. As the preamble states, its control has been bandied about between far and away the two most important States of the Commonwealth, namely, New South Wales and Tasmania. Tasmania formerly had control of the island, and in those early days she said, &#34; We will let New. South Wales assume control of it.&#34; That State did so, and at a later period said, in effect, &#34; Excellent as our control of the island may be, we believe that Tasmania is able to manage it, and, therefore, we will hand it back to that Colony.&#34; Still later, by a sort of reciprocal arrangement, the control of the island was again vested in New South Wales. The present position is that the Governor of that State represents the Commonwealth, and it is desirable that Norfolk Island should be placed under Commonwealth control, just as Papua has been placed under our control. </para>

                            <para>- It is an extremely pleasant little island, and it would conduce to the better behaviour of all of us if we had an opportunity for six months&#39; quiet reflection there. It would be a handsome investment on the part of the Government if some persons - I will not mention names - could be induced to take a six months&#39; holiday on Norfolk Island, especially between the months of July and December. The Bill contains similar provisions to those to be found in the Papua Act. There are one or two items in it which may be seized upon by my honorable friends opposite as subjects for debate, and, therefore, I propose to draw attention to them. First of all, there is the question of land tenure. Let me tell honorable senators what is the position in the island to-day. The total area of Norfolk Island is 8,500 acres, all of which, with the exception of 1,300 acres, has been alienated. As the island has been more or less developed for over 100 years, there has been in force there the usual process of selection. The result is that the 1,300 odd acres which have not been alienated represent the very poorest land. I mention this circumstance deliberately, because I wish to ask honorable senators opposite whether it is worth while to raise in connexion with this Bill the question of leasehold <inline font-style="italic">versus</inline> freehold . </para>

                            <para>- I am making a pathetic appeal to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Mullan</inline> and others not to apply their views in respect of leasehold tenure to these 1,300 odd acres of the very poorest land in Norfolk Island. Another matter which may be in dispute in the Bill relates to what we should drink, and where we should drink, if we lived on Norfolk Island. May I sum up the position thus : This is a Bill which has the approval of the best teetotaller in the Commonwealth Parliament. </para>

                            <para>- I recognise that, at this stage of the session, it is impossible for a Minister, in introducing a Bill, to occupy the time, however concise he might be, which he would probably occupy with a fuller latitude. In these circumstances, I throw myself upon the mercy of honorable senators, if they feel inclined, and I hope that they will not, to accuse me of treating them abruptly. I have to risk that accusation, because I desire to save time. Moreover, I wish to set an example in the hope that it will be followed. This Bill contains two clauses, which are important to Norfolk Island. The first of them is clause 15. Norfolk Island presents a very strange example to men who care to dip into economic problems that engage the consideration of self-supporting countries, and the question of the balance between imports and exports. Here is a little island which to-day finds itself importing, as nearly as possible, seven times the value of what it exports. Yet it continues to exist. </para>

                            <para>- It is a very interesting problem in economics how any country can go on living under those conditions. The Bill proposes to help that state of things. Clause 15 provides that no duties of Customs shall be chargeable on anything imported into Australia from Norfolk Island - that is, there shall be Free Trade from Norfolk Island to the Commonwealth - under certain conditions. The first condition is that the goods are the produce or manufacture of Norfolk Island; the second that the goods are shipped direct from Norfolk Island to Australia; while the third is that they are not goods which, if manufactured or produced in Australia, would be subject to any duty of Excise. I submit that, with these precautions, no man, whatever his fiscal views may be, can possibly object to the stimulus which such a provision will give to manufacture, trade, and production, chiefly, of course, to production in the island. Clause 16 of the Bill deals with the liquor traffic. I can best, I think, put that question before honorable senators by telling them shortly what the present condition is. The clause reads - </para>

                        <para>. - I do not know any very great good or ill that is going to be accomplished by this Bill. It is like most of the measures we have had so far - not of any great vital importance. I was told by the Honorary Minister that I was raising a party issue, and I interjected that the political history he referred to was mainly a record of Ordinances. It was just an interjection dealing with the fact that the preamble, if it can be so termed, is a record of the way in which Norfolk Island has been bandied about from one power to another. I meant no party significance in my remark. </para>

                            <para>- I think that the &#34; swapping &#34; about of Norfolk Island had practically no effect on the islanders. They did not know the difference. If you could tow the island a little closer to Australia, there would be some practical good in annexing it. It strikes me that there is only one big point of difference between some honorable senators on this side and the Minister. I think it is regrettable that when the Senate saw fit to amend another Bill it should be abandoned. I do not know to what extent the Ministry are in earnest in bringing forward this measure, if they are not prepared to accept an amendment. </para>

                            <para>- I, also, am in earnest in wanting to insert a clause which was proposed in another place and rejected. I am not so particular about the clause relating to liquor, although I think it would be a good thing, from the point of view of a moderate drinker, or a heavy drinker, or a non-drinker, to have at least one part of the Commonwealth where there was no liquor, so that hopeless victims might be given a term there. It would not affect me, as I am an abstainer. I know of many excellent men in the community whose valuable talents have become entirely lost through their becoming unwilling victims to drink. Therefore, I believe that it would&#39; be an exceedingly good thing if there was one teetotal corner of the Commonwealth where hopeless victims could not get any drink. </para>

                            <para>- We cannot help that. I have been told that the regulations in force do not prevent the free use of liquor by those who like to have it. Every ship that calls at the island smuggles liquor ashore. I am informed that the Anglican Mission, who own the bulk of the property, consume a fair quantity of liquor. I &#39;do not know why the frock-coated gentlemen should be the only people who are to be able to consume liquor. It appears to me that they, above all others, should set the example of not having any liquor. Again, take the  cablegrammers  I suppose that a good deal of the fiction that we get through the cable is due to the men at the cable station being allowed free liquor. I quite realize that it would not be easy probably to trust the inhabitants with any self-governing powers in that direction which would be any more effective than the present Ordinances. What I do object to was the refusal, in the other place, to include a clause to prevent the remaining Crown lands on the island from being sold. It is immaterial to me when the Senate adjourns. I am not anxious for an adjournment. </para>

                            <para>- In my opinion, the interests of the country are above the interests of parties or individuals. While I could put in my time at home more enjoyably than I could do here, I am not going to help to get through public business if the Senate has to swallow every piece of legislation in the form in which it is introduced. The Honorary Minister, dwelt on the fact that of the total area of the island only 1,300 acres were not alienated, and that that was land of poor quality. I can well believe it. Probably it consists of rocky eminences in the centre of the island. If it was only 1$ acres, if it was all solid rock, without an ounce of soil, I would be just as strong; in the contention that we should not sell any of the lands which remain the property of the Crown - that is, of the people. Therefore, I intend, if the Bill gets into Committee, to move an amendment to that effect, and it is absolutely immaterial to me how much time is taken up in the consideration of it. As far as I am able under the forms of the Senate, I shall certainly oppose tha Bill unless my amendment is accepted by the Government. If they will not accept it, I shall do all I can to delay the progress of the Bill, because I think that on every occasion we should assert a principle of this kind. I understand that the Anglican Mission own the bulk of the best land on Norfolk Island, and that the remainder is land of a comparatively poor character. Nevertheless,. I think that we should assert a principle whenever there is an opportunity. The indorsement of the principle of this Bill might not affect many individuals in Norfolk Island, but it will be an indorsement of a principle in which many of us do not believe. We do not believe in parting with the fee simple of land anywhere. This island has a . considerable population, consisting principally of descendants of <inline font-style="italic">Bounty</inline> mutineers, who have amalgamated * with the native race. They will, in time, want more land upon which to earn a living. Therefore, I maintain that . we should not pay the slightest attention to the fact that only a small amount of land is left unalienated. The smaller the amount that is left the more valuable it will be, and the more reason there is for not allowing it to get into the hands of any one  who wants to exploit the natives. The situation of the island - hundreds of miles from our coastline - offers few facilities for the inhabitants to spread themselves. We should be very jealous on that account of the possibility of the land coming into the hands of persons who may simply desire to exploit it for their own benefit, and to keep the inhabitants circumscribed within the area available to them for cultivation. I have never heard that there were any great demands for this Bill. I do not suppose that the islanders would be any worse off if it did not pass. The effect of it will be to extend the area of the Commonwealth by bringing under our jurisdiction an island which is now under the governorship of New South Wales. But I do not know that the inhabitants would suffer a grievous loss if the Bill had never seen the light of day. Nor do I know that the power, prestige, and glory of the Commonwealth would be much enhanced by including these few thousand acres under its rule. There would be no particular loss from the abandonment of this measure, nor would much be gained from the passage of it. Unless Ministers are prepared to adopt the principle &#39; that the remaining Crown lands shall be preserved to the people, I shall vote against its adoption. It has been argued that the area is so small that it will not afford a good example of the working of the leasehold principle. If that be so, it will involve no great sacrifice of principle by the Ministry to concede the point. </para>

                            <para>-  Then the land will be theirs to deal with, whereas, if it is alienated, it will not be theirs, so that the honorable senator&#39;s argument supports my point of view. If there be no sacrifice of principle on our part in allowing the land to be sold, there can be no great sacrifice of principle on the part of Ministerialists in accepting the reservation of the Crown lands from alienation. The peculiar conditions of the island, and the fact that it has a very small area under cultivation, demand consideration. The population is slowly increasing, and the people will in time want the remainder of the land, even if they do not want it now. I think, therefore, that the land ought to be preserved from the grasp of the exploiter and the monopolist. </para>

                            <para>- I remind the Minister that 1,300 acres of land out of 9,000 acres is an enormously larger proportion than would be 13,000,000 acres in Australia. That is an additional reason why this land should be preserved. We know that in every civilized country in the world, as the best land gets appropriated, people have to do their best with the least productive land ; so that what at one time might be considered so poor as to be almost worthless will become very valuable as population increases and the pressure on the land increases with it. </para>

                            <para>- We have not been made so fully acquainted with the Government Ordinances about the land as with those relating to liquor. But the island is circumscribed, and what is left of the land ought to be preserved for the use of the native inhabitants. The historical records of which the Minister has spoken indicate, amongst other things, that years ago these islanders were living on Pitcairn Island. On account of the growth of their numbers and the pressure on the resources of the island, they were transferred collectively to Norfolk Island, where there&#39; was more room for them. </para>

The land question is at the bottom of all social questions. We now have an &#39;opportunity to apply the leasehold principle by providing that the land left unalienated in Norfolk Island shall be kept for the use of the islanders, and not sold in fee simple. It may be said that there is no present intention to sell it. But if the Government will not accept a clause which will prevent its alienation, I am prepared to fight upon the details until they give in. If the result be the abandonment of the Bill, we shall hope for a more progressive measure &#39;from another Government at a future time. </para>

That is to say, I am fighting for the leaseholder as against the freeholder. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart</inline> is arguing that a leasehold may be as dangerous as the freehold. I do not think that it is so. In any case, leaseholding  is a principle for which we should fight. If the Minister will not consent to the amendment I have indicated, I shall feel obliged in Committee to put up a fight for it. Upon the Bill generally I desire to say no more. </para>

                            <para>- We took over the Northern Territory at a time when there were heavy responsibilities connected with it. The people of South Australia had shouldered the burden for a long time, and apparently came to the conclusion that they had had enough of it. They thought that the burdens of the future ought to be shifted on &#163;o the shoulders of the people of the Commonwealth. </para>

It is a fundamental1 and basic principle of the Labour party that we shall oppose the alienation of Crown lands. Whether the area be small or large, the principle is the same. Although we are told that only 1,300 acres are involved, nevertheless, it is our duty to do all we can to further the principle which I and every other member of the Labour party conscientiously believe in. There is another matter, which may appear very small, but which I should like honorable senators to consider. Clause 15 of the Bill provides that - </para>

                        <para>- Why not give me an opportunity to answer? When <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Mullan</inline> raised this objection before, I agreed that there might be something in it, but that it was not in the right place. Since then, what has happened with regard to the railway is that the Bill to authorize its construction has been circulated amongst honorable senators, and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Mullan</inline> can see from it what is proposed. With regard to the order of procedure, even <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Mullan</inline> must admit that, unless we get the money required for the construction of the railway, it is of no use to go on with the Railway Bill. The order of procedure adopted was due to a desire to convenience honorable senators, and to get on with the business of the Senate. The Government have endeavoured to get the best advice they could on the subject, and they have been advised that the construction of a line from Pine Creek to the Katherine River in the direction proposed is desirable. Secondly, taking into consideration all that can be ascertained as to the features of the Northern Territory and future development there, the direction chosen is the right direction. Thirdly, the survey made is for the most economical line that could be built in that country, and will involve less cost than any of the other lines that have been suggested. To put the matter briefly, the line proposed runs practically as the crow flies from Pine Creek to the Katherine River. It was proposed in _ the last Parliament that this line should be constructed at a cost of &#163;500,000, exclusive of the cost of a bridge over the Katherine River. </para>

The fact is that when the Survey Bill was before the last Parliament two estimates were mentioned, one of &#163;500,000 for the line, and another of &#163;170,000 additional for a bridge over the Katherine River. I am meeting the Committee fairly by telling honorable senators that, in our estimate of &#163;400,000, we exclude the amount required for the construction of the bridge over the Katherine River, which, so far as we are concerned, is estimated, as previously, at &#163;170,000. Inasmuch as this question was thoroughly threshed out when the Bill was last before us, I do not propose to occupy more time, but shall content myself with moving - </para>

But we have very little time to do a lot of work, and I think, therefore, that we ought to vote rather than talk. I would point out to honorable senators that, before introducing, for the consideration of Parliament, Bills to authorize the construction of public works, it is the invariable custom to provide the necessary money for those works. </para>

We cannot cavil at the action of the Government, which is precisely the action which the late Government took under similar circumstances. To attempt to raise an argument upon that question is simply an attempt to split  straws. As we have made up our &#39;minds on this matter, I think that we should get to a vote immediately.

I trust that that amendment, which was carried in a fit of aberration, will be rejected. As far as I can understand, two objections were urged to the Government proposal when the Bill was last before us. The first was that the Bill authorizing the construction of the proposed railway had not then been submitted for our consideration, and the second was that freezing works had not been established in the Northern Territory. The first objection has now been removed - the Bill for the construction of the line from Pine Creek to the Katherine River is before the Senate - and as this Government will not remain in office for ever there is no reason why freezing works should not be established in the Territory by their successors. In those circumstances, I intend to support the motion of the Honorary Minister.

                    <para>. - When the Honorary Minister was speaking, I interjected that when the Pine Creek to Katherine River Railway Survey Bill was under consideration in this Chamber he himself had estimated the cost of that line at &#163;670,000. Upon turning up the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> report of the debate I find that, up till the time when <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Clemons</inline> spoke upon the Bill, only an estimate had been given of the cost of that railway. He then stated that he had gone into a calculation, and he believed that the cost of the bridge over the Katherine River would be at least &#163;100,000. The Minister who was in charge of the Bill thereupon informed him that the estimated cost of that bridge was &#163;170,000. I was under the impression that it was <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Clemons</inline> who had made that estimate, but I find that my memory has played me false. . I have not changed my opinion on this matter, and I do not intend to reverse the vote which I recorded last week. On that occasion it was not urged that honorable senators should vote against the item because the Bill authorizing the construction of the Pine Creek to Katherine River railway was not before this Chamber. The argument advanced was that, as fourteen months had elapsed since we passed a measure authorizing the survey of the line, and as 30 miles of that survey had already been completed, leaving only 26 miles to be surveyed, we ought to be put in possession of the fullest information as to the cost of the undertaking, and that it would- be wrong to sanction the raising of this money before we had sanctioned the carrying out of the work. I have always understood that the method adopted in the building of railways is first to obtain a survey of the country through which it will pass. That information is placed before Parliament. An estimate is then obtained of the cost of constructing the line, and that information is also laid before Parliament, whose members are thereupon asked ti&#62; make up their minds on the matter. The procedure which is being followed1 here is quite different. . Without one atom of information, honorable senators are being asked to vote &#163;400,000 for the construction of this line. When the Pine Creek to Katherine River Railway Survey Bill was before this Chamber, we were informed that the estimated cost of that railway was &#163;500,000. Now the Honorary Minister tells us that it is believed that &#163;400,000 will be sufficient to cover it. Believed on what? That is the information which we ought to have. </para>

                    <para>. - Upon a former occasion one of my objections to this item was that the line to the building of which this &#163;400,000 is to be devoted has not yet been authorized, and that we had no information as to the character of the country through which it would pass. It seems to me ridiculous for the Government to decide to raise money before there is any necessity to do so. The Honorary Minister has said that if we do not decide to build the line the Government will not raise the money. Then, why do we require to sanction the raising of the money? Would the late Government have been justified in asking Parliament to vote &#163;1,400,000 towards the construction of the Kalgoorlie to Port Augusta railway before it had approved of the building of that line? Had it done so the proposal would have been laughed out of the Senate. </para>

                        <para>- It is not. It is absurd to say that we should first raise &#163;3,000,000, and afterwards decide what shall be done with it. I think that before we assent to this item we should authorize the construction of the line from Pine Creek to the Katherine River. Yet the Bill dealing with that matter has been deliberately postponed until after the consideration of the message of the House of Representatives relating to this Bill. As <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Turley</inline> has pointed out, a survey of the proposed line was authorized fourteen months ago, and it is only reasonable to expect that the result of that survey and a report on the nature of the country which the line will traverse would have been forthcoming. </para>

                        <para>- That strengthens my argument. I do not consider myself justified in sanctioning the raising of money for the construction of a railway through country the character of which has not been made known to honorable senators. Our financial obligations are  growing daily. They are growing out of all proportion to the ability of the people to meet them. Therefore, it is essential that every proposal involving expenditure, especially loan expenditure, should be carefully scrutinized before it is adopted. In the present instance we are asked to. appropriate &#163;400,000 to build a railway, and we have no guarantee that that railway will be worth anything. But I certainly will do, as I did on a former occasion,, oppose the passing of this sum of &#163;400,000 for the construction of a railway which has not yet been considered by the Senate. </para>

                    <para>. - I am opposed to the action of the other House for three reasons. My first reason is that I disagree with borrowing altogether. A second reason is that I disagree with the construction of a railway in the north until we have started to construct a line from the south. A third reason is that I disagree with the reasons given by the other House for disagreeing with our amendments. The first reason I will not elaborate. Taking my last reason first, the other House urge that they are not in a position to pay for this work out of current revenue. They ought to be. If they want to indulge in the luxury of railway construction in the far north before they have constructed the line from the south, if they have not the revenue available, there is iri this country enough wealth on which to levy to produce the necessary revenue. The arguments adduced by the two previous speakers certainly seem to me to be very sound. The position is that, after fourteen months having been allowed for making a survey of the proposed line, we have not the particulars on which to judge whether the construction of the line is justifiable, or whether the expenditure involved is reasonable. Consequently, we are asked to take a leap in the .dark by this Ministry of sound  finance. This Ministry of &#34; all the talents,&#34; who, above all other things, enlarged upon their determination to put their No. 14 boot down on extravagance, are proposing in the most essential thing for good government - a proper handling of the finances - that we should take a leap in the dark, and in a large, generous way splash about &#163;400,000 of borrowed money to build a railway which might as well be a railway to Mars or to the moon, having regard to all the particulars that are available to vis. I shall be very pleased if any remarks I have made will have the effect of killing the Loan Bill. 1 wish that the whole Bill, lock, stock, and barrel, were dead, never to be revived. I am sorry that some honorable senators on my side are so inconsistent as to vote for a proposal which means squandering <inline font-style="italic">money</inline> quite as much as though it was expended on defence. </para>

                        <para>- I am not going to use soft language to those who happen to be on my own side and throw vitriol on honorable senators opposite. I am strongly of the. opinion that it is a suicidal policy to commence to build this railway from the north. It has been urged that this line will be part and parcel of any system which may be adopted hereafter for linking up the southern States with the far north. But even if that be so - and I, of course, do not attempt to dispute it - I contend that the line will be a positive danger to Australia if we start its construction at the wrong end. I hold that if there is any reason for our military and naVal expenditure, it is the fear that the Northern Territory is open to invasion from coloured races lying to the north of Australia. If it is proposed to build railways to give possible enemies the means of conveyance farther south, that is not my idea of a sane national policy. I consider that the only sane policy is to start construction from Oodnadatta, and to proceed northwards <inline font-style="italic">vid</inline> the Macdonnell Ranges by whatever route may be adopted. Then we can advance our material for the construction of the line from where it is cheap at a much lesser cost than if we have to convey it round the continent and start building from the north southwards, conveying all the material from the most costly direction into the interior. </para>

                        <para>- If the Government had an earnest desire to do both, I would not mind voting for any proposals which meant&#39; doing both, but if that is not their intention, then I should certainly say that every mile of railway constructed in the north will be a positive menace to Australia. It is giving the enemy, if they should ever land in the northern ports,  a  means of conveyance by which they can probably get agricultural and pastoral supplies from the south. If a landing were effected, it would be a very simple and handy thing for them to use the railway in order to get supplies. </para>

                        <para>- Not a &#34;bean.&#34; The fact that the States have already borrowed so much money is a very good, sound reason why the Commonwealth should not launch out on a similar policy. If we are going to spend borrowed money on wild-cat proposals of the kind indicated in this Bill, what does it mean? It means that we are not satisfied with a burden carrying an interest charge of about &#163;2 2s. 6d. per head. The posterity of the fools who started the borrowing policy have to pay now &#163;2 2s. 6d. per head in interest every year. That means a considerable sum from an average family. Yet that has to be paid to meet the interest bill on the debts -of the various States. </para>

In other words, out of the State debts, approximating &#163;300,000,000, 40 per cent, is not reproductive in any sense of the term. Take that which is supposed to be reproductive. Take, for instance, the outlay proposed on telegraph lines and all that sort of thing. The present Postmaster-General, with commendable progressiveness, is proposing to institute wireless stations inland, which will make scrap iron of the wires that are stretched from place to place. Every modern invention tends to put on the scrap heap a lot of the so-called assets which we claim to represent our national debt. </para>

It is a perfectly feasible scheme. I am astonished at those who profess democratic principles - members of my party - sanctioning the fever which is embodied in a borrowing policy. It creates an idle class who live on the interest derived from investments, and the country carries them on its back. Imagine all the profits that we would get out of these public works if constructed out of general revenue, in which there was no burden of debt to be met. &#62; </para>

                        <para>- We would have had quite as big a mileage of railways, and our own property, instead of being pawned to individuals. We talk about our immense assets, but they are not ours when practically every one of them is pawned, to British investors in the main. Of late years, of course, we have borrowed more internally than used to .be done. But, nevertheless, that means that the interest derived from investments is keeping an idle, parasitic class, living on the backs of the people who have to provide the money. Out of this Commonwealth every year, we have to pay in interest, approximately, &#163;10,000,000 on the loans already effected by the States. The party to which I belong claim that it is a false policy to borrow money for military purposes. Now why is it worse to borrow money for military purposes than for any other purposes? Because they say that the assets are not very tangible. They decay under normal conditions, and under extraordinary conditions they are blown to pieces. </para>

                        <para>- My contention is that the Labour party claim that military and naval expenditure is unproductive, and so they set their faces against it. If you borrow money for something else, and pay cash for military purposes, there is no difference if you pay cash for one purpose and borrow money for the other purpose. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> will agree with me, I think, that if you are going to borrow, it is all twaddle to talk about what particular thing you are going to devote the money to. I wish to point out that there is this fact to be borne in mind - that when the last Government proposed to borrow money from the Notes Fund they also proposed not to alienate any Crown lands in the Northern Territory. It is a fair argument that, even if borrowing be permissible when you are going to spend the money on your own lands, it is inadmissible to borrow to improve an asset which you are going to part with. In this case, the great asset is not the railway. It is the land which that railway is to make more productive. If, instead of selling the land in the Northern Territory, we leased it, and obtained a constantly-growing income from the rentals as the Territory was developed, we should have a tangible asset to place against the money borrowed. But this Government has less justification than the late Government had. The late Government were going to keep the asset, and would always have it, against the cost of the railway. But this Government proposes to borrow money, and, at the same time, to scatter the asset. What has been the history of borrowing in this country right through? What has been done with the &#163;60,000,000 to which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> alludes? Has it enriched the people of Australia ? Not at all. It has simply enriched the landholders. Borrowing serves a dual purpose. On the one hand, it relieves the wealthy class from the taxation which they would otherwise have to bear, and it benefits the properties owned by the wealthy class. A borrowing policy is a system of class exploitation, lock, stock, and barrel. It has the effect of saving the wealthy class from taxation, and of building up the value of their properties, and it puts burdens on the poor which they are the least able to bear. Of the &#163;10,000,000 paid away every year as interest on the public debt of the combined six States of Australia, the greater part is paid by the poor and received by the wealthy. It is&#39; not the poor who have very great investments. The wealthy classes are able to live in idleness by lending money, which means that the </para>

Some will say that we should never have had the development which enables this continent to carry a population of between 4,000,000 and 5,000,000 if we had not gone in for this loan expenditure. I say that this continent could well have carried that number of people, even before railWays were known. </para>

                        <para>- I object to this continual bustling. Here is a Government which has had adjournments for weeks at a time. We have been willing to work, .and have had nothing to do. Now wheal there is something to do, instead of giving us a reasonable time to carry out our duties as legislators, and to give ample consideration to every measure, we are asked to bustle Bills through wholesale. Unless I have to submit to physical force in the shape of the &#34; gag,&#34; I decline to curtail my remarks in the slightest degree. My contention is that there is no reason to hustle things through in this unreasonable manner. There are fifteen days before Christmas, and we have seven or eight working days in which to do business if we choose. I am aware that some think that borrowing is a good thing in itself. But I am of opinion that this Government, with what - without wishing to be personally offensive - I may call the stupidity inherent in Toryism, are actually embarking on a system of profligate and reckless expenditure; they are OUt.heroding Herod in the way they are proposing to splash money about. That money is to be borrowed at high rates of interest. If the Government reply that the money is to be taken from the Notes Fund, I ask their supporters to tell me how they propose to go on with the works after that fund is exhausted ? It is not inexhaustible; and are we to understand that when it is exhausted the works upon which the money is to be expended will be closed up? Even if that were not so, we are not justified in aiding the Government to launch out in a borrowing policy of this description. When the Notes Fund is exhausted, the Government will have a good case for coming to Parliament and saying that the money already expended will have been wasted, unless we are prepared to go to the British money lender for more money to complete them. There never was a more barefaced attempt to plunge this country into a vortex of wildcat finance, which must inevitably lead to national bankruptcy, than to attempt to borrow money for such a purpose. I should like to see the Northern Territory developed on other lines. In the first place, we ought to start the railway from this end; and, in the second place, we ought to tax the wealth of this country to obtain the money necessary to construct public works. Ministers talk of handing assets down to posterity. By the time posterity gets possession of them, there is very little doubt that means of communication very much superior to the present railway system will have been invented, and that the railway will have become so  much scrap iron. I have given an instance where it is proposed to link up inland towns by the wireless system, which means, if it becomes general, that the telegraph lines will become so much scrap iron and old wood. Every improvement, every new invention, makes old devices obsolete. Therefore, I say that there is no justification whatever for passing this burden on to posterity. On the general principle, I object to a vast horde of people living on the interests of investments at the expense of the workers and producers of this country. The money derived from our nationally owned lands, if it were wisely expended, and not simply tipped into the ordinary Consolidated Revenue, would give us means at command to construct mile after mile of railways. We have, too, a right to know how this money is to be laid out. Is there any provision in this Bill for the construction of a railway to the Katherine River at minimum rates of pay ?&#39; Do we know whether the money is going to be expended by the employment of cheap contract labour ? It is a well-known fact in the State from which I come that railway contractors have made huge fortunes - enough to represent a competency for the rest of their lives - from the proceeds of one big railway contract. Is this &#163;400,000 going to be expended in providing fortunes for contractors, who will make profits out of sweating wages for the workers. Is there any guarantee that the money will be expended wisely on the work to be undertaken? The tropical country through which the line is to be constructed ought, before public works are undertaken there, to be treated somewhat as the Isthmus of Panama was treated by the American Government during the construction of the Canal. Everything should be done to make the country healthful and sanitary for those working there. The wages paid should be sufficiently high to amply recompense the men for going such vast distances and putting up with such inconveniences and dangers. If we are going to adopt the contract system and allow contractors to make huge fortunes under the system advocated by the present Government, no money will be available to pay adequate wages to the toilers who will be sent to do the actual work of construction. </para>

                <para>SenatorRAE. - Ministers are turning all the time, and we are foolish enough on this side to allow them to twist us around. I have no wish to make any threat, but if it is decided to meet on Monday at 11 a.m., I have no doubt that additional time will be taken up in the discussion of measures which will more than make up for the two hours that would be gained by meeting at that hour. </para>

                    <para>. - With a view to assisting the Government to get on with business, I have refrained from speaking to-day. In return for that, the Government propose not to permit me to go back to my State if I wish to be present when business is resumed on Monday morning. I do not think that in the two hours between 11 o&#39;clock and 1 o&#39;clock on Monday very much progress will be made. The obstinacy displayed by Ministers in refusing a concession of two hours to honorable senators who wish to go to their homes in New South Wales at the week-end will be a justification for treating Ministers as they are treating honorable senators, on this side. I do not think that the Government will expedite their business by holding fast to an arrangement which has been made, and of which I did not express disapproval because I knew nothing about </para>

                        <para>- I am never very anxious to keep the Senate sitting. We are having crowded upon us just now a number of measures of first-rate importance which will require careful attention and deliberate consideration. I do not know how many measures it is proposed to try to rush through in the next few days, but I cannot see how our meeting on Monday afternoon instead of on Monday morning would make the difference between getting away on Wednesday rather than on Thursday. Ministers should recognise the generous treatment which has been meted out to them, but they show no desire to meet honorable senators who have assisted them on many occasions by refraining from speaking. I have refrained from speaking upon measures I should like to have discussed, out of consideration for the Government. I did so only last night. </para>

                        <para>- I say that we are entitled to ask for reasonable concessions in return for concessions to the Government. In view of the delightful climate of Melbourne at this time of the year, it is, perhaps, worth one&#39;s while to remain at the week-end. One might make a delightful trip to Ballarat tomorrow, and come back refreshed on Monday morning in a condition to discuss any matter for a couple of hours. I do not see why. the Government should desire to meet the wishes of some honorable senators, while they refuse the most modest request of others. The Minister of Defence must recognise that honorable senators from New South Wales wish to get back to their State occasionally, that they may keep in touch with public opinion over there. There is a different atmosphere, political and otherwise, in New South Wales at the present moment to that of Melbourne. In dealing with the Loan Bill, the Senate struck out two items of the schedule, one of which covered an amount for the purchase of land at Liverpool. I was anxious to assist the Government to restore that item, because I consider it necessary. The Government must conduct the business as they will, and I suppose that, so far as our party are concerned, they will continue as they have done from the beginning of the session to say, &#34; Yes, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Cook,&#34;</inline> to everything that is put before them. I do not include myself amongst those who would treat the Government in this generous fashion, because I have no desire to do so. I might be allowed to say that Ministers leading small minorities are well advised not to adopt autocratic methods. </para>

                        <para>- It is not, as the honorable senator will discover when the vote takes place. If the division goes against Senators Rae and Gardiner, they ought to remain in this city over Sunday, so as to be ready to get to work on Monday morning. I can understand that there will be a desire on the part of the Government to get certain measures through this Chamber between 11 o&#39;clock and 1 o&#39;clock on Monday, when such doughty opponents of them as Senators Rae and Gardiner may be absent. As I am opposed to those measures, and as I am very anxious that my honorable friends should have an opportunity, not only of speaking, but of voting upon them, I intend to support the amendment in favour of the Senate meeting at half-past 2 o&#39;clock. It is not very nice for one to act in opposition to an arrangement entered into between the Leader of the Opposition and the Government. </para>

                        <para>- I think there has. But public business ought to take precedence even of any arrangement entered into between the Leader of the Opposition and the Government. If some honorable senators think that certain measures are in danger if the Senate meets at 11 o&#39;clock on Monday, they are quite within their rights in endeavouring to get the hour of meeting altered to half-past 2 o&#39;clock. I understand that honorable senators from South Australia cannot return here until Tuesday morning, as there is no train from Adelaide on Sunday. </para>

Nothing Qf the kind. It would have suited me -much better to have had Monday morning free for departmental work, but the motion is the result of an arrangement which was entered into between the parties in the other House, and, after consultation between the Leader of the Opposition in this Chamber and myself. The proposal was submitted believing that we would be meeting the convenience of honorable senators. Therefore, I dissent from the proposition that what we have done Has been done to serve ourselves. It was done to meet the convenience of honorable senators, which means the convenience of the Opposition, seeing that it possesses such a large majority. The idea of closing the session on Wednesday next- </para>

                <para>Sonator GARDINER&#39; (New South Wales) &#91;4.30&#93;.- The Senate has not had much serious work to do during the months that have passed, and on Monday it is more than probable that quite a number of Bills will he placed before us. Although we cannot be allowed two hours on Monday to allow us to visit our homes during the week-end, I think that the Leader of the Government might well say what business he intends to proceed with before luncheon. The Senate ought not to be in any way hurried in its consideration of measures. </para>

                        <para>- I should think not more than one. I wish for the assurance of the Minister that it is not his intention to use his newly-acquired subservient majority - which is so ready to say &#34;Yes, Mr. Cook, and thank you for  your insults &#34; - to rush everything through on Monday morning. &#39; The honorable gentleman will probably find, however, that after a. couple of days&#39; reflection this majority will not follow him quite so easily. He will, perhaps, not have its members in such a crawlsome mood on Monday. </para>
