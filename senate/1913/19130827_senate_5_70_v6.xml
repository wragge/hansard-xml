                        <para>-I want to put a question to the Leader of the Government, and its importance, I am sure, will elicit a ready reply. Is he aware that the mails which left Launceston at 2 o&#39;clock yesterday afternoon have not yet been delivered in Melbourne, and what action do the Government propose to take to provide better mail facilities for the people of Tasmania ? He will  answer  that question, surely. </para>

                <para class="block">I may say that I endeavoured to induce some honorable senators on the Government side to consent to be members of the proposed Select Committee. There were only three honorable senators, exclusive of members of the Government, to whom I could apply. I did not think it was proper to ask any Ministers to act as members of the Committee. I could only induce one of the three private senators on the other side to whom I applied to consent to be nominated as a member of the Committee. Consequently, the Committee proposed is not what I should like it to be. A Select Committee dealing with a matter of this kind should, I consider, be representative of both sides of the Senate. It is no fault of mine that the proposed Committee is not more representative of the Government side than it is. I make this explanation in order that it may be known that supporters of the Government in the Senate were given an opportunity to act on the Committee if they so desired. </para>

                    <para>. - I have no intention of opposing such a very moderate request from the Government. In fact, the amount asked for in the Bill is under &#163;1,000,000. The present Treasurer has always been in the habit of discounting even millions; therefore, I am surprised that the Government did not ask for a little over &#163;1,000,000. I would not have been surprised if a request had been made for two months&#39; supply. I think that that would have been a reasonable request, because of the very large amount which is set down for a Treasurer&#39;s Advance. A quarter of a million for a Treasurer&#39;s Advance in a month&#39;s supply seems rather extraordinary; it alarms me to a considerable extent that such a request should be made. In the days that have gone I heard honorable senators opposite ask why &#39; &#39; this very large amount&#34; was required. Even a smaller amount than &#163;250,000 was deemed extraordinary by them as a Treasurer&#39;s Advance. We used to be asked whether a Treasurer&#39;s Advance was required for the purpose of carrying on some Socialistic enterprises, and I am wondering whether this &#163;250,000 is not being placed at the disposal of the Treasurer for the purpose of carrying on some wild-cat anti-Socialistic scheme in the future. But be that as it may, if the Opposition in the House of Representatives were prepared to give him &#163;250,000 to play with, I do not think that we in the Senate ought to be very much alarmed. Even that item may be passed as fairly formal. Hoping that the Treasurer and the Government generally will be careful with &#34;this very large amount,&#34; and discriminate in what they do with it, I do not oppose the motion. </para>

                    (Victoria} &#91;4.47&#93;.- Earlier in the sitting I questioned the Vice-President of the Executive Council in regard to a statement he made on the last day of sitting, and the Leader of the Government, on his behalf, said it was customary, when a no-confidence motion was before another place, for the representatives of the Government in this Chamber not to answer any questions. Of course, that is an old custom.

                        <para>- I withdraw the word, sir, and say that the statement of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McColl</inline> was a serious and absolutely incorrect one. It was a statement that could not by any stretch of imagination be characterized as a manly one. At the Fitzroy Town Hall, on 31st July last, the honorable senator indulged in skyrockets and fireworks of a fusion kind, and, in order to tickle the ears of his auditors, he made statements without any justification in respect to the party sitting on this side. He said &#39; &#39; they resurrected the dead,&#34; meaning that the Labour party throughout the Commonwealth had been guilty of corrupt practices. </para>

                        <para>- No, the cap does not fit me at all, nor does it fit any man or woman belonging to the Labour organization in any part of Australia. There has not been a tittle of evidence to justify that statement made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McColl.</inline> I said on the last day the Senate sat that in the circumstances he ought to have had the common decency to await the result of the Government inquiry before making the statements as published in the daily newspapers. I feel sure that members of the Cabinet could not have been pleased with his utterances on that occasion. He said, &#34;they were going straight ahead.&#34; The first time he attempted to go ahead he bumped his head against a wall, and it has been hurting him ever since, and will continue to hurt him. He said that we had &#34; resurrected the dead.&#34; One would think from his remarks that the Fusion, or so-called Liberal, party is endowed with every virtue and exempt from every vice, that they are a party incapable of wrong-doing, and that the only persons who did anything wrong at the recent elections were the members of the Labour party. When <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McColl</inline> anticipated that he was not going to be elected, common rumour had it that he went round mouthing to different people that his defeat was the result of organized corruption. He further had a consultation with the Government Statistician. I am extremely anxious, and so is every fair-minded man and woman in this community, to see what the statement of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Knibbs</inline> really was. I have my doubts that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Knibbs</inline> made the statement which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McColl</inline> attributed to him. What was the statement that the latter made ? He said that there were more names on the rolls than there were persons entitled to vote, and that he had the figures from <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Knibbs.</inline> He made <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Knibbs,</inline> the Government Statistician, say that there were 60,000 more people on the rolls of New South Wales than were entitled to vote. </para>

                        <para>- I know that the honorable senator would make many statements which perhaps he would find it very difficult to prove; but let me deal first with the statements of his colleague. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McColl</inline> said there were 60,000 more people on the rolls of New South Wales than were entitled to vote, 60,000 more on the rolls of Victoria than were entitled to vote, 30,000 more on the rolls of Queensland than were entitled to vote, 17,000 more on the rolls of South Australia than were entitled to vote, 11,000 more on the rolls of Western Australia than were entitled to vote, and 7,000 more on the rolls of Tasmania than were entitled to vote. I make bold to say that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Knibbs</inline> never made such statements. I have no doubt that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McColl</inline> consulted <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Knibbs,</inline> and wis supplied with certain figures, and then he read into the statement that this immense army in the different States, totalling many thousands, had either voted twice or personated others. The honorable senator also said that the late Government had opened every door for corrupt practices. I say that the late Government closed every door in respect to corrupt practices at the recent election. I say that in days gone by every door and every avenue were open to that purpose. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable senator can speak afterwards. We know how, in days gone by, elections were contested and won - by the influence of newspaperdom and by the money that was at the disposal of organizations that had not a penny to bless themselves with at any other period. The last election furnishes evidence that mighty influences were exercised on behalf of the party which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> represents here, and if it had not been for the influences of newspaperdom and financial institutions the certainty is that the present Government would not be occupying the Treasury bench. When this matter was brought before the Senate by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Russell</inline> on the last day of sitting, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McColl</inline> made a statement which I feel sure he cannot substantiate. If a man cannot substantiate a serious statement which he has made, he ought to have the manliness to withdraw it and apologize for having made it. This is the statement that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McColl</inline> made - </para>

I feel rather warm upon this matter, and when it was previously under discussion, I informed <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McColl</inline> that if he did not withdraw his statement, and apologize for having made it, he would regret it. I do not intend to allow the matter to rest where it is. The statements made by the Vice-President of the Executive Council are wicked statements. They are the veriest fabrications, and are an insult to every man and woman associated with the Labour movement throughout the Commonwealth. </para>

                    <para>. - I do not desire to unduly delay the passing of this measure, which aims at providing the necessary funds for the payment of our public servants. But I deem this a favorable opportunity to call attention to certain matters of public import, particularly in view of the fact that, during the past few weeks, the members of this Chamber have not been able to express their opinions upon those matters. During the past five weeks Ministers have been travelling through the country, making all sorts of statements, which have been ably backed up by the press in every instance. Since we last met, the Prime Minister stated on one occasion that, so far as any legislative work is concerned, the Government are powerless. But lie also added that they would make up for that deficiency in the administration of their respective Departments, where, as Ministers, they would be untrammelled. I venture to say that the Prime Minister and his colleagues have carried out their intention. A little while ago the Minister of Defence visited Ballarat, where he made a certain statement with his tongue in his cheek. He said that, in view of the fact that a no-confidence motion was impending, he could not discuss controversial politics; but in the same breath - and I wish he were present in his place in this chamber - he reflected somewhat on the composition of the Senate by describing it as undemocratic. The honorable senator has been a member of this Chamber since 1901. At that time there was not a preponderance of Labour members in the Senate. For several years after there was not a preponderance of Labour members here. </para>

                        <para>- Even admitting, for the sake of argument, that it is correct, what was the position in 1901, in 1903, and in 1906 ? Did not a similar position obtain then with a majority of anti-Labour senators, and was the Senate then described as an undemocratic assembly? I would ask <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gould,</inline> notwithstanding the legal acumen and political experience of which he is possessed, to refresh his memory on the subject. I desire now to refer to one or two administrative acts of the present Government. I had occasion, a few weeks ago, to interview the Minister of Defence in regard to the cessation of work at the Naval Base at Cockburn Sound, Fremantle, as the result of a telegram which I had received from the present representative for that constituency, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Burchell.</inline> The Minister met me very courteously, and informed me that, on account of the uncertainty which obtained regarding the exact locality of the base, it had been determined that all the land work then in progress should be finished, but that no further land work would be undertaken until the present survey had been completed. I accepted his statement, and despatched a telegram to that effect to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Burchell,</inline> which telegram, the Minister will doubtless recollect, I read to him. I was assured that the surveyors would be retained until the present survey had been completed, and that work would then be continued in accordance with the plans of that survey. I am very much surprised to find that since then surveyors, as well as other workmen, have been dismissed. In the statement which the Minister made to me in his office in all good faith, I was led to believe that all the surveyors engaged on the present survey would be retained, and that when they had completed that survey to the satisfaction of the Government, other work would be proceeded with. In these circumstances, I am indeed surprised to learn that two surveyors were dismissed last week. I am informed that there are others to follow. I hope that the Minister in his reply, upon the first reading of this Bill, will say whether or not my information is correct. A remarkable feature about this matter is that at the last general elections in Western Australia we were met on almost every platform by statements of the present Treasurer, the ex-representative of Fremantle, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hedges,</inline> and the honorable member for Perth, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Fowler,</inline> to the effect that work at the Naval Base was not being pushed on with fast enough; that the Labour Ministry were dilly-dallying with matters there; that they were not carrying out the recommendations of Admiral Henderson ; and that they were making a &#39; &#39; holy mess &#34; of the entire position. The Ministry were attacked - the ex-Minister of Defence was attacked - by them, and only a few days after the present Government had been installed in office, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Fowler</inline> found it convenient to declare, in a statement which he made to the press, that he would see that the work at the Naval Base w.as now pushed on with more rapidly. How has it been pushed on with more rapidly? By the dismissal of eighty-five men during the period that the present Government have been in office. There is another matter to which I desire to call the attention of the Senate. The present Minister of Defence has his Naval Board - his experts. All previous Ministers of Defence have had theirs, and it is somewhat remarkable that the present Minister should be setting up a different condition of things altogether from that which was recommended by Admiral Henderson. Either his action is a veiled attack on the desire of Australia to establish an Australian Navy- </para>

                        <para>- I still adhere to it. I will accept the honorable senator&#39;s explanation, but I would ask him to read up <inline font-style="italic">Hansard,</inline> and he will there discover his mistake. There is this other phase of the question. The Minister the other day said that it was the desire of the Government to obtain scientific opinion as to whether or not Cockburn Sound was a suitable place for a Naval Base. Since Admiral Henderson was here the Commonwealth Government have been advised by several scientific men. The action of the Government in practically stopping all work at the Naval Base is either an insult to Admiral Henderson or to the experts who have been advising the Department during the past few years. I venture to say that the Government ought to have considered very carefully indeed whether they should persist in the policy laid down in connexion with the Naval Base at Cockburn Sound. Some time last year a number of men engaged at the work there, having some idea that there was to be continuity of employment, removed their homes from distant parts of the State in order to live adjacent to the works. These men now find themselves out of employment, and will again have to remove their homes. The whole business is uncertain. I can see no solid reason for changing the procedure and policy adopted by the predecessors of the present Government. Again, in connexion with the trans-Australian railway, we were faced with a statement from our opponents, during the last election, that we were not pushing on with the work with sufficient rapidity. Since the advent of the new Ministry I find that a number of men have been dismissed from the Kalgoorlie end of the railway, including the engineer, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chinn.</inline> It is a remarkable thing that during the elections we found our opponents saying everything they possibly could to destroy our chance of success in connexion with the administration of that line. They even went so far as to say that some machinery which had been purchased for use at both ends was obsolete. But since the advent of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Kelly</inline> to the Home Affairs Department as Assistant Minister, we learn that the machinery which his colleague, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> Forrest, condemned on the platform has been found to be absolutely perfect. Take the steam shovel at the Port Augusta end of the line. It was condemned as a useless instrument, and it was said that the money expended upon it had been wasted. Such a mistake, it was said, could only have been made by a Labour Ministry. </para>

                    <para>With reference to comments which have been passed on the rate of progress of the Kalgoorlie to Port Augusta railway, it may be pointed out that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deane</inline> was appointed engineer-in-chief for the construction of the Une on December1, 1912, when, of course, a staff had to be organized. In <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deane&#39;s</inline> report (as consulting engineer) of September 20,1911, presented to Parliament at the time of the passing of the Bill to authorize the construction of the line, it was recommended that the proper way to proceed was to spend the first year collecting plant and materials, and, at the same time, doing what work was necessary in the way of formation of dep&#244;ts at each end of the route. After the first 12 months had elapsed, and plant and material had been collected, would be the time to push forward with the real work of construction. Owing to the press of work in railway construction throughout Australia, it was found impracticable to buy suitable rolling stock, new or even second-hand, and, consequently, a staff of draughtsmen had to be established to work out designs of the requisite rolling stock, and early in1912 steps were taken to this end. A suitable senior draughtsman, recommended by the late chief mechanical engineer of the Victorian Railways, was selected, but he subsequently withdrew, because, under the provisions of the Kalgoorlie to Port Augusta Railway Act, there could be no certainty of continuous, not to say permanent, employment. The position was then advertised, and eventually, on May 6, 1912, an appointment was made. </para>

                        <para>- A public officer can come to his office at any time he likes, but the man on the job has to be on duty when the whistle blows, or he will lose his employment. I notice, also, that the Postmaster-General has evicted the kangaroo from the Australian stamp. That is a great reform, surely ! Now, I wish to say a word or two about the high cost of living. During the past few weeks we have read in the press reports of the speeches of honorable members in another branch of the Legislature, in which they have laid the blame for the high cost of living at the door of the Labour party. The Labour party are to blame for everything. This was a big issue at the elections. No one knows better than honorable senators opposite, however, that the Labour party had nothing at all to do with the increased cost of living. They know perfectly well that it was the Labour party which asked for certain powers to be intrusted to this Parliament, in order that we might deal with combinations and monopolies, that are certainly responsible, in a great degree, for the increased cost of living. Honorable senators opposite opposed that policy, and the people of Australia, in their judgment, rejected our proposals for the time being. But since the advent of this Ministry to power we find the cost of living still increasing. </para>

Let me read an extract, not from a Labour newspaper, but from the <inline font-style="italic">Argus</inline> of the 5th July, 1913. It is headed, &#34;Inter-State freights; increase of 15 per cent.&#34; </para>

                <para>Merchants and manufacturers are complaining of a further increase in Inter-State freights by the steam-ship companies. In the past the practice has been to make small advances of 5 per cent, or less, but this latest jump is one of 15 per cent., making a total of 20 per cent, in the last six months. Business men regard the increase with alarm, and state that it will seriously affect the Inter-State trade. Even if it does not lead to the curtailment of imports and exports, it will necessitate higher prices being charged for goods, with a corresponding upward tendency in the cost of living. The present rates compare with those previously charged as follows : - - </para>

                </para>
                <para>The shipping companies state that the advance has been made necessary because many vessels are running practically empty owing to the outbreak of small-pox. The advanced rates apply, not to cargo shipped on vessels trading to the infected city, but to goods consigned to any port in Australia, from Geraldton to Cairns. Commenting  on  the new freights yesterday, a Melbourne merchant said : - &#34; This will mean a large addition to our expenditure, but what are we to do? The companies have the monopoly of the Inter-State trade, and appear to have an  understanding &#39; regarding freights and fares which does away with competition. Therefore we are wholly in their hands. We recognise that during the last few years they have been compelled to pay large increases in wages to their crews, but an increase of 5 per cent, was made to cover that. However, as they have seen fit to charge an additional 20 per cent, for the carriage of goods, we must pay it, and pass the increase on to the public.&#39;* </para>

                        <para>- What I say is that this newspaper, that opposed the referendum proposals, recognises the fact that there is a Shipping Combine in our midst, which, by a stroke of the pen, is able to considerably increase the cost of living. Here we have a Melbourne merchant who refers to an increase in fares and freights of 15 per cent., and says, &#34;What can we do? There is an understanding between the companies which have a monopoly of the Inter-State trade. We must pay it.&#34; If he stopped there it would not be so bad, but he adds, &#34; and pass it on to the public.&#34; The present Commonwealth Government recognise that there is such a combine in existence, and, although they opposed Bills covering proposed amendments of the Constitution and the referendum proposals consequent upon the passing of those Bills, which would have enabled this Parliament to deal effectively with such combines, they still lay the blame at the door of the Labour party for the increased cost of living. I wish now to refer to a question raised by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley</inline> in connexion with alleged double voting at the recent elections. The honorable senator, when speaking a few moments ago, had not at hand a report furnished by the Department, which effectively refutes statements made by the Vice-President of the Executive Council when speaking a few weeks ago in Melbourne. </para>

                        <para>- I have here a return of the elections and referenda on the 31st May, 1913, covering a schedule showing the results of an official inquiry under the regulations, giving the number of electors marked as voting more than once. I find that particulars are given for all the divisions of the State of Victoria, from Balaclava <inline font-style="italic">lo</inline> Yarra. The highest figures of alleged irregular voting are 173 for Ballarat, out of the total of 33,818 votes recorded, and the lowest thirty, at Indi, out of a poll of 29,088. I have not reckoned up the total for the whole State, but it cannot amount to more than 600 apparent irregularities. This is the State in which, according to the Vice-President of the Executive Council, there was organized corruption. The report I have here is submitted by officers appointed by the honorable senator himself, as a member of the present Government, and I was going to say that they absolutely make him swallow the lie he uttered. </para>

Here, again, we have the return from the Electoral Department, giving particulars for the five divisions of Dampier, Fremantle, Kalgoorlie, Perth, and Swan. I find that in Dampier, with a poll of 24,643, there were fifty-eight apparent irregularities; in Fremantle, out of a poll of 20,628, 156 apparent irregularities; Kalgoorlie, with a poll of 22,085, 134 apparent irregularities; Perth, with a poll of 28,963, 116 apparent irregularities; and Swan, with a poll of 27,830, eighty-six apparent irregularities. These figures give a total of 132,149 votes polled at the last election in Western Australia, and show that 556 votes were cast apparently in an irregular way for the whole State. </para>

I cannot help referring to a certain document which was tabled recently by the Government, purporting to be a statement of what they intend to do. During the election campaign the Prime Minister had two planks on his platform. The first was to put Fisher out and the second was to put Cook in. The honorable gentleman has now discovered a third plank, and that is to keep Cook in. </para>

                        <para>- No; but there are three senators sitting at the Ministers&#39; table in this chamber who form part and parcel of the Cook Ministry, and are pledged to carry out the proposals contained in the document to which I have referred, one of which is the abolition of preference to unionists. It is remarkable that whilst the Government say they are going to abolish preference to unionists they are aiding and abetting a party that gives preference to non-unionists. I refer to the Employ&#233;rs Federation of Australia. We know that it is to the Employers Federation and the combines that Ministers owe their position on the Treasury bench. </para>

                        <para>- I intend only to make a passing reference to it. The Government propose to abolish preference to unionists, but there is a body known as the Independent Workers Union in existence in Australia, the secretary of which is Packer. They say that they are against preference to unionists, and they have established labour bureaus throughout the Commonwealth, aided and abetted through their federation by the employers of the Commonwealth. I have read a circular issued under the authority and seal of the Employers Federation, in which it is stated that the Independent Workers Union, through its secretary or secretaries, will procure employment for men or women, but before they start work they must pay an entrance fee to that organization, and pledge themselves to pay 6d. per week, otherwise employment will not be found for them. Is that not preference to non-unionists ? I think it is. When the Government talk of freedom and equality, let me say that whilst the miner, bricklayer, mason, and other artisans in the Commonwealth may approach the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Court under the Conciliation and Arbitration Act, the Government say to the farm labourer, &#34; You are not to have an opportunity to obtain justice.&#34; The farm labourer may starve, or eke out a miserable subsistence on an alleged wage: but if he says, &#34;With my fellows I will combine; we will form ourselves into an organization, seek registration under the Conciliation and Arbitration Act, and approach the Court,&#34; the Government say, &#34;No, you must not do it,&#34; If this is the attitude which the Government propose to adopt, it amounts to a contention that the farm labourer is made of some different kind of flesh and blood from the artisan. If the Government propose to adopt such a system I venture to say that when they submit themselves to the will of the people they will find it necessary to change their opinions in this respect. This is the kind of liberty, equalty, and freedom that Senators Clemons, McColl, and Millen, as Ministers of the Crown, are preaching to-day. In proposing the abolition of preference to unionists, Ministers are up against something very much bigger than they anticipate. The desire of those belonging to the industrial world of Australia today, of all political views, is to settle industrial troubles, not by the cruel weapon of the strike, but by the more pacific method of arbitration. If the Government persist in what they have set out to do, they will invite the workers of Australia to discard the weapon of conciliation and arbitration, and resort again to the weapon of the strike. </para>

I venture to say that if the press gave the same publicity to industrial troubles which have arisen since the advent of the present Government to power, it would be found that, in proportion to the time, there have been many more than occurred while the Labour Government were in office. Making a further passing reference to the precious document to which I have already referred, I find that the Government propose to amend the Maternity Allowance Act. </para>

                        <para>- I should like to know how many Presidents we have in the Senate. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gould</inline> is an ex-President. I say that the Government propose to amend the Maternity Allowance Act by refusing the allowance to some mothers of children born in Australia. Setting aside the document to which I have referred, that I may be quite within the bounds of order, let me say that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Gregory,</inline> the member for Dampier, when asked a few weeks ago whether he was in favour of an amendment of the Act, said &#34; yes.&#34; When he was asked in what direction he would amend the Act, he said he would not be in favour of paying the allowance to the rich mother as well as to the poor mother, and he would seek to amend the Act in that direction. Further, the Prime Minister - and other members of the Ministry - and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Gregory</inline> have said that they object to the poor being taxed to give something to the rich. I am surprised at this sudden solicitude for the poor. I have never heard either of these honorable gentlemen express any anxiety about the poor of Australia being taxed to give retiring pensions to Judges or highly-paid public servants. Still, they object to the poor being taxed in the direction of a maternity allowance. I suppose that the argument which can be adduced for paying pensions to Judges and highly-paid public officers is that they have rendered good services to the State. I admit that probably they have done so; and I, for one, agree that when they retire from their high positions they should get some recognition. But if that is the only reason actuating them in connexion with the maternity allowance, I ask the Ministry : Who renders the greater service to the State - a woman who presents another citizen in the person of a child, or a Judge or highly-paid officer? Naturally,, the mother renders the greater service; and that being so, there should be no distinction drawn. I know that most of the mothers of Australia have availed themselves of the provisions of the Maternity Allowance Act; but I venture to add that, had there been the slightest taint of charity about the Act, many mothers would not have availed themselves of its provisions. They have availed themselves of the maternity allowance because they knew that it was not a charity but a right to which every mother in Australia was entitled. If the Government attempt, as I believe they will attempt, to amend the Act in the direction they have intimated, it will receive strenuous opposition from me. I desire to refer to one or two other matters. The question of immigration, I understand, is engaging the attention of the Ministry, and it is proposed to confer with the State Premiers with the view to make some satisfactory arrangements here and in London. The question of immigration, I venture to submit, is a very important one to Australia; but the present system is not giving satisfactory results. Here we find six States competing in London for immigrants, and practically one decrying the other. Again, we find that the immigration agents of one State are being paid so much for every immigrant whom they can induce to come to our shores. </para>

                        <para>- Yes. Honorable senators will admit, I think, that that state of affairs is not satisfactory to Australia. It is absolutely essential that this vast continent should be populated, and we must seek assistance in that direction from overseas; but I desire to see only the best of our oversea friends brought to our shores. I do not desire to see six States competing with each other in London, nor do I wish to see a price placed on the head of any man or woman. If it is necessary that there should be immigration officers, let them be paid a proper salary; and whether they get one or a hundred people to come to our shores, let that proper salary be paid. I will make a suggestion to the Ministry for what it is worth. I think that, after considering the matter very carefully, the question of immigration should no longer be allowed to remain a State matter. I consider it the duty of the Commonwealth Government to take full charge as regards the selection of immigrants and the disposition of them when they arrive here. </para>

                        <para>- I believe that there are State Premiers who are quite willing to yield a portion of their political rights. But, leaving that issue on one side, the question of immigration is, I think, big and important enough for the Government to take up independently of the States, and they ought to pay the cost of bringing out immigrants. I want to see a judicious scheme of immigration started, so that we may get the best of the Old Country&#39;s population to come and assist us in developing our resources. I desire to see unanimity of thought as regards the States and the Commonwealth, and the best way to secure that result, I think, will be for the Commonwealth to take full charge of the whole of the proceedings. We are asked to vote money in connexion with the Quarantine Department. In regard to the small-pox scare in Sydney, we need something more than vaccination. Victoria, so far, has escaped, for there has been no local case. The rush for vaccination here a few weeks ago was owing to a passenger by the <inline font-style="italic">Karoola</inline> having escaped detection by the quarantine authorities. While this State has been immune, so far, from any local case, I wonder how long it will remain immune under present quarantine conditions. A person from the proclaimed area in Sydney cannot cross the Victorian border unless he produces a successful certificate of vaccination. I am not a lover or an advocate of vaccination. I am an antivac.cinationist, but I will not obtrude my opinion just now. I only want to point out that vaccination without fumigation is absolutely useless. The authorities compel a man or a woman from Sydney to produce at the border a certificate of successful vaccination, and when that demand is complied with, passengers can go on their way rejoicing, but carrying perhaps myriads of microbes in their handbags, or on their clothing, and letting them loose in this State, or other- parts of the Commonwealth. Any one who considers this question seriously will recognise at once that vaccination alone is not sufficient to prevent the spread of small-pox. The baggage of travellers ought to be fumigated. I hope that some of the matters that I have referred to - in particular the naval base, transcontinental railway, and immigration - are of sufficient importance in. the eyes of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Clemons</inline> for him to state the opinion of the Ministry as regards the suggestions I have offered. </para>

                    <para>. - A Supply Bill gives us an opportunity to deal with acts of administration by the Government. We shall have another opportunity of dealing with questions of policy raised in the statement tabled by the Minister of Defence. But there are certain matters of administration which I think should be raised here, especially as it now devolves on members of Parliament to take that course. At one time, the press acted as a kind of watch-dog, but now that they have obtained a Ministry of their own colour, they, of course, refuse to let- the public know of any matters which are likely to be to the detriment of the Government. The first question of administration I intend to raise is the appointment of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Swinburne</inline> to the Inter-State Commission. I have no fault to find with the appointment, itself, but I want to test the appointment by the standard laid down by the Minister of Defence in the last Parliament, and see how it will stand the test. Let us see how, in the session of 1912, he tested some appointments made by the Fisher Government. Dealing with the appointment of a journalist to assist the High Commissioner, he said - </para>

But if we apply to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Swinburne</inline> the test which has been laid down by the Minister of Defence, what do we find? He is a gentleman who took the stump on behalf of the Liberals during the 1911 Referenda campaign. He was an active participant, not only in State, but in Federal, politics, so much so that, when a breach was created recently in the Liberal party in the Victorian Parliament, he was called in to heal it. In other words, he is a politician of the most extreme type. </para>
                <para>According to the standard which has been set up by the Minister of Defence, that sort of thing ought to be a disqualification. According to his dictum, in the first important appointment which the Government have made, effect has been given to the doctrine of spoils to the victors. </para>

But the Minister had in his mind the important disqualification that they were party politicians, or were associated with party organizations. There is another question of administration to .which I desire to refer. I do think that when Ministers, or members of Parliament, have statements to make in a party fight, they should make them on their own authority, and not endeavour to drag in public officials to act as their mouthpieces.

Ministers have repeatedly endeavoured to make political capital out of the results of the last election. The present Treasurer rushed into print, and declared that in Western Australia those results had disclosed a disgraceful condition of affairs. The supporters of the Liberal party made the same statement through Che medium of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hedges</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Fowler.</inline> But since the inquiry into alleged electoral irregularities, they have been compelled to eat their words. Some of them have had the grace to do so, although they have done it very ungracefully. In the Perth <inline font-style="italic">Sunday Times!</inline> of 3rd August, I find the following :&#39; - </para>

                    <para>It was a matter for great satisfaction that double voting, so far as the scrutiny had gone, did not appear to be so rampant as had been alleged, but the investigation had not yet gone very far, and the question of impersonation which was said to be prevalent in connexion with the absent voting system had not yet been touched. </para>

                <para class="block">That was just as inaccurate as&#34; was his former statement. Not only did the investigation deal directly with the personal votes, but it also dealt with the scrutiny of absent votes. When <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Needham</inline> said that the figures revealed by this electoral inquiry failed to bear out the statements of the Vice-President of the Executive Council in this chamber, he was asked whether he could disprove Che statistics quoted by that honorable senator. He might very easily have retorted that the officers of the Department of Home Affairs have already practically disproved them. </para>

                <para class="block">Electoral Officer of the Commonwealth, which reads - </para>
                <para>Tn response to the inquiry of the  Hon.  the Attorney-General as to whether the number of apparent cases of duplication of voting at the recent elections is in excess of the number of errors which officers might make in marking the certified lists of voters owing to misunderstanding or lack of care, I desire to state that it is somewhat difficult to give a definite reply. </para>
                <para>While the average number of apparent duplications is less than three per 1,000 voters, it will be noticed that in one division (Ballarat) the number reaches 175 in a poll of 32,818, and that in another division (Macquarie) the number falls to 11 in a poll of 23,323. </para>
                <para>A review of the Ballarat lists discloses that many names which have been marked twice are followed on the rolls by identical or similar names which have not been marked. There is reasonable ground in cases of this kind for assuming that there have been errors in marking. </para>
                <para>In divisions in which the elections were keenly contested and the polling was exceptionally heavy, it might be expected that more names would be inadvertently marked in error than in the other divisions, but much would, of course, depend upon the care with which individual  officers  performed their duties. </para>
                <para>While a margin of between two and three errors per 1,000 voters would not appear to be excessive, having regard to the number of similar names appearing on the rolls, it could not of course be assumed that, where the average is either above or below, fraud either has or has not entered into the elections. </para>
                <para>In some divisions the whole of the apparent duplications could probably be cleared up without disclosing any fraud. In other cases a prolonged investigation, involving the tracing of the movements on polling-day of the persons concerned, would be necessary before an official pronouncement could be made. </para>
                <para class="block">I have obtained from the Electoral  Office  and from the Census Office the actual number of names on the rolls in the one case, and a rough and approximate estimate of the number of adults who were entitled to be enrolled for the last election in the other. I find that in New South Wales the number of electors on the certified lists at 31st May last was 1,036,187, whereas the adult population was 970,000, an excess of 66,187, or 6$ per cent. In Victoria, the number of electors on the certified lists was 830,391, whereas the population was set down at 768,000, an excess of 62,391, or <inline font-style="italic">1\</inline> per cent. In Queensland, the number of electors on the certified lists was 363,082, and the population was returned at 332,000, an excess of 31,082, or 8f per cent. In South Australia, the electors on the certified lists numbered 244,026, and the population was set down at 236,000, an excess of 8,026, or just under 4.14 per cent. In Western Australia, the number of electors on the certified lists was 179,784, and the population was set down at 169,000, an excess of 10,784, or 6 per cent. In Tasmania, the number of electors on the certified lists comprised 106,746, and the population was returned at 101,000, an excess of 5,746, or 5 per cent. It will thus be seen that the electors on the certified lists at 31st May of the present year totalled 2,760,216, whereas the population was set down at 2,576,000, an excess of 184,286, or 6 and two-thirds per cent. It must be remembered in that connexion that we have the most complete system of enrolment to be found in any portion of the British Empire. </para>

                        <para>- I will tell the honorable senator if he will only wait. Our electoral system imposes on every person qualified to vote the obligation of getting his or her name upon the roll. Electors may become enrolled right up to the time of the issue of the writs. Up to that period they are able to get their names either on the main roll or on the supplemental roll. Now, we have in Australia one of the most migratory populations to be found in any part of the British Empire. If honorable senators will think for a moment of the migration which takes place between the eastern States and Western Australia they will recognise that each week there are one big mail steamer, one large Inter-State coastal steamer, and generally a couple of smaller vessels, engaged in carrying passengers to Western Australia. The mail steamer will probably take 200 passengers there, the InterState vessels will convey some 600 or 700 more, and the mixed cargo steamers an additional 200 or 300. These vessels are generally full, and when we remember that all this migration takes place in regard to one State only we shall get some idea of the extent of the migration to various parts of Australia upon any one day in the year. Then we have to take into account the migration between the electoral divisions within a State </para>

                        <para>- All these persons may get their names on the main roll. They may, before election day is in prospect, remove to another division. Those who have had anything to do with encouraging people to enroll themselves know that they are far more prone to make out a new declaration than they are to sign a transfer form. When they make a new declaration, what happens? If there be time the card which they fill in will find its way to the central office, the comparison will be made, and the name of the elector will be erased from the roll on which it formerly appeared. But in the great rush consequent upon an election - especially within a week or two of the issue of the writs - it follows that in every State, and increasing in proportion to population, there are a large number of persona whose names, by reason of their migration in the way I have indicated, will appear more than once on the electoral rolls. But not on the same roll. They wculd be on one roll in one division and on another roll in another division. </para>

A comparison of State rolls will disclose that the greater the facilities for getting on to the roll and for securing transfers the more duplications there will be in comparison with population. It is because we have a liberal franchise in the Commonwealth and a liberal electoral Act - which rives facilities for persons to get on the rolls - that these duplications occur. </para>

                        <para>- Under the card system you cannot do away with that inflation without doing one of two things. Either you have to close the roll at a sufficient time before the issue of the writ in order that all the cards may be brought into the central office, checked, and duplications removed, whereby you disfranchise thousands of electors throughout the Commonwealth who have removed their residences, or you have to keep them on the rolls, and at the same time keep a vigilant eye that they are not allowed to vote in more than one division. That check is maintained by the absent voting provision of the electoral Act, because every person who votes by means of an absent vote must sign his name, and his signature can be checked by comparison with the card on which he has originally made his claim to vote. What was the object of honorable senators opposite and their party outside in attempting as they did to discredit the late Government by imputing all this dishonesty and corruption to a political party which has done more than any other party to drive out political corruption from the Parliaments of Australia ? Simply to obtain, as they thought, a little political advantage by so doing. Now they are very anxious that the whole thing shall be forgotten. But we do not intend that it shall be, I think that a party that would stoop to that kind of conduct should not be permitted to let the charges which it has so recklessly made be hurriedly forgotten. The people should be reminded that the present Government, before any inquiry whatever was made - simply on the strength of allegations in newspapers - not only rushed in to attack their opponents, but made absolute charges of political dishonesty against them. Now they have had an official inquiry they find that the charges are entirely disproved, and some of them have had the honesty to admit that they were misled. Others, however, have refused to do so. Let us make an analysis of these apparent duplications, numbering 5,760 - that is to say, 3,146 ordinary votes and 2,614 absent votes. Fortunately we are able to let a little bit of light into this matter. I shall take this opportunity to repeat the challenge thrown down by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Needham,</inline> and will give proof that the duplications were not cases of intentional double voting, but, in many cases, were simply blunders made by officials. I have before me the report of one of the scrutineers present at the Fremantle election, representing <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Burchell.</inline> The return of the Electoral Department shows that in the Fremantle division there were 107 ordinary votes, and forty-nine absent votes, as to which there were apparent duplications. This is a very interesting case, or I should not venture to weary the Senate by quoting from this document, which is written by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bolton,</inline> M.L.A., who acted as Mr.&#39; Burchell&#39;s  representative at the scrutiny. He describes, first of all, the system adopted by the electoral officers in conducting the scrutiny. He says - </para>

                    <para>The scrutiny of the rolls just completed reveals the apparent anomaly that certain electors are ticked as having voted more than once under the absent voting regulations. The explanation of this appears to be in the system of checking the absent votes. The scrutiny of the actual declarations ought to prove that no elector received more than one ballot-paper for the House of Representatives&#39; election. There are_ 27 of these cases which the suggested scrutiny of declarations should disprove. The official rolls also disclose that a number (51) of electors  apparently  voted under absent voting regulations, and also recorded  a  personal vote at the polling booth. Of this number 23 are doubtful, and appear to  be  mistakes of the poll clerks, leaving 28  to  be accounted for  or  inquired into further  bv  the Electoral Department. In connexion with what are known  as  personal votes the clerical errors are more pronounced under the heading  of  &#34; Electors who are ticked  off  as having apparently voted more than once  at  the same booth.&#34; These cases account for a great proportion of the whole queries  in  personal voting, and number 53. Most  of  the cases are obvious errors,  as  a reference  to  the names above or below those  so  double ticked will show, and are further accounted for by the presence of two poll clerks  to  one presiding officer  in at  least one polling booth. Of the above number, 15 are accounted for by the first reference and 17 b&#34; the latter, <inline font-style="italic">i.e..</inline> two poll clerks, leaving 21  to  be accounted for or inquired into by the Electoral Department. To show how absurd the contention would  be  that electors voted twice  in  one and the same booth, I would mention that the official rolls disclose that two poll clerks, both employed  in  the same booth, apparently each voted twice  in  the booth where they were engaged. </para>
                    <para>That is a very remarkable state of affairs, is it not? </para>
                    <para>This clearly proves  to  my mind that my contention of carelessness  or  the ease with which clerical errors can be perpetrated  is  thoroughly justified. A number  of  electors are ticked  off  as apparently having voted  at  two different polling booths. These number 53, and  aTe  mostly accounted for  by  a reference to the name above  or  below the elector  so  double ticked. These account for 36 of the above number, leaving 17 not accounted for. The Electoral Department should be able to easily trace these 17 electors, when it will most probably be found that there have been few, if any, irregularities. I desire to quote one instance. The presiding officer at a polling booth is ticked ofl as having voted at the polling booth at which he presided and also at the polling booth in the district in which he resides, some miles distant. To sum up the position, I find that there were few (perhaps not a dozen) really apparently suspicious cases. </para>

                        <para>- That is so; but the honorable senator must remember that the presiding officers are, in nearly all cases, postal officials, who are well known to each other. A person in the Fremantle electorate desiring to vote in the name of one of the presiding officers at a polling booth at which that presiding officer was not present, would have to give the name in which he wished to vote to a postal official to whom the real owner of the name was perfectly well known. Moreover, the practice that is followed is this : Before the election the presiding officers meet together and discuss their plans; so that, as a matter of fact, the presiding officers all know each other.

The Liberal press took up that statement. <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> Forrest trumpeted it throughout the length and breadth of Australia.

I allude to the attempt to drag in the question o&#39;f defence as a party issue and to make political capital out of it - especially with respect to Cockatoo Island Dock. I am not going to read the lengthy statements made by the Minister, or the others made by me in reply to him, except to say this - that I think that any unprejudiced person, reading his statements, can come to no other conclusion than that he tried to induce the public to believe two things. The first was that the Commonwealth, in taking over that dockyard, had made an eminently bad bargain; that we had gone into it with our eyes shut ; that we did not know what the condition of the dockyard machinery was; that we did not know the possibilities of the yard ; and that we purchased it without any knowledge or any expert guidance. </para>

                        <para>- The second thing was, that having taken over this &#34; eminently bad bargain &#34; - the honorable senator used those very words - there had been a period of mismanagement and ineptitude on the part of the responsible Minister, and that it was only in consequence of the Herculean efforts of my honorable friend that the whole business was saved from disaster, and the lives of thousands of employes from the dockyard rescued from destruction. But what do all these charges boil down to after investigation? They boil down to this: That the late Government knew the condition of the plant which they were taking over, that in the valuation upon which the dock was taken over every allowance was made for the value of machinery which was old and obsolete, and that, so far from being a bad bargain, the purchase was a very good one for the Commonwealth, and that we could get more than the value of our money tomorrow if we wished to dispose of the dock. We could get more than the &#163;850,000 which we paid for it, and, in fact, the State would take it back from us for the price which we paid. </para>

                    <para>Something of a mild sensation has been caused by the ultimatum of the Minister for Defence, ordering the closing down of the power plant at Cockatoo Island. </para>
                    <para>Only a few months ago the works were taken over from the N.S.W. State Government for purposes of warship construction. Now the new Minister for Defence pointedly infers, if not directly asserts, their inefficiency, declaring that a bad bargain has been made. </para>
                    <para>After investigation we feel inclined to associate political motives with the Ministerial statement, though not debating the necessity of a thorough inspection of the boilers. </para>
                    <para>Engineer G. A. Julius would appear to have made some serious allegations in his special report on the power plant, and while his judgment must be accorded every respect, it must be also borne in mind that the present decision has been arrived at as a result of a conference of the Minister and the Naval Board. </para>
                    <para>Engineer-Superintendent Cutler pointed out in a daily press interview that the boilers had been inspected at Christmas. There may be some serious necessity for an immediate re-inspection as recommended by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Julius,</inline> but we cannot conceive the necessity of the Minister for Defence exhibiting the spirit of political partisanship as he has done, and condemning the efficiency of the whole institution. </para>
                    <para>It has been perfectly well understood all along that a new power plant was to be installed, and that the present boilers were being used at a safe low pressure in the interim. </para>
                    <para>Superintendent-Engineer Cutler summarized the position well in the following statement : - </para>
                    <para>The works were being closed temporarily to enable the boilers to be tested. This was being done to see which boilers would have to be renewed when the new power plant was installed. </para>

First of all, it was no revelation by the present Minister of Defence that the majority of the power-plant was old and obsolete. That was known, and taken into consideration in valuing the plant when it was taken over. I say that it was known, because, as a matter of fact, two of the boilers were taken out of the <inline font-style="italic">Protector</inline> and the <inline font-style="italic">Countess of Hopetoun,</inline> two vessels that had been sent to the dock-yard to be repaired by order of the Naval Board. It therefore was known to the Naval Board that these boilers were in use at the Cockatoo Island dockyard. They knew also, and the Minister of Defence knows it now, if he has read his papers, that one of the boilers which have been condemned, that taken from the <inline font-style="italic">Protector,</inline> was, prior to its transfer to the dockyard, working by permission of the Naval Board under a pressure of 90 lbs., and that after it was repaired, cleaned, and strengthened, it was at the time of the Minister&#39;s scare statement working at a pressure of only 60 lbs. </para>

                        <para>- Yes. The gentlemen who, I assume, advised the Minister to take this scare action had allowed that boiler to be used at a pressure of 90 lbs. in a ship under their control, and later, after it had been strengthened and repaired, it was working at the time of the scare under a pressure of 60 lbs. only. This is one of the boilers which are specially referred to in the statement made by the Minister. </para>

                        <para>- Nothing of the kind. What I say is that the honorable senator, in his desire to make some political capital out of the matter, magnified it to such an extent that the bulk of the public were led to believe that the whole plant was obsolete and  inefficient,  and the boilers so dangerous that the work of the dockyard had to be stopped and hundreds of men thrown out of work. As a matter of fact, the honorable senator has now in his possession papers which prove that there was no necessity for any stoppage of the work at all, since the boilers which required to be replaced might have been replaced one by one if that had been thought necessary, aud there was at no time any position of actual danger existing. As a matter of fact, boilers of similar type to the worst of the boilers referred to in the Minister&#39;s statement have been working in the Eveleigh workshops under a greater pressure than that under which the worst boiler referred to by the Minister was being worked in the dockyard. </para>

                <para>Minute to the Director-General of Public Works. </para>
                <para>In compliance with the request of the Honorable the Minister for Public Works, that the members of the late Committee of Management of the Government Dockyards should  report  on certain statements which have appeared in the public press in connexion with the establishment at Cockatoo, and the construction of warships there, the Prime Minister is reported to have made the following statement :  - &#34; We find that it is impossible to build the Cruiser <inline font-style="italic">Brisbane,</inline> now in course of construction there, without installing a lot of new machinery. That ought to have been ascertained before the work on it was begun. As it is, the building of that cruiser will be delayed three years, besides which we are faced with an additional expenditure of&#163;350,000. There are also three destroyers to be constructed there. Possibly the works will be able to go on with them, but one cannot help thinking it would have been better to have had these ships built at Home, and to have set about installing the necessary plant for ship construction here, so that by the time those ships had been delivered we would have been in a position to build the rest of our own warships. The Commonwealth was charged . &#163;870.000 for Cockatoo Dock, and finds after the purchase that it has to instal a lot of new machinery. It was bad business.&#34; </para>
                <para class="block">The Committee presume that the&#163;350,000 referred to is set down as the additional cost pf building the three destroyers and the cruiser in Sydney, as compared with the cost of the construction of similar vessels in England, but are at a loss to understand how that sum has been arrived at. From the inception of the proposal to construct our war vessels in Australia it has been recognised that the cost of so doing would be much greater than if the construction were carried out in established yards in Great Britain, in view of the fact that a higher rate of wages is paid in Australia, and also in view of the necessity for obtaining from Europe much of the material to be used in the construction. That this additional expense would be greater in the case of the first vessels constructed in Australia on account of similar work not having been previously undertaken is also self-evident. The whole of the facts bearing on this question were available to the expert advisers of the Commonwealth Government at the time of the contracts for the assembling of the <inline font-style="italic">Warrego,</inline> and the construction of three torpedo destroyers and the cruiser <inline font-style="italic">Brisbane</inline> were placed with the State Government of New South Wales. The advisableness of incurring this additional expenditure as an initial step towards enabling the Commonwealth to construct its own war vessels is a matter of policy intimately connected with the general question of Imperial defence, and the Committee do not consider it within their province to question the wisdom of the decision arrived at by the naval advisers of the Commonwealth Government, who had the advantage of the advice of His Majesty&#39;s Admiralty. </para>
                <para class="block">Let me say that every one of these points was considered by the late Government. We, of course, knew that it would cost more to build ships here, and that new machinery would have to be added to the dockyard plant; but, notwithstanding that, we believed that the balance of advantage would be secured by commencing at the earliest possible date the construction of warships in the Commonwealth. </para>

                    <para>With regard to the suitability of Cockatoo Island as  a naval dockyard  for the construction of the war vessels referred to above, it might appear from the statements attributed to the Prime Minister by the press that at the time the Commonwealth Government entrusted the dockyard with the construction of the war vessels referred to above, and later, when they purchased the establishment for &#163;870,000, the Commonwealth authorities were under the impression that they were entrusting the work to and subsequently purchasing a fully equipped modern warship building establishment, and that payment was arranged for upon that assumption. This is not the case. Admiral Henderson, who reported to the Commonwealth Government upon the establishment of the Australian Navy, personally inspected the dockyard before any warship construction was undertaken there, and the Commonwealth authorities had his report to guide them. Subsequently, during the construction of the <inline font-style="italic">Warrego,</inline> the Commonwealth Naval authorities had officers stationed upon the island, and it was visited from time to time by their senior naval advisers. It was well known to the Commonwealth authorities that the dockyards were equipped for the docking of vessels, as well as the construction of dredge plant, and that modern machinery was required before the construction of warships could be undertaken ; in fact, so recent are some of the improvements iu machinery used in such work that it would have  been impossible to obtain it in years gone  by,  even had  it been required for the purposes for which the dockyards were used in the past. </para>
                    <para>Being fully seized of these facts, and having had experience of the work done by the Yard in  the  construction of the <inline font-style="italic">Warrego,</inline> the Commonwealth placed orders for three destroyer* and the cruiser <inline font-style="italic">Brisbane</inline> with the State Government ; and, at a later date, took over the establishment on a valuation made by outside experts. </para>

                <para class="block">May I say here that these experts were obtained after Captain Clarkson made the report which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> quoted, and in which he said that the dockyard had not a staff for the work. The honorable senator did not tell the public that. After Captain Clarkson wrote that statement, these experts were obtained by the State Government. </para>

                <para>With regard to the action of the late Committee  of  Management when the construction of  the  vessels referred to above at the Dockyards was proposed, the Committee felt bound to express to the  Government  their opinion as to the suitability  of  the establishment for the construction of  warships.  The Committee do not consider it necessary to refer to their report on  the  subject, which was of a confidential nature, beyond stating that whatever information they  had  at  that  time was equally available to the Commonwealth authorities, whose expert advisers  arc  presumably equally competent with themselves to form an opinion. </para>
                <para>On receiving orders to proceed with the construction nf the warships, &#39;he Committee took the necessary steps to remodel the establishment for  its  new purpose, and obtained from one of the leading firms contracting for war vessels with the Admiralty, and with the advice and assistance of the Admiralty, experts to take charge of the various Departments under the SuperintendentEngineer. </para>
                <para>At the time when the Committee were relieved of the control of the establishment on its transfer to the Commonwealth Government, the Yard was being rapidly brought to a state of efficiency for dealing with the carrying out of the contract entrusted by the Commonwealth, and, having due regard to the delays incidental to obtaining the material and machinery required, matters were in satisfactory train for the completion of the work, and arrangements were complete for providing all the requisite modern machinery. For some time prior to the Committee being relieved of the management of the Dockyards in January last, their operations were hampered by considerations arising out of the then impending transfer, since which date the Committee have had no personal connexion with, or knowledge of, the progress of operations at the Yard; but the Committee confidently assert that at the time the negotiations for transfer commenced, they had taken every action necessary to bring the establishment and staff into a state of efficiency to deal with the work, and that they were fully competent to deal with all such matters as the renewal and repair of plant, boilers, &#38;c., required for the execution of the work as and when occasion arose. </para>
                <para>Adverting to the criticism which has been levelled at the power plant, the Managing Committee soon after their creation recognised that this plant was not such as they considered suitable, and steps were taken by them to temporarily improve matters, pending the installation of a new plant on a more suitable site. As it would, however, answer the purpose for some little time, the money and energy at the Committee&#39;s disposal were devoted to the completion and equipment of the work-shops, and it was only at the end of last year that they felt it necessary to have the scheme thoroughly worked out, when plans were prepared and specifications drawn up for an up-to-date power plant. During the Committee&#39;s term of office, they, through their responsible officers, made due provision, by inspection and careful repair where necessary, for the protection and safety of their employ&#233;s. </para>
                <para>Since the Committee were relieved of the management in January last, they understand the Commonwealth authorities have had under consideration the appointment of a new manager at the Dockyards, and, further, that many matters have remained in abeyance pending such appointment. That such a change was contemplated, and yet not made, may have militated against the successful working of the establishment. </para>
                <para>With regard to the price to be paid by the Commonwealth Government for the Dockyards, this was, as already stated, determined by mutual agreement. The Committee would point out that the establishment has a high commercial value, not only on account of its situation, but also in view of the fact that it contains the finest dock in Australia, apart from its value as a Naval construction yard ; and, so far from considering the price to be paid excessive, the Committee consider that this State made a sacrifice, in the interests of the Commonwealth, in agreeing to the transfer under the terms arranged. </para>
                <para>To sum up the situation in the briefest possible terms : The Committee say that the conversion of these Dockyards into a Naval construction establishment, and the immediate initiation of warship building there - instead of waiting for the construction of new yards at another site - was undertaken by the Commonwealth authorities (presumably in consultation with the Admiralty) for the well-considered purpose of making a small beginning in the training of our men at such work at the only place in Australia where such an immediate beginning was possible; and this step, as well as the purchase of the Dockyards by the Commonwealth, was entered into with a full knowledge of the cost to the Commonwealth of taking such a step, and with a full reliance on the benefits thereby to be obtained. </para>
                <para>In conclusion, the Committee desire to state that, subject to a due allowance being made in time for the hiatus which has occurred during the negotiations for the transfer of the Dockyards to the Commonwealth, as well as for the time which has elapsed since the removal from the Committee&#39;s control in last January (from which date no responsibility for delay is taken) the Committee are willing to resume control  at  the establishment, and to deliver the warships ordered. </para>

                <para class="block">The late Government called for applications throughout the world for a general manager. They did not fix a salary, but asked the applicants to fix their own salary, the determination being to get the best man available, and to pay him well. The applications were gone through by a committee appointed in England, and consisting of Admiral Henderson, Captain Haworth Booth, and either the High Commissioner or Captain Collins. A recommendation of a person was made by the committee, and had not the Government been practically under sentence of death, that appointment would have been made. The present Government have been in office for nearly two months. They know that there can be no satisfactory carrying on of work until the question of Cockatoo Island Dock is settled by the appointment of a general manager - by haying somebody in authority to refer to. The honorable senator who sprang this scare upon the public has had for two months the opportunity of making an appointment. He has had the names before him; he has had the authority of the Government, with a majority behind it, of making an appointment, but he has not done so. The responsibility for any delay which has arisen from the non-appointment of a general manager he must accept himself. I invite him to say why he has not appointed that gentleman, because I know that it was most unsatisfactory to have to carry on with an acting manager. I intend no reflection upon the gentleman who was the servant of New South Wales. He had no permanent appointment with the Commonwealth, and, therefore, he could not be expected to take upon himself the responsibility, nor would the Naval Board like to remodel the dockyard, or make any drastic alterations there until a general manager was appointed. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> knows, if he has read the papers, that many things which the Naval Board had advised had to be deferred until a general manager was appointed. If he had wished to expedite that work, one of the methods by which he could have done so was to come to a decision to appoint one of the applicants as a general manager, or to say to the acting manager,&#34; We have decided not to appoint any of these applicants. We will give you authority to act.&#34; </para>

That was the position when I went out of office two months ago, but <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> has not solved that problem yet, and, of course, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie</inline> says, he has found time to make other appointments.

                        <para>- Yes. If the Minister can produce any evidence to the contrary, I shall be obliged if he will bring it forward. Seeing that he has quoted one member of the Naval Board in that connexion, I would like him to say whether the Naval Board have told him that they were in any way hampered by me, as Minister, in obtaining anything they required for the dockyard. I come to another sensation of the honorable senator, and that is his action in practically closing down the works at the Henderson Naval Base, in Cockburn Sound. In order to get at the genesis of this thing, let us see what Admiral Henderson says in his report of 1911. On page 12 he says - </para>

                <para class="block">When Admiral Henderson made this report, he had with him an exceedingly competent staff. He had also all the data relating to the various soundings which had been taken over a period of years, all the information which had been gained about the harbor and its approaches, and about these banks. He had the Admiralty charts of over fifty years ago ; he was able to compare the existing depth of water with that shown on those charts, and with the more modern soundings taken during recent years in the course of the exploratory surveys for the main harbor at Fremantle, which was eventually located in the Swan River, but which it was at one time proposed to establish at Owen&#39;s Anchorage, Woodman&#39;s Point, the spot where <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> Coode recommended that it should be established. In connexion with that inquiry, the then enginer-in-chief, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. O&#39;Connor,</inline> had occasion not merely to refer to the depths shown on the Admiralty charts, but to check them with the depths which now obtained, and which had been brought about by the scouring action of the tides. Admiral Henderson had all that information placed in his hands by the West Australian Government at the request of the Commonwealth Government. I invite attention to the fact that that officer recommended both an interim programme and an ultimate programme.  His  ultimate programme was a fleet base, which should be the centre of the fleet when created.  His  interim programme was a base for the vessels which are to comprise the fleet unit. In recommending that interim programme, as he does in paragraphs 1, 2, 3, and 4. of his report, he took into consideration the fact that there was then being built in Fremantle a dockyard which, at the request of the Federal Government, had been made large enough to accommodate the flagship <inline font-style="italic">Australia.</inline><inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen,</inline> or his advisers, must have lost sight of the fact that that dockyard is a thing of the past. </para>

                        <para>- He contemplated that this year we should have a graving dock at Fremantle. Would he not have submitted a very different report if he had known that we would not have such a dock ? Is it not likely that he would have recommended the construction of a floating dock for Cockburn Sound in order that we might push on with necessary works there? It was because of the failure of the dock at Fremantle that the plans in regard to Cockburn Sound were put ahead of what Admiral Henderson proposed. If the graving dock had been constructed, all that would have been necessary in the interim programme would have been to proceed with the works that ore set out in paragraphs 1, 2, 3, and 4 of Admiral Henderson&#39;s report. But we had to recognise that we were bringing to Australia a battle cruiser which could be accommodated only in one dock in the Commonwealth, so that if she chanced to become crippled in the Indian Ocean she would have been obliged to go all the way round to Sydney to effect repairs. That consideration entirely altered the order in which certain works at Cockburn Sound required to be carried out, and indicated that, in addition to the undertakings recommended by Admiral Henderson in his interim programme, a floating dock would have to be provided. I have looked up what I said regarding these works when speaking upon the <inline font-style="italic">Budget</inline> in this Chamber last year. I find, from <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> of 26th September, 1912, pages 3483 and 3484, that I stated - </para>

As regards the Cockburn and Port Stephens Naval bases, no estimate can be given as to the final expenditure upon them, for the reason that the work now being carried out is merely survey work on which to establish data to enable us to frame our estimates of cost. Therefore these figures do not include any money for Cockburn Sound and Port Stephens Naval bases, except to enable us to provide preliminary data, or for Sydney, for which no final scheme has yet been proposed. It is further estimated that the expenditure indicated by these figures will be spread over four years. </para>

                        <para>- Yes. Wherever the dockyard may be placed a railway will pay tor itself. It is necessary for the undertakings which will follow the survey work. Railway extension, preliminary works and plant, I find, were to cost &#163;12,000. This expenditure included a house for the naval engineer, a house for the general foreman, offices for the staff, sheds, workshops, eze. Upon the removal of the powder magazines, new jetties and new railway sidings, &#163;20,000 was to be expended. The diversion of the roadway was to cost &#163;3,000, and wages for the staff &#163;1,000, making a total of &#163;45,000. In the &#163;100,000 which appeared in the Estimates for 1912-13, provision was made for the purchase of a dredger for Cockburn Sound. The work which has been carried out with the aid of that expenditure has been exactly the work set out in the details which 1 have given. But as that work proceeded, and as the requisite data was acquired, we were able to decide upon the other works which could be undertaken only after the completion of the survey. The Minister of Defence has sufficient information in the Navy Office  to-day  to authorize the Government in submitting a proposition on the next Estimates in favour of starting those works. The reason why I sanctioned the railway proposal was that it was demonstrated to me by the members of the Naval Board that that railway was necessary, not merely to provide access for the men who would be employed on the works, but also to convey the necessary material for the works, which they urged should be proceeded with at once. Now, as to the site for the dockyard. Cockburn Sound is a huge harbor, somewhere about 12 miles from north to south. In that large sheet of water there are three possible sites for a dockyard. One is at Rockingham Bay, on the extreme southerly side of the Sound and the farthest from the main entrance and Fremantle, another is at Case Point, half-way between Rockingham Bay and the northern portion of the Sound, and the third is at Jervoise Bay, Woodman&#39;s Point, which was the site recommended by Admiral Henderson. When Admiral Henderson recommended that site, he had before him information from the Western Australian Government as to the depth of water it contained, and the Minister of Defence must know that there is from 40 to 46 feet available in close proximity to Jervoise Bay. </para>

                        <para>- That information is different from the information which was supplied to me. I come now to the question of how Jervoise Bay came to be finally selected. The Navy Office is a thing of comparatively recent growth. Three years ago there were only one man and a boy employed there. But after the adoption by the late Government of Admiral Henderson&#39;s scheme, steps were taken to constitute .a Naval Board, and that Board was called upon by me, as Minister of Defence, to organize a staff for carrying out their work. As they brought to me their proposals in that connexion, applications were invited for the positions, and from those applications the Naval Board recommended the appointment of the experts who should have charge of the various departments. In every instance in which experts have been appointed they have been appointed on the recommendation of the Naval Board. One of those experts is the Director of Naval Works, whose duty it is, under the third member of the Board, to work out the plans for works when once the policy to be followed has been determined. That policy in the present instance was the establishment of a fleet base at Cockburn Sound. Surveyors were put to work there. They reported, as the result of boring in the sand, that a certain depth of water was available, and from time to time various recommendations were made by the Director of Naval Works to the third member of the Naval Board. Every step taken by the late Government was taken on the recommendation either of a member of the Naval Board or of that Board as a whole. Never at any time during my period of office as Minister of Defence did the Naval Board, either individually or collectively, express to me any want of confidence in the staff as a whole or any individual member of it. Never once did they tell me that they were not satisfied that the authority upon which they were acting was insufficient or inefficient. Therefore, as these gentlemen came forward with their recommendation, I contend that I was justified in assuming that they were satisfied that the experts under them who were supplying them with expert advice were skilled in their particular work. </para>

                        <para>- If the advice given by the same officers to two Ministers conflicts, the honorable senator should ask them why they give advice in one direction one day and in another direction later. When I left office there was not only no justification for stopping operations, but there was absolute justification for putting on some hundreds of men more. There was an absolute necessity for the work being proceeded with. The information in the Navy Office justified me in adopting the recommendation of the Naval Board. That information was not merely placed before me with a bare recommendation. In addition to that, on many occasions I sat as a member of the Naval Board, and had all the plans and reports before me, discussed them with the Board, and heard the discussions amongst the other members before making up my mind as to my adoption of their recommendation. The decision to choose Jervoise Bay as the site of the dockyard in Cockburn Sound was arrived at at a full meeting of the Naval Board, after consideration by them of the reports of the experts regarding the depth of water, the difficulties of the situation, and all the circumstances of the case. </para>

                        <para>- In many cases it will be found that there has been a deepening of the water as a result of  scourings.  Admiralty charts are not always to be relied upon implicitly. For instance, the Admiralty chart for the coast around Port Phillip heads at one time showed that Half Moon Bay, near the Crows Nest, was impossible for ships to enter, and yet one day we found that a Japanese training ship did come in to the very water where the Admiralty chart showed it was impossible for ships to float. I repeat that the reports brought before the Naval Board showed a depth of water of from 46 to 60 feet. </para>

When the Naval Board met, they had this information before them, and were ready to come to a decision upon it. With that data the Naval Board recommended that Jervoise Bay should be selected for the site of the dock. If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> has not seen that recommendation, I should like him to look at it, and to know that his statement that we acted without full knowledge was absolutely incorrect. </para>

The honorable senator has either been misled by misrepresentations of some of his naval advisers, or he has been guilty of misrepresentation himself ; and I should like him, in justice to himself, as well as to myself, to clear this matter up, and to tell us which is the case. I assure him, and I assure the Senate, that what I have said to-day is the absolute truth. </para>

Because <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> must know - I am sure that he does - that the different members of the Naval Board are responsible for the different sections of the naval work, and that a single member of the Board can come and make a recommendation on a particular part of the work of which he is in direct control. On a matter which concerns them all, the Board makes recommendations as a whole. </para>

                        <para>- The planning of the works  would be under the authority of the third naval member of the Board, who is responsible for that section. He has naval works under his control. But in dealing with the dockyard there are more considerations to bear in mind than the works. There is the question of strategy; for instance, as to whether a particular place is the best location for gun fire. Therefore, you have to have the diversified opinions of the whole Board on an issue of that kind. </para>

                        <para>- I presume that he would. As far as I know, he never complained to me that he was kept in the dark; and if he has complained to the Minister that he has been kept in the dark, I should be glad to hear his statement. At any rate, I wish to make it perfectly clear that, up to the time the late Fisher Government left office, there was not a shadow of justification for the discharge of a single man from the Cockburn Sound works. There was absolutely no justification for any delay in carrying out the work. Everything was being carried out in such a way that the work would be continuous. Moreover, nothing was being done there that was superfluous. Everything would fit in with what was being carried out elsewhere. By the time that the works were carried out, we estimated that we should have the floating dock there. The dredging done was done so that ships could come in. Prior to that time the works would be completed, so as to make the place appropriate for a torpedo and submarine depot, for which no dredging at all was required. We must remember that this base was intended, not only for battleships, but also for torpedo boats, submarines, and destroyers. As far as the Minister&#39;s policy goes, there is not a single place on the western coast to be prepared for their reception. </para>

His  naval advisers can tell him, as they told me, that this was their proposal - that they would give the destroyers and submarines at Cockburn Sound all the accommodation that they required, and that they would put the <inline font-style="italic">Australia</inline> and the cruisers inside Fremantle harbor. The railway which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> was twitting me about just now was to run up from Cockburn Sound to the harbor. That was one of the reasons why the railway was to be built. The honorable senator has evidently not had the whole of the details from his naval advisers as I had. </para>

                        <para>- The permanent design contemplates the whole base being at Cockburn Sound. The whole design contemplated a western fleet. But we have not a complete eastern fleet yet. The whole design will not be completed for twenty-two years ahead. The present work was for a base for the present fleet only, and that is what the honorable senator has lost sight of. I charge the Minister that, in making these attacks on the recent Administration, he has been animated by a desire to make party capital out of defence matters. He has been deliberately trying to drag defence into the&#34; party arena.  His  attacks have failed, because they were empty of justification. In the case of Cockatoo Island Dock, his statements have been shown to be inaccurate and misleading.  His  statements in regard to Cockburn Sound are, to my knowledge - unless the information put before me was wrong and misleading, which I refuse to believe - without a shadow of justification. The honorable senator has shown a deliberate desire to make political party capital out of these defence matters, hoping, no doubt, that I had forgotten the circumstances. Whilst he had the files of papers before him, and I had to depend on my memory, he thought that he would be able to score a political advantage over me. This is the first time in the history of Australia when any political party has endeavoured to make political capital out of the defence question. </para>

I may occupy the time left, however, with some matters of less importance. The honorable senator made some reference to the action taken by the Government in connexion with the electoral rolls.

I came down to the Senate, and moved the adjournment to bring forward figures to show that the rolls were inflated. I did so, not once, but on two occasions, and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> came here with a written memorandum from the electoral officers declaring that the rolls were never so clean as they were at that time. Will it be believed that only a little later, on the eve of the general election, I found that there had been introduced into the New South rolls no less than 80,000 names, by the use of dummy cards. </para>

                        <para>- All I can say is that honorable senators opposite are at liberty to write to the Electoral Office, and ask whether or not the statement I make is correct. I can tell honorable senators how I became acquainted with the fact. I know of no reason why there should be any secrecy about it. It has been admitted by the electoral officers themselves. I found, as every other person must have done who went about with his eyes open, that there were names on the rolls which ought hot to be there. I remembered that I was contradicted in the Senate when I said that the rolls were inflated, because it was claimed that that could not occur under the card system, since before the name of any person was placed on the roll, he or she would have to sign a card which would be proof of the existence of the individual claiming to vote. I took the trouble to go round to the Electoral Office in Sydney with a list of some names which I knew ought not to be on the roll. I presented the list, and said, &#34; Will you please find for me the application cards for these names?&#34; The officer addressed said &#34; Certainly.&#34; When he returned he said, &#34; We have taken the first four.&#34; I said, &#34; With what result?&#34; The reply was, ** We could only find a card for one, but the others are dummy cards.&#34; I said, &#34; What do you mean by dummy cards?&#34; and I discovered that where the  officials  found the name of some person on an old roll, and could not find the person himself to sign a card, they obligingly dropped a card into the index, and signed it for him. No less than 80,000 names were inserted in the New South Wales rolls on that system. </para>

                        <para>- It is an official statement. I obtained the information from officials. We were assured, on the authority of the last Government, that under the card system there could be no personation, but I found that the system introduced by the Government had been broken on the authority of the Government who introduced it, and when I learned that 80,000 names had been inserted in the New South Wales rolls by means of dummy cards, I felt I was justified in believing, and in expressing the belief, that the electoral system of the Commonwealth had been tampered with. </para>

                        <para>- Before dinner I made a statement which I take leave to emphasize by repeating it now. I said that information was given to me by the New South Wales Federal electoral office to the effect that dummy cards were used for the purpose of enrolling electors who had never signed application cards; that these cards were put into the box under a system which was established by the late Government as a guarantee of a pure electoral roll. I said that that system was broken by Ministerial authority, and 80,000 names were improperly inserted in the rolls for one State alone. When a system is brought in for the avowed purpose of securing a clean roll, and is afterwards, by direct Ministerial authority, broken to permit of the improper insertion of names upon the rolls, one is justified in assuming that it was introduced of set purpose, and with the object of resorting to irregularities. </para>

                        <para>- I am entitled to be suspicious when I see 80,000 names which ought not to be on the rolls placed there by Ministerial authority, and when I find that followed up by a notice sent out by the Minister in charge of the Department warning the officials that if any person presented himself at a polling booth and claimed to vote in a particular name, he was to be permitted to vote in that name, even though a vote had already been recorded in that name. In the circumstances, putting two and two together, one could only arrive at the conclusion that to secure a clean election was not the highest ambition of the late Government. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley</inline> apparently objects to such a statement, but I wonder what sort of language he would himself have used if the Government on this side were guilty of such a breach of faith with Parliament as is represented by the violation of the card system which I have described. I pass from that to the remarks made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> with respect to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Knibbs&#39;</inline> statistics. The honorable senator sought to discount them by referring to them as rough estimates or rough statistics. Is the honorable senator not aware that they are the statistics which determine the representation from the different States in the House of Representatives, and that the same figures are resorted to to determine how many separate sums of 25s. shall be paid to the State Governments ? </para>

                        <para>- Even if what the honorable senator suggests were the course adopted, it would still be possible to arrive at an idea as to whether the rolls were inflated or not. As people left one State they would be included in another, but they would not pass out of Australia when they merely passed the boundaries between the States. We have no right, therefore, to discount the figures referred to. No one contends that they are absolutely accurate, but they are the official figures adopted for the purposes I have mentioned, and they may be taken as a guide to determine whether the rolls contain an undue percentage of the people. No one who has anything to do with the Electoral Office will venture to deny that these figures may be so used, and that they show that the rolls were inflated, although <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce,</inline> in the last Parliament, made the denial on more than one occasion. It is clear that prior to the elections the rolls were grossly inflated, and they still are in that condition. There is one other matter connected with this question to which I may refer. I have been rather amused by the spurious indignation assumed by honorable senators opposite when referring to comments I have made on this subject. If they have forgotten I certainly have not that only a little time ago they were never tired, in this Chamber and outside of it, of denouncing the people who they said had made an irregular use of the postal vote. They said repeatedly that the sick, the aged and infirm, and women detained in their homes had been guilty of corrupt practices under the postal voting system. </para>

The honorable senator did not require to appeal to a Liberal Attorney-General. He had an Attorney-General representing his own party to appeal to. Why did not the late Attorney-General put the law in motion against these wrong-doers? Nothing of the kind was done, and our friends opposite abolished the postal vote, not because they could prove corruption under it, since they did not prove it, but because they found that it was an instrument which enabled more votes to be cast against them than for them. </para>

By his admission that he takes no exception to the appointment of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Swinburne,</inline> the honorable senator established the difference between the two cases. What he said was that against the appointment of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Swinburne</inline> he had not one word to utter. That is an admission that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Swinburne</inline> is entirely qualified for the appointment. </para>

When he came back, did he act in accordance with that declaration? No. He conferred the appointment on a gentleman who, however estimable he may be, however qualified he may be in other respects, did not come up to the standard which he himself had laid down, but was the defeated Labour candidate on behalf of the party who made the appointment. </para>

                            has been for two years engaged in the inquiry, and I think it would be extremely foolish to withdraw the commission if it were possible, and certainly I have no desire to do so. I am showing that I was justified in saying then, as I do to-day, that
                            <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Fisher</inline>
                            having himself laid down the code by which he ought to have been guided, departed from that code on the principle of conferring some of the advantages of office upon one of his defeated comrades. I pass on to another appointment - that of
                            <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Ryland.</inline>
                            The first thing to which I might take exception is that his application was not received until it was out of order. The position was advertised, and a day was fixed for the receipt of the applications. The application of
                            <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Ryland</inline>
                            did not arrive to time; it turned up a few days afterwards, and he got the appointment. What were his qualifications for the position? First of all, I say that there was a gross irregularity, a gross unfairness to any one who might have been deprived of an opportunity to apply.

                        <para>- Nobody but an extremely prejudiced or narrow-minded individual would say so. I mentioned that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Ryland</inline> was a miner to show that he had not been trained in connexion with land matters. Had he been an applicant for a position in connexion with mines, I should still say that he had spent many years as a miner, and regard that as a qualification. </para>

The first point is that his application arrived late. That, of itself, should have barred him, or fresh applications should have been invited. The next point is that he cannot in any sense be put forward as a gentleman who was qualified t&#39;o deal with the big land problem confronting the Commonwealth in the Northern Territory. </para>

                        <para>- If the present Government were inclined to do that sort of thing, there is an ample justification in a speech I am about to read, because the position was taken up by the last Government that they were entitled to have in office there men who shared their political opinions. If that is so, that would be a justification for the present Government saying, &#34; As you do not share our opinions we also are entitled to have men who do, and, therefore, we are entitled to throw you out and appoint other men.&#34; </para>

As a matter of fact, under the Public Service Act, priority has to be given to those who are already in the Service. I admit that the Northern Territory is not governed by that Act, but the same principle should have operated. However, no other man in Australia would suit the late Government but a gentleman who was a member of the Political Labour League in Sydney, and who was attacking their brethren-in-arms, the New South Wales Labour Government. </para>

I wish now to deal with a much more serious subject - the subject of defence. In doing so, I want to take very strong exception to the statements made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce,</inline> who expressed a desire that the matter of defence should be kept out of the region of party politics, but who, nevertheless, tinged the whole of his address with a political and personal attack upon myself. He finished by making the most definite pronouncement to the effect that I had been guilty of tarnishing the subject with the brush of party politics. The honorable senator nods his head. He has done nothing else but endeavour to make the question of defence a party question. He has always spoken of it in such a way as to differentiate his own party from their political opponents. </para>

It is impossible to find one speech by a Labour candidate upon the subject of defence within a reasonable distance of the recent general elections, in which the claim was not made that our defence policy belonged to that party; that they were its champions, and that their opponents were seeking to undermine it. There has been no greater offender in this respect than <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce.</inline></para>

                        <para>- In regard to that matter, I am afraid that I must vote with my honorable friends opposite. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> protested against making defence a party political question. But what did he do? He immediately commenced to appeal to passion and prejudice, and to the kindly sympathies of a large number of persons, by declaring that I had thrown hundreds  of men out of work. Was that dene with the object of determining the merits of the dispute between us, or of creating a bad impression outside? I am dealing now with his hypocritical attitude. He stated today that I have done certain things in connexion with Cockatoo Island for the purpose of gaining a political advantage. It would be a fair retort if I said that the honorable senator put men on at Cockburn Sound, and rushed the work ahead on the eve of a general election, for purely political reasons. Such a statement would be absolutely on all-fours with the statement which he has made to-day. </para>

                        <para>- If this matter is to be made the subject of party politics, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce,</inline> by reason of the position which he holds in his own party, must accept the major portion of the responsibility. In the remarks which I make to-night, I desire to draw a big distinction between a policy and the method of giving effect to that policy. I have absolutely no word of quarrel with the defence scheme which is to be carried out. The only rivalry between <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> and myself will be in respect of who shall go ahead most rapidly. But where we part company is that I insist that every pound of public money spent upon defence shall be spent with the same economy as is observed in other branches of our Commonwealth Service. It is not in regard to the policy which we are pledged to carry out that we differ, but in the fact that I believe more businesslike methods require to be followed than I was able to trace in the Defence Department upon my accession to office. I believe that the greatest enemy to the defence system of Australia will be extravagance and folly. The people scarcely realize how much our defence scheme is going to cost them. When they do realize it, if they find that their money is being squandered, I venture to say there will be a reaction in the public mind which will inflict a more serious injury on our defence policy than could be inflicted by hundreds of condemnatory speeches from the public platform. It is because I believe that there has been an absence of close economical administration, and a disregard of the taxpayers&#39; interests that I am disposed to quarrel with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce.</inline></para>

All that I have done is to see that there shall be no waste of public money. To avoid waste it is necessary in all  big  undertakings to insure that they shall be carried out in a proper and methodical way. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> laid great stress upon the fact that he acted upon the advice of the Naval Board.

                        <para>- It cannot be held that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> did right in following certain advice and that I did wrong in adopting a similar course. Further, these advisers were not of my selection. If any one is to challenge their appointment it cannot be my honorable friends opposite, because they themselves are responsible for those appointments. Having had some opportunity of judging the capacity of these men, they appointed them, and they made appointments, I presume, which commanded respect. Therefore, in resting my case upon the advice of these gentlemen, I am not resting it upon that of officials  whom I selected. If any question is to be raised regarding the capacity of these officers - and I sincerely hope it will not - it does not lie within the mouths of honorable senators opposite to find fault with them. They appointed them, and I cannot be held to have committed sin in deciding to accept the advice tendered by them, seeing that they were the guides, counsellors, and friends of my political  opponents  for three years. I want to emphasize one remark which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> made. He said that Cockatoo Island was never in a position of danger. I want to know who says bo ?

Certainly, he condemned the closing down of the boilers. </para>

                        <para>- I do not claim to know whether a boiler is a sound one or not. Even if I had known that these boilers were considered unsafe I should not have left my office stool to go over to Sydney to inspect them for myself. All that a man can do in the position that I occupy - all that any honorable senator would have done in the circumstances - was to take the reports which came to hand. Let us see what the reports were in this case. Here, again, I emphasize the fact that I made no appointments. In the first place, before I went to the Department, the late Government - conscious, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> has admitted, that the plant was defective - had appointed an expert to examine it. Before I give the result of his examination may I say this: <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> has told us that the late Government were aware that the plant at Cockatoo Island was not up to date, that things were not quite as they ought to be, and that knowing so much, they took over the dock as a defective concern. Will <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> deny that the recommendation upon which the late Government acted when they decided to take over Cockatoo Island was a recommendation in which these terms were used? I am speaking from memory, but I am correct as to the essence of the statement - that because things at Cockatoo Island were so hopelessly unsatisfactory the only possible remedy was for the Commonwealth Government to take it over if they wanted their ships to be built. That was the recommendation made to the late Government - not that they should take over Cockatoo Island as a going concern, but that they should take it over because things were absolutely breaking down, and there was no possibility of getting their work done unless they did take it over. </para>

                        <para>- There does not appear to have been any such conflict. But the work was not going on to the satisfaction of the Naval Board. Things were in a perfectly hopeless condition. There were reports, which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> has read, which indicated in one place that good material was being spoilt. It was because things had drifted into that condition - a hopeless enough condition, surely - that the recommendation was made that the Federal Government should take over the dock. To-day we have had a letter read here from the gentlemen who were managing the dock, and whose management was so severely condemned when it was taken over; and these gentlemen who have been found guilty now come forward and testify that things were all right. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> has told us more than once that he acted on the recommendation of the Naval Board - a Board which is charged with weighty and serious responsibilities. I do not propose to analyze the particular share of responsibility which attaches to the Minister and the Board. All that I say is that, as far as I have been able to search the papers, the recommendation of the Naval Board was that things at Cockatoo Island were in such a hopeless condition that unless it was taken over the Government could not expect to get their boats built. </para>

                        <para>- There is no statement in the papers about taking over the dock because of Admiral Henderson&#39;s recommendation. The ground of the recommendation is that things were in such a hopeless state. Yet the gentlemen who were responsible for that condition of affairs are now put in the box, and we are asked to accept their evidence as guaranteeing that everything was all right. When I went to the Department I found that there was in course of progress an inspection of the power plant at the Fitzroy Dock. When the report was presented I found in it a clear indication that the power plant was entirely defective. I very much doubt whether <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> knew that the plant was so defective as it was shown to be. I am not saying that as indicating any. want of supervision on his part. It would be foolish to suppose that a Minister can keep his eyes on everything. I am inclined to think that the late Government would not have been inclined to take over the dock on such terms if they had known that the condition of the plant was as serious as it was shown to be. At all events, they would have taken some steps before they continued to work the power plant. In due course the gentleman appointed by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> to make recommendations furnished his report. The whole matter at issue depends on the question whether it was a reasonable and proper thing to do to stop the works until an examination was made of the boilers, or whether the plant should have been continued until they were examined one by one. </para>

                        <para>- Well, I would not take that responsibility. I am not going to take the responsibility of putting them to work again. I recollect, when I was a member of the Parliament of New South Wales, that over and over again I heard honorable members belonging to the party of my opponents getting up and clamouring for boiler inspection. I recollect the terms in which they referred to employers who worked boilers in a dangerous condition. Remembering that, I must say that I am surprised that exception should be taken by honorable senators opposite to the action that I have taken in this matter. The worst that can be said is that I was unduly cautious. </para>

                    <para>Considerable repairs have to be effected every week-end to keep them running for another week. The pressure at which they are working, viz.,100 lbs. per square inch, is altogether too low for economic operation, and the maximum quantity of steam available from the whole of the boilers, pressed to their utmost, is quite insufficient to run the engine plant at its full output; and, in fact, at the present time it is difficult to reach 65 per cent. of this figure. The plant as a whole is in such a condition as may lead to a complete breakdown at any time, and this condition in the past has frequently caused serious interruptions in the dockyard work. </para>

                    <para>The power plant is almost wholly composed of obsolete and worked out units, and practically none of it is worth a moment&#39;s consideration in determining a suitable plant for the future operation of the dockyard. For the above reasons, therefore, I have put the whole of this plant entirely to one side in considering the question of a proper power supply for the island. </para>

Although <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Julius</inline> wa3 only asked to report on the power plant, he explains that it was necessary for him to deal not only with the power driving the machinery, but also with the machinery itself to make his report complete; and what he says about it shows that it is a monstrous misuse of terms to speak of the plant as being in any way efficient. Here is a statement dealing with the cables which transmit the electrical power - </para>

There is a good deal in the report, but as soon as the censure motion is disposed of in another place, I shall lay the document on the table of the Senate. When that report was received, the Naval Board naturally and properly took it into consideration. The first thing that I knew of it was when it came before me with a minute attached to it, written by Captain Clarkson, the member of the Naval Board, whose profession particularly gives him control of the machinery. He said - </para>

                    <para>I am of opinion that the Board, having received this report, can pursue no other course than to immediately order the fires in these boilers to be drawn and the boilers put out of use until a survey can be made by a Board of engineer officers. This will entail the suspension of a number of men for at least a week in the case of a favorable report being received. On the other hand, if the boilers are condemned as unsafe, as the result of this survey, the work of construction must be stopped until other plant can he provided, or other arrangements made. </para>

                        <para>- I am very glad to hear my honorable friend say so. I thought there would be some one on the other side fair enough to admit that in the circumstances there was nothing else that I could do. It certainly appeared to me that I should fail in the discharge of my duty, not as -a Minister, but as a man, if I permitted the condemned boilers to continue in work for five minutes longer than was absolutely necessary. When instructions were given to stop work I was not indifferent to the welfare of the men. The instructions ordering the fires to be withdrawn were sent over at midday on Thursday, and the manager was instructed at the same time to pay the men up to the end of the week. He was told further to find employment for as many of the men as he could in other directions wherever possible. I mention this because the one thing that did trouble me was the possibility of some of the men being idle. I am pleased to think that no great harm could have resulted, because they were paid up to the end of the week. The surveyors who examined the boilers worked on the Sunday ; the following Monday was a public holiday, and the manager then commenced to take the men back to work, and it was only a matter of a few days when, by working double shifts, he was able to put on more men than were employed when I sent the order to withdraw the fires from the boilers. </para>

                        <para>- I do not know what test the honorable senator&#39;s friends in the dockyard may have made, but I say that, no matter what happened before or afterwards, having that minute before me with the recommendation of three of the four members of the Naval Board, the fourth being unavailable because of indisposition, the only thing for me to do was to order the fires to be drawn from those boilers at once. That having been done, immediate steps were taken to constitute a board to examine the boilers. The board appointed consisted of two Engineer Commanders of the Navy, and a third official, who was a ship&#39;s architect or constructor. These gentlemen were immediately despatched to carry out the duty for which they  were appointed. If they condemned boilers which ought not to have been condemned, and, according to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce&#39;s</inline> statement they have done so, I cannot determine the matter. I am not a judge, nor am I responsible. I was prepared to accept their report. They were appointed by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce;</inline> I found them there; they were given this duty to discharge, and submitted their report. They absolutely condemned five of the boilers, and a little light may be thrown upon the matter by their report as to the condition into which these boilers were allowed to get. </para>

                        <para>- When I read from the report the condition in which the boilers were found, perhaps the honorable senator &#39; will find an answer to this question. I cannot help thinking that a careful manager, adopting ordinary precautions, would not allow his machinery to become dirty. Five of the boilers were condemned absolutely, others were permitted to be worked at a reduced pressure, and in the case of others permission was given to work them for a limited time. The Survey Committee made certain statements in their report which were subsequently embodied in a letter sent by the Naval Board to the acting manager of the dockyard. Here are the statements to which I refer, and to which the acting manager was invited to supply an answer. </para>

                        <para>- No reply has so far been received, though the letter was sent some little time ago. 1 have not the date of it here, but I have no doubt that a reply will be received in due course. I mention the matter because the statements made have been so serious that I thought it well to anticipate some of the objections which might be raised. I might have been told that the acting manager of the dockyard should have an opportunity to reply to those statements, and I mention the fact that they have been sent on to him for that purpose. I come now to another matter, and I am very sorry, indeed, to have to refer to any individual in dealing with this question. It seems to be absolutely impossible to pass away from the matter without making some reference to the gentleman who is now acting manager to  the dockyard.  I do so for the reason that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> sought to establish some ground of complaint against me, because nothing has been done either to appoint <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Cutler</inline> permanently to the position of manager of the dockyard or some one else to take his place. It has been suggested that delay has occurred because neither of these courses was adopted. When <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> asks me why I did not appoint <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Cutler</inline> permanently to the position of manager of the dockyard, let me ask him why he practically dismissed that gentleman ? </para>

                        <para>- That brings me to this position : The honorable senator has said that I should have appointed Mr. Cutler as permanent manager, or should have found some one to take his place. It ought to be admitted that if I can show that, in the opinion of my predecessor, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Cutler</inline> was unfitted for the position, and can say, as I do, that no applicant who has yet come forward is, in my judgment, entirely fitted for the position, I have answered the charge about delay.

In order to show the view which <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Cutler</inline> held as to the reason why <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> did not appoint him permanently to the position as manager of the dockyard, I quote from a letter addressed by him on the 29lh January to the honorable senator as Minister of Defence.

                        <para>- The man took that as an intimation that the Naval Board were not satisfied with his services. If they had been, all that they required to do was to ask the State Government to transfer him to the Commonwealth. It was intended that officers employed at the dock should be transferred, as a number of them actually were, and as a number are being transferred at the present time. Mr: Cutler could have been transferred in the same way. If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> had wished to appoint <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Cutler</inline> permanently to the position, he had only to make a formal application to the State Government for the transfer of his services. In the circumstances, I should have taken very great risk indeed if I had permanently appointed to the position a man who in the opinion of those who had considerable experience of him was not qualified for it. In answer to the question why I have not found some one to succeed him, I say that I prefer to wait a few weeks longer, in the hope that we may get a man specially qualified for the position. </para>

                        <para>- They did, but I am not aware that a Committee sitting in London knows exactly what is wanted here. I do not mind explaining the difficulty which is in my mind. The applicant recommended by the London Committee is an engineer employed in the Royal Navy at &#163;600 per year. It appears to me that an officer who can command no higher salary is, perhaps, not possessed of the wide experience which I think we need for this important position. An error made in this appointment, which would have to be continued for some years, might have disastrous consequences later on. It has seemed to me that an officer holding so comparatively unimportant a position at Home cannot possess the wide experience which I think is the essential qualification for a manager of the dockyard. </para>

                        <para>- It is a matter of opinion as to what qualifications are wanted in the manager of a place like a dockyard. I am trying to state the reasons which have animated me. It seemed to me that a gentleman who had held only that position at Home, although recommended by the Committee as possibly the best of the men applying, was still not quite the man we had the right to look for to take over the responsibility of the dockyard itself, seeing that the success he achieved in his management would have a very big and lasting influence on its ultimate operations. Therefore, I have taken a few weeks longer, in the hope of finding some one who will appeal to me as being more suitable for the position. That is the crime of which I am guilty. </para>

I think that for a salary of &#163;1,500 we might have looked for somebody with a little wider experience than he appears to possess. </para>

                        <para>- Seeing that the applicants were at Home,&#39; the only step which could be taken would be a short communication by cable with the High Commissioner. Passing from Cockatoo Island, I come to the question of Cockburn Sound. I want to start with a reference to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce&#39;s</inline> quotation from his own speech on the Estimates, where he said that the money was wanted&#62; and that the intention was to spend it on survey work. He went on to say that they had been constructing a railway, and other works. I want to repeat most emphatically that there is not the slightest intention in my mind to deviate from the policy laid down by Admiral Henderson to create a base for the western fleet in Cockburn Sound. But I am going to insist here, as I will in every step that is taken by the Department, that before the people&#39;s money is spent, ordinary business precautions shall be taken to see that it will be spent in a proper way. In this particular matter,&#39; my charge against <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> is that, in trying to push forward that work, he lost sight of those business considerations which should prevail with every man in his own affairs. In this particular case, Admiral Henderson&#39;s advice is clear enough. He says - </para>

                <para class="block">It cannot be contended that the examination&#39; has been thorough and complete, seeing that it is still going on. If it was complete, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> would make us believe, if he had done all that appeared necessary to justify him in putting up permanent works, there was no need to carry the examination any further ; but when I went there, and now to-day, they are&#34;&#39; still putting down bores to test the soil. Why are they probing into the bowels of the earth to find out what is underneath if they are satisfied that the time has arrived to spend money on permanent improvements? The fact is, as I will show from minutes of the Naval Board, a justification of my statement that before the necessary preliminary work has been completed an effort has been made to push on the other work, which, in my judgment, ought not to have been started until the exploration and the survey had been carried to such a point that we could say, without doubt, that we know the character of the ground on which we are to build. I have already referred to what Admiral Henderson said. It will be noticed that, in reference to the survey, he used the expression, &#34; It should be thoroughly surveyed.&#34; He must have had a very good reason for putting in the word &#34; thoroughly.&#34; He must have known of the financially tragic history of Bermuda ; but he did not know then, as we know now, what has happened at Fremantle. There, as the result of insufficient exploration, they proceeded to erect their works. What happened ? </para>

After they had spent over &#163;250,000, they suddenly found, because they were over a limestone cavern, water rushing up.

                        <para>- Admiral Henderson recommended the establishment of a graving clock there, and he is accepted by the honorable senator as a law-giver in this matter. It will introduce a curious state of affairs if, when it suits a Minister, he will depart from a report; and, if it suits him, also demand that no one else shall depart from it. Are we going to take this as an idly- written document, or as one in which every word as well as every recommendation was considered ? Admiral Henderson did not recommend a floating dock for the fleet, and lie had a reason for not doing so. </para>

                        <para>- I know that an instruction was given to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr.</inline> Fanstone  to carry on with all speed the work of exploration and survey. I am not concerned in what men he puts on or takes off. There is an instruction from the Naval Board to carry on the survey work as fast as he can, and the rest I leave to him. I come now to a statement by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> that these banks which we all recognised have to be pierced - the Success and Parmelia banks - were pierced months ago. He was trying to rather startle me by giving me the information that months ago these banks had been probed, and that it was possible to determine what they were made of. Why, it is year3 since that was done. The honorable senator shakes his head, but I ask him to listen to an extract from a report by <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> Coode in 1887 - </para>

                <para>The borings through the Success and Parmelia banks have shown, as before stated, that they consisted almost entirely of sand. Any channel which might be formed through these shoals would inevitably necessitate frequent dredging for maintenance, and, as I pointed out in my report of 1877, such an approach would be impracticable and dangerous in a gale from the west, when the wind would be directly across the line of channel, and it would be impossible to_ confine vessels to the deep-water track. Notwithstanding the fine sheet of water which exists in Cockburn Sound, the difficulties attendant upon the formation and maintenance of suitable and safe approaches are so great, and would be accompanied with such a large expenditure, both in first cost and maintenance, and there will be no alternative but to consider the utilization of the shelter and deep water there as entirely unattainable. </para>

As a matter of fact, I do not believe that there is any knowledge of that earlier exploration work in the office.

                        <para>- I will come to that presently. I am now dealing with my action in regard to the works in progress at Cockburn Sound. I did not have Cockburn Sound before me when these things came along. Then I naturally asked what was being done there, and, so far as I can understand the position, I came to the conclusion that for the economical carrying on of these works it was essential we should complete the survey before we proceeded with buildings and land works. Accordingly, instructions were given to finish the works upon which the men were then engaged, and afterwards to limit themselves entirely to the work of exploration. </para>

                        <para>- So far as I understand the position, there is no particular branch in the whole of the engineering world upon which more money can be wasted than upon naval works. The world is full of instances of that kind. It does seem to me that, so far, Australia has not had an opportunity of developing men of very wide experience in this branch of work. We are only following in the steps taken by individual States, which, when confronted with similar problems, have sought the aid of experienced men from the Old World. It is not suggested that the gentleman who is to come out here to advise us in this matter is to review the question of a site&#39;. The memorandum which I have read merely says that in the carrying out of these works it is desirable to secure the services of a gentleman of wider experience than is possessed by any officer now available to the Commonwealth. That recommendation was one that appealed to me. I do not know anything upon which the Government might lose more money than upon these naval works. </para>

I do not want honorable senators to think that I have any reason to believe that they are not being carried out properly and efficiently. But the proof of these matters is not to be determined at the time when you are carrying out the works, but afterwards. In my own State we have had deplorable instances of engineering mistakes  in connexion with  our rivers, and we have had to pay for them since. </para>

These are not easy works to carry out. They are not works which you can find many people competent to execute. </para>

                        <para>- I am not arguing as to whether I am right or wrong in  this  particular matter ;  but  it seems to me that there is no man in the Department - certainly not <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Fanstone</inline> - who is entitled to  be  regarded  as  sufficiently experienced in carrying out works of this magnitude. Believing, therefore, that it was the ng ut thing to do, I had no hesitation in asking that a communication should be sent to the High Commissioner, asking him to take steps to obtain applications from engineers of experience. I have endeavoured to make a plain statement with regard to the matters that have been mentioned. I have inadvertently omitted to deal with my point. I shall be glad to have my attention directed to it, in order that I may repair the omission afterwards. I have endeavoured to approach the subjects with which I have dealt, not merely as one who thoroughly and sincerely believes in the defence policy, which we are pledged to carry out, but in the belief that that policy will lose in public estimation unless, in trying to give effect to it, we are careful of the interests of those who have to find the money. While I should be the last in the world to impair the efficiency of either the Naval or the Military Forces by any unnecessary scamping or economy, I still maintain that it is possible to carry out the defence scheme with the same careful regard for the taxpayers&#39; money as we show in regard to any other Department of the Commonwealth. </para>
