                            <para>- The separation allowance is paid only to the wife and family of a soldier. Therefore it obviously is not paid to every soldier. The payment depends on his having a wife and children, so much per day being allowed to the wife and so much for each child. The maximum payment which a private may receive, including the separation allowance, is 10s. per day, </para>

                        <para>That the object of my motion is one of great public and urgent importance has been brought home during the last few weeks to those who have the honour of being members of this Chamber and another place. The extent to which despotism can rule in a freedom-loving country like Australia has also been made apparent. I charge the Prime Minister with being responsible for this state of affairs. He has  created a  position which is unique in the history of the world. I do not think that in any other country, even in Germany or Russia, a newspaper or periodical is prevented from indicating that portion of its articles has been censored. Those who have been looking into this question are fully seised of the length to which the Prime Minister has gone. I need only refer to his actions in connexion with his communications with and addresses to Labour leagues in Australia. He went to Sydney last week and laid before the executive Labour body of New South Wales his proposals in regard to conscription in Australia, but that body, after having heard the whole of his statements, turned down his proposals by a vote of twenty-three to five. It followed action that was taken by the central executive body in Victoria, which, I understand; turned down the proposals unanimously. But nothing was allowed to appear in the press in regard to either of those decisions. The matter was censored. </para>

This telegram did not arrive at its destination. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Grayndler</inline> reached Melbourne to-day, and we are informed that all the communications of the general secretary of the Australian Workers Union in Sydney, and of the Australian Workers Union secretary in Brisbane, are subject to the ban of the censorship. We know that in Melbourne the telephone wires connecting the Exchange with the Trades Hall have been tapped, and that a military lieutenant, assisted by a shorthand typist, has been set to this task. The remarkable thing is that all these precautions are taken against Labour bodies. I have no intention of putting up with them. I am not prepared to accept the assurances of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> or his Government that both sides will obtain a fair deal on the conscription campaign. </para>

                        <para>It cannot be said that that statement has any bearing on the war or upon the defence of the Commonwealth. Yet a portion of it has been excised by the censor. According to the telegram I received from <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Collins,</inline> the reference to <inline font-weight="bold">Sir William</inline> Irvine having done all he could to injure the working classes has been struck out. The telegram also states - &#34; Reference to Hughes struck out ; also portion reference to Ireland, and portion reference Russia, struck out.&#34; Will any sane man in Victoria say that during the great railway strike <inline font-weight="bold">Sir William</inline> Irvine did not injure the working classes? I do not hesitate to say that he did, yet that statement of fact was excised. </para>

He has a son fighting at the front, but because he referred, in the course of his speech, to the situation in Ireland, and made some reference to Russia, the censor exercised the stupid and dangerous powers conferred upon him by the Prime Minister of the Commonwealth to excise these statements. This is an intolerable state of affairs. If the referendum campaign is not conducted on different lines, then I fear very much for the peace and good government of the Commonwealth. If our people cannot get a fair deal in respect to our boasted freedom of the press of Australia, then they are going to take such action as will prevent others from taking action. </para>

His  office is to be on the sixth floor of the Commonwealth Bank, and to have a staff. These men are being lent by their employers until after the plebiscite. I have seen the whole of the secret instructions. They are to be in daily touch with Hughes, and keep him posted by press cuttings and wires. Pro-conscription copy is to be sent to every paper in Australia daily. The larger provincials and dailies are to have special matter. Women&#39;s votes are to be specially appealed to. The campaign speakers are to be boomed in advance of their visits. The more important papers &#34; may be induced to publish the articles.&#34; Pictorial papers are to be well catered for. </para>

                                <para>- Like the honorable senator, I have had a little experience as a country &#34; ink-slinger,&#34; and I believe that pressmen, like all other men, will take advantage of the best opportunities that are offering. The conscription campaign is to be financed out of the Consolidated Revenue, while the anti-conscription campaign, after much cajoling and coercion, extending over a period of about twelve months, is, according to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes,</inline> to be allowed &#39; &#39; freedom of speech.&#34; That freedom will exist, however, only on the surface. We know what has happened when there has been any genuine opportunity to prove the worth of the right honorable gentleman&#39;s assurance. If the position is not altered I, for one, fear the result. We know that cartoons have also been censored. Cartoons that have been passed in New South Wales have been censored in Victoria, and others which appeared in the Brisbane weekly newspapers have not been allowed to appear in the Sydney press. I appreciate the situation in this respect. I do not expect uniformity of action on the part of the respective censors. Uniformity may not be possible where every one is trying to go his own road, but a definite policy should be laid down with the object of securing something approaching uniformity. The Brisbane newspapers have loyally abided by the dictates of the censors, but recently, I believe, some trouble has arisen because instructions are being rained down upon them to such an extent that the&#34; newspaper authorities are coming to the conclusion that it is futile to endeavour to act in accordance with them. Cartoons have been censored that have had no bearing on any phase of the war, but which have simply referred to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes.</inline> They have referred to him as the Prime Minister, and as a public man, who should not resent public criticism. </para>

                                <para>- I think it was an excellent cartoon. The  deputy  censors have said to artists who have waited upon them with cartoons, &#34; It is no good, these cartoons will not be published; they are a personal affront to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes,</inline> and cannot therefore be allowed.&#34;  Colonel McColl,  who, I believe, is the chief censor in Victoria, indorsed the sentiments, of his sub-censors, and when an appeal was made to the Minister for Defence, that honorable senator would not even listen to it or look at the cartoons concerned. He refused to do so, because he knew that they concerned the Prime Minister. He knew what his authority was worth where any matter affecting the Prime Minister was concerned. Another cartoon which was censored was entitled &#34; Fat&#39;s Dummy.&#34; In this <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> was depicted as a ventriloquist&#39;s dummy, manipulated by a typical capitalist. There was no reference in it to the war. Why should such a cartoon be turned down <inline font-style="italic">1</inline> Still another cartoon, entitled &#34; The Traitor,&#34; founded on the picture of the same name in the National Gallery, and which depicted <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> being denounced by honorable members of both Houses of Parliament, was likewise censored. We have reached a state of despotism such as was never before conceived as possible in Australia. As I stated last night, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes,</inline> during the last month or so, has by his suppression of free speech, easily out-iceberged  Irvine. Unless the Government take such action as will show that they recognise the seriousness of the position, I fear that the friendly feeling which has for so many years characterized our inward life will not oe continued. A great discrepancy has occurred between the actions of censors, not only within the same State, bat within the same town. I know of one instance where a remark or part of a speech was excised by the censor when it was presented for publication in the <inline font-style="italic">Daily Standard,</inline> Brisbane, on 4th August. </para>

                                <para>- It is a fact that there is a censorship; and every country which is at war makes a censorship one of its war preparations. Surely we are not children that we should be expected to believe that our enemies are all in enemy countries. We have enemy spies and traitors here who would sell this country and hand it over to the Germans to-morrow if they could. Any country which loses sight of such facts and dangers, is foolish, and stands unarmed before its enemies; and it is, therefore, our duty to see that the press,, and the facilities for passing communications through the country or from the country, should not be made use of for enemy purposes. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ferricks</inline> has spoken to-day as if there were no such thing as war - as if we were at peace. The indignation shown, based on what I know it to be based, would be quite legitimate if we were at peace ; but we cannot lose sight of the fact that we are at war. If the enemy within our gates - hostile to us and the Empire, and to the cause of the Allies - can use our press our post-office, our telegraphic service, and all similar means, for the prosecution of the German cause, we might as well allow the German soldier here, and leave the German spy and the paid agent with full opportunity to advocate the cause of their country. </para>

I know that the honorable senator does not desire to hear too much about this phase of the question, but I must deal with it. It is a phase that honorable senators constantly lose sight of, and they speak as if we had no war and no enemies - as if German money were not being spent in America to poison the minds of the people there against Great Britain, in the same way as she is prepared to spend money here for a similar purpose.  I  know that Germany is prepared to do such work, and that money has been spent, and  is being  spent, here with that object. </para>

                                <para>- My inference  is  that, knowing the enemy will do this, we have to exercise such censorship as  will  prevent it- -that is the inference and no other. This, I say, is  done  by every country that has an enemy and is at war.  I  quite agree that the censorship regulations should have regard to the due liberty of the press and freedom of speech - that the rules should always be governed by the main consideration that they are aimed at the enemy and not at our own people and our own institu:tions. It is obvious that no matter how these rules may be drawn up they have to be administered bv human beings; and there must be from time to time faulty administration. But while, as  I  say, the censorship is aimed at the enemy we must realize that the enemy will use all available channels of communication if he has the opportunity. Further, there is always a number of misguided individuals who are not enemies, but who, many of them, have  a  &#34;bee in their bonnet,&#34; or are fanatics of one kind and another, with particular fads or fancies which bring them within the censorship regulations. Such people, if not regulated, will unconsciously - not with malice aforethought, but in pursuance of their particular fad or fancy - actually play the  game  of the enemy. It is a fact that a nation at war has to rely very largely on public opinion; and the more democratic a nation is, the more reliance there is on that influence. Therefore, an enemy who has to deal with a country on a different political status - it may be democratic, or approaching the autocratic - seeks to disunite the people with a view to harassing their power of offensive, and one method is the influencing of public opinion. If given the opportunity, such an enemy will disseminate facts, fancies, or statements which will have the effect of disrupting public  opinion, and causing dissension and disunion. </para>

                                <para>- We cannot be sure that we have got all the instructions that have been issued to such representatives in Australia, or that we have got all the representatives; but what I have said has been done. One way of interfering with the conduct of the war is to create dissension as to the objects of the war, and the censorship has to be directed to  prevent  that. Let us remember what happened when our Forces were being sent overseas at an earlier period of the conflict. There was a time when these seas were not clear of enemy shins, and the public were keen to know when the transports in which their friends and relatives were would leave our shores. In that case we had to interfere with the freedom of the press. </para>

                                <para>- No, but there was objection to other Government action that was quite as justifiable. Indeed, objection was raised to the action of the Government in regard to the transports, and I have some of the criticism in my office at this moment. There is no doubt that there were many people who objected to the Government preventing the announcement of the time and place of the departure of the transports. But the public did not know what we knew, namely, that German vessels were within striking distance. To the public the Government action looked foolish; that is, it appeared foolish not to allow people to know the date of departure, and to see their friends off to the war. As I say, we knew that the German fleet was then in striking distance of Port Melbourne. </para>

                                <para>- No; but it is not long since a German raider got into the Atlantic, and attacked and sunk a number of merchant ships, though the fact was not known generally until captured vessels began to arrive at New York and elsewhere. Government action, such as I have described, has very often to be taken for the protection of our own people, and it &#39; all means interference with the freedom of the press and with the liberty of the subject, though, of course, in a perfectly justifiable manner. </para>

                                <para>- Conceivably it may. A Government is charged with the responsibility of conducting the war. If some private citizens form the opinion that the war should not be carried on, and they begin a conspiracy to prevent the Government carrying it on, is the Government to sit back and allow those people to use the postal and telegraph services to further their own ends? If so, that is not my conception of government. I believe that a Government in possession of these benches has a right to conduct a war in the way it thinks best for the country. </para>

It seems remarkable that the honorable senator should have had these facts in his possession all this time and not have brought them under my notice. The honorable senator has said that the two resolutions at Adelaide were not published, but in the <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> of 11th September I find a full report of the Adelaide Conference, including both resolutions. </para>

                                <para>- In effect ; but the honorable senator is inaccurate. The publication in the <inline font-style="italic">Argus</inline> was also censored ; it was not a full report of the manifesto. The <inline font-style="italic">Argus</inline> was supplied by somebody belonging to the national executive of the Anti-Conscription Conference with a copy of the manifesto, and it was submitted by the <inline font-style="italic">Argus</inline> to the censor. That official cut out certain portions, and sent it to the Deputy Chief Censor for confirmation. Next morning the <inline font-style="italic">Argus</inline> came out with the portions censored - not the whole manifesto, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ferricks</inline> would have us believe. The  Deputy  Chief Censor brought the manifesto to me to ascertain whether he was right in censoring it, and I told him that he was, and that he had to censor some more. I do not blame the censor, but take the full responsibility myself. That is how it came about that the manifesto was censored to a greater extent than was the <inline font-style="italic">Argus</inline> publication. </para>

                                <para>- They said a lot of things that I shall not advertise by repeating here. Now as to the allegations regarding the holding up of telegrams. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Grayndler</inline> complained to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> that certain telegrams were held up. The Prime Minister communicated the facts to me. There was one allegation that a telegram to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. John</inline> MacNeil, the Secretary to the Australian Workers&#39; Union at Ballarat, was held up. It concerned a number of men working in the Ballarat district. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Grayndler</inline> told the Prime Minister that it was held up by the censor. I made a full investigation into the matter, and found that the censor never saw the telegram in question. It was mislaid in some way in the telegraph office, and the authorities there have not yet been able to discover how it was mislaid. I made full inquiries into the allegation that the telegrams were held up by the censor, and I found that only one telegram was held up in that way. I do not propose to make that telegram public, but I am prepared to tell any member of the Senate what it contains, and I venture to say that when he hears it he will agree that the censor was justified in holding up that telegram until he found out what was meant by it, because as worded it was open to a very dubious construction. </para>

The censorship of that speech was shown to me and I never saw any reference to <inline font-weight="bold">Sir William</inline> Irvine struck out; but there were references to Ireland, England the Government of Great Britain, and Russia struck out and with my approval. </para>

                                <para>- I suppose that the Victorian <inline font-style="italic">School Paper</inline> was believed to be of so harmless a nature that no demand was made for its submission to the censor. I frankly admit that there will be differences in the administration of the censorship, because we have six censors one in each State, with a staff for each. They have the same set of rules, but these may, in the circumstances, be given a different interpretation. There have been shoals of instructions issued, withdrawn or amended, from time to time as the nature of the war has changed. For instance, what it was absolutely essential should be censored when we had German ships on our coast would not be in the same category now. Any one who is prepared to consider the question dispassionately, will admit that, a few months ago the war, so far as Australia is concerned, became more tinged with political colour than it had previously been since its commencement. As the censorship must change to meet the varying circumstances of the war, it has naturally become more important to have regard to political statements and conditions during the past few months than at any other period during the war. I know that this has caused much of the dissatisfaction and criticism which has found expression from time to time. I want to tell honorable senators now exactly what is the present position as regards censorship. These are practically the. whole of the instructions now in existence with regard to the censorship - </para>

                        <para>Referring now to paragraph c, what it means is that persons are not allowed to do through the press what they are not allowed to do in any other way. What I mean is that the War Precautions Act, for instance, forbids trading with the enemy, and paragraph c means that a person is not allowed through the press to advertise enemy goods or to assist in trading with the enemy. The War Precautions Act forbids certain things which have no connexion with the Military Service Referendum Bill, or the proposed referendum, but are connected with dealings with the enemy. If paragraphs <inline font-style="italic">a</inline> and <inline font-style="italic">b</inline> stood by themselves, the censor would not have the power to prevent what he now has the power to prevent, namely, the use of the press to defeat the provisions of the War Precautions Act. On the subject of the Military Service Referendum Bill, and the referendum campaign, there are only two instructions operative, and these are contained in paragraphs <inline font-style="italic">a</inline> and <inline font-style="italic">b.</inline> Paragraph c has no reference to the referendum campaign, but refers generally to dealing with the war, and its limitations have existed throughout with little or no objection. In paragraph 6, there is a reference to a &#34;strike,&#34; but what is meant is not a strike for industrial purposes, but a strike for the purpose of dealing with the referendum campaign. Paragraphs <inline font-style="italic">a</inline> and <inline font-style="italic">b</inline> are the rules applying to the campaign, and under them the censor is forbidden to allow the publication of incitements to strike for the purpose of defeating the operation of the Military Service Referendum Bill, and the object of the Government, which would, in any case, be illegal as a breach of the Arbitration law. These are the instructions now sent throughout Australia, and upon which the Government propose to stand during the referendum campaign. I venture to say that any one who desires to fight the question honestly without interference and with full freedom will be able to do so under these instructions. Why should it be necessary, in order to fight out this question, to insult or offend any of our Allies, or to incite or suggest a breach of the law? Apart from these limitations, there will be freedom in the conduct of the campaign. No reasonable man would ask for more. No member of the Senate would suggest that the Allies, who are fighting with us to maintain our freedom as well as their own, should, by those advocating or opposing conscription, be subjected to offensive or insulting references. There is surely sufficient for argument in the merits of compulsory service or its demerits without recourse to that kind of thing. </para>

He said that a resolution had been carried at the Adelaide Conference by means of a trick by the Premier of South Australia. I do not think that statement should go unchallenged. As a duly accredited delegate to the Conference, the Premier of South Australia had as much right to move any resolution he pleased as had any other member of the Conference. If there is one gentleman in this country who ought to leave the Adelaide Conference alone, he is <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ferricks.</inline></para>

These reports had to be submitted, I presume, to the censor in the same way as other matter supplied for publication, and the publication consequently took some little time. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ferricks</inline> does not know whether <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> authorized the publication or not. I may say that I have every sympathy with the action that the honorable senator has taken this afternoon. I agree that the matter he has mentioned should not have been censored as it was, and I find no fault with the honorable senator for bringing the grievance before the Senate. I have here the report of the Conference in the <inline font-style="italic">Daily Herald,</inline> Adelaide, dated Monday, 11th September, 1916. It begins with this resolution - </para>

                                <para>- The resolution about which the honorable senator is complaining is the one having reference to the taking of a referendum on the conscription of human life, and the honorable senator has not strengthened his case by any means. No man in this Senate desires censorship to be exercised over anything that is not injurious to the wellbeing of Australia, and, on the other hand, no loyal subject of this country would desire the publication of anything that might be of benefit to our enemies at the present time. My sympathy is with the honorable senator concerning the telegrams which he has read, but the Minister has promised that that matter will be looked into. Surely, in view of this fact, there is no need to make statements that are not strictly in accordance with the facts of the case. </para>

                            <para>. - I .have no desire to contribute lengthily to this debate, but I want to bring under the notice of the Minister for Defence an instance in which the censor erred in the opposite direction. Some time ago the Fremantle Trades Hall Association had a notice of motion on its agenda-paper calling a general strike in the event of conscription being put into operation. That notice of motion was published widely, in spite of the censor, and in course of time the Association discussed the motion, which was defeated by thirty-five votes to five; but, strange to say, no notice was then taken of it, although representatives of the press were present. My feeling is that if we brought down the archangels from Heaven to preside over the censorship to-day, they would not please everybody. I am only sorry that there has not been a closer censorship over events that have happened within our party, because very accurate reports have appeared concerning the secret Labour Caucus. God help the secrecy of the Caucus if that is what happens. </para>

                                <para>- I am very glad of the opportunity to refer to that matter. The Yarra-bank is one of those places where there is no censorship at all. I went down to that classic resort recently, and was present at a meeting of about 7&#62;000 people, presided over by <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Maloney.</inline> Having heard so much about freedom of speech, I asked him if I might say a word on the other side. In my innocence, and accustomed as I have been to public meetings throughout the country for the last thirty years, I thought that I would, at least, be vouchsafed the opportunity to say something. When I asked <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Maloney,</inline> he said, &#34; Come up here, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch,&#34;</inline> so I pressed my way through the crowd, some advocates of free speech meanwhile hooting me and advising me to go to Germany. But when I got near the platform, and asked <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Maloney</inline> if I might say something on the other side, he said, &#34;No, brother.&#34; For the first time in my Australian experience I was refused the opportunity of speaking at a public meeting. </para>

It appears, however, that some special attention is being paid to the Labour press in this country. This was evidenced by the raid lately upon the Trades Hall in this city, at the instance of the military censor. </para>

                                <para>- Yes, it is a good thing for every working man and woman in Australia that we have such institutions as Trades Halls in our several centres of population. I turn to those institutions when I want light and leading to guide me. Recently a conference was held at the Melbourne Trades Hall; all the States of the Commonwealth but one were represented. Matters of considerable importance were discussed at that conference, and certain decisions were arrived at. In the furtherance of the business that had been transacted, it was decided in the interests of the anti-conscription campaign, and on behalf of the industrialists of Australia, to issue  a  manifesto. It would appear, however, that a mistake was made by the drafters of the manifesto, because it was not submitted to the censor for approval. Evidently the Minister for Defence was made aware of this, but instead of exercising <inline font-style="italic">common</inline> sense, and giving some fair play, which might be expected from a Labour Minister, what was done? At the Trades Hall the officials are engaged, during the whole day, in the various offices, administering the affairs of the different organizations, and there is telephonic communication, as well as a frequent tramway service, between the military barracks and the Trades Hall. </para>

                                <para>- As I said, there is an easy means of communication between the military barracks and the Trades Hall, but the military authorities instead of doing their work in the daylight, came down to the private residence of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Holloway,</inline> secretary of this organization, when he had retired, and informed him that they wanted the manifestos that were to be distributed throughout the States of the Commonwealth. He was indisposed to let them have them, but they warned him that if he did not, they would break into the Trades Hall. In order that they should not destroy property at the Trades Hall, he accompanied them to that building and gave them possession of the pamphlets. Then they journeyed to the office of the <inline font-style="italic">Labour Call,</inline> where they secured possession of documents, and took away the forme containing the type from which  the circulars were printed. And notwithstanding the statement by the Minister of Defence, I affirm that the pith or that manifesto was published in the <inline font-style="italic">Argus</inline> When that fact was brought under the notice of the honorable gentleman, he at once became a super-censor, and above him to-day there appears to be yet another censor, in the person of the Prime Minister. j.his censorship in respect of anti-conscription is irritating to men who have helped as far as they possibly could &#34;to build up the movement with which we are associated. How, in the name of goodness, are we to put our case against the Government if such rigid censorship is to be exercised ? The censorship does not apply only to the Labour press, because I recently brought under the attention of the Minister complaints by the provincial ,press of Victoria as to the way in which their news matter was being censored. A very glaring case was submitted to him more than a week ago, a case in which a newspaper which is not run in the interests of Labour made very serious complaints because of the paradoxical way in which it was treated as compared with the treatment accorded to city journals. </para>

                        <para>Ordinarily the press is the guardian of the public interest. If a wrong is being done, it is to the press that the discoverer of the wrong takes his knowledge. Or he tells his tale upon a platform to half-a-dozen people, perhaps, and the press tells it to half-a-dozen millions. The public does not know now the things it i.? not permitted to know. That is to say, newspapers are not permitted to tell what things arc censored, and there can be no protest against it. The public must not be informed that a wrong is proceeding. This is a power too vast to hand over to party politicians. It is a power which at least should be subservient to the High Court; and no regulation or instruction should have any force until it had the approval of a Judge of the Court. No work of equal importance confronts the distinguished Bench, lt is not judicial work, perhaps, in the ordinary way; but it is work of exactly the same character as that which the High Court wag created to perform. </para>
                        <para class="block">If the censorship were vested in the Justices of the High Court, the people of Australia would be safer than they are, and newspaper proprietors would secure a much fairer deal. Before resuming my seat I wish to say, with all the sincerity of my soul, that I do deplore the attitude taken up by the Minister for Defence and the Prime Minister, who, whenever anybody makes out a case against the censorship, or against anything pertaining to their administration of Departments, emphasize the fact - as if we were not aware of it - that we are at war, and go out of their way by innuendo to charge certain sections of the community with being subject to German influence and in the receipt of German pay. Such innuendoes are damnable and despicable, and if the Minister for Defence, or William Morris Hughes, charges me or anybody with whom I am associated with such heinous offences, I shall certainly do something to make them sit up. They themselves hold an honest opinion, and surely in this Australia of ours there is room enough for us all to have an honest difference of opinion without having recourse to such outrageous statements. The Minister for Defence and the Prime Minister have outraged a big section of the community by these innuendoes. I hope that they will discontinue making them from this time onwards. </para>

                            <para>. - I would not have risen but for the circumstance that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ferricks,</inline> who wishes to reply to some of the statements which have been made during the course of this debate, has been suddenly called out of the chamber. To myself and to a number of honorable senators the allegations which he made were positively alarming. The most grave of them, I regret to say, was not touched by the Minister for Defence. I confess that I was surprised at this, because I suppose that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ferricks</inline> has some reason for making the statements which he did, especially those in regard to cartoons. One allegation was that a cartoon had been published which represented the Prime Minister in a certain position, and that that gentleman immediately wanted to know why the censor had allowed it to pass. Evidently, if it had been submitted to the Prime Minister himself, it would not have been published. That is the only inference one can draw from the statement made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ferricks.</inline> If we are going to have a censorship to that extent in Australia the forthcoming campaign will not be conducted in the ordinary way. </para>

                                <para>- I think so. At the same time, I do not think that there is any reason to have a censorship of cartoons which relate to political movements in Australia. If any cartoon is calculated to give assistance to the enemy I can quite understand it being censored. But whether the matter is within the knowledge of the Minister for Defence or not, no answer has been made by him to the charges which were so ably dealt with by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ferricks.</inline></para>

                            <para>. - Honorable senators have thoroughly accepted and indorsed the statements made by the Minister for Defence as to the course of conduct which must be followed in regard to the censorship by a country which is at war. He laid down general principles, to which everybody will assent. But I cannot help thinking that he entirely overlooked two important matters which arise out of this discussion. In the first place, I would point out that there is a vast difference between a military and a political censorship; and, in the second, that the Government have already decided in regard to a most important matter of public policy, that it shall be removed from the parliamentary arena and transferred to the people. Both of these matters have a distinct bearing on the motion submitted by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ferricks.</inline> I am quite convinced that whatever instructions have been issued by the Ministry, the censors have lately been following them to an extent which is little short of criminal, and is certainly very foolish. So great has become the restiveness of the public under the censorship as they know it to exist, that quite recently the Labour party in my own State held a meeting and practically presented an ultimatum to the Government that those who favoured this course were prepared to throw themselves heartily into the campaign in favour of conscription, provided the censorship was modified. That statement appeared in the press, otherwise I should not have known of it. There is evidence, in the minds of those who are not politically opposed to the Minister on the conscription issue, that the censorship has been carried to undue and unnecessary lengths. As one who heartily supports the Government proposal covered by the referendum, I would point out that if the censorship is exercised as it has been of late, it will be the most powerful weapon that we could have to fight, and will play right into the hands of our opponents. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ferricks</inline> made certain statements about alleged cases of censorship, no doubt in good faith, but presented no evidence to substantiate his assertions in any one case. He affirmed that certain telegrams which he read out had been censored There is no evidence that the censor ever saw them. If they were censored, he should remember that, when a censor finds that suspicious telegrams come to or go from an individual, he may be pardoned for exercising a little extra severity with other messages passing to or from the same quarter. In this case, the Minister affirmed that he himself approved of the censoring of one telegram passing to or from <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Grayndler.</inline></para>

                                <para>- Anything deliberately intended to injure the interests of this country is traitorous. The Minister, in reading the letter, of instructions,, mentioned the direction to the censors  to  prevent the publication of anything which would incite to a breach of a Federal law. I hope he will make it apply also to anything calculated to lead to  a  breach of a proposal which may become  a  Federal law. I refer to statements which amount to an incitement to people, if the Government policy should become law,  to  refuse to obey it. Honorable senators have talked about the censors suppressing matter that ought to be allowed to be published, but those officials are open  to  condemnation for not suppressing statements of that kind, because I know  nothing  more likely to incite a spirit approaching rebellion than that responsible people should publicly declare that,  if  Parliament passes a law, and a majority of the people, approve .of it, they, . with thousands of others, will resist it. The censors might reasonably ask if that  is  not a direct incentive to a prospective -breach of a proposed Federal law, leading to public turmoil, and, possibly, culminating in revolution. When speaking about what the censors have suppressed, honorable senators should consider what they are passing. I take a serious view  of the position, because there are evidences that it will not take very much to create a very excited state of public opinion. There is, therefore, an obligation on every one to choose his words with great deliberation, considering not what effect they have upon his own mind, but the effect they may have upon minds less disciplined. . If revolutionary utterances of this nature are to be made in the coming campaign, the obligation rests upon the censors, and those controlling them, to see that they are not circulated by means of the press throughout the length and breadth of Australia. </para>

                            <para>. - <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen&#39;s</inline> remarks confirm in a measure the statement of the Minister for Defence that those responsible for the censorship are carrying out their duties impartially.- <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ferricks</inline> called attention to what he believed to be tyranny on the part of the censors, and used some very strong language in so doing, and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> has castigated them in language not quite so strong. These facts confirm the Minister&#39;s view that the censors are doing the best they can, for it is evident that they are pleasing neither side. Some men have been prone to throw the whole responsibility for the censorship upon the Prime Minister.  His  burden is quite heavy enough as it is, although he may be quite willing to carry any additional burden that may properly be placed on him. We know that the Minister for Defence has never sought to escape the responsibility for the conduct and control of the censorship system in this country. That .matter is entirely in his hands. It should, therefore, be remembered, in justice to the Prime Minister, that we have in this chamber a Minister directly responsible to Parliament for any grievances honorable senators may have against the censorship. I have a little grievance also. I have in my hand an article against conscription, presenting the case from the Australian point of view, and written by Randolph Bedford, one of Australia&#39;s best known and ablest journalists. It contains some very fine arguments and some unanswerable facts, but for reasons best known to themselves the censors have not allowed it to be published. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ferricks</inline> made some very serious statements. They have been in a measure answered by the Minister, but the matter can in no circumstances be allowed to remain where it is. </para>

He should invite the Minister to make the fullest and most complete investigation to ascertain if telegrams of the . character he read out this afternoon have been Stopped. If they have been the Minister will be doing only what the Senate expects of him if he deals in the most drastic manner with the person responsible for their suppression. </para>

The honorable senator may rest assured that if his statements are found correct I shall go as far as he can possibly desire me to go in seeing that the existing censorship conditions are modified during the coming campaign. I have sufficient confidence in <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> to believe that he will take drastic action against those found responsible for the suppression of the telegrams quoted. If the facts are as alleged, nothing short of drastic action will satisfy the great majority of honorable senators. </para>

He raised a volunteer army, and he was the cause of that insurrection which took place in Ireland. Talk about British justice. We afterwards saw that man put into a position of power, and he became a member of the British  Government. Whether the working classes were right or wrong in raising that insurrection against the powers that be, there was no reason to shoot men like Connolly and others. </para>

The foreign service . and the diplomatic service of Great Britain had the right alone to make treaties. Before any man could get into that service he had to have a  private income of not less than &#163;400  a  year and blue blood in his veins. It did not matter if the blood was illegitimate or not, and very often it was. Those blue-blooded men were sent to alien countries to represent the British Empire, where they soon got out of touch with the people of their own country; but that was what the people &#39;had to put up with, and showed how much Democracy there was in warfare.

                                <para>- That may be the honorable senator&#39;s opinion; I do not think it an advantage to suppress the truth in that way. In the early stages of the war, trouble was caused by the authorities preventing the people from learning the truth about it. At Gallipoli the. Australian volunteer soldiers put up a wonderful achievement. They saved the Russians, who were being hotly pressed by the Austrians and the Germans, from a flank attack by the Turks. I stated in my speech that by holding the Turks at bay at Gallipoli the Australians had saved the&#39; Russian conscript hordes from annihilation. The word &#34;hordes &#34; was struck out, although it means merely migrating crowds or bands, and fighting armies are migratory. The censor, in the exercise of his discretion, refused to allow the word &#34; hordes &#34; to be applied to the Russians in a report published by the Brisbane <inline font-style="italic">Standard,</inline> a Labour anti-conscription journal, but on 5th&#39; August the censor permitted the words to be published in a&#39; pro-conscriptionist journal. A correspondent, tilting at me, was there permitted to write-: </para>

                            <para>I had the honour of attending an  anti-conscriptionist  meeting last night, and there was a remark made by one of the speakers which impressed me above all others. During the course of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Ferricks&#39;</inline> speech, a considerable portion of which was a tirade against the military systems of other nations, in order to demonstrate how superior the voluntary system is, he informed his hearers that it was the gallant Australians at Gallipoli who saved the Russian conscription &#34; hordes &#34; fromannihilation. </para>
                            <para>I trust your report of this speech will record this word &#34; hordes,&#34; because it is a most significant one. If you remember, during the time of the terrible Armenian massacres many years ago, this was the word of contempt and abhorrence used against the &#34;unspeakable Turks,&#34; and their bands of assassins were known as the &#34;Turkish hordes.&#34; This is <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Ferricks&#39;</inline> description of the noble army that has been accomplishing such unparalleled deeds of heroism and achieving incredible victories against the. Germhun. and I hope it will be remembered by all of us when the proper time arrives. - Yours, &#38;c. Chelmsford. </para>

                                <para>- It was an impetuous or impulsive, but I do not admit that it was an unfortunate, expression. The Russians of Queensland are good unionists, good industrialists, and good Australians. They acknowledge that they left Russia because of the despotism ruling there. It is because of that that they are opposed to conscription in Australia. They have experienced in their own country the ills of conscription. My object in moving the adjournment was to ventilate what I considered a very serious matter. Having achieved that object, I ask the permission of the Senate to withdraw my motion. </para>

                            <para>. - When speaking on the adjournment motion, I spoke of a telegram sent to or from <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Grayndler</inline> as having been held up. This telegram was subsequently referred to by other speakers, and, as I do not wish to create a false impression regarding it, 1 make the following personal explanation : - The telegram, having been held up by the censor, was brought to me, the censor asking whether I approved of it being held up. After reading it, I told him that I approved of his action. I wish to say, however, that my mind did not receive the impression that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Grayndler</inline> was disloyal, or a party to disloyalty. </para>

                            <para>- It is not a fact that all news from Broken Hill has been censored. There have been in circulation in this city certain very ugly rumours regarding Broken Hill, which, upon making inquiry, I found to be without foundation, and I contradicted them. My contradiction was followed by the assertion that news from Broken Hill is being censored. That assertion is as untrue as the rumours to which I have referred. </para>

Senators are fully aware of the contents and intentions of the Bill, and I am quite sure they have come here to-day prepared to proceed with the debate. I am moving the suspension of the Standing Orders in order that after the first reading we may be able to proceed with the second reading, the debate on which maybe continued until a reasonable hour to-night, when, I hope, we shall have made sufficient progress to enable the Bill to be disposed of at an early hour to-morrow. It is necessary that the Bill should be passed as soon as possible. The Government desire to secure its passage this week, and that can be done while still allowing every honorable senator full opportunity to express his views. I trust, therefore, that there will be no opposition to this motion . </para>

                        <para>. - I object to the suspension of the Standing Orders for the purpose of carrying this Bill beyond its first reading stage to-day. There is no urgency in the matter. Already the writ for the taking of the referendum has been issued, and the Prime Minister has said that whether the Bill be passed or not, the referendum will be taken. So that apparently the passage or rejection of the Bill will not really affect the taking of the referendum. </para>

As the Prime Minister has flouted this Parliament, and said that whether the Legislature approves of the Bill or not he intends to proceed with the referendum, we should take him at his word and reject the Bill. In any case there ought to be no hurry in dealing with this measure. The Prime Minister has not been in a hurry to consult the Senate. </para>

When the war is over the people must decide for themselves whether that provision shall appear on the statute-book. It is a matter for future decision during times of peace. The object that the Government have in view in submitting this question to the people is associated entirely with the prosecution of the war. The Government will be no party to using for industrial purposes the power which will be conferred on them by an affirmative answer to the question.

                            <para>- It is easy to hold that opinion, and it is equally easy to hold the opposite opinion. In discussing this Bill we are not considering what the people&#39;s reply to the question may be. We must consider what it involves, and it is my object to show that. Attempts have been made in the press and on the public platform to show that something sinister or something which does not appear on the surface is involved in the question to be submitted to the people. It has been claimed that once the Government are given authority to call up certain grades of persons the power will be used for some ulterior motive, whereas the sole object of the Government is the prosecution of the war, and the sole object of calling up these persons is to maintain the supply of reinforcements to our troops who are now at the front. The Government hold that they should possess this power. Some people hold that voluntary enlistment has not failed. Unfortunately the figures are an unanswerable contradiction to that assertion. The enlistments from May last have declined at a very rapid rate. In the months preceding sufficient recruits were enlisted each month to meet the number of reinforcements required - in fact, in some months there was a surplus&#34;; but since May at no time have the numbers been equal to the number required. I am a strong believer in the voluntary system. I wish it had been possible to carry through the war under that system. I would be a much happier and much more satisfied man. I am sure that honorable senators who support the Government and support the Bill, who eventually will be found supporting the affirmative side in the referendum campaign, will be doing so with no degree of pleasure, but rather with the feeling that their position is one that they must take up, however unwillingly, owing to stern and sad necessity. That is my position. I would be very much happier if we could find reinforcements month by month without having to resort to compulsion. But there is still another answer  to the contention that the voluntary enlistment method has not failed. If it is capable of doing what is required in the way of providing reinforcements month by month, no action towards compulsion need follow an affirmative answer at the referendum. But it is obvious to any one with the least imagination that there can be no hope of success in that direction. However, if in any month the voluntary system, which will proceed side by side with the other, brings in sufficient numbers to provide the necessary reinforcements, to that extent there will not be a resort to compulsion. There has been some cavilling as to the number of reinforcements for which the Government have called. I have heard the argument put forward, and it may bo brought forward again during this debute, that the Government are asking for 16,500 recruits per month, whereas figures given by me have shown that during six weeks there was a loss of 17,000 through casualties. It is said that the casualties represent a rate of 3,000 per week, whereas the Government ask for over 4,000 recruits per week. It is thought that there is some sinister motive in asking for the greater number of recruits than the rate of casualties shows to be necessary. It is urged that we have some idea of extending our forces. &#39; I repeat what has already been stated publicly. The Government have no intention of putting new units into the field. Their intention is to keep the existing units up to their proper strength. Those who talk about the discrepancy between 17,000 casualties in six weeks and 16,500 recruits in. four weeks lose sight of the wastage that goes on apart from the battle-field wastage. The margin asked for is required to meet that wastage which occurs before the recruits go into the battle line. </para>

                            <para>- No. Our experience over a period of twelve months shows that the wastage that occurs between the time of enlistment and the actual entry to the firing lino is close on 20 per cent., and as we have no guarantee that this rate will not continue, we must take into consideration not only the heavy wastage on the battle-field itself, but also that which occurs before our troops reach the battle-field, owing to sickness, disciplinary cases, medical unfitness - though fit when despatched - desertion, and various other causes of that kind. I am trying to anticipate points which may be raised during the debate, in order, if possible, to shorten the discussion. There has been some comment, particularly in the State of Victoria, as to the number of men who have been rejected as medically unfit. The number was so great as to be very disturbing, and in order to ascertain if there was any leakage in that direction, and whether men who were actually fit were being rejected as medically unfit, an inquiry was held by an independent Board of highly-qualified medical men into the cases of 600 men who, since the 1st July last, had been rejected as medically unfit. A close examination disclosed that only five of them should have been passed as medically fit. On the other hand, according to the last despatches from Egypt, there is a large number of cases of men who had been accepted in Australia as medically fit who ought never to have been accepted. These men have broken down before they could reach the battle line. Obviously, from the complaints from which they are suffering, they were medically unfit at the time of leaving Australia. These two examples can afford little consolation to those who say that men who ought to have been taken have been rejected.. On the one hand, only five out of 600 men who have been re-examined have been described as men who should have been passed. On the other hand, we have a large list of men who are being returned from Egypt without doing a day&#39;s fighting, and who have cost the Commonwealth thousands of pounds for equipment and training, who have been found medically unfit, and were so at the time of enlistment. </para>

                            <para>- Before that can be said, it will be necessary to analyze the names of those who are being sent back for the cause I have mentioned, in order to see whether some States have been more lax than others in this regard. That may be the explanation. I hope that the debate on the Bill will be conducted without rancour, and that the subsequent campaign in the country .will also be conducted without rancour or personal vindictiveness. To those with whom I am politically associated, but who differ from me on this particular question, I say that th&#187; Labour Party has always contended that the people should be consulted on political matters. The party have agitated for the adoption of the initiative and referendum. For the first time in the history of the Commonwealth Parliament we have been faced with the necessity for giving an important decision. Whether or not honorable senators agree with the decision arrived at by the Government, they must face the fact that some sort of decision had to be made, either to say &#34; Yes, we will supply the men,&#34; or to say &#34; No, we will not supply the men.&#34; If the former, then obviously there was only one way of doing what was necessary, and that was by the method which has been proposed by the Government. If the latter decision be arrived at, if we do not supply reinforcements for our troops, what will happen) We have four divisions of infantry in France ana a light horse division in Egypt. There is also in Great Britain a fifth infantry division, which has not yet taken the field. The four divisions in France are not intermingled with. British or French troops, or even with troops from the other Dominions. They hold a certain defined line of the front. In other words, a certain portion of the line in France, covering so many miles, is held by Australian troops, and the whole responsibility for holding that portion rests with them. It takes so many battalions to form a division, -and each division has its own defined line to hold. It has so many battalions in the front, so many in the supporting trenches, and a certain number 01 battalions in the rear resting. Each in their turn take their place in the front line. </para>

                            <para>- The point that I wish to make is that if, as the result of casualties, deaths from wounds, or sick- - ness,  a  battalion which is holding, say, a mile of front, loses one-half its strength, then, obviously, it must shorten its line to half-a-mile. or the. line must be &#39;held by only one-half the number of men who were previously holding it. &#39; If that were the experience of every battalion, what would be the .result? If the people of Australia would not find the necessary reinforcements, we should be compelled to say to the British Government, &#34;You must reduce the extent of line our troops are holding, or else ask every man in the battalion to hold&#39; twice as much ground as he  waB  holding when he had the support of his mates who have fallen.&#34; </para>

                            <para>- I shall deal with that question. If we decreased the number of men who were holding a certain lino, the gaps in the ranks could not be allowed to remain unfilled. They would have to be filled by either the French or the British, and in either case they would be filled by compulsory soldiers. That is a point that I desire to bring home to the minds of honorable senators. If we declined to fill the gaps made in our ranks as the result of casualties, then they would be filled by men from Great Britain who have been compelled to go into this war, or by citizens of France, who, likewise, have been forced to do so. </para>

                            <para>- If they were so filled, then, of course, my argument would not apply. I should like to have the assurance that either Canada, South Africa, . or New Zealand are able to do more than supply the requisite reinforcements for their own troops. So far as my information goes, however, they are unable to do more than Australia has done, and that is to supply the necessary reinforcements for. those whom they already have at the front. There  is  no proposal, on the part of New Zealand at all events, to do more than keep up its existing units in the field. </para>

                            <para>- That may be. It is true that all our troops are not in the field at the one time. We all know that they take turn about in the front line. But the point that I am making is that, if the people of Australia said that they would not keep up the necessary reinforcements, the inevitable result would be the shortening of the line that the Australian Forces are holding.. I invite honorable senators to ask themselves whether that is an answer which Australia could make with honour to herself and to the men she has already sent to the front? When this war broke out, the Cook Government were in office, and they offered a division of 20,000 troops. Our party was then in opposition, and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Fisher,</inline> who was then the leader of our party, announced to the country - it must not be forgotten that at the time we were all before the people - that we would support the Government in every measure they were taking to back up the Mother Country in this war. It cannot be denied that that announcement met with no op- . -position on the part of members of our party. Indeed, so far as I know, it was indorsed by every member of our party speaking throughout the country. </para>

                            <para>- Quite so. At that time, there was no suggestion of compulsion. The announcement was made that both the Government and the Opposition at that time favoured the sending pf the first division to the front. The general election resulted in the return of our party with a majority, and the Fisher -Government from time to time, as volunteers presented themselves, announced that they had offered new units to the Imperial Government, and that these had been accepted. And so we went on until&#39; these new divisions were accepted, and I heard no word of protest, either on the part of the present Opposition, or from honorable senators on this side, as to the divisions now in the field being offered for active service. Lot me say -&#34;that the British Government never, at any time, asked that we should send any one of those units. Every one of them has been offered voluntarily, and willingly, on behalf of the people. I believe I am therefore right in assuming that the people of Australia, and their representatives in Parliament, have acquiesced in the placing of these divisions in the field. That carries with it the further obligation of seeing that those men are supported by sufficient reinforcements to enable them to put up a fight against the enemy, and to maintain themselves at their full strength. I trust that when this question is submitted to the people,&#39; it will receive their indorsement. That, however, is not the question with which we have now to deal. The question involved in this Bill, and which we have first of all to face, is as to whether we are going to give the people the . opportunity to answer the question that I have read. </para>

                            <para>- The honorable senator is dealing with&#39; one point, and I am dealing with another. I am simply showing what could have been done by any Government that happened to&#39; be in power when this question arose. The Government of the day, no matter to which&#39; party it belonged, could have brought down a Bill for compulsory service; but with what result? In the first place, it would probably have wrecked the Government, and secondly, it would probably have wrecked the Parliament. </para>

                            <para>- Having wrecked the Parliament, it would have been referred to the people - not as a question standing by itself, but as a question linked up with all sorts of other considerations. It would have been interwoven with the question of party, and with questions arising out of the individuality of candidates. Various political considerations would have been dragged into the arena, so that the question would not have been discussed on its merits before the people, although it must inevitably have gone before them. </para>

                            <para>- I think that the veriest tyro in politics could see that this Parliament was incapable of passing a Bill for compulsory service without a general election. Thus the question would have gone to the people in any event. Those who are opposing this reference to the people are, therefore, face to face with two alternatives; either they must say, &#34; We shall not send the required reinforcements,&#34; or &#34;We shall send them, and we will pass a Bill authorizing the Government to provide for compulsory service.&#34; We know they would not be prepared to pass such a Bill, and if they are not prepared to let this Bill go to the people it is obvious they are not prepared to let the men go to the front. A serious responsibility, therefore, rests upon those who oppose this measure. The question they are called upon to answer is not as to whether this is the proper course to follow, since it is clear that it is the only practical way open to us. By opposing this Bill, therefore, they say, in effect, that they are not prepared to send reinforcements to the front. </para>

                            <para>- That is so. I propose to give some little consideration to the further point that the Government should have used its executive power to deal with this matter. In a country like Australia, and more especially when a Parliament elected since the war was actually in session, what would be said of any such attempt on the part of the Government to use its undoubted grant of power from the people, without consulting the Legislature? </para>

                            <para>- If the one is undemocratic, so is the other, though I hold that neither is undemocratic. I justify my action in regard to preference to unionists by saying that unionism is in the  interests  of the country and for its benefit; and so I justify my action in regard to conscription by saying that it is in the interests of the country and for its benefit. The interests of the country must come before the interests of the individual ; and that, I think, is pure Democracy. I am, therefore, prepared to defend my action in regard to conscription on democratic grounds. Surely it is democratic to allow the people of the country to say what shall be the law in this regard? Why should honorable senators arrogate to themselves the right to say, although the people vote in the affirmative, conscription is wrong? Surely the people are as well able as we are to judge on this question ? The people will be liable, and they know what conscription means. To many thousands it has a significance which it has not for most of us, seeing that they are within the military age, while most of us are beyond it. These people, therefore, have a personal reason for studying the question to even a greater extent than we have. This Bill is a mile-stone in human progress. </para>

                            <para>- I mean a milestone. What is it that we have been contending? That war is made as the result of secret diplomacy - that it is made in the offices of Ministers for Foreign Affairs, without the people being consulted. And what have - we been saying but that the people should have a voice in the matter? </para>

                            <para>- The people then had a voice, because they elected a Parliament after the war had been entered upon. I know that the honorable senator is enthusiastic for this war, as is shown by the fact that his son is in the Forces; but, to use a hypothetical case, if he had then said that he was against the war, and against Australia taking any part in it, would he ever have come into this Chamber ? Of course not. The honorable senator knows that, like himself, the great bulk of the people were enthusiastically in favour of supporting Great Britain in the war; and I therefore say that the people of Australia have spoken on the question. </para>

                            <para>- Of course not; but while it then meant sacrifice, it now means very much greater sacrifice than any of us dreamt of - a sacrifice far beyond our wildest imaginings. v The people are now to be given another opportunity of saying whether, having indorsed the action of the Government in going into the war, and having been content to make sacrifices to that end, they are prepared to make still greater sacrifices. What Democrat could oppose or object to such a proposal ? What Democrat would arrogate to himself the right to answer this question for the people, without giving them an opportunity to answer it for themselves ? The challenge that the Bill makes to honorable senators is contained in the question whether they regard themselves as greater than the people. Have they greater concern in the matter than have the people? If not, why stand between the people and an expression of their opinion? I cannot see how any Democrat can oppose the submission of the question to the people. I do not propose to go into the merits of the question of compulsory service beyond the cursory remarks I have already made. The point is that the Bill lays on the people the obligation and responsibility of answering the question. </para>

                            <para>- No; I do not know that. We cannot say that only a few have been penalized in this country as a result of the war, because, as a matter of fact, a vast army of people have been penalized. We have a casualty list of over 50,000 killed, wounded and sick ; and although some of these may have been only slightly wounded, the sufferings of some of the relatives, if small, have been very intense. I venture to say that there are very few homes which have not, to some extent, suffered as a result of the war. Under the proposal, of course, the suffering will be spread over a wider area, and the measure, at any rate, affords an opportunity to make the sacrifice more equal. Honorable senators know very well that my mouth has been closed about the inequality of sacrifice, owing to the fact that I have been responsible for the voluntary system. I have had to take it, with all its inequalities, but I have never ceased to recognise those inequalities. It is one of the great failings of the voluntary system that, while a, man who recognises his duty steps in prepared to pay the price, another man, who should stand by his sides, keeps back, and makes no sacrifice at all. As the Government have already announced, the question to be put to the people deals with one phase - the compulsory service of human beings on the field of war. The Government recognise that this imposes an obligation on those who remain behind to also make some sacrifice; and during next week honorable senators and the public will know what those sacrifices are to be. </para>

                            <para>- The price is lower than when the trade was controlled by Germany. I do not propose to refer to the machinery of the Bill at this stage, beyond saying that we recognise the fact that the men at the front are still citizens of the Commonwealth, and have a right to a voice in the matter, and that, therefore, an opportunity will be afforded to them to record their votes. This provision applies to nurses at the front, as well as to the crews of transports and the Australian Navy. </para>

                            <para>- The question we have to determine is not at what age the citizens of the Commonwealth shall be permitted to vote ; that is a question which may stand by itself. If Parliament decided that at eighteen years of age the men at the front should be permitted to vote, then there should be the same age qualification in Australia; we cannot have  one class of voters at the front arid another class here. The Bill affords opportunities for people- in the various Territories to vote, and clauses provide for the disqualification of certain persons, amongst whom are naturalized British subjects who were born in any part of the territory of any country with which Great Britain is now at war, and persons who are interned. That was the original provision in the Bill, &#34;but an amendment was made by another place exempting such persons who have sons at the front. These, under the Bill as it now stands, will be entitled to vote. </para>

                            <para>- The reason for calling up the 32,000 is that the large number of casualties during August and September have rendered it necessary to draw on the division in England. I take it that the reason for drawing upon that division is that the 40,000 reinforcements are not sufficiently trained. The men belonging to the division will obviously have had more training than the reinforcements that hare just landed in England. The authorities are taking men from the division and sending them to the front, because they have had more extended training than the reinforcements, and it will, of course, be necessary for us to replace the number taken from the division. </para>

So I say to honorable senators, who are now speculating as to what will be necessary four months hence, let us see what will happen in the interval. &#187; </para>

                            <para>- The Government are not so foolish as to attempt to answer hypothetical questions; they have to deal with practical matters. What we do know is that shortages will occur, and that we shall have to make them good. We know that we will have a sufficient number of single men in Australia to make them good up to June next. We know also that if it becomes necessary to call up married men, we will have ample time within which to consider that necessity, and Parliament also will have ample time to deal with that question. I am not going to be led away into the consideration of hypothetical circumstances, and what is likely to be required four months from now. The Government tell Parliament that they are going to call  u;p  single men, and before they take any other action they will have time to consult Parliament again. </para>

I repeat that I do not propose to answer hypothetical questions or to be drawn into an academic discussion as to what the Government will be likely to do in some, other circumstances than those with which we are at present faced. The Government proposals deal adequately with the present situation. We tell honorable senators that it is our present intention to call up single men, and 1 shall not be led into an argument as to what will happen when the supply of single men is exhausted, because I say that before that time arrives the Government will have ample opportunity to meet Parliament and inform honorable senators of what they propose to do. We shall have time within which to decide whether we shall require to call up married men, and if so, to what extent. </para>

Let me remind honorable senators that all these hypothetical speculations as to what will be necessary on a certain date are vitiated by the results of our experience in the past. When our men were at Gallipoli, we sent to the front a certain percentage of reinforcements, but after heavy fighting took place, we had to double the number of reinforcements, and later the number required was reduced again. We may find that in three months&#39; time  12,000  reinforcements ,per month will be sufficient. What we have to meet is the present situation as we know it, and  16,500  per month&#39; will be necessary to meet it. Six months hence only 10,000 per month might be required. </para>

                        (Queensland) &#91;6.20J. - This is, perhaps, one of the. most important Bills ever submitted to this Parliament, and it deals with a momentous question. The way in which Parliament proposes to deal with the question under this Bill is to shirk its responsibilities and shoulder them on to the people. In my opinion, this so-called &#34; Military Service Referendum Bill &#34; is a sham and a fraud. It is a mean subterfuge by which certain politicians hope to shirk their responsibilities to the people.

                            <para>- Why do I regard this Bill as a sham and a fraud ? It is because the- taking of a vote of the people implies the right and the opportunity to also submit to them the arguments pro and con on the question they are asked to decide. Notwithstanding the explanation of the Minister for Defence to the contrary, in my opinion the position of the anti-conscriptionist in the campaign will be like that of a man going into a duel armed with a bayonet to fight against a man armed with a modern rifle. The man with the bayonet would be all right if he could use it, but of course the fellow with the rifle will see that he never gets a chance to do so. In the same way the conscriptionists led by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> in this campaign will see that the anti-conscriptionist never get a chance to state their case.

What else can he do to prove his case against it? That was the course adopted in the preparation of the manifesto from what I might term the most representative industrial body that ever sat in Australia. </para>

It looks now as if we shall not get a fair deal. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> has addressed the Labour Caucus at length. He has also addressed at length the political bodies of New South  Wales, Victoria, and South Australia, and for a long time, as was stated by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ferricks,</inline> the only account we could get of those gatherings was a garbled statement to suit the Prime Minister&#39;s purpose. Such a despotism over the press as that exercised by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> since his return to this country has never before existed in Australia. If the Liberals, while they were in power, had done what the so-called Leader of the Labour party has done, I think Labour men would have been ready almost to lynch them. </para>

                            <para>- Well, South Australia does not count for very much in this conflict. In my opinion, a referendum taken under these circumstances cannot be anything else than a sham, a fraud, and a farce. It has been said, and a great deal of capital has been made out of the statement, that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> has been to the front, that he has consulted the War Councils of England and France, and that, therefore, his position as an authority on this crisis is much stronger than that of any other man in this country. I have had the privilege of hearing the strongest arguments, and seeing the reddest picture, that the Prime Minister in his own inimitable way has presented to us, and, notwithstanding that, I am here to-night unconvinced that he has made out a case sufficiently strong to justify us in forging upon ourselves the shackles of conscription. I take the full responsibility of saying, that no legislator who has had his eyes about him, and has read of the things as they appear here and in neutral countries, can deny that if the people of Australia today really knew the dangers to which they are exposed, they would lynch every legislator who advocates the policy of further denuding this country of its manhood. I make that statement deliberately, and I challenge its contradiction by those who advocate conscription. I cannot say all I would like to on this matter, but perhaps the hour of trial will come to Australia with appalling suddenness, when perhaps it is too late, ana then an infuriated and betrayed Australia will be looking for the men who were responsible for this policy of sending away our manhood at this juncture. I am going to prove my statements on no less an authority than the Prime Minister himself, for this is what he said &#39;at a public meeting in the Melbourne Town Hall a few weeks ago- </para>

We have been told that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> has first-hand information. It has been suggested that, because he speaks on the authority of that first-hand information, we ought to tumble over one another in order to embrace conscription. But what is the position? We know that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> besought his Cabinet to agree to conscription; he placed the whole of the facts before his colleagues, and laid his cards on the table. He pleaded with Caucus, and there also he placed his cards on the table. Later on he pleaded with the political and industrial bodies of New South Wales, Victoria, and South Australia. He gave them the same facts; but in every case his proposal was turned down, and I am satisfied that there will be an overwhelming majority against it when the people have an opportunity of voicing their opinions on the fateful 28th October. The industrial councils to which I refer were unanimously against conscription, but <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> is now appealing to the people themselves, and he is not going to tell them the facts, nor will he allow us to do that either. </para>

The moment <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> returned to Australia he emphasized the statement that men were urgently required at the front, but in this connexion I want to point out what appears to me to be unmistakable evidence of a conspiracy or collusion between the Imperial authorities and the Prime Minister of this country. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> had scarcely landed on his return to the Commonwealth when a dummy was put up in the House of Commons to ask <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lloyd</inline> George if he thought Australia would be able to find sufficient men as reinforcements. That looked as if somebody was moving. At all events, the question appeared to have been inspired. A little later on, at the time when <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> was trying to win his case here, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lloyd</inline> George said in the House of Commons - </para>

                    <para class="block">That looked to be more than a mere coincidence. It appeared to be part of a plan to convert the people of Australia to conscription. On the top of that we now have the request from the Imperial Army Council to Australia for drafts of reinforcements, a thing that had never been done before by the Imperial Government. In 1914, just after the outbreak of the war, when this country had offered only 20,000 men for service at the front, when the small British Army was putting up that immortal retreat from Mons, when the guns of the Germans were thundering outside Paris, and Calais seemed almost within their reach, when our Fleet had not as yet proved its unmistakable superiority over the German Navy in any big sea fight, no request was made to Australia for assistance. Yet when, according to  Colonel  Repington.  who is generally acknowledged to be the best authority on the war in Britain to-day, there are 15,000,000 Allied troops at the front; when Roumania has joined those forces; when we are on the offensive instead of being on the defensive, we are invited to believe that Great Britain has departed from her traditional policy of refusing to ask her Dominions for help, and has actually &#39; requested assistance from Australia. I refuse to believe that she has asked for help from us, unless she was requested to ask for it. There is no record that New Zealand, or Canada, or South Africa has been asked to render assistance. In these circumstances, it is indeed remarkable that such a request should be made to Australia. I believe that this conspiracy was carefully hatched in Great Britain between <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> and certain responsible persons there. We all know why conscription was introduced in the Old Country. Nobody is so foolish as to think that the men of Great Britain were conscripted for the trenches. The truth is that the authorities there desired industrial conscription. The great Northcliffe press, supported by the capitalistic influences of Britain, were determined that the workers should be brought under military control in the interests of capitalism. That is the real reason why they were conscripted. In support of my statement, I intend to read a few extracts. The first is a summary of the situation by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Stead,</inline> who has written the sanest articles on .the war that have been published here since the commencement of hostilities. In his <inline font-style="italic">Review</inline> of the 3rd June last he says - </para>

                        <para>No fewer than 5,041,000 men had voluntarily enlisted. That is an amazing fact, and makes one wonder why compulsion is needed. I have referred before to the fact that it is generally accepted that the total number of nien a country can put in the field is just exactly 10 per cent, of the entire population. The number of men, women, and children living in the British Isles is 40,000,000; so that, apparently, the total number of soldiers which could emeiently be put in the field is 4,600,000. But 400,000  more  than that have actually been obtained as volunteers. Is conscription, then, going to yield many more men? If not, why has it been introduced? One would imagine that compulsion was needed rather to fill the munition factories than to swell the army - rather to put all workmen of fighting age under military control than to increase the already huge total of fighting men available. </para>

                        <para>By a majority of 326 to 36, in a House of 070* members, the British Parliament decided in favour of universal conscription. As, according to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Asquith,</inline> Great Britain lias no less than 5,000,000 men under arms, it is difficult to see how conscription will put any more soldiers in the field. Conscription will, however, enable the Government to organize the entire nation far more effectively, for all workers of fighting age will be under military control. The suggestion has already been made that miners should work for ten hours instead of eight, in order to make good the shortage of coal. Under present conditions that would bc quite impossible; but under the conditions brought in by conscription, it would be quite feasible. </para>

                    <para class="block">Here is yet another sidelight upon how conscription came to be inaugurated in Great Britain. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. John</inline> Dillon, in writing on this question, says - &#34; In recent British history, there has been no such discreditable chapter as that which contains the history of the campaign against the voluntary system in Great Britain. If the Conscription Bill is presented and passed, it will be the crowning triumph for Lord Northcliffe and his newspapers, for the <inline font-style="italic">Daily Mail</inline> is fully justified when it claims that the campaign is their campaign, and the triumph is their triumph. And the working classes of Great Britain will do well to remember that <inline font-style="italic">a</inline> large number of those who have carried on this campaign have been predominantly influenced, not by a single-hearted desire to win the war, but by considerations of the conditions of England after the war is over, and by a desire to create an instrument which can be used hereafter to resist and put down the Struggles of Labour which they anticipate will follow on the conclusion of peace. </para>

                            <para>- Exactly. Tire chief reason why conscription was introduced in Great Britain was that the military authorities there might control the industrial classes, both during the war and after its termination. The same remark is applicable to this country. We have in Australia a class which is out for the employment of child labour, coloured labour, or any other class of labour, so long as it is cheap. </para>

I notice that the censor did not censor the statements contained in that extract. He censored the manifesto of the industrialists of Australia, but he overlooked the statements which I am about to quote.

                        <para>The indenture should be of, say, five years&#39; duration, although at the expiration of that time the men could be allowed to sign a fresh agreement for a further period of years. Restrictive legislation would have to be framed to prevent them obtaining vested interests in the country; but that would present no great difficulty. Children born in the country would be subject to the same conditions as their parents, and would have to leave with the latter, or after a fixed number of years. Of course, we realize that the great problem would be to deal&#39; satisfactorily with the half-caste; but, owing to limited space, this question must be discussed in a future article. It is a problem that can be solved, must be solved, for, even if the question of climate did not make a White Australia impossible, the war has put an end to it. After peace is declared, the colour line will become more and more indefinable, and we shall be compelled to recognise the fact, for Britain will say to us, &#34; Renounce your White Australia policy or suffer the consequences. Your blood will be upon &#39;your own head.&#34; </para>

Is that what you are sending the manhood out of the country for - to make it easy for the spoilers and exploiters to destroy the country ? That .is what these men are out for. Within a few months of the passing of conscription an insistent demand will be set up for coloured labour., and with the unions smashed or seriously damaged by conscription, they will be unable to put up the great fight that they would be able to put up under normal conditions. With a gagged press, and speakers gagged on the platform under the War Precautions Act, what chance will they have to raise an outcry against the attempt which will inevitably be made to foist coloured labour on the country within a few months of the advent of conscription ? So surely as conscription is passed, and a scarcity of labour succeeds, the arguments for coloured labour will become more plausible, and almost unanswerable, according to the ideas of the capitalists. </para>

                    <para class="block">That means the supply of single men. That statement is made, in my opinion, with the deliberate design and purpose of deceiving the people, and deluding married men and others who may be called upon into the belief that only the single men will be required, plus such married men as may volunteer. These are the facts: - 32,500 men must be called up at the end of this month, or the difference to make up that number. Up to yesterday there were 4,000 volunteers, so that probably 25,000 men will be called up on the 1st October. We shall want 16,500 per month afterwards. This means that for one year this country has to raise 214,000 men. According to Knibbs&#39; figures, quoted by the Minister himself a week ago, the single men physically fit, according to the census cards on the 9th June last, between the ages of eighteen and forty-four, were 203,402. Of these, 50,572 were in camp on the day the Minister made his statement, reducing the number of single men available to 152,830. It is estimated that those over eighteen and under twenty-one number 40,000. </para>

                            <para>- The Minister said it had been stated that they reached as high as 50,000, but I am knocking 10,000 off. That leaves 112,830. Only sons of widows and sons in families that have already sent a boy to the front will take off a considerable number. It is said that there &#34;will be judicious exemptions for certain industries. Doctors, and also workers in special industries, will be exempt. I have put these down at only 20,000 single men. This reduces the available number of single men to 92,830. The number of rejects as medically unfit has, so far, gone as high, in some cases, as 50 per cent. I will assume that only 33$ per cent., or 30,970, are rejected as medically unfit. This brings the available number of single men between twenty-one and forty-five to 61,887. The Minister, said the wastage in camp had gone as high as 20 per cent. I will put it as low as 10 per cent., or 6,188. This will bring the total number of single men available in the Commonwealth between the ages of twenty-one and forty-five down to 55,699 for the twelve months, meaning that within four months the available single manhood between twenty-one and forty-five will have been exhausted. The married men available on the 9th June last, according to the Minister&#39;s own figures, quoted from <inline font-style="italic">Knibbs,</inline> were 294,859, divorced and -widowers 4,839, making a total of married manhood between twenty-one and forty-five of 599,698. Taking the medically unfit as 33A per cent., and it may be a good deal higher, we get a deduction of 99,899, leaving a balance of 199,799. Married men under twenty-one who will be exempt may be roughly estimated at 5,000. That figure seems rather low, but there are not a great number. This brings the total down to 194,799. The wastage on a 10 per cent, basis will bo 19,479, bringing the total available married men between twenty-one and forty-five down to 175,320, or a grand total of married and single men available between those ages of 231,019. If we want 214,000 men, on <inline font-style="italic">~Mt.</inline> Hughes&#39; and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce&#39;s</inline> figures, for the first year, we shall have a balance available at the end of twelve months of 17,019, or enough for one month? </para>

                            <para>- I am not worrying about them. If figures mean anything, the Minister&#39;s statement means that we want 214,000 men for the year, so that there will be only one month&#39;s available manhood in Australia within those ages at the end of twelve months. I am giving these figures to prevent the public being deceived by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes,</inline> or anybody else, into thinking that the Conscription Act is not far-reaching. It is far-reaching and all-embracing,, and may include all the single and all the married men, not only between twenty-one and forty-five, as <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> would have us believe, but between eighteen and sixty, because the kernel of the Bill lies in the clause containing the question to be put to the people. That refers to &#34; the same compulsory powers in regard to requiring military service for the term of the war outside the Commonwealth as the Government have now in regard to military service within the Commonwealth.&#34; That is what <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> and the other supporters of conscription should be honest enough to tell the people. That it involves single and married men between eighteen and sixty, is proved by the wording of section 59 of the Defence Act- </para>

Let us be honest, and tell the people what we intend. The lives and liberties of many of our citizens are involved. Therefore, let those who vote know the whole facts. If we continue the campaign as it was opened by the Prime Minister, with an outburst of calumny and the misrepresentation of opponents, how can the people arrive at an honest verdict ? We have a terrible responsibility in this matter, and must, therefore, put our case fairly, fearlessly, and faithfully. Hitherto the Minister has found the greatest difficulty in sending away 13,000 men per month. The men sent away this year have not averaged more than 9,000 or 10,000 a month, and the average for the two years of the war is about 7,500 per month. </para>

                            <para>- No. Unfortunately they are decreasing, and there is no prospect of an increase. How, then, shall we send away 16,500 men a month ? If the Imperial Government have to choose between transporting 10,000 men from Canada and 3,000 men from Australia, will they not take the Canadians, so that their shipping may be employed to the best advantage? Three trips can be made from Great Britain to Canada for one trip made to Australia. In view of these circumstances, there is no warrant for the attempt to impose the shackles of conscription on the country. We have done excellently- in comparison with Canada, where there is a population of over 8,000,000, and where it is not necessary to keep men for home defence. Were Canada denuded of her manhood, neither Germany nor any other country would dare to lay hands on her, because of the protection afforded to her by the Monroe Doctrine. Every man that we send away weakens our own defence. <inline font-weight="bold">Sir</inline></para>

With conscription there will be insufficient men to harvest our crops, to shear our wool, and to prepare our meat. This will make the argument for the employment of coloured labour stronger. Our productivity will be reduced just when it should be increased, that is, when the strain is at breaking point. It has been costing us, approximately, &#163;70,000,000 per annum to do our part in the war, and at the end of the year the cost of it will reach &#163;100,000,000. Let us hesitate before making it greater. We have in camp and abroad approximately 300,000 men. If we increase the number by 213,000 within twelve month&#39;s, our expenditure will reach the staggering sum of &#163;234,056,250 per annum. That estimate is based on the assumption that it costs 25s. a day to keep a man in the field, having regard to food, munitions, equipment, and everything else. </para>

                            <para>- I leave that to the honorable senator. Putting down 5 per cent, as the interest on the money that we borrow, and taking concessions and other expenditure into consideration, the rate will be slightly higher. Our interest bill at the end of twelve months will be &#163;11,702,000. It seems to me that the country cannot carry such a load. Some people seem to think that we can help in the war only by hurling men into the trenches. France and England soon found out that that is not the only way of winning the fight. In the first instance, shops and factories were closed, and artisans and others were rushed into the trenches. </para>

                            <para>- Yes. England denuded her collieries of men, but it was soon found that by closing the factories, and the workshops injury was being done to the Allies&#39; cause, and men were- brought back from the trenches. We may have the same experience here. A supply of wool is vitally important to our men, who, if they are to withstand the* rigours of a European winter, must be well clad in woollens. Similarly, our men must be well fed, and Australian meat, than which there is no better in the world, must be provided for them. Our wheat will be in great demand until the Dardanelles are opened. </para>

                            <para>- Because the people at the front needed it more. We need also gold, copper, and other metals. If, however, we send away too many of our men, we shall reduce our production, and thus injure the Allies. There may be a difference of opinion as to how we can best help, but I think we can do&#39; best by sending materials and increasing production. Others think that we should send men. Whilst I respect the opinions of my opponents, I ask them to respect mine. We cannot produce things that are essential to the conduct of the war, and at the same time increase our contribution of troops by over 200,000 within the next twelve months. To do that would ruin the country. Under the most favorable conditions after the war it will take two years to bring all our men back. Production will be decreasing instead of increasing, but, notwithstanding that, we must pay our men until the opportunity comes to discharge them. We may thus get into a condition of which the consequences will be terrible. Let us view the matter rationally. If we lead the country to disaster we shall damage the Allies more seriously than if we declined to sanction conscription. The other day the Treasurer asked for a loan of &#163;50,000,000, and obtained &#163;23,000,000. When men are demanded, and an insufficient number offers, honorable senators cry for conscription. But when gold is asked for and is not obtained honorable members do not endeavour to conscript it. Where, then, is the logic of the conscriptionists ? A person who will conscript one man&#39;s life and will not conscript another man&#39;s gold has no right to claim the name of a Democrat. What will be done by the press-gang if it is sent on the warpath by the present so-called democratic Government? The first place they will go to will be a mansion. They will rap at the door; the owner will be too old to go to the war himself, and, as is usually the case with the aristocracy, probably will have no son to send. He personally cannot be conscripted. Perhaps in his paddock he will have 100,000 sheep. Could they be conscripted? No; sheep are sacred -private property, and therefore must not be touched. So they will pass the rich man&#39;s mansion and his flock, which are inviolable. Then they will arrive at the cabin of a poor man; they will find that he has a son. Will that boy be immune? No, he will be conscripted ; he will be fair game for the press-gang. The poor man&#39;s son will be forced to take part in the ghoulish butcher&#39;s carnival in Europe whilst the rich man will be exempted in regard to both life and wealth. Yet we are told that there ought to be equality of sacrifice. Even if we had partial conscription of wealth - we are not likely to get entire conscription of wealth - there could be no equality of sacrifice in this war. Two married men may be conscripted, one rich, and the other poor. Both may go to the war and lay down their lives for their country. What is the position of their families? One man&#39;s children must be dragged up on a pension of 5s. per week each, less than sufficient to keep body and soul  together  under present conditions, and the other man&#39;s children, whilst they certainly will have suffered an irreparable sentimental loss, will be still in affluence and will be reared in conditions approximately the same as if their father had never been killed. Who, then, will say that there can be equality of sacrifice ? The Commonwealth has floated a war loan, and allowed to the rich man of this country per cent, with exemptions. The poor man has to give his son, but the richer a wan is the safer he is from all levies. Under the extraordinary and immoral law passed by this Parliament last June a man may have &#163;1,000,000 and receive approximately &#163;50,000 per annum in interest for in vesting it in the war loan, and yet unless we resort to repudiation we cannot compel him to pay a single penny of taxation for the purposes of the war. That is an anomaly which should not be tolerated anywhere. Some well intentioned people are deluded into the belief that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> intends to propose the conscription of wealth. A good deal of coaxing will be required to convince me that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> will keep his promise in that regard, any more than he kept it in regard to the conscription of life.

                            <para>- We know that the policies of Australia and Great Britain in regard to raising&#39; the wealth for financing the war have not been right. Fancy Great Britain in a time of war allowing the shipping companies to accumulate the stupendous sum of &#163;250,000,000 in profit. In 1913 the shipping companies of Great Britain made profits &#39;aggregating &#163;20,000,000. That was a time of peace, but in a time of war those same companies increased their profits by &#163;2.30,000,000. Should such a scandal be tolerated in our Empire when the worker is scraping for a bare existence, and when the cost of living has increased by 33 per cent. ? Even in Australia the banks last year made a profit of no less than &#163;3,000,000, which was equal to 13 per cent, on their capital - a pretty good result to obtain in time of war. We are told of an immense armament ring in England with a capital of &#163;25,000,000. The more big battles fought and the greater the number of men killed, the greater will be the combine&#39;s dividends. That ring should not be tolerated in our Empire. What is the Government&#39;s policy for financing the war? They say they intend to introduce a War Profits Bill, but only to take half the profits. We are allowing the exploiters of Australia to rob the widows of men who have been killed at the front, and the wives of soldiers who are fighting there. The exploiters are piling up huge fortunes out of the necessities of the people, but do the Government step in and say they will not allow such a policy to continue ? No ; they say, &#34; Halves, brothers, halves.&#34; That is what one thief says when he catches another. The Federal Government say- to these men, &#34; Rob the people as much as you like - exploit them as much as you can ; so long as you give us half the profits you will have discharged your obligation to the State.&#34; That is not my idea of financing the war or protecting the people during the war. Among the party represented by honorable members opposite, among members of War Councils, and the <inline font-style="italic">elite</inline> of capitalism, we find men praying for the suspension of Wages Boards in order that returned soldiers may be employed as slow workers on low wages, and thus help to cut down the system of unionism. We are told by one gentleman that 29s. 6d. a week is quite sufficient for the maintenance of a family of five people in decency and comfort. </para>

                                is reported in the Sydney press to have said that it was a &#39;sufficient sum on which to bring up a family of five - an average of os. 10¾d  per head per week. No matter whether this Bill passes or not, on the 30 th of this month the Government propose to call up 32,500 men under the provisions of the Defence Act - for home defence, I suppose. Has such a fraud ever been perpetrated on the people before, when we know that if the verdict of the people is given in the affirmative these men are really being called up for foreign service? We should be honest, and suspend the compulsory calling up of any man until the people have given their decision. I maintain that the voluntary system has never had a fair deal. It has done magnificent service, which would have been infinitely better but for the fact that at the outset a section of the community, for some purpose best known to themselves, took a set against it, and put forward strong proposals for conscription. In Queensland practically the whole of the Liberal party realized what I suppose some of the Liberals in the Federal arena do, that the Labour movement was whole-heartedly against conscription, and instinctively they took advantage of the circumstance, as all along they have been prepared to take party advantage of every opportunity afforded by the alleged political truce.

The men in Queensland who support conscription are those  who  have always been opposed to reform, and have done all in their power, by hook or by crook, to prevent the men they would now drive to the front from having a say in the management of the affairs of the country.

Similarly, the man who becomes a volunteer in order to avoid being a conscript can hardly be described as a volunteer. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes&#39;</inline> statement will not bear examination. The Labour movement was started a quarter of a century ago with one aim and object in view, namely, to dethrone the autocracy which then ruled supreme. The movement said that no man should dominate a Parliament or a people; that the people should rule instead of being ruled. For the purpose of bringing about this reform leagues, unions, and conferences were established, and the objects of the movement found final expression in the platform that the party adopted. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> was one of the principal architects of that platform. 2Tow he is out to destroy some of his handiwork. He is out in spirit to-day to depart from one of the principles that animated the movement, namely,- that the movement should lead its leaders, and arrogates to himself the right to lead the movement. The moment any movement, Labour or otherwise, allows itself to be dictated to by one man it is in danger, because if that man succeeds in one case he will succeed again. If <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> succeeds, and conscription is carried, the Labour party is doomed.

                            <para>- No. I honestly believe the statement I have made to be correct. If I did not I should not have uttered it. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> has no right to complain of having his lips sealed when he himself seals the lips of the members of his own Government. 1 undertake to say that not one member of his Cabinet will remain in it and talk against conscription. That is7 the test, and there is no answer to it. My position is this: I regard the meeting which was held in the Sydney Town Hall last Monday night as the practical beginning of an unofficial coalition between <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> and certain other people. That coalition is going to draw closer and closer. It is just as well that we, as Labour men, should know where we stand. I know where I stand, and am quite satisfied that every man who follows <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> in this unofficial coalition, which he commenced on Monday, and which will draw tighter and tighter as the differences between him and his party broaden, must be led to the one inevitable position. The man who has already gone with these people will find by and by that there is a point beyond which he cannot go. But, unfortunately, he will have burnt his boats, and will be thrown upon a political noman&#39;sland, where he will be exposed to i-he fire of every party. That has been the experience before in regard to these coalitions. All have had their beginnings in the same way, and I am afraid this will&#34; have an ending like some that I can recall to mind. I saw the beginning of a little coalition in Queensland, and I saw its disastrous end. But at the same time I saw rise out of the ashes of it a resplendent movement, better than ever it was before, and I believe that out of all this trouble the Labour movement will rise higher, and nobler, and better than ever it was. No one can keep down this movement. It is too big. too all-embracing and high in its ideals, to be kept down by any man. Its ideals are above man and party and place. So long as the soul of the movement outside is sound, there is hope for it, and no politician can break it down. </para>

                        <para>.- The Bill now put forward for our consideration and decision is the most important that has ever been submitted to this Chamber. Prior to its introduction in another place the newspapers of this State airily assumed that the great majority of the people of Victoria were anxiously and eagerly awaiting the application of conscription in the Commonwealth in respect of the titanic struggle that is now being waged in Europe. But since the introduction of this Bill the newspapers- of this State, at least, have discovered that there is a section, and a very big section, of this community, who are determined by every legitimate means in their power not to have imposed upon them that which the publications to which I have referred assumed that the people desired. Last night, at the Exhibition Building, Melbourne, there was held a meeting which was attended by probably 15,000 or more citizens of Victoria. It was by no means the first meeting that had been held by organizations and interested persons who are putting forward every legitimate effort to defeat the referendum in this State on the 28th October next. When the resolution in opposition to conscription was submitted to that immense gathering, it was carried unanimously. So far as the  chairman  and I noted, there was not a single dissentient hand or voice raised against it in that great gathering. The reason why the industrialists of Victoria are determined, if possible, to prevent the introduction of conscription in this young country of ours is that they know that it is vicious in principle, and because they know also that the conscription of human life is but the first step, the next step being the conscription of labour. That there is not wanting evidence of this is shown by the utterances of various gentlemen in different spheres of activity. A few evenings ago, in the Victorian Legislative Council, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hagelthorn,</inline> Minister for Agriculture, made .certain remarks that had little or no application to the  measure then before the - Chamber; but evidently the matter to which I am going to refer was in his mind, and he thought, maybe, it would be a fitting opportunity to give expression to it. Bte said - </para>

                        <para>Before very long the Government, either directly or through agencies qualified for the purpose, would have to take into very serious consideration the limitation of certain industries and activities when harvesting operations were on and fruit picking was in full swing; for, he repeated, it was apparent that there would be very great difficulty in getting a sufficiency of labour to undertake the garnering of cereals and fruit, and yet the gathering of those crops must proceed. </para>

                    <para class="block">That was the statement of a responsible Minister, made before the people had had an opportunity to express their views on the question that is to be submitted to them on the 28th October next. T expect that when he speaks of the limitation of certain industries that are in existence today, he means that, if the people now employed in them could be better employed in picking fruit or gathering the harvest, those other industries ought to cease. There is no doubt that those who were running the industries affected would object unless there was conscription of labour; and although the Minister stated to-day that the Government had no intention at present to conscript labour- </para>

                            <para>- I do not think that any other Government could do worse than the present Government. However, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Mullan</inline> referred to the statement by the Prime Minister which was reported in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> of July last; and it is a statement that cannot be too often emphasized. The Prime Minister then said, &#34; In no circumstances will I agree to send men out of the country to fight against their will.&#34; When he made that statement he was Prime Minister of Australia and Leader of the Australian Labour party. It was only last year ; and at that time he knew, as we all knew, that Lord Kitchener had said that, in his opinion, the war would last for at least three years - that preparations were being made for a three years&#39; war at the shortest. We also knew that Russia was more or less disorganized, and more or less unequipped, and we were told that France was being bled almost white. Further, we knew that the Prime Minister of England, and other gentlemen holding responsible positions in the heart of the Empire, had declared, &#34; What we want are munitions, munitions, and more and more munitions, and more and more men.&#34; At that time there was no conscription at Home, and both Britain and her Allies were short of munitions. To-day, circumstances, like <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes,</inline> have changed. We were then well within the danger zone, while to-day  we are not only outside that- zone, but Germany is beaten, and the end of the war is within measurable distance. In my case, Russia is better off than she was over twelve months ago. She is better equipped than she was when <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> said he would under no circumstances conscript men for oversea. Today, France has more men in the field than she had at the beginning of the war, and Britain has ample munitions and ample men. Yet we are told that the reason <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> has changed his opinion is that necessity has arisen for such a change. </para>

                            <para>- I shall show that, later on. According to the Government&#39;s proposals, a proclamation will be issued shortly calling up for home service 32,500 single men. The voluntary enlistments will be deducted from the 32,500, and the difference will be called up before the 1st October next for home defence. If the people of Australia are not in favour of the Government&#39;s proposals, these men will not be sent overseas, and neither will they, in my opinion, be retained for home defence. Now, home defence is to me a matter of supreme importance. It is so because I love Australia, the land of my birth, with all my heart and soul. I love her because she is rich in all that makes for a nation&#39;s greatness. She has every variety of climate, every diversity of soil, and unbounded resources and potentialities. I love her because she gives to her people, particularly those who, like myself, are born and reared in the school of adversity, greater opportunities for a fuller and better life, and a higher civilization than any zone that belts the globe. </para>

                    <para>Those are my authorities for saying that Germany is beaten, and that the end of war is within measurable distance. We have been told that only single men are to be called up; that only single men will be necessary to see this war through. I am going to quote figures which will show that if there is anything in that statement it is but a confirmation of the statement I have previously made, that there is no danger whatever of Australia becoming the prize of the enemy, because the number that can be called up under the scheme outlined by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> in Sydney will be comparatively so small as to make no material difference in the re- . suit of the war. The Prime Minister has said that the Government propose only lo call up single men, and that they do not think it will be necessary to call up married men. According to figures compiled by the Commonwealth Statistician, there were, on the 9th June last, 450,000 fit men, between the ages of eighteen and forty-four years. Of that number it may be assumed that one-third are single men, and the remaining two-thirds married men. One-third of 450,000 gives us, in round &#39;figures, 150,000 men. The figures&#39; show that on the 9th June last there were 150,000 fit single men between the ages of eighteen and forty- four years. I understand that we are entitled to make a deduction of 25 per cent, from this number to. represent those between the ages of eighteen and twenty-one years, who will not be conscripted, and, according to the best authorities, of the volunteers who presented themselves for medical examination and enlistment at the various military depots in this State during the past four months, there were 36 per cent, of rejects because of physical unfitness. I make bold to say that if from the 150,000 single men between the ages of eighteen and forty-four years, we take 25 per cent., representing those under the age of conscription, 36 per cent, as rejects because physically unfit, and the number covered by the exemptions provided for under the scheme outlined by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes,</inline> we shall find that there will not be available more than 50,000 or 60,000 single men. In the circumstances, I say that when the Minister for Defence and the Prime Minister tell us that they do not think it will be necessary to call up married men, the statement is misleading, and, in my opinion, more or less dishonest. </para>

                            <para>- I am stating my view of the case seriously. Those who favour the Government&#39;s proposal believe that the war will last longer than I think it will. I challenge the Prime Minister or the Minister for Defence to contradict my contention that when we make up the difference between the number of volunteers and the 32,500 who will be required on the 1st October, and send forward 16,500 per month after that, the eligible single men in the Commonwealth will have been pretty well exhausted by the end of the year, and by January or February, 1917, the call for married men will be made. </para>

                    <para>I am against conscription for many reasons. I said earlier that home defence is to me a matter of supreme importance. We have played a very big part in this war. It is well that the people of Australia should understand what our financial responsibilities are and will be as the result of what we have done up to date. During the first year of the war, according to the Budget statement of the Treasurer, our expenditure was, <inline font-style="italic">in</inline> round figures, &#163;20,000,000. In the second year it was &#163;50,000,000. If we do not conscript a single man, our financial responsibility for the financial year ending the 30th June, 1917,and assuming that the war will be ended then, will amount to another &#163;75,000,000. It is estimated by those most competent to judge that if the war is over at the end of June next, it will take two years before our soldiers abroad can be returned to Australia and settled in different avocations. </para>

                            <para>- It will be nearly two years before the last of our soldiers abroad can be returned to Australia. The major portion of them will have to be paid for that period, and it is estimated that if the war ends by June of next year we shall be involved in an additional expenditure of &#163;60,000,000 on this account. That will mean a total expenditure of &#163;205,000,000 as a new debt for the Commonwealth of Australia. </para>

                            <para>- I am allowing 5 per cent. Now our taxation proposals bring in &#163;4,500,000, so if we do not conscript a single man our present taxation must be more than doubled to meet this new liability. If, however, we conscript 300,000 men, the additional expenditure will be &#163;75,000,000, bringing the total new debt up to &#163;280,000,000, and the interest bill will be increased by &#163;3,7 50,000, making the total of interest &#163;14,000,000. It will be seen, therefore, that if the people of Australia go in for conscription, and they call up 100,000 men, our present taxation proposals will have to be more than trebled to meet our interest liabilities. </para>

                            <para>- Well, if the people of Australia want conscription, that is what it will cost; and, so far as the Labour party is concerned, they will see that the taxation is imposed upon those who, apparently, have not borne their fair share of it, in respect to this war, up to the present. I would not send a single man out of Australia by conscription, because the question of home defence is of .supreme importance. The turning point in the struggle has been passed, and victory for the Allies is as certain as that day follows night. There is, therefore, no danger, so far as Australia is concerned; there is no danger in respect to the Empire. </para>

                            <para>- If the people of Australia see this matter in the proper light, I think they will view favorably the proposal I am going to put forward. Instead of conscripting 100,000 men, as is proposed, involving an expenditure of &#163;75,000,000, I would spend that amount in the construction of strategic railways, in hastening on the unification of the railway  gauge3,  in the building of seaplanes and submarines, and thousands of aeroplanes, as well as a fleet of dirigibles. I would also erect the most tip-to-date arsenal in the world, and honeycomb Australia with stations for the location of our air fleet. 1 stood almost alone on this question years ago, when I pointed out the possibilities of aerial defence. I said then that the next war, which I hoped to God would not take place in my life-time, would be the most bloody in the history of the world, and that it would be largely determined, not as wars have been in the years gone by, but under the water and in the air. Those who have followed the progress of this </para>

                    <para>Avar  know that the submarine has played an important part, and that the substantial progress made by the Allies on land is due to the fact that they have become masters of the air.  Thi3  question of aerial defence is receiving very careful attention from the most advanced military authorities in the world. Even Great Britain is preparing for the next war, for in the <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> of the 14th of this month there appeared a cable message stating that the British air defence, after the war, would involve the establishment of an encircling cordon of 20,000 aeroplanes and 1,000 air craft for the army. What would it mean if we spent the &#163;75,000,000 in. Australia? It would enable us to construct strategic railways, to adopt a uniform railway gauge, to build a large fleet of aeroplanes - thus affording employment for thousands, who will probably experience difficulty in securing employment after the war - and to materially assist the Empire. </para>

                            <para>- Never mind that. I  affirm  most unhesitatingly that she is beaten. Only a few years ago an agitation was started in the Commonwealth for the presentation of a Dreadnought to the Mother Country. A certain section of the community believed that that was the most appropriate &#34;way in which we could recognise the services that had. been rendered to Australia by Great Britain in the matter of affording us adequate protection. The Labour party came into  power,  and said, &#34; The best service that we can render to the Empire is to build a navy of our own,&#34; and accordingly that was done. In the same way I maintain that the best service we can render the Empire now - seeing that all doubt as to the issue of the war has been removed - is to go in whole-heartedly for an efficient system of home defence. I do not desire to trespass any longer upon the time of honorable senators. I have expressed my views in regard to this Bill. From the first I have never doubted the ultimate result of the war. I have said many times that men, money, and munitions must eventually prevail. That they  have prevailed is borne out by the substantial evidence which I have produced this evening. When this Bill is referred to the people, I and others who are opposed to the Government policy, will do what we can to prevent conscription being fastened upon the Commonwealth. If I am any judge of the feeling of the people of Victoria, and if I understand their determination aright, a majority will not be found casting an affirmative vote in respect of the Bill on the 28th October. </para>

                            <para>- I cannot speak for other States. I know that meetings have been held in some of the State capitals by the advocates of conscription. We have been assured that the meeting which was addressed by the Prime Minister in Sydney the other evening was one of the most successful gatherings ever held in the Commonwealth. We know that the speech which he delivered on that occasion had practically been delivered in the newspaper offices here before it was uttered in Sydney, and that cheers had been given for it by the sub-editors of certain journals and by others. We have been told that it was a packed meeting which was held in the Sydney Town Hall - that is to say, that the hall would not hold more people, that the early doors were rushed, and that when the motion was put to the gathering, 4,000 persons voted in favour of it, and only seven against it. </para>

                            <para>- No, but somebody else did. Outside the Sydney Town Hall those who could not get admission to that building by the early doors held a meeting on their own account. The meeting was more numerously attended than was the gathering inside the Town Hall, and, when a vote was called for, 8,000 persons were found to be opposed to conscription, and only eight in favour of it. I have that information from a most reliable source. </para>

It is because I have a conscientious objection to conscription for military service abroad, when I consider it is quite unnecessary, that I have raised my voice in opposition to it. When the numbers go up on the 28th October I believe it will be found that the proposals of the Government have been defeated by an immense majority. </para>

                        <para>. - In common with other honorable senators, I do not think that this is a time for silence. Bather is it a time when each one of us should express his views freely and frankly on the momentous issue which faces us to-day - the most important issue with which Australia has ever been confronted. I shall approach this question with a full sense of my responsibility, and with a desire not to reflect in any way upon the opinions of those from whom I differ. Only a brief two years ago there was no member of this Parliament, and no citizen of Australia, who imagined that today we should be face to face with the question of conscription. In this land of ours - the freest under the sun - we little dreamt that within a few brief months we should be faced with the question of determining whether or not our manhood should be shackled with conscription; but we are face to face with it now. That being so, I am prepared to take my share of the responsibility, and shall treat the measure in that light. When <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> was in London his speeches there were acclaimed here. They were acclaimed in every part of the Commonwealth. When he arrived in this country he had a triumphal march. He was hailed as a Heaven-born leader by every capitalistic paper. No man has ever left Australian shores for the heart of the Empire and acquitted himself so well as he did. I do not agree with some things he has said, or with some of the things he is doing today, but, speaking of him as a man, all the acclamation given to him as a man was richly deserted. But when he returned from his Empire mission, and had, with his colleagues, considered the situation facing the country, when it was announced that the policy of his Government was to submit the question of conscription to a referendum of the people, the capitalistic press to which I have referred, with the honorable exception of the <inline font-style="italic">Age,</inline> practically turned him down. Yesterday he was a Heaven-born leader; to-day he was nothing. Yesterday they cried  &#34;Hosannah!&#34;;  to-day they cried &#34; Crucify him !&#34; He was a Heaven-born leader, but he did not lead in the direction which they thought he would take. They, therefore, turned him down, but in twenty-four hours they changed their minds, and now the same papers that decried him are again acclaiming him, which shows how little you can depend upon the whims and vagaries of certain people who write in the public press. I am against conscription of human life, and no vote of mine will ever bring about the conscription of human life, good, bad, or indifferent. We have been told by the Prime Minister and those who agree with him that it is essential to conscript the manhood of Australia in order to preserve our liberties. With that pronouncement I do not agree. Such a doctrine would have been right twelve months ago, when the fate of the Empire and its Allies was trembling in the balance. The position to-day, so far as this world-wide war is concerned, is entirely different from what it was then. The fate of the Empire and its Allies is not trembling in the balance. That is true of the fate of the Central Powers instead. Those who run surely can read, and when I make that statement I do not want it to be understood that I think the war is over. But the position is so much improved in our favour that it is not necessary to ask for the conscription of our manhood. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Mullan,</inline> in his very able address, dealt with the question of the cost which the Commonwealth would have to incur in the event of the Bill being indorsed by the people, but I would ask the Government why a financial statement in connexion with the resources of the Commonwealth has not yet been made? It is most remarkable that, whilst the Government have found ample time to bring forward this Bill, which purports to conscript our manhood, it has not yet had time to make a financial statement of the probable cost of that policy! This should have come from the Commonwealth Treasurer before the Bill was submitted. The Treasurer has not enjoyed good health during the past few weeks ; but a financial statement could have been made by the </para>

As it is, we are being asked to sign a cheque in blank. </para>

                            <para>- I am prepared to do so. It is only right that before Parliament places its imprimatur on the measure, we, the custodians of the public purse, and the people who have to foot, the bill, should be fully informed regarding the financial situation. I understand that another place has adjourned until Wednesday next, when a financial statement will be delivered. I cannot accept the statement of the Government that married men will not be called to the colours. The figures are too conclusive to allow me to do that. Should conscription become the law of the land, we shall not be able to give that assistance to the Empire for which the Imperial Army Council has asked unless we conscript married men. As to the conscription of wealth along with the conscription of life, it is true that the Prime Minister has&#39; said that wealth will be conscripted in proportion to manhood, but he has not stated to what extent or in what manner wealth will be conscripted. </para>

                            <para>- Should not the Prime Minister tell us exactly what he intends&#34; to do. That was humanly possible. He should have told us exactly what he proposes to do with the wealth of the country, just as he has told us what ho proposes to do with that most sacred thing human life. That would have been the better course to take, and fairer to those who owe allegiance to him. It has been said that taxation can be introduced which will provide for the conscription of wealth. I do not think that is so. The people are already taxed fairly heavily, though the taxation is not in proportion to the ability to bear it. Those who pay the taxes pass them on to the worker and the consumer. Can any one stand on a public platform and deny that ? Consider the cost of living to-day. I marvel how it is possible for any workman in Australia who has to pay rent, and maintain a wife and family, to keep his own body and soul together, let alone carry out his responsibilities to those dependent upon him. Continue increasing taxation if you like, but every increase will be passed on to the worker and the consumer. That being the position to-day, unless wealth is conscripted the worker will not only be offering his life for his country, but will be paying practically the whole cost of the war. That is an indisputable fact. If it should happen that a majority of the Australian people vote in favour of the conscription of life, power will be given into the hands of the nine or ten men who form the National Government to control every man in the Commonwealth, and to direct him to go here, there, or wherever it is their will to send him. Human flesh and blood will be directed into a national pool controlled by the Government of the day, and if that should happen, surely to God they should have the&#39; right to direct wealth in the same manner. </para>

I may not speak as freely on this question as I should like to do, because I will not violate the bond of secrecy into which we have entered, but if I were free to speak either in this chamber or outside, the public would be afforded a better idea as to the necessity for retaining our manhood within our shores. </para>

                            <para>- I do not intend to do so. I am treating this matter from an Empire point of view, as well as from an Australian point of view, and I say that the Commonwealth has taken, and is taking, a noble share in the campaign, and has excelled the record of any other portion of the British Dominions. I am glad, indeed, that those men who went abroad to defend our country will have an opportunity of voting on the proposed referendum If there are any men who should have the right to vote on this question they are those who have volunteered to defend our liberties on the battle-field of the Old World. I congratulate the Government on having made that provision for them. When it was proposed to take a referendum on the alteration of the Constitution, I asked the Government whether it would be possible for soldiers who were then at the front to cast a vote, and .the answer was that ballot-papers could not be issued to soldiers at the front, and the Government had abandoned their intention of obtaining the votes of the soldiers, because it was found impracticable, and because the soldiers were under Imperial control at the front. That was on the 11th December of last year. If the proposal for soldiers to vote was impracticable then, how has it been made practicable to-day? </para>

                            <para>- I make no imputations. I simply call attention to the fact that while it was impracticable to take a poll of the soldiers then, it is now found practicable, no matter where the soldiers may be. I am glad to see it. If it had not been for what I think was a mistake on the part of the Prime Minister a little while ago in offering another 50,000 men to the Empire, we would not have been asked to face this question of the conscription of Australian manhood. The wiser course would have been to maintain a supply of reinforcements for the divisions already in existence. </para>

                            <para>- Parliament was not consulted, but I do not suppose that any member of Parliament objected at the time. I simply say that it was a mistake. I admit that I am speaking in the light of after events. As the Prime Minister had made that offer, it. required an extra effort, which has unfortunately failed, and accentuated the position in which we find ourselves today. I believe that if the Prime Minister&#39;s mind were searched, he would admit, in the light of after events, that he had made a mistake in submitting this further offer of troops, when Australia was already doing very well. </para>

                            <para>- If they had been, we should have heard of it. No better argument could have been used by the Government to carry their referendum proposals than a statement that the sister Dominions of South Africa and Canada had been asked to send more men. If such a request had been made, it would have been used by the Government in this case. I undertake to say that it has not been preferred, otherwise we should have heard of it. Whilst I do not decry what has been done by any of the Dominions, I do say that, in proportion to her population and having regard to her distance from the great theatre of war, Australia has done more than has any of the Dominions. Having regard to her population, to the distance she has to transport her troops oversea - 12,000 miles - and to the relative cost of training, equipping, feeding, and transporting her men, Australia has done more  than  any part of the Empire outside the heart of the Empire itself. Another matter to which I desire to refer is the proposed constitution of the appeal Courts. If the referendum be carried, opportunities will be given to men to show cause why they should not be conscripted. The Bill provides, first of all, that they must go before a police or stipendiary magistrate. If he refuses their application for an exemption, they may appeal to the Supreme Court of a State, and from that tribunal to the High Court. I enter an emphatic protest against this proposal, and in Committee should like to see it amended. Let us focus our attention upon this particular point. Take the case of a rich man and a poor man who desire to be exempted. Both appear before the magistrate, and, let us assume, the exemption in each case is disallowed. The rich man can afford to appeal to the Supreme Court, and from there to the High Court; the poor man cannot. He has to stop practically at the first Court; he cannot afford to go further.. The Bill should be so amended as to provide for the appointment of a board in different districts in each State, representative of rich and poor alike, so that a speedy determination can be made as to whether a man shall be exempt or not, and litigation thus avoided. Inevitably the rich man will be able to exhaust all the channels which the clause as it stands affords, whereas the poor man will be compelled to stop at the first Court. I commend to the Leader of the Senate the suggestion that this should be remedied - </para>

                            <para>- The honorable senator&#39;s interjection is, as usual, of an insulting character. I am not proposing a board for myself or of myself. What I suggest is that there should be in certain districts in each State a board comprising an industrial representative and an employers&#39; representative, with an independent  chairman,  to settle such questions. I should hot like to trust myself entirely to the decision of either a police or stipendiary magistrate in such a matter. Another point is that it has been suggested that during this campaign it will not be necessary for leading articles and letters dealing with it, and published in our newspapers, to be signed. Is that so.? </para>

                            <para>- I am glad to have that assurance. Having said so much, I desire now to intimate that I am going to support the Bill. In view of my remarks, this may be considered strange, but it is not strange to my mind, x have no mandate from my constituents to conscript human life, nor have I any mandate from them not to conscript it. I believe in the principle of the referendum. It is a Labour principle, and one that I have favoured ever since I have been able to act and think for myself. I am not going to use it now as I would treat a suit of clothes - use it while it pleases me and cast it aside when it does not. I cannot do that with the principle of the referendum. There is a higher and a greater tribunal than that in which we are gathered to-night. That tribunal consists of the creators of this Parliament, and of me as a senator through the ballot-box. It is because I trust the people in all things that I trust them in this. I would not be worthy of the trust reposed in me if my vote meant that those most concerned would not have an opportunity to say yes or no on this great and most momentous issue. While I am against the conscription of human life, I am supporting the Bill in order that it may be submitted to that greater tribunal of which I have spoken. And when the Bill is before the people, if God spares me health and strength, I shall exercise my right as a citizen, and give my views on the public platforms of Western Australia as I have given them to-night. </para>

                        <para>. - Is the Minister for Defence aware of the fact that the <inline font-style="italic">Argus</inline> this morning printed an article on the subject of conscription which was not signed, notwithstanding the statement made to-night that all articles having reference to that issue must be signed? I understand that a difficulty has arisen, through no fault of the paper, but through the fault of the Prime Minister. The reason for the position seems to be that a writ for this referendum has been issued without the authority of law, and the newspapers are in a  position to defy the Government. As I say, a writ has been issued without authority, and the result is that a great morning paper has been able to laugh at the restrictions sought to be imposed, and to publish an unsigned article regarding conscription. I do not know whether this is done with the connivance of the Government or not ; but, as I have said, it really means that a writ has been issued without the authority of law. What does the Leader of the Senate intend to do ? Does he intend to ask the newspapers to recognise the spirit of the law? The Government have issued an illegal proclamation, which will remain illegal until it is sanctioned by Parliament. </para>
