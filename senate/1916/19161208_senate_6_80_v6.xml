When questions are given notice of on Thursday it is almost impossible to, get replies by Friday morning.. I suggest that in future honorable, senators should give notice of the questions for the- first day of sitting in the. following week. </para>

                        <para>. - In the course of my remarks on Wednesday night I endeavoured to point out the part which Australia was playing in connexion with, the war, the numbers which had been given, the cost which had been entailed to the Commonwealth, and the circumstances which had brought about practically a crisis in connexion with the recruiting of men to help the Empire at the present moment. I endeavoured to show that, whilst we were prepared to do as much as we possibly could, there was a limit to our giving, and that at some point or other we must. necessarily find it impossible to go further. </para>

                            <para>- I said that it refers to those who are opposed to that policy.  The cause of any lack in recruiting is due, I contend, to the position taken up by the conscriptionists, who have practically created a feeling in the minds of men that the taking of their place in the defence of the Empire is no longer an' act of chivalry and of gallantry, but that it is the duty of the conscript slave, the man who has been coerced into action against his own free will, having never been stimulated or stirred into the spirit of patriotism which is animating every soldier who goes to the front. They have robbed Australia of that sentiment which underlies the system of voluntarism. If there is any dearth of recruiting, it is due to the feeling created by the coercion party. </para>

When I am asked what is the difference between coercion for service overseas, and coercion as applied to trade unionism, I say that whatever trade unions establish as a principle, I, as a member of a trade union, am compelled to obey ; and when this country decides for service overseas, I, as a loyal member of this Commonwealth, will also obey that law. </para>

                            <para>- As I have said, Great Britain has a population of 46,000,000 and a territory of about 100,000 square miles. Australia has, in round figures, about 5,000,000 people and a territory of about 3,000,000 square miles. In other words, Australia is about thirty times the size of Great Britain and has a population of only one-ninth, so that it could not reasonably be expected we should do as much. Obviously it would be easier for Great Britain to contribute one-tenth of her population than for Australia to do that. </para>

                            <para>- I repeat it was easier for Great Britain to do what she has done than for Australia. I know that Great Britain is doing a great deal in the manufacture of munitions, and if we were similarly employed we should be playing a more useful part. We have to look to the future and bear in mind that we might be called upon to make even greater sacrifices than hitherto, and I think we would be doing a far greater service to the Empire if we conserved our interests within Australia than by going; forward " mad-headed " in the manner indicated by the Government proposals. </para>

                            <para>- It is quite true that Great Britain established the principle after 5,000,000 of her men had voluntarily come forward, and it is true, also that, according to Colonel Rep.ington, or some other military authority, 10 per cent, of its manhood is as much as any nation can afford to give in the prosecution of a war. I say, therefore, that Great Britain had already given more than a normal proportion before she adopted conscription. </para>

                            <para>- We do not know what sacrifices we may yet be called upon to make in Australia, and I urge that if we are going to maintain our supplies that is as much as we can reasonably be expected to do. Had we confined ourselves to four divisions we would not be- in the difficult position in which we are at the present time. It was a mistake to attempt to send five divisions to the war. I have no doubt that it was the purpose of the military authorities in Great Britain to increase our task until we reached the breaking point. They had no proper regard for the internal affairs of Australia. They were impressed by the grit and worth of the Australian soldiers. They, believed that they were of more -value than almost any other soldiers, they had, and for the purpose in view they, were prepared to bleed Australia to the last man to enable them to carry out their task. I can admit that that was their business, but it is ours to loot after our domestic affairs and to have regard to the internal interests of the Commonwealth: We cannot overlook our duty to protect and safeguard our interests, in Australia. We should maintain the traditions upon, which the Democracy of Australia has been built up, and I say that to propose a system of- conscription is to advertise to the world that our- men who- are capable of bearing, arms are unwilling to do their duty. If that were really so, there are other means which might be adopted by which those who ought to go to the front could be secured. <inline font-style="italic">~2fo</inline> doubt there are some men who have failed in their duty in this respect, and who have not shown a proper sense of their responsibility in connexion with the war. But I remind the Government that the liberty that is permitted upon our race-courses, and at other places of amusement, is a practical admission that those who are responsible have not been imbued with the due sense of the gravity of the situation. We are living here just as we did before the war, and men attend prize-fights and race meetings as though there was nothing amiss. Whilst the Government are prepared to tolerate such a condition of affairs they cannot at the same, time claim that the manhood of Australia have failed to realize their responsibility. Before they attempt to put pressure upon a community which has shown itself more than willing to play its part in the prosecution of the war, they should have the courage to deal with the persons to whom I have referred, and bring home to them a sense of their duty. I am not against sport or amusement. I dearly love pure sport and amusement, and I am satisfied that a community that fails to -foster pure forms of sport that serve to relieve the tension of men's minds will not conserve the best traditions of nationhood. But at a time when we are in death-grips with an enemy such as the world has never before seen, there are ways and means by which all the forces of the community could be concentrated for the carrying on of the war without the adoption of a policy that strikes a blow at all democratic traditions, and which might establish a precedent from which we would never later be able to free ourselves. We are not justified in asking a people who have done their share, and more than their share, in the prosecution of the war to adopt a policy which would rob them of their claim to gallantry and manhood. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> referred to the people of France and other countries that have adopted conscription, and in reply I say that the exigencies and circumstances of any nation can alone determine the wisdom of the policy it adopts. If the people pf Australia to-day found that there was no other way by which to defend their national existence than the adoption of a policy of conscription, I am satisfied that without any referendum they would unanimously  call upon the Government to press every fit man into the service of the country. </para>

                            <para>- <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie</inline> is welcome to think so if he pleases - " As the fool thinks the bell jinks." Those who are against conscription have been perfectly satisfied with my utterances on the subject. I have not been asked to take any more extreme stand than I have taken. I claim that in what I am saying now I am giving utterance to the views of those who are associated with the anti-conscription movement. The people who have advocated anti-conscription are as zealous in the prosecution of the war as ever our conscriptionist friends could be. I say, further, that those who have appeared on the anti-conscription platform are those who for the most part have sons at the war, whilst those who have been advocating conscription have no sons to go to the war. It is a notable fact, apart from the platform advocates 'of conscription, that people who voted for it, and who assisted the campaign with funds, have merely vested interests to preserve, and were called upon to make no sacrifice of flesh and blood. It ill becomes any man who has nothing to offer to tell the son of another man to take his place at the front. </para>

                            <para>- That is so, but those honorable senators are notable exceptions. A very great number of those who have been calling upon our young men to go to the war have themselves nothing to give, but everything to preserve and protect. They are satisfied that in this case, as in every other, the working population should bear the burden whilst they enjoy the results from their burden-bearing. I am confident that the agitation in favour of conscription was born amongst the wealthy class. It did not emanate from the Labour leaders or from Labour institutions. No Labour organization in Australia took the initiative in suggesting that the manhood of the country should be conscripted. When we are told that conscription is the policy of unionism, I ask why the agitation for it did not begin with the Labour movement and amongst Labour organizations. It is said that trade unions coerce their members into obedience to their laws, but they never instituted a propaganda to compel the manhood of the country to go to war as they think it right to apply compulsion to their members' in connexion with industrial organization. The thing speaks for itself and needs no argument. I hope that a difference of opinion on this subject between <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie</inline> and myself will not interfere with the friendship that has existed between us. </para>

I have even tried to cultivate the friendship of those who have differed from me, believing that to be the right course to adopt. I contend that Australia has done, and is doing, all that any people situated as we are can be expected to do. The highest encomiums have been passed in England upon Australia for the work that she has done and is doing. In my opinion, the agitation in support of conscription has been due to the action of people who have some political axe to grind. I have stated from every platform during the referendum campaign that the agitation in favour of conscription was a deep-laid plot to destroy the Labour party. </para>

                            <para>- We see the result of the agitation, and what I predicted has come to pass. The agitation was begun, not because Australia was not doing its share, but because Labour was dominant in the Legislatures of Australia, Federal and State. The purpose was to create disunion in the ranks of Labour, and it was believed that this would accomplish more for the advance of so-called Liberalism than any other policy that could be pursued. We have the results of the agitation before us to-day. Those who were responsible for it have. captured the men who in the past have been leading the van in the ranks of Labour, the men upon whom we relied to safeguard the principles of unionism. Liberalism has accomplished its purpose, but we may find some grain of comfort in the well-known statement of Lincoln that, " Though it is possible to deceive the people for a time, to fool some of them all the time, and all of them some of the time, it is impossible to deceive all the people all the time." I venture to say that the disruption which has occurred in tEe Labour party will lead to a greater organization on the part of the masses of the people, who will, in the future, nourish their liberties as they have never done in the past. I am quite sure that the people outside this Parliament had arrived at the conclusion that their representatives here were suffering from lethargy.  They  had come to regard Parliament as a fossil institution, and its members as persons who, having once received the confidence of the electors, were content to merely sit on these cushioned benches, draw their salaries, and parade themselves as the representatives of the people. They believed that we did not take them into our counsels, but adopted a high-handed attitude- </para>

The whole spirit of the Labour movement has been shattered to the winds, so far as they are concerned, and yet they have the effrontery to claim that they are the leaders of the movement. </para>

                            <para>- We have never repudiated one pledge. We have said that we would do everything in our power' to prosecute the "war to a successful issue, and we are doing it.- The only sprag in the wheel has come from the conscriptionist camp - from the men who have destroyed recruiting, and who have imposed a- serious check on the patriotic fervour of the manhood of this country. Never since the conscription, campaign began* have we been able to make "the crowd feel that by volunteering for service abroad they would be ennobling themselves. This we had been able to do until the conscriptionists came forward with a scheme which emanated, not from the class to which our Labour leaders belong, but from a class which has 'always been seeking its own aggrandisement. When the people decided that they would' not be forced to do 'that which they were not prepared to do voluntarily, the Government still persisted in calling up the manhood of Australia. They put forward a policy under which, every fit man in the country was to receive a month's military training in order that he might learn the rudiments of the business. From 'the stand-point of rendering these men efficient, the utter futility of that policy was -at once apparent. It took men away from their ordinary vocations, disrupted industry, and loaded us with a debt which we are ill-fitted to bear. It cost the Commonwealth no less a sum than £600,000, and no attempt has been made by the Government to justify that expenditure. They merely acted in a despotic way, and imposed upon the people an unnecessary and heavy burden. This is one of the acts -which must condemn the Government in the- eyes of the electors, and it' is one for which they will have to answer in the not distant future. Then I object strongly to the treatment meted .out by the Government to those who .differ from them on . this question. '.They have not hesitated to -associate the opponents of conscription with the Industrial Workers of the World, to brand them as men who are .prepared to destroy homes and cities, and generally to wreck civilisation. They have thus put an indignity, not only upon the representatives of the people in this Parliament who differ from them, but upon the people themselves, who by their votes have shown that they are not prepared to adopt the Ministerial policy. These are matters which we cannot forget. The issue of the- regulation- under which men of eligible -military age were to be questioned .when they visited the polling booths on referendum day will always remain as: an outstanding interference with the secrecy of ,the ballot. I will not say anything further on that. heading, because :Senator Gardiner, in his exposure of the methods of the Government, clearly demonstrated that what they .sought to establish was not the rule of a Democracy, but the rule of an 'Autocracy - the creation of a dictatorship, which is repugnant to every free man, and which does not meet with the approval df the people df this country. So far as I am concerned, whatever may be the differences between my utterances and my conduct, I shall at all times be prepared to plead the merits -of this-'war, and to urge the surrender of all that we have and all that we hold dear in its prosecution to a, successful issue. I am quite satisfied that if we cannot get men to voluntarily fight for their liberty, it is because they have no liberty to safeguard. But -we i cannot appeal to the best instincts of humanity by a resort to force. When we have to resort to that, it .will be the last stage in our history. We may then reckon that we are doomed and "damned/an'd- that there is no fair prospect for our immediate future. 'But I do not believe that '.we have .yet reached that pass.. I do not think it will ever be necessary to conscript the manhood of this country.

                            <para>- When I reflect  upon that circumstance, I have no fear for the success of the Allies. When I think of the justice of our .cause, I can see more millions - greater battalions than those which are arrayed in battle to-day - fighting the common foe before Australia can go under. If I believed" that Australia could turn the tide of battle by one inch, that she could, by any -gift of numbers, alter -the result of the immense struggle which is now raging, much as I value the standard of liberty set up by the Democracy of this country,  I would  forego it, and appeal to our manhood to lay aside all its preconceived "notions,, and submit itself for military service, as a child . does to its mother j realizing that its fate was dependent upon the success of out arms. But if we gave every man that we have we could not alter the result. We are not the determining factor in the prosecution of this war. The object I have in view is to maintain the freedom of the people and safeguard their liberties. I want to prevent them being brought into serfdom and slavery, and to foster the fighting spirit in us all as we go forward together to give battle to the common foe. I want to put an end to the misrepresentation and calumny which has been heaped upon us by those on the conscription platform with their wild-cat schemes and hysterical ravings. I sincerely trust that during the coming month, whatever may be the part we are called upon to play, we shall all be animated -by deep love of home and country, and seek to maintain the freedom and liberty of the British race, and uphold its best traditions. I trust that as the result of the efforts put forth during the campaign the cry of the conscription of manhood will have been ended for ever, and that Australia will maintain its freedom in the prosecution of this. great. and dreadful war. </para>

                        <para>. - Although the referendum campaign is ended, it seems that it has still to be fought over and over again for an interminable period. Nothing but the recent conflict appears to engage the attention of Parliament and the country. I do not ' know whether it is wise to - do so, but I also wish to make a few remarks thereon. It was not likely that those of us who were opposed' to compulsory service abroad would assist the Government to perfect their plans to carry it into effect. Objection has been raised to the action of the Government in calling up the men in anticipation of an affirmative vote. Personally I was pleased at their action in that direction, because I believed that when the people began to realize what conscription meant they would record a much greater vote against it than would otherwise be the case. Instances came under my notice where people for some time previously had been enthusiastic conscriptionists, but when the hand of the Government was stretched out to force members of their family into the training camps they began to see things in an entirely different light, and spared no efforts to defeat conscription. </para>

                            <para>- It was a very unpleasant fact. It brought home to the people in a way which no other method could have done what conscription really meant, and it was largely owing to the calling up of th$ men .that conscription was defeated. I, and I am sure .most other people, regret very much the enormous amount of personal abuse and misrepresentation which took place during that campaign, and which apparently has an indefinite course still to run. </para>

The annoyance to which we were subjected by the unfair and unreasonable attitude of the Government in regard to the censorship of the press was also responsible for a very large measure of the support we received during the campaign.- The Senate yesterday decided that the Government should no longer -be permitted to enjoy the freedom of action in that direction, which they, enjoyed during the campaign. </para>

                            <para>- The decision of the Senate was a restriction of unfair actions on the part df the Government. They capped the whole of their unfair proceedings by the determination to insist upon the use of the ballot-box to find out whether-men had -answered the proclamation or not. All these matters greatly assisted the " No Conscriptionists, " but apart from all that, once the people began to realize what conscription meant, they became more and more hostile to the idea, and if the campaign had continued for another fortnight our majority would probably have reached not 60,000 but 200,000. The people of Australia are not prepared to entertain the compulsory idea. It has been said that compulsion is the law of the land in Great Britain, but I remind those who make that statement that the people of Great Britain had not very much voice in the election of members to the Imperial Parliament. They have no voice at all in the election of members of the House of Lords', and they were not consulted  upon the question of compulsion or .no compulsion. Had they been consulted it is very problematical whether they would have voted for it. As it was, it was forced on them by a Government elected not by the people but by a small minority. There is no adult franchise there, and the women of Great Britain do not count in the election of members of Parliament. </para>

                            <para>- It certainly does not. An instance proving this conclusively was seen the other day. There has been on the platform of the Labour party for ten or twelve years a proposal to extend the principle of land value taxation to water and sewerage rating.- That has also been on the platform of the Liberal party for many years. A Bill to give effect to it was passed by the Lower House in New South Wales recently, but when it reached the Upper House the Honorable B. B.  O'Conner,  followed by <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Thomas</inline> Hughes, and supported by <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Allen</inline> Taylor and <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Nash,</inline> vigorously opposed the idea. Their opposition was so strong that the Honorable J. D. Fitzgerald, who was in charge of the Bill, ceased to push it along. So far from the New South Wales Legislative Council representing the people I am firmly convinced that if the people had a referendum on the question they would vote for the abolition of that Chamber by a very large majority. Many of its members axe there for the express purpose of preventing the passage of useful legislation. </para>

                            <para>- I do not think that even the Right Honorable Joseph Cook would have objected to the passage of a Bill of that sort. There is no reason either why the Parliament of New South Wales should not have passed such a measure. They could have done it without the  slightest  difficulty, but they did not want to do it. They were determined to hang up the coal industry as long as possible, and prevent the miners from obtaining what they got ultimately. </para>

                            <para>- That is an oh1 method of getting recruits, but the old plan of stopping industries is not going to work in the future in the same way as -it has done in the past. We had statements furnished to us through the press to the effect - I do not say with the view to get recruits - that in Tasmania the Liberal Government "had closed down the public works. Such action can have only one result, and that is to throw men out of work, to make it more difficult for persons to secure employment, and to bring about that which is' unquestionably the worst form of conscription. I am not sure that the Federal Government, if I can read aright, do not intend also to do the same thing. Let me warn them that if they propose to cut down the few little public works we have in hand, they will meet with very strenuous opposition to their action, and that they are not going to get recruits by that method. There has been a number of matters which have led up to a reduction in the number of voluntary recruits, which do not appear to me to have been stated with sufficient clearness and in sufficient detail to indelibly impress the position on the minds of honorable senators. And without wishing to weary them, I propose to quote a few figures. Quite recently the Minister for Defence was good enough to quote to us the enlistments during the months of June, July, and August, and also to furnish us with a statement showing the casualties for' each one of those months. But that, I submit, was not a fair way of placing the position before the Senate. I want to show that not only has the voluntary system not broken down, but that we are getting more than sufficient men to meet all our requirements. Not going back any further than the first of this year, I intend to quote the enlistments for each month up to October. They are as follows: - </para>

                            <para>- I. quite understand the position. The return 'placed, at our disposal showed that during the.- whole of the. campaign, our total casualties up t the end of September were a little over 70,000. Since. that . time the answer given to us by the Minister shows that our net casualties for the whole of the term of the war - that is from October, 1914, to the 31st December, 1916- were' 50,916; and the total voluntary enlistments' for" 1916, from 1st: January to 31st October, were 117,296. These- figures show conclusively, and'.in a way which neither the Minister for Defence nor any of his supporters, nor any of the conscriptionists in the country can controvert, that we had not only maintained our Forces at the front at their original strength, but that we had a margin of 66,380 on the right side. In these circumstances to say, as the conscriptionists have said, that we are not maintaining our Forces, that we are not sending forth the necessary number of reinforcements, seems to me to be utterly untrue, because the return shows beyond the possibility of a doubt that we have not only maintained our reinforcements and our divisions at their original strength, but that we have had a. margin of 66,380 to spare. That is the effective argument which ' appealed to the electors of New South Wales to turn., down the conscription proposal:. Had. the Government been able to show - and they have never been able to show - that we were not maintaining our divi- sions at their original strength, then the position would have been an entirely different one. But neither the Government nor any of their supporters, have. ever, been able to prove that such was the case. </para>

To. my mind, there has been a lack of candour on the part of the Government in. placing the true position before the electors of Australia. I am satisfied that when, the war broke out it was a wise action on the part of the Government to prevent certain items of information from becoming public property, but that stage has passed. The people of this country now are entitled to get from the Government as frequently as possible exactly what the true position is. I venture to say that there are very few members of the Government, and very few members of the Senate who, on the spur: of the moment, could tell us.-howmany men are. abroad at the present time. </para>

                            <para>- I did not; the: statement is quite incorrect. It is very much like other inaccurate statements made during the campaign. Australia has not "quitted." If she had, I presume no more troops would be going to the front, the men at the front would be recalled, and steps taken to close down the whole business.- Has anything of that kind been done? </para>

                            <para>- No; if is based on an official statement made by the Minister for Defence, and from figures supplied by the Defence Department. If the honorable senator says that the Minister, has misinformed the Senate, I differ from him, as I believe the Minister supplied, ns with, correct information concerning the position; and on those figures -I maintain we have not -only sufficient- men to maintain our divisions at the front at a normal strength, but a margin of more than 66,000 men. In these circumstances, what is the use of saying that we- are going to quit? Surely honorable senators should cease to mislead themselves, and at the same time mislead the community in regard, to this ' matter.  Before I. pass on to' another phase of . the subject, I want to make it clear that I am entirely opposed, to, and have -no sympathy whatever with, those who were prepared to destroy machinery, as stated by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> yesterday; in the course of his remarks with regard to Cockatoo Island. It is a "most disgraceful and humiliating confession to have to make that, in this country, there are men who think that, by the destruction of machinery, they will secure any advantage to themselves, or the class to which they belong: It is an entirely mistaken notion, and one which. I am sure is not countenanced by members of the Australian Labour movement. Now, referring to the recruiting campaign, I want to point out that a number of reasons contributed to the falling off' of recruits during this- year. It. will be remembered that about March last, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> said that, even if we. had had conscription, we; could not have sent- one additional man to the front. </para>

In January last the voluntary enlistments totalled about 22,000 a month; in March, 15,000; but for April, after the Minister's statement - they dropped to 9,000; and in June, July, and August, they totalled only a little over 6,000 per month. Notwithstanding that, I repeat we have secured more than sufficient recruits to keep our divisions up to their normal strength. </para>

                            <para>- It would be a good thing for the Allies if some of those responsible for the conduct of the war were sacked, and fresh men put in their places. I am glad to know that some effective action <inline font-style="italic">has</inline> taken place with regard to the British Cabinet. After <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce's</inline> statement about recruiting, a considerable amount of correspondence, notwithstanding the censorship, reached Australia from the front, and placed before the people here the true position of our soldiers. That also was responsible in no small degree for a reduction in the number of those coming forward to offer themselves for their country. </para>

                                I beg to call your attention respecting my return to Australia to undergo a sentence of three years' penal servitude. The reasons why I appeal to you are as follows :  - I am number 1134 Private E. Bernberg, of " D " Company, 17th Battalion, 5th Infantry Brigade. I embarked from Australia on the troopship No.
                                <inline font-style="italic">A32</inline>
                                on 12th May, 1915. I arrived in Egypt a few weeks later, where we had to undergo a severe training. On or about 15th August we embarked on the troopship
                                <inline font-style="italic">Alornia</inline>
                                for the Peninsula, where we arrived on 20th August. I was then fighting with my battalion for seventeen weeks until the evacuation, after which We were sent back to Egypt. I wish to state that up to the time I got into this trouble I had only one crime. I am nineteen years of age, strong, and perfectly willing, and would be only too pleased, to go back to the front and prove myself, as I have already done, and at this time when my country needs me. The crime I am sentenced on to such a term of imprisonment is what other men are daily getting a few days' confinement to barracks for. At the court martial the crime was stated as " Absent without leave and insubordinate language to a non-commissioned officer." This crime was committed in Egypt after the evacuation. I appeal to you, sir, to do your utmost in this matter and get me my liberty, so that I can fall in the ranks again with my fellow countrymen.

                        <para>- I may say that I went through Darlinghurst Gaol a few weeks ago, and I was pained and surprised to see the number of men who are there, and to learn the trivial offences for which they have been incarcerated. I take another case, that of No. 1517, Private W. J. Clinton,C Company, 19th Battalion, 5th Brigade. He is serving five years' penal servitude. One would think that we did not need any men at the front. Private Clinton writes - </para>

                            I, the undersigned, wish to appeal against the sentence passed on me whilst in Egypt. I am charged with - 1. Disobeying an order. 2. Obscene language. 3. Escaping from custody. On which charges I am sentenced to five years' penal servitude. I will endeavour to give you a true statement of what occurred, all of which was stated on oath at my court martial. I was ordered by our O.C. to have a shave. I told him I did not own a razor, to which he replied by swearing and telling me to borrow one. While endeavouring to borrow one I was sent by a sergeant out in the desert on fatigue, with which order I complied. Upon returning to the lines I was walking along with the sergeant to borrow a razor when our O.C. saw me, and once again abused me about not having a shave, at which I lost "my head and abused him in return. Then I was placed under arrest, 'and put into the guard tent, from where I escaped, not having any leave since my first arrival in Egypt, and knowing that after being court martialled for the first charges would not get a chance, took it on myself, got out. of the guard tent, and went into Cairo. I might state that I was on the Peninsula from August 5th till the final evacuation, and always done my duty to the entire satisfaction of the officers and N.C.O.'s of my battalion. While there for a couple of months I was attached to the Engineers doing sapping duty, and helped during the last days at Gallipoli to mine the Turkish trenches. While at Lemnos, after returning from the Peninsula, I broke camp to visit Castro, a village a few "miles away, for which crime I was sentenced to 28 days' second field punishment, which included a forfeiture of £7 pay. Upon returning to Egypt and, thinking that my punishment was finished, refused to attend defaulters' parade, for which I got another 28 days and £7 fine. It was on returning to the lines after being tried for the latter offence that the present trouble arose. Up to the time of leaving Gallipoli I had the cleanest of sheets, and, if given another chance, will do my best to soldier on and play the game. Trusting this matter will receive your earnest consideration.

                            beg to draw your attention to our case, arid ask you to see if you can get us a remission of our sentence. Our battalion (20th Battalion) were seventeen weeks on the Peninsula, and we were among the last to remain on Anzac at the evacuation. When we returned, to Egypt, after a fortnight atLeranos Island, our battalion was camped at Telelkebir about four weeks, and then we were shifted across the Suez Canal and placed on the Canal defences. On 'our return from Gallipoli leave had been. granted to 1 per cent. per day, we, not being amongst the lucky ones, did not receive leave. We were posted out on the Arabian Desert, and the main work  allotted to our battalion was that of constructing a railway. On . 29th . February, 1916, we were detailed off for outpost for the following day. At 7.55 on 1st March, 1916, it was found that the railway working party was short, and we were picked to make up the number. The party had been issued with water before we joined them. After a march of 1 or 1½ miles in the broiling sun we reached the work, . and we were detailed off with a party under, a corporal to shovel sand on the line. We didn't start work, and the corporal asked us what was the matter, and we stated that we wanted a drink of water, and then we would start work. We were refused. We then asked the corporal for a drink out of his bottle, with same result. A sergeant was brought along, and he asked us what was the matter, and we stated that we wanted a drink of water, and then we would start work. An officer was then brought along, and he asked the same question as the sergeant, and got the same answer. At the court martial our characters were given as "very good," and 'we were sentenced to three years' penal servitude each. We were taken to 'Citadel 'Detention Barracks. We did six weeks there (four of which were spent in single cells). We have now done twelve weeks of our sentence. Hoping that you can receive for us a -remission of our sentence.

These sentences have already been published in the Australian <inline font-style="italic">Worker</inline> newspaper and in other organs. They are to a certain extent known throughout New South Wales, and they had a very material effect in causing the people to pause before they decided to force other men to go to the front to be dealt with in similar fashion for similar offences.

                    <para>Sir,-I, the . undersigned, beg . to appeal to you in regard to the severity of my sentence. On February 17th I was court martialled on the charge of disobeying &lt; an order and showing wilful defiance of authority and sentenced to two years', hard labour. This happened at Telelkebir Camp. after our return from the Peninsula. Previous to this offence I had nine months' service with an entirely clean record. Eight weeks of this time -was -spent on the Peninsula in the. firing line. . From the date of the evacuation . up till the date of this offence we were almost continually on -short rations of . food and water, and a full measure of work, which did not tend to sweeten our tempers. Therefore, on being addressed by a sergeant in a sharp manner first thing in the morning, gave him a hasty answer, with the above result. During my career as a soldier I have endeavoured to carry out my duties in a manly and soldierly manner, which fact was proved to the satisfaction of the officers constituting . my court martial. Trusting you will give this matter your earnest consideration, and take my previous record as an indication of my character. </para>

I only had been granted leave once since leaving Australia nine months before.

October, ' 1914, volunteered for active service, and embarked on 22nd December, 1914, arriving in Egypt a few weeks later, where we camped at Heliopolis.

                        <para class="block">I believe, 1,500, when we had to retire. I was also with my battalion in the big advance on 6th August, being in the ammunition column under Lieutenant McDonald. On this occasion I was mentioned in despatches for conspicuous service on the field - for carrying bombs and ammunition to the advancing troops on the 6th, 7th, and 8th August under heavy shell fire. I continued this work up to 26th August, when I was ordered to report to the Divisional Head-Quarters Staff, to take over acting sergeant-cook to General Godley and staff - being a cook by profession. I held this position until October, when I left the Peninsula (after being there from April to October without a rest) to rejoin my battalion, which at that time had already had five weeks' rest at Lemnos Island. </para>

                        <para>- Order ! As far as I have been able to follow the honorable senator, I think that he is quoting these letters for the second time. I believe that he quoted them before the suspension of the sitting for luncheon. Once is quite sufficient to quote them, and the honorable senator will not be in order in" reading them again. </para>

I wish now to put before the Senate another letter, in. reference to the case of No. 1729, Private John Jamieson, of the 20th Battalion, Australian Imperial Force. He is serving eighteen months' hard labour in Darlinghurst Gaol. He writes - </para>

                        <para>I enlisted on the 1st June, 1915, and was only in camp nineteen days when I stepped to the front and volunteered for active service. I embarked on the troopship <inline font-style="italic">Kanouma</inline> on the 19th June, and arrived a few weeks later. I wish to state I was only in Egypt on twenty-four hours when I again volunteered for the Peninsula, which I arrived in time for the Lone Pine charge, which I took part, being an ammunition carrier to the Glasgow Battery. I was doing this work until my battalion arrived two or three weeks later, when I joined and relieved the 8th and 10th Light Horse on Walker Ridge. I then stayed in the trenches for some considerable time, when I was chosen as a bomb thrower to the battalion. I did this work until the evacuation, when I was picked out as a bomb thrower for the rear guard, Russell's Top. </para>
                        <para>I also wish to say I sprained my ankle in the early part of the evening, and was ordered to leave my post by <inline font-weight="bold">Major Fitzgerald,</inline> who I asked a favour to stop to the last, which was granted to me. When we left Russell's Top we embarked for Lemnos Island, and then went through a severe training, and then embarked for Egypt, where we arrived a few days later, and went to Tel-el-Kebir for more training, and -then to Australia Hill, doing trench sapping and patrol duties, after which we marched 15 or 20 miles to Ismailia. I received a. new rifle with the battalion to go to France. Whilst at Moosco I went into the village with some more of my friends, and got native drink. When arriving back at the camp I was placed in the guard tent for being drunk. I was charged with being drunk and using insubordinate language to my superior officer, named Sergeant Holman. i was put back for a court martial, found guilty, and sentenced to eighteen months' hard labour, and taken, with others, to Abbassia Detention Barracks. I was there about fourteen days, and then taken hand-cuffed through the street of </para>
                        <para class="block">Cairo to Citadel Prison, and was confined in a small cell twenty-five days. </para>
                        <para>I was then taken on board the H.M.A.T. <inline font-style="italic">Seang-Bee</inline> for Australia. I wish to state that I was in the R.N.R. as a qualified seaman, and discharged with good testimonials. I ask of you to try and do your utmost for me and my comrades to be released, so that we may be able to go back to the front with our respective units at this critical moment when my country needs me. I wish to state, in conclusion, that I am a married man, with a wife and five children to support. I am also a member of the Trolley Draymen's Union. I was working up to the time of enlistment driving for W. McKeown, Glebe, for some considerable time. Trusting you will be successful on my behalf. I wish also to state that I have never got leave from the army since I joined twelve months ago. </para>

                        <para>I, Trooper William Waddell Miller, was arrested and placed below deck, and detained there, without any charge being formulated against me, for 48 hours. I was liberated, and told that nothing further would be heard of the matter. Alter landing at Anzac as a free man, carrying arms and equipment, some seven or eight hours after, I was informed by Sergeant P. Ryan that I was under arrest. That day I was taken before  Colonel Cox,  who read out a charge of disobeying a lawful command and insolence to my superior officer, which consisted of abusive language. The evidence in favour of the charge was laid by Lieutenant Buskin, -coupled with a written report by  Colonel O'Dowda,  Royal Dublin Fusiliers. </para>
                        <para>I pleaded " Not' guilty." Colonel Cox then said, "Will you be tried by- ? No, you'll have a court martial." The Adjutant then took the summary of evidence, Colonel Cox still remaining in the orderly-room, also a trooper not connected with the case. The Adjutant, in adjudicating on the case, put the following question to Lieutenant Buskin :  - "On what date, day, and what time of day was the crime committed?" Lieutenant Buskin looked confused, and could not answer until Colonel Cox rose and reached across the table for the evidence on the written report by Colonel O'Dowda, who was in the vicinity, and could have been present, thus rendering his evidence as invalid. A court martial was granted. At the court martial, held on the 3rd September, 1915, four more witnesses were produced who were not present at the summary, thus giving me no opportunity to cross-question them, and thus lay before the General both sides of the case before he granted the court martial. </para>

                        <para>Oh March 16th I was tried by court martial on the charges of insubordinate and threatening language to an officer, and striking another N.C.O., and sentenced to 12 months' hard labour. Previous to being tried, I applied to our Adjutant to be allowed out on open arrest to arrange my defence and obtain the services of a prisoner's friend, my request being refused; and, having been under the influence of some Egyptian concoction sold as whisky, was totally unaware of what had taken place. My first knowledge of anything having happened was on my awakening in the guard tent tied up. This happened at Ismailia Camp after our return from the desert.. Previous to this I have had a. clear record, only having been once before our Battalion Court for overstaying my leave by three hours in February, 1916. My company O.C. said this would not be recorded against me on account of previous good service. </para>
                        <para>I was on the. Peninsula for eighteen weeks, and for three months of this time I held the responsible position of Acting Post Sergeant-Major, administering the work and manning of our post right up till the evacuation. Also had the honour of being selected by our O.C. as the last man to leave the firing line on Walker's Ridge, having to cover the retreat of our party by subterfuge and close our line of retirement with barbed wire, being accompanied on this latter by Lieutenant, now Captain, Hosking: </para>
                        <para>Whilston duty in the firing line I suffered from the effect of concussion from shell fire twice, the last time, just four days before our evacuation, I was rendered deaf for twenty-four hours, and left subject to violent headaches. On the arrival of the rearguard at Lemnos Island we were paraded in front of General Godley and complimented on our work, our names being mentioned in despatches. From here we were drafted to Egypt, and sent out ten miles over the Suez Canal into the desert to one ceaseless round of hard work digging trenches in the sand on short rations, both of food and water. Whilst here I Was again complimented by our Brigade <inline font-weight="bold">Major for</inline> good work carried out at head-quarters. From here we were marched over to Ismailia Camp to reorganize for France, this being the first little bit of civilization we had seen since our departure for the Peninsula in August last year, just eight months. Taking into consideration my past services and steadiness as a non-commissioned officer (which position I held for ten months), I trust you will agree with me that, for a disciplinary offence committed at a time whilst I was not responsible for my actions, this sentence is unduly harsh. </para>

At 6 a.m., after having loaded tents and other material on to transport waggons, both companies were fallen in, in full marching order, consisting of full web equipment, containing 150 rounds of ammunition, valise containing underclothing, haversack containing two days' rations, full water bottle, and two blankets, and waterproof sheets strapped over all, also rifle. After standing in platoons for one hour the O.C. arrived on parade and granted the company permission to sit down. He then returned to the mess tent to have his breakfast. Returning half an hour later he again fell us in, and kept us standing for half an hour before moving off to entrain for Moaski. On arrival there' we were marched to the outskirts of Ismailia, where we halted for the first meal of that day. During this halt I found it necessary to retire, and as there was no latrine near at hand I had to go a couple of hundred yards to obtain privacy. On returning I found that the battalion had moved off, leaving a man (Private Hidden) in charge of my equipment and rifle. Soon afterwards another member of the company turned up, having been left behind also, and together the three of us resumed our march in the direction taken by the battalion. As my right foot was very painful from the long standing that morning, and had increased by having to stand during the entire threehours' train journey,it was decided to hire agharry, by which means we might catch up the battalion. After driving for some time we overtook the rear of the 18th Battalion, which was proceeding in the same direction. A staff officer stopped our gharry and told us to get out, which we did. We were than placed in Captain Hinton's charge, who detailed a corporal to bring us along. We caught up to the 18th, who at this time were resting at the roadside, and sat down with them. When they resumed the march we were ordered by Captain Hinton to fall in with them. I told Captain Hinton that I was unable to proceed as my right foot was then very bad. He then ordered the other two to join up, and Private Smith, who was under the influence of liquor, refused to proceed without me. Captain Hinton then asked for our names and numbers, which we gave; he entered them in his notebook, and I asked him to leave us, telling him that we would follow, as Private Smith was unaware of what he was doing or saying. He then left us, cautioning us to follow, and Smith shouted an obscene remark after him.I told Smith to stop, as Captain Hinton would only put the remark down in his book. We followed on slowly, meeting on our way Captain Peren, A.M.C., our medical officer. He asked us what was wrong, and I informed him that I was suffering from bad feet. He did not inspect my feet, but directed us to the camp at Ferry Post. On the following day we moved on and made our camp at Katoomba Post; I again having to fall out and follow slowly in the rear. After three days' trench digging and outpost duties I was sent for and brought before  Colonel Mackenzie,  who ordered my feet to be examined, which examination was carried out while standing in six inches of soft sand, making a satisfactory examination impossible. The  Colonel was  then informed that I was suffering from flat foot, but not sufficiently so to incapacitate me from service, and I was then remanded on two charges as follows :  - </para>

                    <para>I arrived in Egypt 2nd  February,  1915, where I went straight into camp with my battalion at Mena Camp, the Pyramids. The Brigadier of the brigade had us up for inspection, when he told us we were fit for the front. We embarked a week later for Lemnos Island, where we were practising to land from the ships' cutters. I landed with my battalion on the 25th April. I was there five months when the Suvla Bay landing was made. We had to have a charge at a place called Lone Pine to draw the Turks' attention from Suvla Bay. I went through the charge as a first class bomber. </para>
                    <para>On 13th September my brigade, that is, the 1st Brigade, went away to Lemnos Island for six weeks' spell. We were relieved by the 23rd and 24th Battalions. I was specially selected by my Commanding Officer, Captain  Loyd,  as a first class bomb-throwing instructor to the 23rd and 24th Battalions. I stopped with them a fortnight as an instructor. Corporal dudley also stopped behind; but, unfortunately, he was killed. When I went for a spell, I only had one month. </para>
                    <para>The battalion had an issue of beer and stout, and also drew £7 in two pays. I arrived two weeks later. I could not get any beer or stout, and it took me all my time to get £1. , </para>

It was here that I got my F.5.C.M., for stealing money and goods, the property of an officer. I was sentenced to twelve months' imprisonment with hard labour. It was reduced till further orders. In the meantime, I was sent back into the firing line. </para>
                    <para>The sole motive of the crime was I wanted to get my discharge. ' When I committed the crime I had £27 in my pocket.

                            <para>Sir,</para>
                            <para>I, No. 663, Private T. C. Smith, 19th Battalion, A.I.F., at present undergoing sentence of four years' penal servitude, now beg to place this - my case before your notice, and trust you will endeavour to get a remission of my sentence, and permission to rejoin my unit at the earliest opportunity. </para>
                            <para>After the battalion arriving in Egypt, after the evacuation, we were on the march from  Mocassar  Station to Stadium Camp, Ismailia, on the 24th January, 1916. We halted for lunch, some of us proceeding to town to obtain something to eat. Some drink was also introduced, and when we came back the company had moved on. We put on our equipment, and tried to pick the company up again. We hired a conveyance to take us on, as one of the party, Private Phillips, had a bad foot, and could not keep up with us. A staff officer, with the rank of major, ordered us out of the gharri, also instructing an N.C.O. of the 18th Battalion to take charge of us and hand us over to our unit. We joined up with the 18th Battalion. They were resting when we came up to them. It seems, sir, that after reaching the Stadium Camp we again started off for the Arabian Desert, and three days after arrival there I was charged with threatening my superior officer and abusive language. As to those charges, I am totally ignorant of their ever having been committed; as from the time I missed my own company at Ismailia, I was deep in the state of intoxication, and everything seems a blank to me up to the time I was brought before the officer commanding to stand my trial on those charges. </para>
                            <para>I must also state, sir, that there are two of my brothers at the front besides myself, and one of them severely wounded at the Palace Hospital, Cairo: that, coupled with the fact that I had, "though at a loss to state the date," been buried in the trench through the enemy's shell fire, causing loss of memory for the period of two months or more, must show that my constitution cannot be too strong, and where drink is introduced could be more easily overcome than one whose constitution was in a normal condition. </para>
                            <para>I have already completed four months of this sentence. I am but a youth of eighteen years, just budding into manhood, one who is  expected to keep up the traditions of his country as a peaceful and law-abiding citizen. Surely to guide a man into the right path there must be a kind and helping hand to assist a straggler from the path. Also consider the disgrace my sentence throws on the parents who brought me up, and have thus got the finger of disgrace pointed at them, though they themselves have done nothing to incur this punishment. I only ask, for their sake, as well as for the chance to return to the firing line and redeem my good name; and on this request being granted I will endeavour to show the world at large that I am well worthy of the chance. </para>

                <para class="block">So far as I know, this private is still in either Darlinghurst or some other gaol in New South Wales completing the balance of his sentence. It is difficult, of course, to state definitely, but, according to the evidence in my possession, the sentences imposed on these men were altogether too severe. Next, I wish to quote the case of Corporal J. A. Walker, who, with privates C. R. Yeadon, M. G. Alcock, E. J. King, A. G. Anderson, T. J. Rowland, P. Hill, and W. Fletcher, signed a joint request for the remission of their sentences - </para>

                    <para>We, the seven undersigned members of C Company, 19th Battalion, 5th Brigade, A.I.F., beg to draw your attention to our case, and to record an appeal against the severity and injustice of our sentences. The charges laid against us were - I., Joining in a meeting; II., Disobedience of an order. The circumstances being as follows: - </para>
                    <para>On Thursday, 3rd February, 1916, we arrived at Katoomba Post, about 4 p.m., after a 10-mile march across the desert carrying full equipment and ammunition. Shortly after our arrival we were issued with four and one-half biscuits per man, and were instructed that this was our bread allowance for four meals. By dinner time next day the bread allowance was finished, and our dinner consisted solely of a slice of bacon per man, a few lucky ones getting tea. The whole company, being dissatisfied, desired to make their complaint to the orderly officer of the day; but he did not come round the lines as was. customary. Next we asked our tent commander, Corporal Walker, to be paraded to the O.C., and he approached the company orderly sergeant, who refused to parade him. As all our efforts to make our complaint were futile, the whole company fell in on afternoon parade without packs, hoping by this means to draw our officers' attention to our grievance, and being quite willing to put our packs on afterwards. When our O.C. came on parade, instead of making inquiries, as we had hoped, he ordered the company to fall out and put their packs on. No one in the company complied with this order. He then addressed two men individually, and had them immediately arrested. Then our corporal was arrested, and although he tried to explain the company's behaviour, was immediately silenced. Following this, after much persuasion from all the officers in the company, the remainder fell out to put their packs on. Before going to put our packs on, five of us approached our O.C, <inline font-weight="bold">Major Norrie,</inline> and asked him if he would give the three men under arrest the same privilege that he had given the rest of us, namely, a second opportunity to put their packs on. He replied that the two privates could have another chance, but not the corporal. As we could not honorably leave the corporal to bear the entire blame of a matter in which the whole company was interested, we decided to share any censure that his action might entail, just as we and the rest of the company would have been willing to share any beneficial result of the protest. Consequently, we were placed in the guard tent, and, after a fortnight, were court martialled, and received the following sentences: - </para>

                    <para>No. 1017, Private Yeadon, C. E.,eighteen months' hard labour. </para>

                    <para>No. 854, Private Fletcher, W., (still in Egypt), twelve months' hard labour. </para>
                    <para>The above eight men have all served with the battalion from its landing on Gallipoli, in August, until the final evacuation, and, with the exception of two cases of overstaying leave, we have all got clean records from the time of our enlistment until 4th February, 1916. Two of the above were selected to stay on duty on Gallipoli until the post was finally abandoned. We beg to state that evidence of the same import as this statement was given on oath at our court martial, and that evidence as to character was given to the entire satisfaction of the  President  of the Court by various officers and N.C.O.'s of our company. It was also stated by our O.C. that he would have no hesitation in picking any one of the eight for- any special ob responsible- duty, and that several oft us had for- nine - weeks, prior to the evacuation, of Anzac, been, on outpost, nightly without any relief, which; he considered', was sufficient proof of our reliability. </para>

If my memory serves me aright, I think I saw that an- officer of' the Defence <inline font-style="italic">D&amp;partment</inline> - or- perhaps it. was the Minister himself - had made a statement in the press to the effect that some consideration should be given to Australian soldiers, because, possessing a great deal of initiative, they were easy to- lead, but difficult to drive. It must be remembered that these men- bad not been trained for military duties at all, and had not. been accustomed . to discipline. Many of them- had spent their lives in. -the- bush; and, although some had been in employment, a great number had been working for themselves, and, therefore, had always been accustomed to absolute freedom of. action. When they heard the. call of the Empire, they responded. willingly, only,- however, to- find themselves surrounded by a mass of military regulations, of which they ' had had no previous knowledge. It is not to be wondered at, therefore, that many of them, perhaps under influence of drink of a doubtful character, supplied to them in Cairo, disobeyed some of the military regulations. Due allowance ought to be made for this fact, and the Minister for Defence and his Department ought not to have allowed these matters to stand over all these months. So far as I . know, no reply has yet been received by the Department, and so I. feel it necessary to place the matter before the Senate. I do not like doing this at all, because it would -be much more, satisfactory if the men could be released, and. given an opportunity to rejoin their regiments without delay. I should .be glad to ber appointed as a judge -in cases of this kind, because then - most . of the men charged. with these offences. would receive permission, in . the near., future to rejoin their regiments. I agree that discipline must be maintained, but there are various ways : of . achieving that object, and we should bear in mind that Australian soldiers, unlike the soldiers of other countries, so- we. are told, cannot ber driven,. Having . said that,' I hope that, for the sake of recruiting in . the  near : future/ the Minister of Defence will cable again- and again for information regarding offences which these men have committed, and that, if he cannot get any further particulars, he will appoint a Commission here to take into consideration all the facts, and deal with the men in a commonsense way. If he does that, his action will have a beneficial effect on the men, and no  in-jury whatever will be ' done to. the community; while, on the other hand, recruiting will be greatly stimulated throughout the whole of the Commonwealth. I do not deny; nor do I wish to disguise the fact, that the position which confronted us in August; 1914, has still to be faced. It demands all the intelligence, and ability which we can bring to bear upon it. With all due deference to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley,</inline> Germany is not yet beaten. It is-true-.that, on the western front, for  months past the Allied forces have- been slowly - pushing the German forces backwards., and I have- no doubt they will continue to do so until their, object is  achieved ; but, on the- eastern front, there has been-.-an absence of news  for some months, because the censors have been at" work there, especially in the northern section, and we cannot speak with any certainty regarding the position. Germany overran Servia. Happily part' of that country has been recovered from the enemy; but we learn from day to day that the enemy is overrunning a large part' of Roumania, with disastrous results to the people of that country.. We do not know where the Germans may strike the next blow. All the stories we have heard : about the scarcity of food in Germany must be taken with a grain of salt. Indeed, I believe they may be discarded altogether. I, for one, do not believe them. I believe that Germany has not only plenty of men willing enough to fight for their country, but plenty of munitions, and plenty of food. It would appear, also, that Great Britain does not expect the war to end in the near future; The preparations being made in the Mother Country to carry on the conflict indicate that Great Britain expects the war to last, probably for many years yet. I am satisfied that the Allies are getting stronger and stronger as the days go by, and that, ultimately!, victory will be ours. We regret, of course, that, Greece having thrown in her lot with the Central Powers, the position in the near East, is not at all satisfactory to-day. It is the duty of this Government to render all the assistance possible to Great Britain and her Allies in this crisis ; but they must realize, once and for all, that the people of Australia will not submit to conscription. That issue, I take it, may be regarded as settled. In view of ' the preparations in Great Britain for a prolonged struggle, we must be prepared to play -our part in this war for a good' number of years to come. I am not able to see the end of it. I know that the Germans are a stubborn and tenacious people, and, as they believe they are fighting. for the right, they will continue for a long time. We are built in much the same  way-, and are not disposed even to consider . the possibility of giving in. The Commonwealth Government have yet an  opportunity  of securing all the men that: Australia, can offer in this conflict: Some people -may not be disposed 'to assist the' Government in- this direction, but I, for.' one, do not adopt that attitude. Any assistance I can render under, the voluntary system will be willingly given. It is work which no man: who .is not going; to the front himself would care about doing, but I think that every man who can help in this way should be prepared, at public meetings or elsewhere, to place the true facts before his fellow citizens, in order that they may agree as to the best course to be adopted. I should like to say that this is not work which should fall exclusively to the parliamentarian. It may be true, as I have been told, that parliamentarians, being accustomed to speak, are better fitted to place the position clearly before the people than are those who have not their practice in speaking. But ' I still say that the business men of this country, and others vitally interested in its welfare, should be compelled to take their part in this movement. The land-owners of the country should be called upon to take their part. </para>

The Government have presented a financial statement, and I regret very much that in it they have not shown any intention to raise some of the necessary revenue for the payment of expenses in connexion with the war from those who own the land of this country. </para>

                            <para>- The total of £446,000,000 is, I understand, a complete estimate, but it is doubtful whether the owners of the country would be prepared to sell their estates at even that amount. We shall have an opportunity, I hope, in the course of a few days, to deal with this matter, and I trust that we shall call upon the .Government to abandon such trivial proposals as the taxing to the extent of Id. a 6d. ticket for a picture show. A policy of taxation of that kind is quite unworthy even of the present Government. I hope they will see their way to abandon it. I have spoken at some length, and have placed the cases of a number of men before the Government and the Senate. I do not like this kind of work, but the men to whom I have referred are in gaol, and many of them would be only too pleased if given the opportunity to rejoin their regiments. I am satisfied that if the Government were to remit a very large proportion of their sentences, whilst no harm would be done to. any one, much would be done to secure the success of the recruiting campaign which is just about to be started. We have no evidence at present before us to enable us to say when the war will be brought to a conclusion. We cannot, in my opinion, obtain 16,500' men per month. I do not believe that Australia can supply that number of men, even though we should take married men, in the course of the next few months. I believe, however, that we are in a position to keep up reinforcements so as to maintain the five divisions that are at the front. </para>

                            <para>- Men going from Australia now can be used to reconstitute the fifth division. I wish to say that those who voted as I did, and worked very strenuously as I did in support of the no-conscription campaign, are as loyal to Australia as any conscriptionists know how to be. We are prepared to give the Government all the assistance we can, whether in the way of imposing taxation, or in any other way -that may be suggested. We shall have an opportunity during the next few months to assist the Government in the matter of recruiting, and I, for one, will be prepared to give them all the assistance I can in that direction, whatever -other members of the party to which I belong may be prepared to do. My con-  science tells me that the 'men at the front must be reinforced. We have never objected to reinforcements being sent. I wish to make that perfectly clear. Those who accuse us of doing so know that they accuse us wrongfully. What we objected to, and will continue to object to, is the sending of men to the front by compulsion. We must in any  case face the position with which we are -confronted, and I hope that the Government will do nothing to prevent a full and free flow of troops to the standard. I repeat that the remission, or a substantial reduction, of the sentences -that have been passed upon the men to whom I have referred to-day would be of the greatest value to the recruiting movement now proposed, and I trust that the Government will favorably entertain the views I have expressed on the matter. </para>

                        <para>.- We have, in the statement presented to the Senate by the Federal Government, an intimation that they intend to pursue a  " bold and unfaltering policy " in the conduct of the war. Such a policy will meet with the approbation of every honorable senator on this side. However, during the continuance of the present debate we have had some indication of what the bold -and unfaltering policy of the Government -is to be, particularly with respect to one important feature in the conduct of the war. The policy of the Government is bold, unfaltering, and determined, so far as man power is concerned, but it stops dead and short there. When we come to the question of finance to provide the sinews of war, we find that this bold and unfaltering Government have already proposed a modification of the scheme submitted by the last Government for the taxation of those who hold the wealth of the' country, and who, while they stay at home, should be called upon to do their share 1 towards the successful prosecution of the war. If it is the policy of the Government to reduce the taxation proposed upon those who have made huge war profits from 100 per cent, to 75 per cent., there is nothing very bold or unfaltering about that. If it is the policy of the Government not to tax war bonds, and to spread the wealth levy for the Repatriation Fund over a period of five years, in order to placate a section of their supporters, it looks as if they were determined to remain on the Treasury bench by making any concession that their Liberal party supporters may ask for. We shall have the financial policy of the Government before the Senate later, and will be able to refer to it in detail. As announced, however, it should be an indication to the people that the Government intend to retain office by the sacrifice of the principles which they asserted previously. </para>

                    <para>So far as the party on this side is concerned, we remain the same as we were prior to the recent lamentable split. We have the same principles and the same platform. It has not been amended, nothing has been deleted from it, and we have entirely the same organization, the same procedure, and the same rules of conduct. Nothing that has been done, by any one connected with the Labour movement has in the slightest degree altered our methods. The reason we find ourselves in opposition is because we have been true to the pledges we made to the people who sent us into this Parliament. We elected to sacrifice whatever emoluments we might have been receiving for the sake of our principles, and to remain true to the cardinal principles on which we were returned to power originally. It is because those principles were abrogated and torn up by the Leader of the present </para>
                    <para>Government that we find ourselves in our present position to-day. </para>

My attitude  at the meeting depended entirely upon what the Prime Minister did. He took the stand that he would not submit to his party. He left the meeting, andSenator Pearce and others left with him. </para>

If, in Australia, we are going to abandon our principles of Democracy, and substitute an Autocracy, the sooner <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Story</inline> frankly acknowledges the fact the better. All these remarks about secret juntas and outside organizations come ill from men who for many years sat in those secret juntas and were parties to their creation. Let me ask <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Story,</inline> "Is not his party a secret junta?" Does it admit the press to its meetings? Can anybody hear its debates? Is not the Cabinet a secret junta? Did not honorable members in another place take serious objection to the fact that a Minister revealed that certain regulations were put before a meeting of the Executive Council? At the meeting which took place in Sydney at which those regulations were approved, three Ministers only were present. </para>

                    <para>SenatorREADY. - There may have been only two Ministers at that meeting, and one of them journeyed to Sydney for the express purpose of being present. At that little secret junta these objectionable regulations were approved, and I am proud to think that my leader in this Chamber, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner,</inline> resigned his position as a Minister rather than submit to them. I shall expect the next time <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Story's</inline> party meets, a general invitation to be issued to the press to come along and take notes of it. I will guarantee that they would prove interesting reading at the present juncture, and I would not mind being the reporter. </para>
                    <para>As my leader has stated, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> attempted to impose his opinions and his will on the members of his party. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> has been a veritable political " humptydumpty." He has had a very great fall indeed, . and many persons, while recognising his great abilities, also recognise that this political "humpty-dumpty'.' is a man in whom they can no longer put their trust, and especially when they sec the Ministry hanging on to the Treasury bench dependent for their existence upon the party whose principles' are absolutely antagonistic to their own. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes'</inline> methods were probably never equalled by any leader in Australian history. He abused his position. He libelled and denounced even his own followers. He slandered and reviled all those who were opposed to him. He gagged and insulted his own Ministers, he stifled free speech, and used the whole of the governmental machinery of Australia, Federal, State and municipal, for a pernicious party propaganda for his own side on the referendum question. For these' reasons we elected to get out into the cold shades of opposition and to trust our fate entirely to the electors. As far as I am concerned, I will do nothing to hinder an appeal to the people who created this Parliament, because I feel sure that the only authority which will effectually determine this political crisis will be the electors of Australia through the medium of the ballot-box. </para>
                    <para>A point has arisen in regard to the now famous regulations, which I have not heard mentioned by any previous  speaker,  and which I would like to bring under the notice of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce.</inline> I have no need to recall <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes'</inline> attitude towards these regulations, and his manner of introducing them. There is no doubt that they would have been used on polling-day but for my leader in this Senate. Australia owes a debt of gratitude to him, to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Higgs,</inline> and to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Russell</inline> for the action which they took. In looking up the Electoral Act I find that there are very stringent penalties imposed for electoral offences. In order that we may insure that the ballot shall be kept absolutely pure, certain sections provide that any breach of the law, or any attempt to unduly influence votes in any one direction, is punishable by heavy penalties. The sections of the Act dealing with this matter are very clear. In Part XV. I find that section 177 provides - </para>
