                        <para>- The British Government have discontinued the practice of indicating the locality in which casualties take place, both as regards their own Forces and the Forces of the Dominions. I think the honorable senator will find, on looking through the casualty lists referred to, that there is a date placed opposite each casualty which will serve to indicate where it took place. </para>

                        <para>- I have seen the statement referred to. In my opinion, the effect of any statement upon public opinion may be gauged by the source from which it emanates. Holding that view, I do not think that a statement coming from such a source as that indicated in the report quoted is likely to cause any perturbation in the public mind. </para>

                        <para>. - I have looked carefully through this Bill, and also through the principal Act which it is proposed to amend. It is the duty of honorable senators to conserve, as far as they possibly can, the functions of Parliament. One of those functions - and the principal one - is that of legislation. But by virtue of certain provisions which are appended to Bills, we frequently find that our powers of legislation have passed into the hands of Departments, or of officials in Departments. To my mind, the two sections of the Rules Publication Act of 1903 which it is proposed to repeal have hitherto largely safeguarded the functions of Parliament. We are now invited by a single  stroke of the pen to excise these provisions, and to forfeit much more than appears on the surface. Paragraph 3 of section 3 of the principal Act provides - </para>

                    <para class="block">I ask honorable senators not to consent to hand over indiscriminately to the heads of Departments powers so vast and far-reaching. Only yesterday, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley</inline> called attention to the voluminous character of the statutory rules and regulations which are being printed from time to time, and requested that, on account of their bulk, they might be bound up quarterly. In these troublous times there may be occasions on which it may be imperative for the Defence Department, for example, to act immediately. In such circumstances I have no objection to it acting under statutory rules. But this Bill covers all cases, and will really have the effect of transferring from Parliament, and vesting in the head of a Department, the power to make laws. I have every confidence that the present Government will do what is right. But Ministers come and go, and if we consent to this proposal now the principle which we sanction may eventually be used against us in a very determined way. Of course, it will probably be argued that when Parliament meets any honorable senator will be at liberty to take exception to any rules to which he may object. That is a very easy way of locking the stable door after the steed has been stolen. But it is much easier to conserve our privileges now than it will be to regain possession of them when once we have parted with them. I view with very great apprehension the proposal to hand over to the heads of Departments the functions of Parliament. </para>

                        (New South Wales - Vice-President of the Executive has put it, there were any intention to deprive honorable senators of the control which they now exercise over regulations, I would join him in his protest. But I would point out that this Bill is based on the experience of fifteen years. When the principal Act was passed, a provision was inserted in it requiring that sixty days' notice should be given of any proposal to make statutory rules, with a view to adequately protecting the public. During that period of sixty days it is open to any member of the public who is interested to take exception to any rule. Yet in the whole course of fifteen years not a single exception to any proposed statutory rule has been lodged. In this Bill we propose to adopt a system which represents a sort of mean between the urgency system that is now in existence and the old and slower method under which there was double printing and double trouble. The measure is merely a machinery measure, and the right of honorable senators to veto any rule or regulation will still exist. We merely propose to adopt  a  simpler method than the existing one. - an improved method based upon fifteen years' experience of the working of the principal Act.

                <para class="block">In this Bill, it is proposed to effect amendments in two Acts - the Acts Interpretation Act of 1901 and the Acts Interpretation Act of 1904. The Act of 1904, although to be construed with the Act of 1901, is not an amendment of the prior Act. Clause 2 of this Bill, which amends the 1901 Act, and clause 4, which amends the 1904 Act, will' have the effect of doing away with certain repetitions in the wording of Acts and regulations. The new section 10a proposed to be inserted in the 1901 Act provides that references in any Act to another Act shall, if that other Act is afterwards amended, be deemed to be a reference to that Act as so amended. The new section 11 embodies provisions which are usually repeated in regulations which repeal other regulations. This section.  will obviate the necessity of repeating in "repeal regulations," the words which continue rights, privileges, obligations, and liabilities acquired, accrued, or incurred under regulations which are being repealed. The section will insure the continuance of investigations and legal proceedings commenced under regulations prior to their repeal, and that penalties and punishments inflicted for offences against such regulations are not affected by such repeal. The purpose of the amendment of section 2 of the Act of 1904 is to bring the provisions of Acts, passed prior to the Acts Interpretation Act 1904, into line with subsequent Acts in respect of the notification of regulations in the <inline font-style="italic">Gazette,</inline> the date of their commencement, and their presentation to Parliament. It is merely a technical alteration simplifying our procedure for the repealing of Acts. </para>

                    <para>The measure is a very simple one, and as there are two similar Bills to follow in which the same principle is involved, it is my intention to make my remarks on this Bill apply also to them. For administrative purposes Australia has been divided into States, but it has been found that this arrangement does not always work satisfactorily in regard to the administration of the Post and Telegraph Department, the Customs Department, and the Public Service. As an illustration, I may point out that the  Deputy  Postmaster-General of New South Wales controls his Department from Sydney, and at present whenever it is necessary to transfer an official from any part of New South Wales to say, Broken Hill, his expenses have to be paid through Victoria and South Australia to the latter place. It is the desire of the Government to make for more economic working of the departments referred to, and in the case of the Bill now under consideration, to enable the Postmaster-General of South Australia to transfer an official from the South Australian service to Broken Hill, thus saving the Department considerable expenditure. The same system will be followed by the Customs Department and the Public Service. Under this Bill the  Deputy  Postmaster-General of South Australia will control Broken Hill, thus making it possible to save something like one-fourth of the expenditure at present incurred by sending officials all the way from New South Wales to Broken Hill whenever a transfer is authorized. The same principle of administration will be applied in the different States where it may be found to be necessary. </para>

                        <para>. - From the Minister's remarks I gather that the purpose of this Bill is to effect economy in the management of the respective Departments named, for it does seem a waste of money, when transfers are being effected, to send a man from New South Wales to such a distant part of the State as Broken Hill, when the same purpose could be effected by having a transfer from the Department under control of the South Australian Deputy Postmaster-General. What I am for the moment concerned about is as to whether it is the intention of the Government to clothe officials in the Adelaide Post Office with authority to transfer a man from the Adelaide office to Broken Hill instead of formally getting the approval of the Public Service Commissioner for transfer from the New South Wales Department to Broken Hill, and whether this suggested alteration in the interests of economy will interfere in any way with the promotion of men who may not happen to be in proximity to an office where a vacancy occurs. </para>

Adelaide and one in Sydney, and a position at Broken Hill was vacant, preference would be given to the man in Adelaide, but if the Sydney man was senior his rights would be preserved. There would only be odd cases of that sort. </para>

                        <para>.- The Federal Territory is administered by the  Deputy  Postmaster-General, Sydney, for postal purposes, and will doubtless continue to be so until Yass-Canberra becomes a big enough centre to justify a change. An instance of what the Bill aims at is furnished by the position of Deniliquin, the only rail communication with which is from Victoria. In the circumstances it is foolish to have Deniliquin administered for postal purposes by the  Deputy  Postmaster-General,New South Wales. </para>

                    <para>. - I take advantage of this opportunity to bring under the notice of the Government, through the Minister of Defence, a matter of some importance to persons travelling frequently to Melbourne from other States. Owing to the conditions due to the war, vessel desiring to enter Port Phillip Heads must first obtain permission to do so. An examination boat is stationed outside the Heads, and all! steamers desiring to enter the port have to obtain the necessary permission from the examination officer. I do not wish to. question the necessity for such a restriction or, so far as ships generally entering the Heads are concerned, the manner in which it is imposed. But I wish to ask whether one or two irritating results of the restriction might not be removed. For instance, boats regularly engaged in trading between Tasmania and the mainland, and well known to the officer commanding; the forts at the Heads, and to the officer in charge of the examination boat, have, on more than one occasion, been held up and" delayed outside the Heads. In one case the delay extended for nearly an hour. Delay occurred to the <inline font-style="italic">Oonah,</inline> on which I travelled the last time I came from Tasmania to Melbourne. We had had a good passage across, and on nearing the Heads we found that the examination boat was several miles out interrogating a schooner that was about to enter the port. We had to toss about outside, aimlessly waiting to secure permission from the examination officer to enter the Heads. The <inline font-style="italic">Oonah .</inline> is one of the best known traders between Tasmania and the mainland, and because the examination boat was six or seven miles out from the Heads, the passengers on the <inline font-style="italic">Oonah,</inline> who wore not feeling too well after their trip, were tossed about while waiting for what was merely a routine permission by the examination officer. I ask whether, in the case of steamers frequently trading in and out of the port, and perfectly well known to the officer in command of the forts and to the examination officer, some arrangement could not be made by signalling between the officer in charge of the fort and the examination boat to permit such vessels to promptly enter the Heads. Delay in the case of such vessels does not appear to be necessary, and that such delays may in the future be obviated is my reason for bringing the matter before the Minister. </para>

                    <para>.- The inconvenience referred to by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ready</inline> is one which I know has caused some little friction. I think it should he possible, in the case of boats that are so well known as these regular traders must be, for some system of signalling to be arranged which would obviate unnecessary delay. I shall bring the matter under the notice of the Minister for the Navy with that object in view. </para>
