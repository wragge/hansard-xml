                                <para>- I have noticed that heading. I am not prepared to say whether it is within the power of any private or public body to use such a form in the issue of a circular. I shall have that question investigated. But I remind the honorable senator again that, according to the wording of the circular, it is only an invitation, and not a command. </para>

                        <para>- Consideration was given to the question of exempting the clerical employees of banking institutions. It was represented that it would not be easy to fill the places of some of the clerical employees in private banking institutions, and also in the Commonwealth Bank. They were therefore exempted from enlistment. A similar course was adopted in respect of the employees in a number of other institutions. </para>

                            <para>- I am going to tell honorable senators. They were industries supplying equipment for the Defence Department. In the case of some  industries, such as the woollen mills, where the whole of the output was taken by the Government, the whole of the employees were exempted from enlistment; In other cases, where mining companies or smelting companies were supplying Great Britain and the Allied nations with material for munitions, the whole of their employees were exempted from enlistment. All these questions of exemption will, when the new regulations for compulsory military service are issued, be remitted to the Courts that will have to deal with exemptions. </para>

                        <para>- Matters in connexion with the proposed Commission have been in abeyance pending the return of the Prime Minister from England. As the honorable senator knows, the Prime Minister has been fairly busy since his return, and has not had an opportunity of dealing with that question. As soon as circumstances permit, he will give attention to the matter mentioned by the honorable senator. </para>

                    <para>The object of the measure is to allow the Attorney-General to delegate certain powers to a Solicitor-General, who has already been appointed. Certain powers that could be conferred upon him under regulation have already been so conferred, but certain other statutory powers belonging to the Attorney-General cannot&#39; be conferred upon the Solicitor-General except by the passage of an Act. In conferring powers on the Solicitor-General, the Attorney-General will not divest himself of any power. He will merely delegate to the Solicitor-General authority to do certain things, and resume that authority at his discretion. </para>

The ability of the appointee is beyond question, but the proposal is an altogether new departure, and is not upon proper lines. The position of Solicitor-General is usually regarded as political. The man filling the office is a member of Parliament. He is placed in charge of an important Department and is responsible to Parliament, and can be brought to account in Parliament if anything is done of which Parliament disapproves. Our Solicitor-General will not have a seat in Parliament, and cannot be brought to book by Parliament for anything he does. </para>

We want to deal directly with the man in charge. The Senate ought to throw the Bill out. If the Government find it desirable to appoint a Solicitor-General in addition to the Attorney-General, let them do so in the ordinary  way, and  appoint a member of Parliament to the position, so that he may be responsible to Parliament. </para>

                        <para>. - I agree to a great extent with the arguments adduced by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart.</inline> Probably we are establishing a dangerous precedent, but, on reading the Bill carefully, I find that Parliament is not giving away any of its privileges or authority. Sub-clause (2) of clause 2, provides that the &#34; Solicitor-General shall have such duties and functions as are prescribed by or under any Act or as are delegated to him by the Attorney-General in pursuance of this Act.&#34; Therefore, in supporting the second reading of this Bill, as I intend to do, we shall not be approving of the appointment to this position of a man who is not responsible to Parliament. The Attorney-General is responsible to Parliament, and no powers can be delegated to the Solicitor-General without his consent, and all such powers may be the subject of review by this Parliament. Parliament, therefore, is not being asked to divest itself of any of its powers. Whilst it is extremely unfortunate that . we have not amongst the members of our party in this Chamber a legal luminary who could act as Solicitor-General and be appointed a member of the Cabinet, I consider that the Senate will be quite safe in agreeing to the Bill, inasmuch as the Attorney-General will still be the responsible head of his Department. </para>

                            <para>- The Postmaster-General has authority to delegate certain powers to the permanent head of his Department. The same remark is applicable to the Minister for Trade and Customs. I would further point out that in Canada, New South . Wales, Tasmania, and New Zealand, the Solicitor-General is not a member of Parliament. Under this Bill it is merely proposed to authorize the Attorney-General to delegate power to the Solicitor-General to undertake certain work for which the Attorney-General will assume responsibility. The Attorney-General will thus be relieved of much of the drudgery of official life. </para>

                        <para>- Yes ; but I believe the Government are quite right in discriminating. The proclamation will be issued on that day, so I understand, and I was anxious to know if the provisions of the Defence Act were to be complied with, namely, that Parliament itself should hear the reasons for the issue of the proclamation. Now, in reply to my question, the Minister informed me that Parliament would be &#34; sitting.&#34; I have been told that if this Parliament were to adjourn to-night, and its members returned to. their different States, Parliament would still be &#34; sitting.&#34; I do not know whether that is the true interpretation of the Act, but for the information of the Senate I will read section 46 of the Defence Act 1903-1915.

                <para class="block">That section is mandatory, and says quite clearly that if Parliament is not sitting when the proclamation is issued it &#34; shall &#34; be summoned to meet within ten days. I should like to hear what the Minister has to say on this point. This afternoon he said that Parliament would be &#34; sitting.&#34; If by that he meant that this Parliament would be assembled in this building some time next week, then Parliament could hear the reasons why the proclamation was issued; but if Parliament is not sitting within this building after the 2nd October, will the Governor-General, in accordance with the provisions of the Defence Act, summon Parliament to assemble to hear the reasons for the issue of the proclamation? I want an interpretation of that word &#34;sitting.&#34; I have been&#39; told that even if we adjourn for six months, so long as Parliament is not prorogued, it will still be &#34; sitting.&#34; It would be as well to have an understanding in this matter, because other senators, like myself, are in doubt. To my mind, there can be only one interpretation, namely, that if Parliament is not sitting, it should be summoned within ten days after the issue of the proclamation to hear the reasons. The Minister did not reply to the second portion of my question, which was to the following effect: - &#34;If not, under what authority is it intended to validate such proclamation?&#34; I want to know if the Government have any power other than those under the Defence Act, which I have quoted, to validate the proclamation. If they have no other power, then, in my opinion, Parliament should be here assembled to hear the reasons. </para>

                    <para>. - It is with some reluctance that, on the motion for the adjournment of the Senate, I refer again to the censorship, but it is of supreme importance just now, when we are about to begin this great campaign on conscription, that we should have some definite understanding as to where we stand. We have been assured over and over again by the Government that we are going to get a fair deal in the campaign, but notwithstanding all these promises, I fear that the men who are going to fight against conscription will be hopelessly handicapped. If it is going to be a fair fight, the same latitude should be extended to both sides; but from what I have already learned it appears to be very unlikely that this will be the experience. The following communication, which I have received from the Acting Secretary to the Minister for Defence, makes it abundantly clear to me that we will not get fair treatment :  - </para>

                            <para>- I am afraid that the censor would think it was. If this censorship had been in vogue in Great Britain during the Prime Minister&#39;s visit, most of his speeches would have been suppressed, because they were the strongest indictment it was possible to have regarding the policy of the Allies in this war. Right from the start he condemned their vacillation, hesitation, and indecision. Why should any man in the Common- &#39; wealth be denied that freedom of speech which is permitted in Great Britain? If we are going to have a fair fight, some of these restrictions should be removed. At present it is not permissible to say that conscription has operated unjustly in Russia, or to speak of the disadvantages of conscription in France or in any other country fighting on the side of the Allies. Take next paragraph (c) - </para>

                    <para class="block">What chance have we under that instruction ? Under the War Precautions Act the Government can make any regulations they think fit. That point was decisively settled by the High Court, which laid it down that the Government are to be the sole judges in that matter. Therefore, -during this campaign, in addition to the restrictive regulations that already exist under the Act, they can bring in regulations that will absolutely prohibit a man from having a fair say. The very fact that every man who is against conscription in this fight is subject to the War Precautions Act, and the regulations made thereunder, puts us in a tight corner throughout the piece. Therefore, according to the latest instructions, bearing date 22nd September, I submit that we are not going to have a fair deal. This paragraph follows - </para>

                    <para>What is the inference? That the censorship is to be rigorously restrictive if &#39; the statements are not capable of easy contradiction, explanation, or disproof. If the intention is to the contrary, why should the censor discriminate between statements which are easy of contradiction, explanation, or disproof, and those which are not? The very fact that that instruction is there shows that these gentlemen are out to handicap in every possible way the men who are going to fight this great issue. Even since that notification was sent to me the censor himself has violated the instructions contained in it, in his treatment of a pamphlet headed, &#34; War Precautions Act and a Proposed Amendment,&#34; and issued under the signature of F. J. Riley, secretary of the Australian Peace Alliance. Whatever the opinions of those people may be, the spirit of the instructions laid down by the censor should be observed, but it has not been observed in this case.

                <para>Under this regulation the premises of the Australian Peace Alliance were raided and searched by two officers, and thousands of copies of two leaflets were seized and taken. They are detained now, and the military authorities refuse to return them, or to give any information concerning them. One leaflet is by the well-known writer, John A. Hobson, and was published in England in <inline font-style="italic">The Nation,</inline> and in Victoria, presumably with the censor&#39;s permission. It is a striking article - it deals with the question of peace - but the military gay the people shall not see it. The other deals also with peace, and was published in the <inline font-style="italic">Labour Leader.</inline> It is called &#34; Women and children first.&#34; But our military authorities will not allow it to be distributed here, and the public are at their mercy. </para>
                <para>The Socialist party&#39;s premises have been raided and searched; so, too, have those of the No-Conscription Fellowship. Printed matter was seized, and its fate is unknown. Ross, of the Socialist party, was accosted in the street, and threatened with a personal search there and. then; and they have the power to do this to any man (see regulation 50b) on the merest suspicion. Lastly, but by no means leastly, the Trades Hall, Melbourne, was raided at midnight, and a carefully-prepared and moderate report of the Trades Union Congress on conscription seized, and later the premises of the <inline font-style="italic">Labour Call</inline> were visited, and copies seized there, as well as the set-up type. The entire number of <inline font-style="italic">The Socialist</inline> of August 4 was seized and confiscated. </para>
                <para class="block">I appeal to the sense of justice of honorable senators, no matter what their opinions on this great issue may be, whether that paragraph should have been censored. It is not because I consider it very important, but, if the censor deletes such matter, how will he behave during the campaign, when Parliament is not sitting, and there is no appeal beyond his decision, because, when Parliament is not meeting, it is an absolute fact that, in the matter of censorship, there is no appeal beyond the censor, and we can get no redress? I am not going to guarantee the facts as set out in the above paragraph. I do not know whether they are right or wrong, but that is a statement of the case by a gentleman who signs his name, and no censor has a right, according to the instructions I have read, to censor it. It may be an indictment of the Government, but that is for the Government to defend. If we are to have a free press, no Government should object to any statement, however obnoxious to themselves. So long as it does not involve the safety of the nation in this time of war, it should not be suppressed, and I cannot understand how any censor, if he is acting on his own initiative, can say that there is anything in that paragraph to which exception can be taken. He may differ from the statement of the facts, but even if the facts are wrong, that is no justification for his censoring it. </para>

                        <para>- That is the. main point. So long as it is not seditious or disloyal, and does not involve the safety of the nation, no one has the right to interfere with it, for it does not come within the scope of the instructions issued this week. Here is another instance. Again I am not responsible for the facts stated. I merely read them to show that they are suppressed, and to claim that they should not be suppressed, whether they are right or wrong, so long as they do not involve the safety of the realm, and are not disloyal or seditious. This is a letter signed by R. S. Ross, secretary of the Socialist party, criticising the censor. It is censored because he dares to criticise the action of the censor.&#39; If the Minister is prepared to justify what was done in this case, then, when I go on the platform and criticise the censor, as I may be called upon to do, in quite an impersonal manner, my utterances also will be suppressed. I tell the Minister now that if my matter is censored, I shall claim the right to criticise the censor who does it. </para>

                    <para class="block">The last sentence has been excised by the. censor. I agree with <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Ross</inline> that the remedy is worse than the disease. But notwithstanding that that opinion may be shared by hundreds of thousands of persons within the Commonwealth, this military dictator, re&#39;gardless of the welfare of the country, can suppress all that we say. These matters may be more or less unimportant, but&#34; a straw shows how the wind blows.&#34; The samples of the censorship to which I have directed attention are a clear indication of how anti-conscriptionists will be treated during the coming fight. Before the ink was dry upon the promise made by the Prime Minister that we should be given a fair opportunity of stating our case, it was practically repudiated by the censor. Upon a previous occasion I said that the anti-conscriptionists would not receive a fair deal during the forthcoming campaign, and that they would enter it in much the same way as a man armed with a bayonet would enter upon a fight with a man who was armed with a modern rifle. The conscriptionists will not allow our arguments to reach the public. I consider it a damned shame for <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> to tell us that we shall have a fair field and then for the censor to tie our hands in the way that they are being tied. Personally, I do not care either for <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes,</inline> the censor, or anybody else. I intend to express my views, and the stricter the censorship becomes the bolder will be my expression of them. </para>

                            <para>- When the cases which the honorable senator quoted are investigated, it will be found that they are all a criticism of the censor for some act which he has committed in the past, under instructions. Each of those paragraphs is a. criticism of the censor for. something which he has done previously. This question arose very early in the history of the censorship. In the early stages of the war certain things were prohibited under the censorship regulations. The ingenious pressman at once endeavoured  to get  round that prohibition by starting to criticise the stupidity of the censorship, and in order to prove that the censor was stupid he quoted* the article which the censor had previously struck out, and appealed to the public . to say whether it ought to have been struck out. Obviously something had to be done to stop that sort of thing, otherwise the position would have been farcical. Consequently, &#39; a regulation was framed under the War Precautions Act under which attacks upon the censor for anything done in the. performance of his duty were forbidden. I would direct the attention of the Senate to the last statement read by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Mullan.</inline> It was a criticism and condemnation of the Government. But the criticism of the censor was excised from those paragraphs. Why? Because the censor, as a Government servant, was carrying out his instructions. If we are to allow such criticism, obviously in order that it may be of an intelligent character, we must allow the publication of the facts upon which that criticism is based. When once we do that, of what use will the prohibition be?. </para>

                            <para>- Not as to the acts of the censor. If we allow that, we shall have to allow the publication, as criticism of the censor, of practically the allegations which that officer has previously excised. Suppose, for example, that somebody were to write a slashing and bitter article reflecting on the Allies, and that the censor cut it out. If the writer of that article were subsequently allowed in the press to attack the censor for his action, under the guise of that attack, he would be able to publish the very thing which he had been forbidden to publish. The statements quoted to-night by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Mullan</inline> in the portion which he said was not censored contain a criticism of the Government for its administration of the censorship of a far more sweeping character than is the criticism of the censor himself. </para>

                            <para>- Yes; because under the War Precautions Act regulations such criticism is forbidden. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Mullan</inline> has stated that under the instructions issued to the censors it will be possible to . stop a criticism of the Gallipoli campaign, because such criticism might be construed as a reflection on the British Government. Of course, it has often been said that one can drive a coach and four through any Act o&#39;f Parliament or through any regulations, and, conceivably, a censor might strain his instructions in the way that has been suggested by the honorable senator. But any such action would not be in accord with the spirit of those instructions, nor with the wishes of the&#39; Government. </para>

                            <para>- No, at the time. It is my wish, and the wish of every other member of the Government, that the instructions to the censors should be interpreted in the way I have stated. I give <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Mullan</inline> that assurance, though I do not know whether he is prepared to accept my assurance or not. I do not think that it is any reflection on Great Britain to say that the Gallipoli campaign was a mistake. That has been said in the press of all sections many times. It was said when the restrictions of the censorship were very much more severe than they are to-day. </para>

It is sought to&#39; publish that statement throughout the length and breadth of the land, in order to incite resentment against the Government and the military authorities. But the statement is absolutely false. Any person can approach a civil Court against the censorship referred to, or against any action taken under the War . Precautions Act. It is not a military Court that deals with these things, but a civil Court. That is one of the statements which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Mullan</inline> read as an example of the statements that were struck out by the censor. Does the honorable senator wish freedom in this matter to mean the right to publish falsehoods about Acts of Parliament that are being questioned at the present juncture? <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Mullan.</inline> - I say that it does not come within the rights of the censor to intervene. </para>

                            <para>- He knew the statement he made to be false. Why did he seek to publish it at a time of war ? In order that the foundation war measure should be held up before the people of the Commonwealth in a false light, and be made to appear a tyrannical military measure, administered by military Courts. Surely there can be only one conclusion  as to the purpose sought to be served by the publication of such a statement. The purpose must be to create a false impression in the minds of the people, and to weaken the power of the Government in carrying on the war. Every one knows that the War Precautions Act is the foundation war measure, by which we are&#39; carrying on the war, and without which we could not carry it on. If such a measure is to be held up in a fake light before the people, I say that is not fair criticism. It is hampering the Government in the conduct of the war, and creating dissensions on false premises. </para>
