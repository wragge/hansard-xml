                        <para>It is anticipated that the railway from Pine Creek to&#39; Katherine River, upon which about seventy men are now employed, will be completed about April next. The extension to Bitter Springs, a further 64 miles, has been favorably reported on by the Public Works Committee, and a Bill to authorize the construction is now before Parliament. Should the Bill be passed, the prospects of obtaining the &#39;necessary material to enable a start to be made immediately the line to Katherine is finished are not very hopeful, as the greatest difficulty is experienced in getting tonnage to take sleepers to Darwin, and it is considered unlikely that the necessary rails can be procured by that time. </para>

                            <para>- Yes. But that provision applies to the original regulation, as well as to this one. When matters are submitted to the censor, he acts practically as a dictator and an autocrat. Without giving too many illustrations in support of ray contention, I wish to show that, during the recent referendum campaign, the censor did not hold the scales of justice evenly as between the two opposing political forces. </para>

                            <para>- <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> brought the wrath of his hearers upon himself. Those who know him and his Celtic temperament will recognise that when he spoke, as he did here, in such a wonderfully impassioned way on the question of conscription he was bound to provoke some hostility. I deny <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce&#39;s</inline> statement that freedom of speech was allowed to every person in the referendum campaign. I take it for granted that freedom of speech also includes freedom of the press, but I have here a striking illustration to show that under regulation 204 freedom of the press was not allowed to Nathaniel Jacka, the father of Lieutenant Jacka, one of our Victoria Cross heroes. He made the following statutory declaration : - </para>

Lieutenant Albert Jacka, V.C., in one letter said that while out of the trenches they almost &#34;forget the rattle of the guns, and  we have plenty of fun.&#34;  Never in any letter have any of my sons supported conscription, and in&#34; my belief they are all still opposed to it. &#39; My wife and daughter are working against conscription, believing, as I do, that we should keep free the land for which our sons went out freely to fight. </para>

If he did not apply that language to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Jacka,</inline> and honorable members of this Senate, to whom in the name of goodness did it apply?

                            <para>- I am not advocating that any man should defy the law. The censor in Ballarat allowed  it to go  into the columns of the <inline font-style="italic">Echo,</inline> which did valuable service in the &#34; No &#34; campaign, but about an hour after he had given his sanction a telephone message was received from Lieutenant McColl, of the censor&#39;s staff, in Melbourne, that the declaration must not be published. It was published in the <inline font-style="italic">Echo,</inline> as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McKissock</inline> says, in defiance of the instructions from Melbourne. Yet the Government say that the censor was prepared to give us a fair deal. Is there anything wrong in that declaration? Does it in any way assist the enemy or interfere with recruiting? It was purely a political, and not a military or national matter at all. </para>

We wanted no favoritism on either side in  the  campaign. All we demanded was what was right, fair, and just. I have  here a  proof of the Sydney <inline font-style="italic">Worker,</inline> the recognised organ of  the  Australian Workers Union, one of the greatest unions in Australia. It bears on it the censor&#39;s stamp, dated 21st October, 1916, a week before the poll was taken. This fair-play-loving Government and this just censor censored the article in a way which I shall show. The proof I have is just as it came from the censor, with his blue pencil marks on it. I shall read to the Senate the passage which he censored, and which the anti-conscriptionists wanted to put before that section of the people who are wise enough to read the columns of the Sydney <inline font-style="italic">Worker.</inline> I appeal to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> to say whether there is anything in the article damaging to recruiting, or in any way helpful to the enemy, or hurtful to our Allies. As a matter of fact, it was purely a question of figures, and the purpose of the. article was to show that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> was asking the people of Australia to do too much when he wanted 32,500 men in the first month, and 16,500 men in each succeeding month. It was as follows - </para>

                        <para>We are asked continually to put up a specific argument. Well, we propose to-day to ask the master mathematicians of the Conscription party how they square the following figures: - &#34;Reinforcements&#34; required for twelve months (including September quota of 32,000 ) 214,000. This works out at a monthly average (check the figures) of 17,833 men. </para>
                        <para>Actual losses from 25th April, 1015 (landing at Gallipoli) to end of September (including Somme offensive) - 737000 men(approx.). This works out at a monthly average of 4,294 men. (We are supposing that every man <inline font-style="italic">hors-de- comhat</inline> never returns to the firing line, which, is, of course, incorrect. But we are modest.) </para>
                        <para>Difference, 13,539 men. </para>
                        <para>Can the conscriptionists explain why 13,539 extra men are required every month above the required reinforcements? </para>
                        <para>Now, study the official reinforcement figures as given out by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> early in September last - </para>

                        </para>
                        <para>At estimated wastage of 4,294 men per month, as shown above, these 83,023 men will last till January, 1918. Check the figures for yourselves, master mathematicians of the Conscription party. </para>
                        <para>Now, we have Mr.Hughes&#39; word that the losses are as low now as at any period of the war, and &#34; would remain so during the winter.&#34; But, even if they continue at the rate they have since the beginning of the Gallipoli campaign, Australia has reinforcements sufficient to last till January, 1918,, as shown above. </para>
                        <para>But why does Hughes, on his own showing, want to conscript 268,000 men by January, 1918, while, on his own figures, not a single man will be required before that date? </para>
                        <para>He says he will not form any new divisions - except, of course, the one he did form, after he had pledged himself not to form any. He says he only requires men to actually reinforce the losses in the field. Those losses are proven to be on an average of 4,294 a month. Then why does he want 32,000 the first month, and 16,500 for every month after that date? </para>
                        <para>That is the great secret. Billy Hughes knows why he wants them. And so do we. </para>

Whether it was malevolent or not I am not here to argue. That is for the people themselves to decide. What I contend is that the censor has no right to alter words in an article dealing with any person which has nothing to do with the war and to put words into a written statement. That is the attitude which I am trying to follow in my speech.- Getting away from military and political matters, I have here a copy of a dodger issued by a gentleman who has been running throughout Australia, a picture show called &#34; Ireland a Nation.&#34; He expended about &#163;80 in getting the dodger printed and distributed throughout the Commonwealth. He started in Melbourne with his cinematograph show, visited about eighty towns in New South Wales, travelled through Queensland, and when he got to the great town of Cairns the censor pounced upon him and said he would not permit the dodger to be distributed broadcast to advertise the fact that the man was running the show. I ask honorable senators to observe the silliness of the censor. The dodger deals with &#34; Ireland a Nation.&#34; What this has to do with the war I think, that nobody but the censor knows.

                    <para>It depicts 114 years of Erin&#39;s struggle for Home Rule, for freedom and for long-deferred and grudgingly granted justice. A magnificent back-cloth is provided for the setting of this historical series by scenes embracing beautiful panoramic views of the romantic Lakes of Killarney, the  Wicklow  Hills,  Kilmainham  (the patriots&#39; gaol),  Luggielaw,  Glendalough, Glen.malure, Glen Cree, and a dozen other spots famous in song and story for sheer loveliness or some deed of vivid flame, including many ancient cathedrals and  monastries,  and other places of historical, archaeological and picturesque interest. Amid these scenes and in this setting is unfolded the  pathetic  and heroic story of Ireland&#39;s fight for freedom and free institutions. Erin&#39;s friends and foes are shown as in a crystal. </para>

                    <para>The film shows a number of persons who are famous in various ways, from the perfidious Castlereagh to the martyred Emmet. The word &#34; perfidious &#34; has been censored. The censor would not allow the word to be published or distributed, because it alluded to Castlereagh, who li as been known in history as the &#34;  perfidious  is Castlereagh.&#34; </para>

Here is further proof of the silliness of the censorship. Just to show how inconsistent the censor is, he allowed the words &#34; martyred Emmet&#34; to pass, but at the bottom of the dodger the words &#34; Ireland&#39;s martyr &#34; in relation to Robert Emmet were censored. </para>

I defy the Minister for Defence, or any other honorable senator, to say that this is not a historical fact and that it has nothing whatever to do with the war. and of many whose hearts broke amid the sorrows of involuntary exile; of men who, in the great warfare of mind rendered the Irish cause services no less memorable and glorious. They were neither forgotten nor unhonoured. The warrior figure or Hugh O&#39;Neill is a familiar vision to Irishmen; Sarsfield expiring on the foreign battlefield with that infinitely pathetic and noble utterance on his lips : &#34; Would that this were for Ireland &#34; - is a cherished remembrance, and that last cry of a patriotic spirit dwells for ever about our hearts; Grattan battling against a corrupt and venal faction, first to win and then to defend the independence of his country, astonishing friends and foes alike by the dazzling splendour of his eloquence; and O&#39;Connell on the . hillsides pleading for the restoration of Ireland&#39;s rights, and rousing his countrymen to a struggle for them, are pictures of which we are proud - memories that will ever live in song and story.

                            <para>- No; and I believe that the people were only too pleased to see the film. I come now to refer to a case that recently took place under this particular Statutory Rule 204. Relying on the promise of the Prime Minister, that speech during the referendum would be absolutely free to both sides, a reputable firm of printers in this city, Messrs. Frazer and Jenkinson, published certain dodgers advocating no-conscription. They had no feeling in the matter, but when a document was brought to them by the person signing it, and submitted for printing, as a matter of business they printed it in good faith, as an ordinary business deal. What happened? On the 28th November, under Statutory Rule 204, these people were brought before the Court on four separate charges. The first was in respect to a humorous leaflet entitled, &#34; The Charge of the  Would-to-Goders,&#39; &#39;  and the parties concerned were fined &#163;15, with <inline font-style="italic">&#163;7 7s.</inline> costs, and bound over in a recognisance of &#163;50 to observe the regulation. </para>

They were fined &#163;3. The fourth case was in respect of a leaflet entitled, &#39; &#39; Which way would the Kaiser like you to vote,&#34; and on this charge they were fined &#163;3. They were fined a total of &#163;23, with &#163;7 7s. costs, and, as I said, were bound over as well. </para>

It cannot be said that the statement that it is possible &#39; &#39; that these are but the beginning of many more to follow,&#34; is against recruiting, aiding the enemy, or is calculated to destroy, the spirit of camaraderie which should be fostered between the Allies.

                            <para>- Yes, but it is not necessary that the censor should be given such great powers as these. If it were carried out tactfully, and administered in accordance with the intentions of this Parliament, I would be prepared to revert to Statutory Rule 187, which would prevent any person from making a statement against recruiting. </para>

                            <para>- Yes, I do not want anything drastic to be done. I should not care to see the disallowance of any regulation which was fair and just. The patience of the people may, however, be taxed to the breaking point, and I advise that the Government should reconsider this statutory rule, and issue it, in a modified form. This course would meet with the approval of most of those who are opposed to the rule as it stands. I have here a reprint of an illustration, entitled &#34;The Sorrowful Christ.&#34; There appears to me to be nothing very wrong about it. Its publication was permitted in the <inline font-style="italic">Labour Call</inline> of Christmas, 1914, but on to-day, 7th December, it is censored when presented as an illustration for the Christmas number of <inline font-style="italic">The Timber Worker,</inline> the official print of the Timber Workers Union. As honorable senators will see, it represents &#34; The Sorrowful Christ&#34; looking upon a multitude of dead surrounding him. Its publication was permitted in the Christmas number of the <inline font-style="italic">Labour Call</inline> for 19i4, while the war was still raging. Unfortunately, the war has been continued since August, 1914. Now, when the conditions are practically unchanged, although two years have elapsed, the publication of this illustration in the Christmas number of <inline font-style="italic">The Timber Worker</inline> is prohibited by the censor. I do not know how this prohibition can be explained. What is wrong with its publication now, if it was not wrong to publish it in 1914? </para>

                            <para>- I wish to explain to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> that I am not opposed to a censorship in relation to matters such as recruiting or the raising of troops for service abroad. But I do object to a censorship which prevents any person from uttering a word. I protest against granting to any one man, or to any body of men, the power cf affirming that no- person shall publish, sell, or distribute any printed matter relating to the war or arising therefrom. Now, the cost of living, the death rate, our taxation proposals, and many other things are connected with the war. Consequently the censor, if he chooses, can prohibit any statement being made in respect of them. I do not forget the allegation of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> that he was even prevented by the censor from sending a wire to his wife upon a purely political matter. He wished to apprise her by telegraph of the fact that he had resigned from the Cabinet owing to the issue of certain obnoxious regulations.- </para>

                            <para>. - I think it is fairly obvious that what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Blakey</inline> has in view is not the abolition of a particular regulation, but of the censorship altogether. I take this motion as indicative of that. I do not think it is capable of any other interpretation after having heard what he had to say. One of the reasons why I say this is that the amended regulation really does not grant a very great extension of power to the censor. It certainly makes his power clearer in regard to particular subjects. The old regulation is rather narrowed down to the methods of recruiting or of raising troops for service in any of  His  Majesty&#39;s Forces. Honorable senators who admit that a censorship is necessary, and that we cannot carry on a war effectively against an enemy like Germany without it, will see that after all that is a very great, limitation of the power of censorship in relation to matters dealing with the war. After all, the power to censor matters relating to recruiting and to the raising of troops is one which merely interferes to a certain extent with the enemy&#39;s power to create a public opinion which will prevent us from recruiting the members of our community. I desire honorable senators to strip their minds of all humbug in connexion with this matter, and to remember that Germany has spent millions of pounds on a press propaganda in the United States of America and right through Europe, and not to be such fools as to blind themselves to the fact that Germany has spent money in Australia for the same purpose. The censorship is the only way we have of fighting that, We cannot fight it with bullets and bayonets. The division upon the motion will show whether honorable senators are prepared to rob us of the only arm by which we can fight Germany here. The mere fact that the Prime Minister and myself have misused or wrongly used the power of censorship is quite beside the question. That may be a perfectly legitimate complaint upon which to base a motion of censure either on <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> or myself. </para>

When it was pointed out to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Blakey</inline> that if this statutory rule were destroyed, the original regulation would remain, he replied, &#34; We will kill the other thing after we have killed this.&#34; He would not only prevent us having the power of censorship - the power to prevent the enemies of Britain writing in the interests of Germany on matters respecting this war - but he would even prevent us having the power to protect ourselves in the matter of recruiting and the raising of troops. </para>

                            <para>- Order. The Honorable senator has no right to interrupt whilst I am on my feet. The facts are that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> said that certain agents of Germany were disseminating throughout Australia statements which, were detrimental to the cause of the Allies, to Great Britain, and to ourselves. He said that that fact was well known to the Government, and that these men were not without friends in Parliament. That is the statement which he made, and it cannot be taken to apply to every member of Parliament. It might be taken to apply to one or more members whom he considers to be friends of those agents. That is the exact position, and if any honorable senator considers that the statement is a reflection on himself, I shall ask <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> to withdraw it. </para>

So long as I  remain in this position I shall continue to act as I have always done, in an absolutely fair &#39;and impartial way, and to treat every question from a purely judicial stand-point, without fear or favour from any individual or either side of the Senate. I took particular note of what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> said, because I could see it was calculated to raise dissension or disorder. I have given a careful and exact statement of what took place, and I have ruled that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> has not made a general reflection upon honorable senators. </para>

                            <para>- I think it necessary that the country should know exactly what the motion is about. It is not a motion, as I understand it, as to whether the censorship has been wisely or honestly used. It is not a motion of censure on the censor, on the Government, or on the Minister administering the Department. It is a motion primarily to disallow the censorship in regard to matters pertaining to the war, and the announced intention is that, after that is done, the censorship, as regards matters referring to recruiting and the raising of His Majesty&#39;s Forces anywhere, is to be removed, and this on the eve of a recruiting campaign. I ask the Senate, before it does anything to produce that effect, to remember that what I have stated is a fact known to all - that Germany has her press propaganda in every country for the purposes of this war. She has it here without the slightest doubt. Why should she leave Australia out? There is every reason why she should have it here, and there may be unconscious channels through which her influence flows. </para>

                            <para>- I leave the honorable senator to judge for himself. That being so, honorable senators have to take upon themselves the responsibility of helpingSenator Blakey to destroy the power of censorship in Australia. Germany has her censorship; no one is allowed to use the press of Germany to create dissension there, or to write down Germany, or speak against recruiting. The same (thing is true of Austria-Hungary, and of Turkey. Britain and her Allies have their censorships also. </para>

                            <para>- It Hoes not matter what the honorable senator said ; here is his motion. If he is merely dissatisfied with the censorship, he can vent his; dissatisfaction by moving the adjournment of the Senate, or a reduction in a Supply Bill, or in a dozen other ways, but the motion is not for that purpose, nor will that be its effect. Its effect will&#39; be to destroy the power of censorship, and honorable senators therefore cannot shelter themselves behind the motion and say, &#34; I only voted that way because I was dissatisfied with the censor, or the Minister for Defence, or the Government.&#34; The effect of voting for the motion is to destroy in Australia the power of checking German propaganda. If that were done Australia would be the only one of the countries at war where it was done. </para>

                            <para>- I am thinking of it now. Here and now is the time when the honorable senator is called on to record his vote on that issue. All <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Blakey&#39;s</inline> quotations would be quite apt on a motion of censure on the Government, or on the administration of the censorship, or on a motion to reduce the Defence Estimates, because of the action of the censor. That would be a proper way to raise the question whether the censorship had been properly exercised or not. But this motion is not that, and the vote on this motion will not be on that question. All the instances the honorable senator quoted are therefore beside the point. I would remind him of an interesting feature in regard to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr.</inline> Jacka&#39;s  statutory declaration. It will be interesting to see how my late colleague, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner,</inline> votes on the motion, because at the time when the alleged censoring of the declaration took place I was in Western Australia, according to the date given, and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> was administering the Department. I am not prepared to admit that it was censored, as stated by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Blakey,</inline> and will tell the Senate why later. I am not prepared to admit anything the honorable senator says as regards the censorship, or the accuracy of any of the information supplied to him. or that any one of those cases is genuine. I have not seen them. They have not been brought before me. I have seen so many statements published in journals about the censorship, which on inquiry I found to be faked and false, that I accept none of them without first inquiring into them and finding them to be correct.- I can  give one instance brought forward by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Blakey</inline> which is quite capable of an explanation apart altogether from the question of censorship. He quoted a cable which appeared in the <inline font-style="italic">Herald</inline> favoring the anti-conscriptionist side, and said it did not appear in the morning papers-, the inference being either that it was stopped by the censor or that the morning papers did not publish it. That is not a rare occurrence, for the simple reason that the <inline font-style="italic">Herald</inline> gets a different service, and if the other papers published that cable they would be liable for a suit for damages under the copyright law. Only a few. weeks ago, the <inline font-style="italic">Herald</inline> published a cable most flattering to the Defence Department. -It stated that Canada had adopted our system of Defence administration, in regard to the Military Board and our system of promotion from the ranks - a compliment to our Defence Act, and two or three other features of Defence administration that originated in Australia. That cable did not appear in either of the morning papers. I should assume, I suppose, that the censor cut it out. </para>

                            <para>- The honorable senator quoted instances in which he alleged that the censor had exercised his powers unwisely, and nearly every one of them referred to recruiting. If this motion were carried, and the honorable senator succeeded later on in killing the original regulation, those statements could be published without being censored. What was his object in quoting them? Was it not a further illustration of the fact that the honorable senator is against the censorship altogether? </para>

                            <para>- Then the honorable senator should admit that he has chosen his ground wrongly. Instead of attacking the power of censorship he ought to attack the censor, or the administration of the censorship through me, the Minister. If he wants to do that, is he acting logically in seeking to destroy the power by which the censor acts? That is what he is doing, and all the illustrations he used really do not cover the extension of the censor&#39;s powers which the amended regulation gives, but they do affect the original power to deal with recruiting matters. To show that the honorable senator is really against our having the power of censorship - I hope Lam not doing him an injustice- </para>

At that juncture the Prime Minister had called together in Melbourne, under the War Precautions Act, the parties to the dispute, and they were about to meet in conference when the article was submitted to the censor. That article, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Blakey</inline> quotes it, refers to the man who was to bring them together to effect a settlement as &#34; a malevolent enemy of the coal miners.&#34; </para>

                            <para>- Let us put ourselves in the position of a German agent in this country. The best thing we could do, as we could not lead an armed insurrection for fear of getting shot, would be to prevent troops, arms, and munitions of war leaving this country. Therefore, if an industrial dispute occurred in the mining industry, which supplied coal for the transports and for the small arms and other defence factories, obviously the best thing for a German agent to do would be to keep that dispute going. The article as submitted to the censor was apparently designed for that purpose, because it referred to the arbitrator as a malevolent foe of the coal miners. </para>

                            <para>- The article, I say, referred to the arbitrator as a malevolent foe of the coal miners, and because it was scotched by the censor, because the censor would not allow the columns of the <inline font-style="italic">Labour Call</inline> to be used for the purpose of creating further dissension in the coal trade, which would have had the effect of holding up the transports, and of stopping work at the Small Arms Factory, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Blakey</inline> uses it as an argument why the censor should be stripped of his power. That is what we have to deal with. Now I come to the censorship of the leaflet issued by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Dan</inline> Green, the agent of the Australian Workers Union in Melbourne, and who is also the agent of a picture show. That particular picture show came under the notice of the military authorities in Queensland. I am confident that if any honorable senator peruses the leaflet referred to he will be satisfied that it was designed to stir up bitter memories connected with the long-&#39; distant past; that its tendency was to create diversion among the people of the British nation, and to confirm in the minds of Irishmen the idea that England was Ireland&#39;s traditional enemy. Is this a time when all the old hatreds should be revived ? Is this a time when trouble like that should be accentuated? Is this a time when feuds of a hundred years ago should be dug up and paraded round this country of ours? </para>

We have seen the result of this course of action in the recent riots and bloodshed in Dublin. I repeat that in a war like this, when we are at death grips with the enemy, we should not permit the circulation of statements referring to England as the traditional enemy of Ireland. </para>

                            <para>- I do not know, but I should say that among our recruits there are as many sons of Irishmen as there are of Scotchmen and Englishmen, and that is all the more reason why we should set our face against any attempt to stir up the hatreds of a hundred years ago. We want, if possible, to forget those troubles. Now I wish to refer more particularly to these picture shows. At least two have come under the notice of, and have been prohibited by, the censors. I saw one of them myself, and have had a close description of the other. They were sent from America for the deliberate purpose of creating ill-feeling in this country with regard to one of our Allies. There is not the slightest doubt in my mind that the picture was filmed with that end in view, because it presented in a most revolting form a certain phase in the history of that&#39; allied country, but which, happily for the people of that country, has passed. So far as scenery was concerned the pictures were beautiful, and perhaps it might be asked why we should not have allowed them to be shown throughout the length and breadth of this land; why we should not allow Germany, through her agencies in New York, and by means of the printing press and the photo play, to distribute her propaganda literature .in this country of ours. We are preventing it because that literature has been specially designed to stir up ill-feeling against Great Britain ; for the purpose of dividing the Allies; of creating a feeling of distrust in France and Russia of Great Britain, and ill-feeling in Great Britain against the other two of the allied countries. </para>

                            <para>- No. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Blakey^s</inline> argument has nothing to do with the main question. We have to remember that war is conducted, not merely with rifles and bullets, with guns and shells, but by the influence of public opinion in a country. Germany has spent millions of pounds to create public opinion in allied and neutral countries against Great Britain, arid she is prepared to spend millions more. Is it not reasonable, therefore, to assume that Germany is ready to spend large sums of money in Australia ? And that we may protect ourselves against that danger, is it not right that we should have power to prevent the creation here of an enemy public opinion ? The motion, so we have been told, is really directed at the original regulation. </para>

                            <para>- No. I have told the honorable senator that it was found necessary to insert these additional words because, as originally framed, the regulation was so restricted as to refer merely to the raising of troops, whereas arising out of the war there are other and equally important questions affecting this country. There is, for instance, the question of getting the troops away. Are we to allow the newspapers of this country to publicly advocate that transports shall be held up ? That is the question. </para>

                            <para>- That being the case, I want to point out that there is another phase to that question. This amended regulation, to which objection has been taken by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Blakey,</inline> gives us power to prevent the publication of statements that might have the effect of interfering with the movements of our transports. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Blakey,</inline> by his motion, is seeking to take that power away from the Government. The old regulation only gives us power to prevent the publication of statements which refer in any way to the methods of recruiting or raising troops. If newspapers can publish throughout the country articles inciting men in the Small Arms Factory to go on strike, to sabotage the machinery of that factory and of the Cockatoo Island Dockyard, they will help the Germans by the propagation of such doctrines, and the amendment of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Blakey</inline> will take from us the power to stop the publication of such incitements. </para>

                            <para>- If the honorable senator votes for the destruction of this regulation, he is voting against our having that power. Apparently he has not read the War Precautions Act. It confers certain specific powers on the Government - this is not one of them - and then it gives us general power to make regulations in regard to the safety of the country and the conduct of the war. This is a regulation made under the Act for the purpose of preventing the publication in this country, without reference to the censor, of any statement &#34; which relates or refers to the present war,- or to any subject connected therewith or arising therefrom.&#34; The reason for the addition of these words is Hi at the regulation only gives us power in respect to any printed matter &#34; which refers in any way to the methods of recruiting or raising troops for service in any of  His  Majesty&#39;s Forces.&#34; </para>

                            <para>- Possibly a censor, acting under his powers, has prevented the publication of some speeches. My honorable friends must recognise that a censor may have used his powers wisely or unwisely. Suppose that a firm were to disobey an order of the censor, and a Court were to ask on what regulation the censor forbade the publication of the statement. If the amendment were disallowed here, we should have no regulation to point to as the authority under which we forbade somebody from publishing exhortations to stop transports from leaving the country, to stop the production of small arms and munitions for the war. He would be a foolish man who would say that the censors never did anything wrong, that they always acted wisely and in accordance with the law. I do not-make such a claim.. I have seen things published in this &#39;country which I think ought to have been censored. I do not doubt that the censors have been guilty of sins of commission and sins of omission; but this is not the way to deal with them. Honorable senators know that if they want to deal with the censors there is a proper method &#39;to pursue. &#39; The Minister is responsible to the Senate for the acts of his servants - for the acts of the censor staff. Honorable senators have many opportunities of dealing with the Minister in any cases where the employees of his Department have not carried out their duties faithfully and well. That &#62;is &#62;the proper way for <inline font-weight="bold">&#39;Senator Blakey</inline> to deal .with cases of omission or cases of commission. </para>

Whether it came under <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner&#39;s</inline> notice or not I do not know:, probably it did not. I am not prepared to pass judgment on a matter which has come under my notice to-day for the first time. I am quite prepared to believe that a censor has often acted unwisely; probably sometimes in one way, and! sometimes in another. Will honorable senators say that things have been kept out which ought to have been allowed to* go in? I have seen things in the press,, which, in my opinion, ought to have been kept out. </para>

Now honorable senators in the corner can, see a sinister motive in whatever he does. If, for instance, he blows his nose, they have an idea that he has a  bomb  concealed in his handkerchiefs He can do nothing without their seeing something sinister or evil behind it. It &#39;is only a little while ago since the same- gentlemen used to say that they were going into Parliament to support the Prime Minister. I am not going to follow them into all this mud-slinging and dirt. It suits them; let them revel in it. .In conclusion,. I appeal to honorable senators to be honest, and not to allow themselves to be misled. I want the country -to know that the question on which we are to vote is, whether the Government are to have the power to censor any .statements made against the &#34;interests. of this country, .and. in the interests of our enemies - a power which, I repeat, Germany possesses. Whether honorable senators are prepared to strip the Government of that power, knowing that an enemy will be ready to take advantage of it, the vote will show. </para>

                            <para>- We are trying to strip the Government of a power which they have used in a way not only discreditable to themselves, but to Australia. I am not going to seek shelter by saying that the censor officers may not have made mistakes. I venture to say, however, that they have administered the regulation with much more justness than has the Right Honorable W. M. Hughes. The Prime Minister has interfered with their administration. He has compelled the officers to use the power in a way in which Parliament never believed it would be used. They have misused their authority under the instructions received from <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> and his secretary, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Garran.</inline></para>

                            <para>- Under the regulation the Prime Minister can penalize country newspapers if they publish anything about the war without having first submitted the matter to the censor. That is a power which should not be given to that gentleman. The regulation, as amended, would work out in such a way that any one would be guilty of an offence who published such information. The Minister for Defence was rather curious to know how I intended to vote, because I was a member of the Government which passed the regulation, for which, of course, I take full responsibility. I am speaking because I shall not have an opportunity of voting, since I have paired with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen.</inline></para>

I have here a simple statement in proof - of that. He left Melbourne a few days before the referendum, and his secretary, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Garran,</inline> gap.e instructions from him to the censor that he was not to allow the publication of anything that certain Ministers might say. I am not surprised that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> should not be listening while I make this statement. The gentleman who is responsible for the maladministration of these regulations left an instruction with <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Garran,</inline> which was conveyed to the censor, that he was not to publish anything that his Ministers might say, and the Ministers referred to were <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Russell, Mr. Higgs,</inline> and myself. </para>

I venture to say that those who raise them are the friends of Germany. If there is German money in circulation in this country, I say that honorable senators who try to make out that Australian people and members of the Australian Parliament are getting some of it,- ought to be getting it themselves if they are not, because they are earning it. The man who tries to make out that there is any disloyal section in this community is a friend of Germany, and so is the man who tries to turn every question that is raised upon that issue. </para>

                            <para>- For two years in this country during the continuance of the war we had absolute unanimity amongst our people. There was absolute loyalty to the Empire. Nothing asked for by Parliament was refused or conceded with a grudging voice. Millions of money were passed here in a few minutes, and what was asked for by the Government was not questioned throughout the country. At the end of this period we are told that we are disloyal if -we dare to vote against a regulation requiring newspaper proprietors and others to first submit to the censor any statement that they wish to make concerning the war, and under which, if certain statements are made in innocence by a Labour newspaper, the proprietors may have their newspaper confiscated, or be brought before magistrates and fined. </para>

The fact remains that there has been no change in the principles, platform, or pledge of the party which sent the honorable senator and myself to the Senate. </para>

But the Government simply say, &#39; &#39; If you vote against the allowance of this regulation, and if you take this power from us, you are disloyal, and we shall let the people see where you stand . &#34; In the circumstances, I am prepared to vote against the allowance of the regulation. I may be said to have already voted, because I have paired upon the motion with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen.</inline> I am against the regulation, because it has been used by the Prime Minister in a way in which it should never have been used. Further, I am going to vote on every occasion that presents itself to strip this Government of every power, because it is exercising powers which, constitutionally, it should not exercise. It is continuing in office without a majority in Parliament. </para>

At the present time that cannot be said of the Government. Regulation 187 covers all the powers of censorship that are necessary, and more powers than any Government under the leadership of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> should be intrusted with. It is his leadership and his administration that has caused the difficulty. Of course, censorship will cause some friction in any case. A conference of Labour people that expelled some of my honorable friends has admitted, by resolution, that censorship is necessary, and has complained only of its abuse. </para>

                            <para>- There is no question that it is, and, so far as the honorable senator is concerned, unfair to him. lt is my purpose to remove from the Prime Minister, who, not satisfied with mismanaging his own Department, wants to interfere in every other Department, a power of censorship that is unnecessary. The censorship of our political discussions, and of the ordinary news concerning the war, to which the people are entitled, is quite unnecessary. We are a British community, and we do not need our war news served up to us with a scrupulous regard for our feelings. We want the truth, and the bare truth. If the news is such as to show that greater efforts on our part are needed, those who are conducting the business of the country will be in a better position than they are in to-day to ask for  the recruits  who are so much needed. I am not quite sure of the number supporting the Government in the Senate. I think there are ten or eleven definite followers of theirs. If the eleven who want <inline font-style="italic">to</inline> control the business of the Senate wish, in a great emergency like this, to live altogether free from racial hatred and disturbances, why do they not go a&#39; little farther, and endeavour to create harmony between the sections of the people who are represented in this Parliament? Are they doing it ? I venture to say that they are attempting to discuss every question with a view to making it appear that all who disagree with them are enemies of the Empire. Now, I am the sort of man who, when anybody unfairly attempts to injure a friend, will stand by that friend in order to show my resentment against what I conceive to be an unjust method of attack. I hope that the Senate will insist that that portion of the regulation should be abolished which makes it an offence for any matter to be published relating to or arising out of the war without first being submitted to the censor. Take the case of the Ballarat <inline font-style="italic">Echo.</inline> Let us assume that a piece of news is obtained just in time for publication. Are the proprietors of that journal to wait for two clays before publishing it in order that it may first be submitted to the censor? Some time ago we had a censor in the newspaper offices of Melbourne, but even then our action was misunderstood by the proprietors of those journals. They thought that he was placed there for the purpose of hindering them, when, as a matter of fact, he was put there for the purpose of helping them. However, it is impossible to have censors in every newspaper office throughout Australia. Notwithstanding all the statements that have been made in regard to anti-conscriptionists in this country, I venture to say that there is very little difference, from the stand-point of loyalty to the Empire, between man and man. We want to win this war, but those who take the view that all who differ from them are less loyal to the Empire are underestimating the manly intelligence of Australia. </para>

                            <para>- I would take from them a misconceived regulation - a regulation which was given a trial for three months, and which during that time proved that in the hands of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> it was an absolute impossibility. For two years the war went on without this regulation. For two years Germany&#39;s agents were free to spend money as they pleased. I agree with the Minister for Defence that the man who does not think that German money will be used in this country is adopting an ostrich-like attitude by shutting his eyes to the facts. </para>

                            <para>- But I know from the newspapers of the United States of America that millions of pounds were spent by Germany in propaganda work there. Consequently, I think that similar efforts will be made here. The man who wishes the Empire to stand foursquare to every wind that blows is the man who will act as a Britisher in panic time. I do not hesitate to say &#34;that the worst acts committed under the regulation which we are discussing were the deliberate acts of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes,</inline> who compelled the censor to do things which the Minister for Defence had already done in a proper way. If I could be assured that the administration of this regulation would be left in the hands of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce,</inline> I would vote for&#34; its retention. </para>

                                is bad enough without a regulation: but, armed with a regulation .under which he can harass every newspaper proprietor in Australia, he is a positive danger, and I am surprised- that

I hope that this will be the last occasion on which senators on one side of the chamber will be found endeavouring to make it appear that those upon the opposite side are disloyal. Let us not here give any hope to Germany that Australia is divided. It is the duty of every honorable senator to speak the truth, which is that, in regard to this war, Australia is united. And if a voice be found here and there crying out against it, that is only what might be expected in a population as free as is our own. An honorable senator asks me whether the absence of this regulation would not be of some assistance to Germany if she  attempted  to use the press of Australia. It would be of no service whatever. The portion of it to which we object is that which compels all articles, before publication, to be submitted to the censor. As one who occupied the position of Minister for two years, I say that I never heard a complaint in regard to this want of power. </para>

Could anybody listen to what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Blakey</inline> said to-day without realizing that the administration of this regulation was one of the  most objectionable blots on the life of the Government of which I was a member. If something was done under that regulation of which I never dreamed, surely I am not blameworthy? Take the case of section 9 of the Act, which conferred certain powers on the Government. I say, unhesitatingly, that if that section were . under consideration tomorrow, I would not vote for it, because of the way in which its provisions have been abused. </para>

                            <para>- When section 9 was under consideration, I did not doubt that it would be used for the purposes for which all thought it would be used; but in view of the way in which it has been used, I would not vote for it again. This regulation occupies exactly a similar position ; we have witnessed three months of its administration. The whole of the evils which accrued in that period have not been put before the Senate. But because of our experience of its operation, we are satisfied that it is an objectionable regulation which ought to be repealed. If the Government say that the abolition of that regulation strips them of power, I invite them to-morrow to introduce a short Bill into this Chamber conferring upon them not exceptional powers in this direction, and to see &#39;how it will be treated. We all know that government by regulation is merely intended to fill in the gaps between the periods when Parliament is sitting. </para>

                            <para>- And never did I think that a man who could see so clearly as the honorable senator, could make such blunders. The honorable senator did remind us all of the dangers attendant upon government by regulation, and now, when the most glaring misuse of a regulation is put before him, it will be interesting to watch how he will vote. I shall await the division with interest, in order that I may see whether he gives effect to his preaching. The honorable senator has always been one of the champions of government by legislation, and not by regulation. I think that he is the only unofficial member of his party. If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Senior</inline> is the whole of the Government support apart from those holding official posts, he occupies a remarkable position. </para>

                            <para>- I do not know any others, or I would. I notice that the press wants now to take from us our name of the Australian Labour party, and tack on to us that of the Official Labour party. It seems to me that one of the conditions for following the Government section of the Labour party is that you must have an office. I am against the regulation, and support its repeal. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Blakey</inline> made out a good case against it. If the Government claim that the motion will strip them of power, I invite them immediately to introduce a Bill to give, them all the power necessary. If they do, I promise them that any reasonable measure providing satisfactory security for the liberty of the people will have the support of the Opposition. By the carrying of the motion the Government will lose no power. They will lose no power by the regulation being taken out of the hands of the Prime Minister. I mention him because he goes right over the top of other Ministers to enforce his views. He steps above even such a Minister as the Minister for Defence, and releases for publication on the eve of an election matter censored weeks before by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce.</inline> If the regulation is repealed, the Prime Minister will no longer have power to bring the country press, the Labour press, and other papers to book for publishing articles without first submitting them to the censor. </para>

                            <para>- Germany has very much power now, which will never be made greater by any one sitting on this side of the Senate. If the honorable senator likes to live on the anti-German cry, he may repeat it parrot-like as often as he cares, but he know3 that it does not carry conviction when applied to men who are known in the communities they represent. It does not carry conviction when applied to men who, before they ever reached the Senate, have undergone the test that all members have to undergo before they get here. No man in thi3 Senate is disloyal, and nobody knows it better than the honorable senator. No man in this Senate can have even the suspicion of disloyalty cast upon him. I am speaking for all parties when I say that. Of course, if you throw mud enough, some of it will stick, and I dare say, if the honorable senator picks upon an expression that some one has used and twists it, he may lead some people who do not know the facts to believe what he says, and so gain a vote or two, but is it worth while ? The position is too serious for these . childish accusations. We should try to overcome the inclination to put the other fellow in a bad position. </para>

The Senate for two years have given the Government everything they have asked for that should be given. That, in itself, ought to have induced the Leader of the Government here to admit at once that the indictment against the regulation was proved, and to own frankly and with dignity that the use to which the regulation had been put was not such as to warrant its continuance. If the Government consider that to lose it would strip them of certain power, they can remedy this to-morrow by introducing a Bill to give them the power they want. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Senior</inline> has warned me of the dangers of government by regulation. Will he assist me now to get back to government by legislation ? </para>

                            <para>- That is the real trouble. The regulation is one of the little troubles that we are able to remove. The fact that there is a Government in power &#39; without a majority in Parliament is the real danger to this country, and the real help, if help there be, to the German side. A Government without the confidence of the people administering a regulation of that kind, and afraid to appeal to the people for their confidence, surely ought to be deprived of power. </para>

                            <para>- The honorable senator is, of course, an authority on them. I do not happen to know any, or any friends of Germany. If I did, I would see if I could not hand them over to the proper authorities, to be dealt with properly. This regulation, whose repeal certain people say will give Germany extraordinary power, has -been in existence only three months, and I challenge&#39; those who defend it to produce anything that would have helped Germany that it has been used to suppress. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Blakey</inline> produced a number of instances which proved that the regulation has been used to suppress information that would have helped the people of Australia to a wider knowledge of what is happening, and that would not have helped Germany at all. I challenge the supporters of the regulation to produce any censored articles or statements in regard to which the regulation has helped to preserve us from German influence. </para>

                            <para>- If the honorable senator had heard my speech, he would have heard me say that there was some one who could administer it satisfactorily. I do not make any particular claim to be able to administer regulations. It is a most difficult business, and it will be much more satisfactory when we can get the community to first hear the laws debated in Parliament. They will then be ready for what they have to live under, and can obey or disobey at their pleasure, paying, of course, the penalties if they do -disobey. This regulation has been shown to have been a great danger to the liberties of the people, many of whom have been prevented:, in their ordinary civil life, from expressing their opinions in an ordinary and intelligent manner. Words have been struck out of articles, making them meaningless. Writers have been compelled by the electoral law to sign articles when the words that gave sense and smoothness to them have been deleted by the action of the censor. That should not happen. The Government should have all the power it asks for to cope with German interests and German influence. I venture to say that I have the whole of my party with me when I make that statement; but those powers must not be used to deal with British interests and British people, or with what I hold even -dearer - Australian interests and Australian people. A distinction must be made between the two things. I put the whole blame on the shoulders of one man -the Prime Minister. If it is true, as we say it is, that the Government have misused it to injure the Australian community, I ask not only the party sitting behind me, but all those others who believe in preserving our liberties, to take care that this pernicious regulation shall not exist after this evening. </para>

                            <para>- Well the Minister may elect to leave the chamber.  His  -attitude during this debate reminds me of a parent trying to correct a child who may have been playing truant, because the Minister threatens that if members of this Chamber vote* for the disallowance of the regulation he will prove them to be friends of Germany, and enemies of the Empire. It is just about time that members of the Senate proved themselves men, and not children. Too long has it been the practice of Ministers to threaten a member that if he takes a certain line of action he will be labelled in a certain manner, but I am prepared to be put in the pillory, if necessary, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> evidently desires. I am prepared, by the vote I am about to give, to put myself in the prisoner&#39;s dock, so to speak, and leave my future to the verdict of a jury which has much more power than <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce.</inline> That jury will be the people of Western Australia, who sent <inline font-style="italic">me</inline> here. </para>

                            <para>- The honorable gentleman knows what I mean. I refer to a statement by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> which means that he would place all of us in the prisoner&#39;s dock if we dared to vote in a certain direction. According to the Minister, we will then be enemies of the Empire and friends of Germany. I want to draw attention to the fact that while <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> was addressing the Senate he said that Germany had friends in this Parliament. </para>

                            <para>- The Minister can prove his statement if he likes. My point is that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> made an accusation against members either of this Parliament, or of some other Parliament. Where are those friends of Germany? Which Parliament did <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> mean? Was it the National Parliament of Australia, a State Parliament, or was it the Imperial House of Commons? If Germany has friends in any Parliament in the British Empire will <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> give us the names of those members? Surely that is a broad enough margin for the Minister to work upon. </para>

The honorable senator would not for a moment make such a statement to me now, and I do not think that he ever made it outside, for he is too much of a man to say such a thing as that. These placards were exhibited on the hoardings, and the Defence Department knew that they were there. Why were not the words of the placard submitted to the censor? </para>

                            <para>- Whatever may be the result of the vote I am about to give, it will not be given with the  intention   of depriving the Government of powers of censorship. I want that to be borne in mind. I know it is imperative that the Government of any country should have powers of censorship during a time of war., and particularly during a war of the nature of the present one. But I think it is time that Parliament stepped in and said to the Government, &#34; These powers of censorship shall go so far, and  no farther.&#34;  I will make another statement. If it had not been for the too strict censorship exercised in Great Britain there would have been no need to introduce conscrip there. It was because the censorship was so strict that her people did not know where they were. They could not learn from the columns of the newspapers the true position on the Eastern or Western front,&#39; or the situation in the Balkans. They were fed up with certain kinds of cables and news. The real news which they should have received they were deprived of by too strict a censorship. I venture to say that if the manhood of the British Isles had known the true position, conscription never would have been a law on the British statute-book. </para>

                            <para>- No. There would have been no necessity to have a vote on conscription in Great Britain if the truth had really been known to the manhood. Whilst I agree entirely with the necessity of a censorship, I think it would be foolish on the part of this Parliament to hand over to the Government absolute powers such as this amended regulation suggests. Why? Talk about government by regulation or government by legislation. During the past two years we have practically been governed by regulation. This session commenced on the 8th October, 1914, and may go on for some time yet. Practically during the greater part of that period Parliament has not governed. The Executive has governed. I admit that I was a party to the War Precautions Act under which regulations have been made time and again. </para>

                            <para>- The Minister for Works says that the honorable senator did not use the word &#34; this,&#34; and I wish the Minister for Defence to tell the nation now which Parliament he referred to. I wish him to say whether he referred to the Federal Parliament, to any State Parliament in Australia, or any Parliament in the British Dominions. If there are friends of Germany in any of these Parliaments, the sooner the people concerned know their names the sooner will they be able to get rid of them. In justice to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce,</inline> I have repeated my challenge, and I leave it to him to decide whether he will respond to it. I might summarize my statement by saying that I accept his challenge that if I vote for the disallowance of this regulation I shall be assisting to strip tne Government of all powers of censorship. I shall not be doing anything of the sort. I shall be voting merely against giving the Government the absolute power which they have time and again exercised since the War Precautions Act has been in force. I admit that . I assisted <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> and the last Hughes Government to put the War Precautions Act on the statute-book. I accept my share of responsibility for doing that, but I little dreamt at that time that I was creating a Frankenstein. I say now that had I thought that the administration of the Act would have resulted as it has resulted, my vote would never have been &#39;recorded for it. I am a sadder and a wiser man to-day than I was when I voted for that Act. </para>

                            <para>- Yes, it teaches a lot of things, and we have had sad experience of the administration of the War Precautions Act. Honorable senators recognise that, while probably the intention  of Parliament in passing every Act is to benefit and protect the people, the administration of any Act may defeat the intention of Parliament in passing it. It is in the administration of an Act that the danger lies. We have many times had proof that the War Precautions Act has not been administered in the way that this Parliament thought it would be. I repeat that in voting for the disallowance of this regulation I am not taking from the Government all powers of censorship. </para>

                            <para>- No, that is&#34; not so. I am humbly endeavouring to retain parliamentary control of the Executive. It is possible that we may shortly adjourn, for what period I do not know, and I say that Parliament should always keep its hand on the Government. It has been proved time and again in the last few months that it would have been better for the country had Parliament continued to sit. The Government would not then have been given the latitude which they have taken advantage of. So far as the censorship of published matter is concerned, the words which it is proposed should be deleted from this objectionable regulation are - which relates or refers, to the present war, or to any subject connected therewith, or arising therefrom. </para>

If I did not vote for the disallowance of this regulation I would be placing the destinies of Australia practically in the hands of one man. The Minister for Home Affairs in another place has admitted that the presiding officers acted on instructions from the Attorney-General&#39;s Department, yet the Prime Minister has the temerity to affirm that- the regulations which were responsible for the resignation of three of tv-&#171; colleagues were not issued. It is a .&#34;&#39;ore lawyer&#39;s quibble. The instructions were issued and were acted upon. Because the Prime Minister attempted to interfere with the secrecy of the ballot I object to placing in his hands the power that is conferred by this regulation. </para>

                        <para>.- During the six and a half years that I have been a member of the Senate I have not heard the Minister for Defence make such a good attempt - with his usual ability and eloquence - to bolster up a bad cause as he made here to-day. Those of us who followed <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Blakey</inline> this afternoon are aware that the people of Australia are vitally interested in the subject-matter of </para>
                    </talk.start>
                    <para>Hie censorship, and especially since the question of conscription became a burning one in our midst. Nothing has been productive of more trouble than this question of the censorship, and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Blakey</inline> should be commended for having afforded us an opportunity of calmly and dispassionately debating it with a view of showing the people what are the true facts of the case. </para>
                    <para>The Minister for Defence appealed to honorable senators to be honest with themselves and not to be misled. I think that we ought rather to be honest with the people of Australia and not permit them to be misled. I was surprised indeed when <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> deliberately attempted to mislead the public  by the way in which he stated the case. In submitting this motion <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Blakey</inline> read the objectionable regulation which was an amendment of a previous regulation. For the first two years of the war there was in existence a regulation which provided that any printed matter issued in relation to recruiting should be subject to the censorship. No objection was urged to that. It was held to be sufficient to enable the Government to effectively control the issue of pamphlets relating to matters connected with the war. Three months ago-and .this date, singularly, coincides with the period when the question of conscription first arose - that regulation, which was never before challenged, was suddenly amended, so that instead of applying merely to recruiting matters, or to the raising of troops for service abroad, it empowered the censor to control the publication of every pamphlet. </para>

                            <para>- Exactly. It was a dragnet regulation. When we as a party object, not to the regulation which was acted upon for the greater part of two years, but to this extension of it, we are told by the Minister for Defence that we are attempting to wrest from the Government the power to control traitors. That is a deliberate effort on his part to mislead the people. </para>

                    <para>SenatorREADY.- It will take from them the power which was given them to deal principally with pamphlets relating to conscription. When the Minister for Defence says that our intention in disallowing this additional power is to entirely destroy the censorship, I say that he is making a deliberate misstatement of facts which cannot be too strongly repudiated by any decent thinking man. </para>

I wish to quote two instances, which occurred during the recent referendum campaign, of th&#39;e way in which this additional power has been misused, and of how the censorship has been unfairly used for political purposes. Both cases occurred in Tasmania. One of them is connected with the press, and the other with the issue of pamphlets. Every honorable senator is familiar with the cartoon which was published in the <inline font-style="italic">Worker</inline> of Thursday, 5th October. It depicts a blackboard on which are set out the figures relating to the number of men that were said to be required as reinforcements under the scheme of the late Hughes Government.

The paper was simply making its own deductions, but the cartoon was not allowed to be published in Tasmania, although it was published all over . Australia, and passed by the New South Wales censor. Honorable senators can imagine how irritating that kind of thing would be to the proprietors of a newspaper, with no time to get the decision altered before the poll was taken. That case alone is sufficient to justify any one in voting for the repeal of the regulation, to say nothing of the instances quoted by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Blakey.</inline></para>

                        by the Duke de Morny, at the beginning of last month, has a significant bearing upon the present conscription crisis. It furnishes abundant proof of the assertions of anti-conscriptionists that Australia can do far better than drain herself of the whole of her able-bodied men. The article is entitled, &#34; A Message from Russia,&#34; and in it the writer says - &#34; I landed in England two clays ago, direct from Russia, where I have spent over a year. During that time I have been at the Court, I have met the Czar, the Grand Dukes, and the heads of the Government Departments. I have been far afield with the Russian armies; I have watched the transformation that has come over them, and how they have gradually been reorganized and re-equipped after the great retreat of 1015; I have been amongst the peasants in the villages, and I have talked with the sturdy Cossacks from the Don and the Amur. I bring this message to England, as I shall take it to France. It is an appeal that comes from the united heart of a mighty people - in which the Czar himself and the humblest private join. It is addressed to the munition makers of England and France. &#34; Send us more heavy guns, more rifles, more machine guns, and yet more ammunition. Do not stop for an hour. If necessary, keep more of your men out of the trenches, and send them to the factories. We have men, countless millions, who are waiting and longing to march against the Huns. They cannot move until they are armed and equipped. You have the brains, the skill, and the resources to make what we require. We will promise you to crush the common enemy and invade his soil, if only you will send us what we want.&#34;

This abuse of power could have been exercised with only one object - to prevent the people knowing all the facts on the question of conscription. Now that all this worry and irritation, and in some cases expense, has been caused to the people and to various newspapers, we are told by the Minister for Defence that we should allow it to go on ; but we should not be worthy of a seat in the Senate if we did not vote to curtail the power which has been so grossly and flagrantly misused. </para>

                        <para>- I presume for publishing it. When one sees other messages starred and headlined, including a message from Jacka, the story of <inline font-weight="bold">Mrs. Hughes&#39;</inline> unfortunate experience with the burglar a message from General Haig, and soldiers&#39; letters from the front, and this message refused publication, every man whose brain is not perverted must admit that the censorship has been conducted in a biased and partisan way. The Senate ought to raise a warning finger to the censor, telling him that it intends to see that his abuse of his powers is watched and curtailed. He should be told that anything he does in the future will receive our closest scrutiny. He can take this motion as a decisive and necessary lesson, showing that we do not intend to permit unbridled and unlicensed censorship in the future. I shall do nothing which would hinder the Government in the successful prosecution of the war. I shall help them with any recruiting scheme, or in any other way in my power ; but while I can prevent it I shall not allow something to continue which inflicts irritation and trouble on the people at a time when we need a*ll our unanimity and every ounce of our solidarity. I shall vote for the motion in the hope .that the censor will take it as a warning to endeavour in the future, in dealing with pamphlets and newspapers, to hold the scales fairly and evenly, giving exactly the same treatment to every section and every political party. </para>

                            <para>- The Minister said that everything to the detriment of Australia, as one of the most important self-governing Dominions, and to Great Britain herself, could be published through the repeal of Regulation 204. But, although he professed to believe that all these ill-effects would follow, he actually, earlier in the afternoon, acquiesced in that action being taken by the Senate without attempting to offer a note of warning. When the motion standing in <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Blakey&#39;s</inline> name was called by the  Clerk  this afternoon, the three Ministers and the whole of their eight supporters were in the chamber. I had just arrived within the bar about half-a-minute before, and was waiting for <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner,</inline> or the Whip, or <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Mullan,</inline> with whom <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Blakey</inline> had been in communication regarding the matter, to call &#34; Not formal.&#34; None of them did, nor did any of the three Ministers or their eight supporters. Thinking the  matter was worth discussion, and not knowing if any arrangement had been come to by my colleagues, I, on the impulse of the moment, called, &#34; Not formal,&#34; otherwise there would have been no discussion. Was <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> agreeable that a regulation of the gravity which he says this one possesses should have been brushed aside, as he knows it is going to be now, without his uttering one word of protest? Either he is insincere or he is not fit to hold his present position, in view of the case he tried to buttress up to-day as to the dangers that would confront Australia in the event of the regulation being repealed. Was it the intention of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> and his colleagues and supporters to thrust Australia in the vortex of this calamity for the sake of obtaining what he might believe to be a party advantage, in order that he and his party might be able to go to the country and say, &#34; Look what the Labour majority in the Senate did &#34; ? I think, when <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> sees his speech of this afternoon in cold type in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> he will be sorry for his utterance, because it was most rash, most ill-advised, and most inaccurate. Is it to go out to the world that the Leader of the Government in the highest Chamber of the National Parliament of Australia made such grave and serious statements as to the effect of German influence, not only in Australia, but in the Parliament itself ? What will the Kaiser think of that? We have been asked to consider what the Kaiser would think of the action of Australia on the referendum on 28th October, and I am entitled to ask what the Kaiser will think of this statement that Germany has friends in the Parliament of Australia? </para>

His  remarks followed directly upon the old and unfounded charge concerning the spending of German gold in this country, and, in answer to an interjection by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating</inline> - &#34; If you know that German gold is coming in to German agents, why don&#39;t you deal with them?&#34; <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> replied - &#34; We have, and when we dealt with them we found that those German agents were not without friends in Parliament.&#34; I venture to say that is almost an exact reproduction of the actual passage of words that occurred. If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> did not mean this Parliament, why did he not say so when he was challenged by his colleague <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Needham,</inline> and others, who asked him to give the names of the members who he alleged were friends of German agents who received German gold for distribution in Australia for anti-British purposes? What would we think if we could read of a statement in the German Reichstag by Bethman-Hollweg - I mention him because I do not know who else would be the counterpart of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> in the German Parliament - to the effect that the British Government had friends in the Parliament of Germany? Would we not regard that as a hopeful sign that Great Britain was getting a good foothold in Germany? And, therefore, is it not reasonable to assume, on the authority of the statement made by the Minister for Defence to-day, that the German people will think that they are doing all right, because, according to the Minister for Defence, they have friends in the Parliament of Australia? The German people would, of course, be entitled to think that the position is improving because of a statement made, not only on the authority of our Minister for War, but on the authority also of our Prime Minister. I spoke in no insincere vein this afternoon when I ventured the opinion that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce,</inline> at the rate they are going, are about the best friends that Germany has in Australia at the present time. Their attitude threatens to disrupt Australia. I should think that their reason would come to their aid and save them. I know that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> is only emulating <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes,</inline> and is running amok after him. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> has become desperate, because he has been seriously disappointed since he came back to Australia. I am entitled also to ask what does the Kaiser think of the British crisis ? </para>

We would like to know also what the British papers really have to say about the British crisis, for which <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> was in part responsible, because during his visit to the Old Country he was the tool of the Northcliffe press, which for the past twelve months has been endeavouring to break up the British Cabinet at any price in the interests of the Conservative party.

                            <para>- Only that I heard other honorable senators this afternoon, when talking about the placard, ask what would the Kaiser think of it, and I was assuming that, as a discussion had taken rather a wide range, I might follow their example. However, I shall have an opportunity to-morrow of pursuing this theme, and for the moment I shall leave it. It appears to me that the Government and the Opposition which is keeping them in power should, in the interests of Australia and of Great Britain, bring a little pressure to bear upon <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> - if they do so, I am sure <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> will drop in behind them - with regard to the administration of the censorship regulations. It is well known that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> was responsible for the censorship prior to the referendum. We had indisputable evidence of that fact in the instructions against the printing of caricatures and all that sort of thing concerning him. Altogether the instructions are most ridiculous. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> was good enough to tell us this afternoon that regulations agreed to by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> were overruled by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes.</inline> Everybody knows that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes,</inline> particularly in the application of the censorship, which this motion seeks to wipe out, was a self-appointed dictator, but I do not think that the Democracy of Australia, just at present, is prepared to stand a dictator either in censorship or in any other matter. </para>

                            <para>- We. would have no freedom in Australia if the honorable senator&#39;s leader had had his way on the 28th October. The honorable senator is now sitting behind <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes,</inline> and, of course, is a most servile supporter, ready to agree to anything that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> does. If the regulation is to be excised, and if the Government accept the suggestion by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner,</inline> and bring forward the legislation needed to prevent any grave results following upon the dangers pointed out by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> this afternoon, I feel sure there will be no opposition in this Chamber. When this regulation is wiped out, the present censorship will be done away with, and when the question of appointing fresh censors comes before the Government, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> will be well advised if he would exercise a little more discretion in the selection of such officials. Apart from <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes&#39;</inline> dictatorship, fully half of the anomalies which have been quoted in the Senate were due to want of knowledge on the part of the censors as to their duties. In Queensland, a gentleman named Captain Coxon was appointed Chief Censor, and during the referendum campaign he was so biased in favour of conscription that when the correspondents of the country papers - those papers that were advocating &#34;No&#34; during the campaign - went to him with their articles dealing with the issue, he not only used to refuse to pass them, but he told them straight - &#34; I will not take any more of those damned lies. You are sending this stuff to violent publications like the Innisfail <inline font-style="italic">Democrat,</inline> and it is taken from that vile  publication  the <inline font-style="italic">Baily Standard.&#34;</inline> This man used to work himself into a passion when, he was refusing good argumentative stuff in the interests of the anti-conscription cause. We know that many of the censors, prior to their appointment, occupied positions in drapers&#39; shops and other callings. The office of censor, in my judgment, requires a certain amount of journalistic training. Captain Coxon, before his appointment, followed the occupation of a clerk in the Works Department of Queensland. He might have been a very excellent clerk, but it does not follow that he was a good judge of journalistic material. In my opinion, men of journalistic experience should have received these appointments. Fewer of these gentlemen will bo needed, I hope, when the overplus is done away with, and care should be taken in the selection of those who are appointed. I sincerely trust that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> will not repeat the rash statements he made here this afternoon, and that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> will steady up on his wild rampage. I do not think that these empty assertions about German gold are cutting any ice. If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> honestly think that they do, they are welcome to the slight consolation; but I think that they are doing great harm to </para>

                        GOULD (New South Wales) &#91;9.1&#93;.- This debate is another evidence of the undesirability of having too much legislation by means of regulations. I have frequently protested here against the exercise of the powers given in various Acts to deal with very many matters by way of regulation. We know that a regulation, if it goes beyond the powers given by the authorizing Act, has in a court of law no effect. Whether the regulation under consideration goes beyond that point may be a matter of conflict of opinion amongst honorable senators; but I would remind them that Ave are not dealing now with a question which Would arise in the ordinary course of our legislation. The Government have had a very important duty thrust upon them. They have been called upon to exercise very wide and drastic powers, and these powers were deliberately placed in their hands by honorable senators. It must be recognised that it is quite impossible to provide by Act of Parliament for a multiplicity, of matters which have to be dealt with by the Government at a time like the present crisis. It has been stated that for a period of two years the Government were able to get along without this regulation. But when honorable senators made that remark they were entirely oblivious of the fact that the Government had not the power to make such regulations until the last amendment of the War Precautions Act came into force - that is the 30th May, 1916 - and that the regulation which it is proposed to annul or repeal was passed on the 30th August last. It is a very singular thing that the honorable senators who are protesting against the administration of that regulation assisted to bring it into force, because they were supporting the Government of the day. The regulation was introduced, but not one word of protest was heard from any of these honorable senators. When I find that certain honorable senators who were members of the late Government are objecting to the regulation to-day,
                    </para>
                    <para class="block">I ask where they were during the period from the 30th August, when the regulation was assented to by the Governor-General, to the 25th October, when they saw fit to leave the Government? Not because of this regulation, or any alleged abuse of it, but because of a new regulation which had been passed, I believe by the Executive Council, though it was not allowed to take effect, probably in consequence of Ministers finding that a mistake had been made, in attempting to thrust upon the people of the country a regulation which evidently was not acceptable to a large majority of their followers in Parliament. That was the ostensible reason given for not allowing the regulation to take effect. The honorable gentlemen to whom I have referred were willing to remain in the Cabinet while the referendum campaign was proceeding, and it was not until almost the last moment that they took the dramatic action of retiring from the Cabinet. The Military Service Referendum Bill was discussed in the Senate a month before the vote was taken, but not one word was said in regard to the regulation which we are debating to-day. In this debate, honorable senators have attempted to say that they see no objection to a regulation of this character, but they object to the way in which, it has been administered. If the regulation has been administered wrongly, that is no reason why it should be destroyed, but it is a reason why those who have so acted, if they have, should be destroyed, whether it be the censors or the Government. After having allowed matters to go as they did, honorable senators are now condemning themselves by the protest they are making. As regards many of the. matters which have been referred to to-night, I consider that the censor acted very wisely and prudently in striking out the passages, and so preventing their publication in the press. </para>

                            <para>- Yes; but I arn not aware that anybody has said that this particular regulation has not been administered according to democratic ideas. In this debate we cannot, unfortunately, get away from the cleavage which recently happened on the question of conscription. Honorable senators do not seem to be able to bring themselves to the consideration of this matter in a dry, practical way, and see what the regulation really means. Is it a wise, sensible regulation in itself? If it be so, as I think has been generally admitted, we should have very drastic powers in the hands of the Government. The censors act as officers under the Government, who are responsible politically for any mistakes or errors which are made in the exercise of the powers. I do not think that the Government are attempting to evade that responsibility. If this regulation is wise, would not the Senate act sensibly in retaining it? Honorable senators may point out what they consider to be errors of administration. It is for the Government to see if they cannot rectify any errors which have crept in. I do not believe that they are entirely convinced as to the occurrence of errors. It should be borne in mind that it is much better to have a strict censorship than a lax one. It is better that the publication of many matters should be suppressed rather than that the regulation should be administered with so much laxity that an opportunity would be given to some persons, not only to assist the enemy directly, but also, in au indirect way, to create ill-feeling amongst the community, in consequence of things which are dead and gone. We know that the picture show which was being boomed by the poster referred to by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Blakey</inline> was calculated to cause a recurrence of a bitter feeling which, unfortunately,  existed many years ago in  Ireland  in connexion with the administration of.  that  country. </para>

                            <para>- The honorable senator said nothing about the show, but he objected to an advertisement of the show being suppressed. He objected to a certain portion of the poster being excised which was calculated to create an unpleasant feeling, and cause persons who felt an old enmity arising in their minds to go and&#39; see the show, and get that enmity strengthened. Do not honorable senators realize to the full extent that no nation, when it is in a death grip as our nation is, can hope or deserve to Be successful if it is going to allow itself to be split &#39; up into different sections - fighting one against the other, when there are matters of much greater importance to be considered. In this chamber we have strong differences of opinion on political matters, but are we not all bound together in a bond of common unity to protect ourselves as a body ? As it is with a community, so it is with a nation, and so it is with a family. </para>

                            <para>- No; the late Government, who were supported by these very honorable senators, were quite willing to take the assistance of the Liberals in order to carry on the business of the country; but now, because honorable senators have had a disagreement with the Government, because there has been a family quarrel in the Caucus, and a large number of men have put themselves in direct opposition to their previous leaders, it is a crime for the  Liberals  to continue in the line of policy which they adopted at the very commencement of the war. I think that the financial proposals put forward yesterday are calculated to bring in more revenue than the previous proposals. </para>

                            <para>- I agree, sir, that it is. Honorable senators may realize from what I have said that in this matter I support the Government, not only because I believe it is their intention to do all they can in connexion with the trouble with which we are at present confronted, but also because I believe that the regulation taken exception to is a wise one, and &#34;should be adhered to. It is an amendment of a previous regulation, and was issued because the Government from their experience of the previous regulation during the short time it was in force came to the conclusion that wider powers were required to protect the interests of the community under existing circumstances. I hope that honorable senators will deal with the matter from the point of view of what is right and proper at the present time, and will not allow themselves to be carried away because of any alleged or actual abuse of the regulation. If there has been actual abuse of the power it confers steps should, of course, be taken to put a stop to it. But honorable senators should not forget that these regulations have to be administered by fallible instruments, that different men have different minds, and will differ in their conclusions with respect to the same case. When they find that there is a determination on the part of the Government to do what is best in the public interests, the only duty that devolves upon them as honest and patriotic men is to support the Government in the circumstances. </para>

                        <para>.- When speaking in connexion with the no-conscription campaign throughout the country, I believed that the prejudices of the capitalistic press were to be blamed for the fact that they ignored the arguments used by the advocates of no-conscription during the campaign. From the disclosures which have been made in the Senate to-day, I have been led to believe that the omission of our utterances on the public platforms from the columns of the press was not due in any sense to the press but to the censor. I have been led to believe that this modest regulation, which we were unsuspicious of, was the cause of the apparently partial attitude taken up by certain newspapers during the referendum campaign. I feel somewhat disappointed at the attitude. of the Minister for Defence in dealing with this motion.  His  speech was tantamount to a charge that every member of the Senate and of this Parliament who is opposed to the views of the Government is simply a pro-German. I thought that now that a decision hai, been arrived at by the referendum the animus shown during the campaign would have ceased, but without the slightest provocation the Minister for Defence has to-day &#39; repeated in the same venomous manner charges which have caused so much feeling and resentment between those who should be united at this particular time. If such charges are to be repeated continually they will hinder not only the work of Parliament but the carrying on of the&#39; War. </para>

I say that the attitude assumed by the Minister for Defence will not assist to reconcile the differences created in connexion with the conscription referendum. I rose to protest particularly against the honorable senator&#39;s utterances concerning the attitude of the coal miners in creating a position of affairs which has induced him to suggest that they were practically the agents of Germany. I wish to utter my protest against the miners of the Commonwealth being regarded in any sense whatever as the agents of Germany. I claim that there are no more loyal subjects of the Commonwealth than are the members of this working class community. It is a libel upon honest workers of - this country to make such a suggestion as that which has been made by the Minister for Defence. I direct the attention of the Senate to the fact that some twelve months ago when shipping was required for the carriage of wheat across the seas, the coal miners were willing to produce coal, but could not find bottoms in which to ship it, and thousands of them were rendered unemployed. </para>

                            <para>- I should be the last man to suggest such a thing, but I thought it right to give the reason which prompted me to make these references at this juncture. I do not wish to allow an opportunity such as this to pass without lodging my protest on behalf of a body of men who are as loyal and true to the Empire as are any other citizens of the Commonwealth, against the statements made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce.</inline> I need not try to justify my claim in support of the loyalty of these men, which I am sure is accepted by the community. I regret very much that the Minister for Defence should have made such a statement as that to which I have taken exception. It is not true, and the utterance of such statements tends to irritate honorable senators who are here to defend the interests of the persons charged, and who are not prepared to have loyal citizens of the Commonwealth treated unjustly. The insinuation that in opposing this regulation we are trying to interfere with the right of the Government to control utterances of the press or of individuals which might in any way play into the hands of our enemy, and the attitude adopted by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> only discloses that bias which gives rise to feeling which, if continued, must prevent the unanimity of action which we require for the proper conduct of the affairs of Parliament and the prosecution of the war. I yield to no man in my desire to protect the Government of this country from utterances or statements which might be used to play into the hands of the enemy, or to militate against the successful prosecution of thewar. </para>

                        <para>. - This afternoon the Leader of the Government in the Senate, in the course of his very heated speech, made a number of remarks which even he will regret upon calmer consideration. As a member of the Senate who for sixteen years has been closely associated politically and personally with the honorable senator, it is with very deep regret and great reluctance that I have to take the most emphatic exception to the tone of his speech this afternoon. I know that interjections are disorderly, but many of us fall into the habit at times, and while <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> was speaking I happened to make an interjection and the honorable senator, in the heat of his speech, which could not be said to have been engendered by any misrepresentation from this side, said something about German money and German friends being not only in Australia, but in the Federal Parliament. </para>

                            <para>- What did <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> mean? I hope that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> will remain calm, because we know what will happen if he lets himself - go. By the mass of evidence which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Blakey</inline> brought forward in support of his motion this afternoon, all but those who are determined not to be convinced must have been satisfied that this regulation is inimical to the freedom of this country. The evidence he brought forward was supplemented later by other speakers, including <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ready,</inline> who gave concrete instances of the operation of the censorship under this regulation in Hobart during the referendum campaign. The evidence submitted must convince every fair-minded man that it would be better to revert to the Original regulation of which this is an amendment. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> in his defence of the regulation said he wished it to go forth through the columns of the newspapers that those who will vote for the motion to disallow the regulation are friends of Germany. No other construction could be put upon the honorable senator&#39;s speech. Knowing, as the honorable senator does, the men who have worked by his side for sixteen years in this Parliament, and have given him such loyal support as any public man could expect to receive, I say that the honorable senator should have been ashamed to make the remarks he made this afternoon. The Minister for Defence is not the only member who is entitled to get warm on this subject. When a few interjections were made during the course of his speech - reasonable interjections - he answered them with a tirade of abuse of those honorable senators who intend to vote for this motion. He said that there were many friends of Germany in Australia, and that she had friends in Parliament. If he did not say that, I did not catch his words. The inference was that Germany has friends in this Parliament. </para>

                            <para>- When the Minister affirmed that the agents of Germany had friends in Parliament, I asked him, by way of interjection, to name them, i,nd he replied, &#34; Let those whom the cap &#34;lswear it.&#34; There can be no question that the whole tenor of his speech this afternoon was calculated to create in the minds of the readers of the newspapers from one end of Australia to the other the impression that those who vote to disallow this regulation are the friends of Germany. </para>

Those who opposed conscription were described as the friends of Germany, as associates of the Industrial Workers of the World, and believers in their methods, and, indeed, were called everything that was bad. How is it that the powers of the censor, which were so ruthlessly enforced in the case of anti-conscriptionist newspapers, were not applied to the powerful journals of this country? On the very day before the vote was taken, the big Melbourne newspapers published in large headlines, &#34; Those who vote &#39; No &#39; will give a vote for Germany, and to desert the boys in the trenches.&#34; </para>

                            <para>- Here is another friend of Germany. When the people of Australia decided that they would not fasten this compulsory military curse upon the country, it was natural that the German newspapers should crow, seeing that the Prime Minister and the journals which supported him had repeatedly urged that if a &#34; No &#34; vote was recorded  it would be a vote in favour of Germany. </para>

                            <para>- Yes, and the Prime Minister was to blame for that. Quite enough instances have been brought forward to-day to prove that the powers of the censorship were most unfairly used during the recent referendum campaign. Whilst I do not wish to occupy time by adding to those instances, there is one case which I must mention. It will serve to show the length to which the censors were allowed to go. A few days before the vote was taken, I was speaking from anti-conscription platforms in Hobart and its suburbs. There was a secretary of the anti-conscriptionist movement there, and, naturally, he was doing all that he could to fight conscription. At the meetings that were held he made it a practice to take up a collection in order to defray the cost of the literature that was distributed amongst the people in condemnation of conscription. A few days before the poll he received a notice from the military censor in Hobart intimating that if he attempted to take up any further collections for the purpose indicated he would be prosecuted. I do not blame the Minister for Defence or the Prime Minister for that. It merely goes to show the sort of persons who had power placed in their hands under this regulation. Of course, the officer was exceeding his powers. But he took the step which he did under a regulation- </para>

                            <para>- At all events, the instruction was issued that no further funds should &#34;be collected. This afternoon, in replying to that portion of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Blakey&#39;s</inline> speech which dealt with the censoring of a proposed exhibition of films dealing with Irish history, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> declared, in very warm language, that if that question had been raised it would have thrown the country into a turmoil. That was a childish remark to make, because there is not an Irishman in Australia, or a descendant of an&#39; Irish-  man, who does not know something about Irish history. </para>

                            <para>- My quarrel with the Minister is that it is childish for him to say that the exhibition referred to would have stirred them up. There is a good deal of trouble in Ireland to-day, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> well knows. The Minister implied that we should not refer to past Irish history, because&#39; it would stir up ol&#39;d feuds, and prevent not only Irishmen in Ireland, but Irishmen and their descendants in Australia from enlisting. Let us be honest with ourselves. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> knows, as we all know, that Ireland to-day is under martial rule, if not entirely, to a very large extent. If the British authorities gave Ireland what she ought to have had long ago, and what they promised to her - self-government - so that they could withdraw their Forces from Ireland, the 100,000 extra troops which we were supposed to get under conscription in Australia would not have mattered, because they would have got that number from Ireland. In the circumstances, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce&#39;s</inline> remark that the article quoted by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Blakey</inline> this afternoon would have stirred up strife if it had not been censored was a foolish one. </para>

                            <para>- I believe that the honorable senator is to-day, as he always was, an ardent Home Ruler; that is why I. cannot understand his remark this afternoon. Another instance quoted by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Blakey</inline> was an article written for the <inline font-style="italic">Labour Gall</inline> on the coal strike, and censored. It was stated by interjection from this side, when <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Blakey</inline> was speaking, that if that article had been published it would have been only -telling the truth. I tell <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> now that if the Prime Minister had shown the strength that Australia fondly hoped for many years that, he , possessed, if he had been the strong man that we painted him, and believed him to be, there would have been no coal strike, and the tens of thousands of men and women who to-day are idle would still be following their usual occupations. The trouble was caused by the weakness of the man who, as Prime Minister, rules the destinies of this country - the man who, for some months past, according to his actions, has been not only Prime Minister, but the whole of the Government rolled into one, for we know that many of his actions have not been approved of by his own Ministers, over whom he has ridden roughshod. If he had shown the same amount of strength a day or two before the strike commenced, or within a day or two afterwards, that we all supposed he possessed, there would almost certainly have been no coal strike. </para>

                            <para>- It is quite possible for a dictator to be a weak man. He was a dictator when it came to dictating terms to the representatives of the workers, but he was weak when it came to facing the coal mine-owners. Any one who reads closely the speeches at the two conferences, will see that the whole burden of his complaint was addressed to one side only. </para>

I shall vote for the motion, because, like <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> and others, I feel that it is absolutely dangerous to the freedom of the people ot this country that such drastic powers should remain in the hands of the Prime Minister. He has shown, if ever a man did, the most absolute partisanship in connexion with the censorship. Every one of us knows that statements which would have educated the people on the question to be decided at the referendum were not allowed to be published. We also know that practically everything the conscriptionist speakers liked to say, ur the conscriptionist press liked to write, was allowed to be printed. Because of the bitter, unscrupulous partisanship shown by the Prime Minister from one end of the campaign to the other, it will be a very good thing for ,the people of this country if the regulation is wiped out of existence and something more in conformity with the wishes and freedom of. the community substituted. </para>

                        (New South Wales; &#91;9.52&#93;. - Before the recent adjournment, i asked  tUe Minister for Defence if we could expect a fair deal under the regulations. At that time, and for some little time before, it had seemed to me that the War Precautions Act was not being administered by the Government as it ought to have been. In reply,
                        <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline>
                        assured me that, subject to the regulations, we should get practically a fair deal. I shall vote for this motion, because in New South Wales we did not have a fair deal in the campaign. Not only was our literature censored almost out of recognition, but the local press, which sometimes does give the Labour side a small share of publicity, almost entirely shut down on the whole of our speakers. I am inclined to think now that they did this, not altogether out of opposition to anti-conscription and to Labour, but at the instigation of those administering the regulations under the War Precautions Act. But, on the whole, I do not think we lost very much  through their action. It is very annoying, of course, to see one&#39;s opponents day after day securing column after column, and page after page, of the morning and evening papers, while the side one is supporting is absolutely ignored. But ever since we became a party we have had almost all the newspapers opposed to us, and therefore it is no new thing to us to be opposed by the local press of New South Wales. The situation had this big advantage, that the public came out as they never did before, for I never saw them so interested in any question as they were in the one that has just been decided. Personally, it does not very much concern me that the regulation was administered so drastically as it was, but I do not want to take any further risks with this Ministry. I took quite enough with the last, and shall vote for the repeal of the regulation, because I believe the Government have ample powers under the previous one. If I thought the carrying of the motion would even in the remotest degree assist the Central Powers I should not give it my support, but I believe the regulation has been, and is being, used, not against the Central Powers, or their agents, but against all those Australians who oppose the present Government. For that reason, I shall vote for its repeal.

                        <para>. - I have listened in vain for some reasonable- argument that would justify the annulling of the regulation. I expected something tangible to be brought forward, but, so far as I can see, it is being used simply as a cloak for an attack, not on the censor, but on the Prime Minister through the censor. This has simply been a continuation of the debate we had yesterday. Not one of those who have spoken this afternoon has shown that the regulation ought to be annulled, because the censors have not done their duty. The reason they have given is that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> has too much power. </para>

                            <para>- I am not concerned with that. The regulation was laid on the table of the House on the 13th September. Not a single senator in the chamber at the time took exception to it, but on the 21st September, a week after, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ferricks</inline> moved the adjournment of the Senate for the purpose of discussing the conduct of the censors. All this business is a show, and nothing* else. If honorable senators believed that they were giving too much power to the Government, why did they not, at that time, seize the opportunity to prevent any further power being given? </para>

                            <para>- <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ready</inline> says he did not think there would be such a misuse of the power of censorship, and yet we find that, a week afterwards, when <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ferricks</inline> raised the question, additional power was given to the Government. The whole argument, therefore, falls to the ground. When <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ferricks</inline> moved the adjournment of the debate on the occasion referred to, he incidentally mentioned something that had taken place in Adelaide, but was not quite accurate, and had to be corrected by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Newland,</inline> and the matter of these regulations has been dealt with in much the same way. When <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> rose to reply to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ferricks</inline> on the occasion referred to, he proved the absolute need there was for the censorship and the. necessity for greater power. I am not permitted by the rules of debate to quote what was said then, but, if I were, I could show that the need exists to-day as then, for the increased censorship power. In their treatment of this motion to-day, honorable senators ought to have shown, not that the censors were exceeding their duty, but that the increased powers complained of were not necessary for the safety of the Commonwealth. They did not do that, and therefore they failed to prove their case. </para>

                            <para>- But I point out that when <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ferricks</inline> moved the adjournment of the debate, the honorable senator allowed the matter to pass without taking any exception to it. Amongst other things referred to on that occasion was the anxiety, on behalf of persons who had friends on board the transports, to know when the vessels were about to leave, but the Minister demonstrated how necessary it was to keep the movements of all transports secret. In spite of that, our friends would now open the floodgates. They have become uncommonly sensitive regarding statements concerning German gold, and I suggest that they should read a work called <inline font-style="italic">The World in the Crucible,</inline> as well as another work entitled <inline font-style="italic">The German Conspiracies in America.</inline> These will disclose the German conspiracies in America, and honorable senators will be able to understand the operation of the German press bureau in that country, the purpose of which is to print and circulate lies against the Allies in an endeavour to prejudice the great mass of the American people against Britain. </para>

                            <para>- Those of us who have passed&#34; q through many campaigns know how difficult it has been to get money to carry on, but in South Australia during the referendum campaign we saw advertisements, published on behalf of the anti-conscriptionist cause, that must have cost five, if not ten, times as much as the advertising in any previous campaign. If that money did not come from the Germans - I do not say that it did- </para>

                            <para>- If it did not come from the Germans, all I can say is that the anti-conscriptionists must have touched wonderful springs of benevolence in the hearts of some of their people. I am not imputing that it did come from the Germans, though I have been told that those collecting money for Australia Day, at Murray Bridge, where several Germans live, had to be content with ls., but when it was a matter of contributing to the anti-conscriptionist cause they could rely upon getting <inline font-style="italic">&#163;1</inline> from the same gentlemen. </para>

                            <para>- If the honorable senator will look at the <inline font-style="italic">Mail,</inline> he will find that petitions are being signed calling upon <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Dankel</inline> to resign, and even as late as last Saturday night that paper was urging those who had petitions to send them in. As I have already said, supporters of the motion have failed to show that this increased power of censorship is not necessary. In order to demonstrate that such power is not required, they would have to prove that the conditions to-day were better than they were when the regulation was passed. But carried away as they have been by a false vision, a false conception, and a false estimate entirely of the ability of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> and of the sacrifices <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> has made, under cover of a motion like this they now want to deprive the Government of the power conferred upon them by this regulation. Can it bc said that any man who would take, away the whole of the power contained in the original regulation is a friend&#34; of Australia, or a friend of the Allies ? This comes with a very bad grace from my friend <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner,</inline> who, when he was speaking on this question, declared that he would strip the Prime Minister, not only of the power contained in the amended regulation, but of the whole power of the original regulation. </para>

                            <para>- The honorable senator did not qualify his statement in that way. He said. &#34; We will strip him of that power and go further still.&#34; A misuse bf a power is no reason why the Government should be deprived of power- It is a reason, when a case is proved, that the Government should be condemned or ejected, but it is not a reason for emasculating the statute-book. Honorable senators know that repeatedly I have objected to government by regulation.  It is a strange thing that those against whom I have had to battle in the past want to annul this particular regulation. If we had had more government by legislation, and less government by regulation, it is possible that this debate would not have taken place. I will not consent to strip the Government of this particular power until legislation is brought forward to take the place of the regulation. </para>

                            <para>- The regulation, gives to the Government, not absolute powers, but prescribed powers. My honorable friends will take away the powers which relate to the war. They claim that they are valiant soldiers in this matrter, and that they are prepared to stand behind the Government in prosecuting the war. One means of prosecuting the) war is by withholding from the foe that, which would be useful to him. Another means is by withholding from the people themselves that which would be detrimental to them concerning the war. Yet our honorable friends wish to take the power away from the Government. They have failed absolutely to show that there is a justifiable reason for restricting the power. The whole of their argument has been in the direction of showing that censors have made a wrong use of the power. It is a condemnation of the censors, but the main aim is to hit the Prime Minister as far as possible. I sincerely hope that our honorable friends will be consistent and say, if they are going to stand behind the Government, &#34; Having ventilated our views on this matter, we. as men, will withdraw the motion and stand behind the Government.&#34; This  is no  time to be divided, or to be quibbling- over things of this kind. The  war  is being dealt with as if it was a piece o: ancient history instead of a thing which is becoming more vivid and  more  gruesome every day. </para>

It may mean that I shall never enter this Parliament again.&#34; My honorable friends have said to me, &#34; So far as we can, we shall see that you do not enter this Parliament again.&#34; Is that the right way for men to act who are complaining of want of liberty ? These are the gentlemen who are calling upon the people to witness that they have been bound hand and foot, and have not liberty. What liberty do they need! They want not liberty, but licence, to do what they please. If our honorable friends will be honest and true to the conscience which they possess they will say, &#34; Instead of voting for this motion we will withdraw it.

We have expressed our opinion of both <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> and the censors, but we refuse absolutely to divest the Government of a power which they should have to govern the Commonwealth.&#34; </para>

                            <para>- Undoubtedly. We are living in abnormal times. War is an abnormal condition. I cannot understand why honorable senators should urge that the machinery of the censorship should be materially impaired, even if they can ,point to isolated acts of injudicious administration. The machinery must remain. When honorable senators say that the censorship is not properly exercised, let them reflect that there is a very much larger power in the hands of the Administration, in the hands of the Minister for Defence in particular. Will they urge that that much larger power has been injudiciously administered, and even if it has been, will they argue that the power should be  withdrawn ? We know that, in effect, the <inline font-style="italic">Habeas Corpus</inline> Act is suspended. It has been ruled by the High Court that the Minister for Defence can intern any person who he believes is inimical to the public safety, and need not give reasons for so doing. Are honorable senators challenging that very much greater power than the one which can be exercised by the censor? Undoubtedly not. They hardly dare to do it. </para>

                            <para>- Has he not? There have been many cases of its exercise, and one has been reviewed by the High Court. This fact indicates how necessary it is that we must have a censorship over all kinds of publications during this abnormal period. Have not honorable senators seen statements to the effect that Germans, high in the confidence of the German Government, have acknowledged that that Government have spent no less than &#163;10,000,000 in endeavouring to influence the press in neutral countries? I venture to say that the unfortunate result of the referendum vote which was taken in Australia a month ago has done more than the Germans have been able to secure by their propaganda work at a self-confessed expenditure of &#163;10,000,000. I do not intend to mention the names of neutral countries, but within the last week or two statements have appeared in Australian newspapers, taken from American publications, to the effect that a hitherto pro-Ally neutral European nation had been practically converted into a pro- German nation through the expenditure of German gold on publications in that country. Two or three evenings ago there was in the <inline font-style="italic">Herald</inline> an article indicative of the fact that public opinion in Holland was being extensively influenced by the use of German gold and German propaganda. It is quite patent that German influence is being extensively exercised in Java, which is not very far from Australia. And quite recently I had occasion to take an interest in the French possessions in the Far East. I found that the French colonial press, which&#39; is admittedly as patriotic as any colonial press in the world, is being subjected to a very rigid censorship in the interests of France and her Allies. One journal in particular published in Saigon had column after column in issue after issue blank because the matter which the editor thought would be newsy and breezy for his subscribers was considered by the censor to be injudicious matter for publication. Probably the censor was correct. Of course, editors want to publish what will interest their subscribers, and censors very properly wish to prevent the publication of what they think would be inimical to the best interests of the nation. There seems to be an eternal conflict between editor and censor. I am not going to say that German gold is being expended in Australia, at the present time. Such a scientist as Huxley said that there was no certainty that the sun would rise to-morrow morning, that there was only a high degree of probability that it would. Although I am not quite certain that German gold is being profusely spent in Australia, or has been spent here since the war began, I say that there is a very high degree of probability that it has been spent, and is being spent. Because it would be singular if this British possession, in which there is one-tenth of the white population of the Empire, should be exempt from the German propaganda. I, being a man of common sense, state that I do believe that there is a high degree of probability that German gold is being expended here. </para>

                            <para>- Let the honor able senator ask me who is getting German money in America. Those persons have been getting German money who have been in a position to most carefully and satisfactorily wield their influence on behalf of German interest if it has been expended. I am not going to impair the censor&#39;s machinery by my vote. I believe that the members of the Hughes Ministry, although I may differ from them in many matters of domestic politics, are patriots and honest men, and are endeavouring to do their best in the interest of the Empire at the present juncture, and I certainly, seeing the most extensive powers which are reposed, and properly reposed, in the Minister for Defence, am not going to curtail the administration of the censor&#39;s department in any very important matter. </para>

                            <para>- As for that. I may say that the days of Tom Glassey are passed, and now the man that certain individuals are hurling bricks at is <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> - the man who made the union that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Turley</inline> is a member of. At that time that union was &#34; black-legging &#34; on the other unions of Australia, because its members were working for 25 per cent, less wages than were the members of any other union in Australia at the time. It was not until <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> came along, lifted them up, and put them on a level with the members of other unions, that they got the same wages as men in similar employment elsewhere. Now, then, I challenge <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Turley</inline> to show what he has done for his old work mates that will compare with the achievements of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes. Senator Turley</inline> knew perfectly well that he was wrong in his statement as to the society that I addressed, and tried to mislead the Senate on the matter. I have a few things to say before this fight is over. I know the character of some honorable senators, and their history in connexion with trade unionism. </para>

                            <para>- I do not think so. There were delegates from the Women&#39;s Trade Union at the meeting which I addressed, and they were not snubbed. That sort of thing is left to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ferricks,</inline> and to hurl every insult he can at <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes,</inline> who is the greatest trade unionist in Australia. The societies affiliated with the National Council of Women are numerous. Many of them are charitable, and some of them nursing societies, but there are some women&#39;s trade unions affiliated with the body I addressed, and for the better knowledge of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Turley,</inline> I am going to give their names. The first I mention is the Women&#39;s Branch of the Federated Hotel, Club. Restaurant, and Caterers&#39; Employees Union. The next is the Victorian Lady Teachers Association; the next the Victorian Women&#39;s Post and Telegraph Association, and the fourth the Women&#39;s Shorthand and Typists Association. This shows that there are trade unions represented on the body I addressed, although it is a non-party organization. I take this opportunity to contradict the insinuation conveyed in <inline font-weight="bold">Senator</inline> Turley&#39;s  statement that I addressed the Women&#39;s National League. The honorable senator&#39;s remarks were absolutely incorrect and misleading. </para>

                        <para>. - There was no insinuation on my part in connexion with this matter. Unfortunately, the newspaper from which I quoted last night is now in the hands of the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> staff, and has not yet been returned to me. I quoted from a Government organ. I stated at the time that I quoted from the Brisbane <inline font-style="italic">Courier,</inline> in which the statement appeared that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie had addressed a meeting of the Women&#39;s National League, at which he had announced that the party to which he belonged was in future to be known as &#34;the National Labour Party.&#34; I stated that in my opinion it was most appropriate that the Whip of the National Labour Party should make the announcement to the Women&#39;s National League, because it is known that ever since its inception in Australia the Women&#39;s National League has been up against the Labour movement. The honorable senator, I suppose, would quote nothing like that from any other newspaper. When he stated that my remark was not correct, I asked him what was the name of the organization, and he said it was the Women&#39;s National Council. I do not know anything of the Women&#39;s National  Council. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie says that quite a number of trade unions are connected with it. I do not even know that.  His  explanation seems to me to be most peculiar. He says, in the first place, that the Women&#39;s National Council is a non-party organization. My connexion with trade unions has led me to think that, whether -they are unions of men or of women, they are not represented upon any non-party council. They are represented upon party councils that are representing organized labour, and nothing else. T know nothing of the composition of the Women&#39;s National Council, or the organizations affiliated with that particular body. Another matter has been referred to. I stated that, at the time to which he has referred, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie was supporting a Liberal candidate, whilst, on the other hand, I was supporting a Labour candidate. I am quite prepared to bring all the evidence that is necessary to prove my statement. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> was a member of the New South Wales Parliament at the time, and will be well acquainted with the man whom I was supporting. </para>

                            <para>- We had a union before <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> saw Australia, and before he ever thought of coming to Australia. I am not here on any false pretences whatever, or as the result of any misrepresentations. The first union that I joined in Queensland was the Wharf Labourers Union in 1882. One of my colleagues, who is now sitting behind the Government, can bear out my statement that I joined the Seamen&#39;s Union in 1884, and that I was for years a member of that organization and a delegate from it to various conferences. That was before <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie saw Australia. I take no credit for that - it merely goes to show that I am growing older. But I have grown up with the Labour movement, and I have never &#34; ratted &#34; on it. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie has affirmed that the members of the organization to which I belonged at that time received less wages than did the members of similar organizations in any other part of Australia. I admit the truth of that assertion. I admit that until we got federation amongst the various waterside unions throughout Australia, the wharf labourers in Queensland received less wages than they did in New South Wales. But when I first came to this country the seamen on the coast of Queensland were receiving better wages than the seamen who were engaged on any other part of the coast of Australia. It was after the federation of the seamen was brought about that we were able to get better wages. </para>

                            <para>- No one man was responsible for the increase of wages and the better conditions that obtain so far as any Labour organization in Australia is concerned. It is the men who are behind the organizations who have made it possible &#39;to secure increased wages and improved industrial conditions. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie has claimed credit for the Government having settled the coal strike. As a matter of fact, they had nothing to do with it. Take the Sydney <inline font-style="italic">Bulletin</inline> to- day, and what does it say? It affirms that one Judge in twenty-four hours did more good in connexion with that strike than <inline font-weight="bold">Mr, Hughes</inline> was able to accomplish in a fortnight. Why? Because <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> did not exercise his powers. It was because the miners themselves declared that they were going to have improved conditions, that they were able to dictate their terms to the coal owners. That is the position in regard to organized labour throughout Australia. I am satisfied that the federation of the waterside workers did a great deal, not only for the workers on the waterside in Queensland, but for those all round Australia. It is not because <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> has dropped out of the Waterside Union that that organization will go back. As a matter of fact, it will go forward, and will secure even better conditions than its members enjoyed when <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> was  president  of it. </para>
