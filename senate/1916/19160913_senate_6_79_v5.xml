                        <para>- This question was asked last week, and I then informed the Senate that the instructions referred to are confidential. I therefore cannot lay them on the table of the Senate, but any member of the Senate may see copies of the instructions to the censors at the Victoria Barracks. </para>

                        <para>- This is determined by circumstances. If the soldier has been so severely wounded as to be rendered unfit for further service, or is likely to suffer a considerable period of invalidity, he is returned to Australia after he has sufficiently recovered in England. If his wounds are of a minor character, and the time necessary for his recuperation is likely to be short, he is kept in England during the time of his invalidity. </para>

                            <para>. - I venture, as a preliminary observation, to express the opinion that no member of this Chamber who takes part in this debate will be able to free himself from a sense of responsibility arising from the undoubted gravity of the position that confronts us. The gravity of this position is, I think, very fully emphasized in the statements made by the Prime Minister, and by his colleague, the Minister of Defence. It also arises from a consideration of the military position so far as we are allowed to understand it from the daily papers, and though it is quite true that the later news has heartened us considerably, I venture to say that, taking even the most favorable view of this later news, the most we can say at the present juncture is that we have reached the stage at which we can, I think, say with confidence that it is now clear that Germany cannot win. But it is equally clear we can only defeat Germany - and by defeat I mean the attainment of the full objects for which we went to war - if we resolve to continue, to supplement, and to expand the efforts which we have so far made. To my mind, that constitutes the one question to which we ought to direct our thoughts in consideration of the problem that immediately confronts us. A word now as to the statement which we are discussing. When the first statement was made by the Prime Minister, I ventured to express a feeling of intense disappointment at what I regarded as its insufficiency. That disappointment, I feel sure, was shared by a very large section of the community that holds views similar to my own as to the course of action which we are called upon to take. In order to understand the position we have to recall the circumstances under which the statement was made - the circumstances which caused that statement to be awaited with such intense interest by the people of Australia, by the people of Great Britain, and I might also say - though in perhaps a lesser degree - by the people of the allied countries as well. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> had just returned from a triumphal career through Great Britain, in the course of which he aroused a very considerable and widespread measure of enthusiasm, by the dynamic energy with which he appealed to the people of the Mother Country, and demonstrated how that salvation was to be attained, not by hesitancy and delay, but by prompt, decisive, and continuous action. The Prime Minister proceeded through the Old Country as a stern and unrelenting prophet of decisive action. He was indeed a veritable human fiery cross, calling to action the people, not merely of Great Britain, but of the Empire. </para>

                            <para>- I prefer my own simile. As I have said, the Prime Minister went through the Mother Country as a human fiery cross, calling upon the people immediately to do all, to dare all, and, if needs be, to sacrifice all, in order to proceed to the rescue of the Empire in the hour of its greatest crisis. Those speeches which the Prime Minister made in Great Britain were in a sense messages to Australia as well, and they were so accepted in this country. Any impartial student reading his later speeches in Australia could only come to the conclusion that he was repeating here the doctrines which he so eloquently expounded at </para>

                    <para class="block">Home. It was at this stage, and when I, like others, believed that the time had arrived for prompt action in the direction of introducing compulsory military service, that the Prime Minister made his statement in the other House, and the Minister of Defence made a similar statement in the Senate. I want honorable senators to recollect what I have said as to the conditions which existed at that time. In that statement it was set out that the Government intended to proceed by referendum. In listening to that statement honorable senators must have come to the conclusion, as I did, that the Government accepted the referendum as a virtue, and not as a necessity; that they were attaching faith to it as a principle from which under no circumstances would they depart ; that it was in itself the most desirable course open to them. It was under these circumstances that I was disappointed, and felt that there was a big gap between' the irresponsible critic in the Old Country and the responsible Prime Minister of Australia. Since then we have been allowed to see things a little more clearly. We know that the Prime Minister was for four days, I think, in close conference with his immediate political supporters, but we are not privileged to know what happened at that conference. We <inline font-style="italic">do</inline> know, however, that after perhaps our sense of proportion had time to adjust itself, the Prime Minister favoured us with another statement, and his colleague, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce,</inline> delivered another statement in this Chamber. I invite honorable members to consider the difference between these two attitudes. From the first statement it appeared that the Government were adopting the referendum as a virtue; the second made it clear that they were adopting it as a necessity. We know now, from the words of the Prime Minister, that the Government felt the desirability of obtaining definite authority before proceeding to enforce compulsory military service, which would be such a great departure from our existing policy. It looked to the parliamentary machine to provide the authority ; but the Prime Minister has clearly indicated that there is very little prospect of Parliament - I speak of both Houses - assenting to that proposition. The Prime Minister has openly and frankly told Parliament and the country that his real difficulty is this Chamber, and seeing that there was, apparently - aDd I assume he correctly judged the possibilities of the situation - no prospect of obtaining authority from Parliament, he resolved, by means of a referendum, to appeal from Parliament to the people themselves. That puts an entirely different complexion on the situation. I can accept the referendum as an expedient, but not as a principle. Under the circumstances, one must feel a measure of sympathy with the Prime Minister and ' his colleagues, who, feeling that there was a certain work to do, found themselves hobbled as it were by one branch of Parliament. But whatever our feelings may be - and I am still disappointed that circumstances did not permit the Government to proceed by a more direct route - we are confronted with this position. The Government having taken the responsibility of deciding upon the action to be taken, there is only one course left to every member of this Chamber and every member of the public outside. They have got to say " yes " or "no" to the proposition. For myself, my course is clear. I do not pretend that in all its details the Government's proposition is entirely as I would like it, but I do say that it is the proposition with which we have to deal, and under these circumstances I shall have no hesitancy in doing what little I possibly can in order to insure that the necessary question submitted by the Government shall be answered in the affirmative. </para>

                            <para>- This matter is too grave and serious for any other attitude to be adopted towards it. Having said that, may I observe that if there is anything in our Constitution or parliamentary machinery that in a time of great national emergency may paralyze a. Government, then so much of that Constitution or parliamentary machinery must go, seeing that it becomes a hindrance and a danger rather than a help and safeguard. </para>

                    <para>I should like now to say a word cr two on the principle of the referendum as applied to a matter of this kind. It is, perhaps, a trifle abstract now, but at the same time I can conceive a danger to the future of Australia if it is to be accepted as an essential principle, that, in a time of great emergency like this, it shall be necessary to consult the people directly. If it is a sound proposition that we cannot proceed to apply compulsion to the extent of raising the necessary reinforcements now without consulting the people, it was more necessary that we should have consulted the people, at the outbreak of the war, as to whether Australia should participate in it or not. </para>

                            <para>- That is so; but my point is this: I am not now dealing with a particular case, but with the idea which has apparently entered many minds, that, before a step of this kind is taken in a period of great emergency, the Government ie under an obligation to consult the electors. If that were a sound and necessary course of action to take now, it was, as I have said, far more necessary that we should have done it at the outbreak of war, because everything that has happened since has been in consequence of what was then done. But no one ever suggested that a referendum should be taken before we made that offer to the Old Country, and no one would have hesitated for five minutes before making that offer. Yet the question involved then was much more serious than that arising now. The question was whether we should go into the war or stay out, and it was the duty of the Government to take the responsibility of speaking and acting for the people. When the Government announced the course it intended to pursue, it received the fullest assurance of whole-hearted support and approval from the then Leader of the Opposition, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Fisher.</inline></para>

                            <para>- It does not make the slightest difference. The question waa not whether Australia should fight with volunteers or conscripts, but whether Australia should join in the war at all. If Germany succeeded in winning, she would not say, " I will deal only with the men who fought"; but she would say, " Our quarrel is not with the men who fought, but with the Government and the <inline font-style="italic">people</inline> of Australia." Therefore I want to bring home to honorable senators that, whilst a referendum might be entirely suitable and essential in time oi peace, it might be tragic in its consequences if we bound ourselves down to the doctrine that in all circumstances, before decisive action is taken, there must be an appeal to the people. May I also point out that the proposal with which we are now confronted is the direct result of the action approved by this Chamber ? Something has been said about the present demands upon our resources, and an effort is being made to depict this as being an appeal from the Imperial authorities for something more than we have offered. I can see nothing to justify that view of the case. In November last, this Government, with the unanimous approval of the people of Australia, sent forward a voluntary offer. They undertook to send additional units, and to maintain by reinforcements both the original army and the new one ' they proposed to create. No one then raised the slightest objection - at any rate, I did not hear of it - and the Government had either the active or the silent approval of everybody for the offer then made. The Imperial authorities are now asking us to redeem the promise then made. The need for raising more men arises from the distinct offer which was made in November last. Having made ourselves, by our open or silent approval, parties to that offer, we have now to consider whether we shall see our promissory-note dishonoured, and Australia placed in the ranks of defaulters, 01* whether we shall take the one step which remains to us in order to redeem the promise which we then made. Honorable senators, I am sure, are not limiting their vision to the present when they consider this matter of the referendum. To my mind, it would be the most dangerous principle which could ever be adopted or approved if we did accept it as essential to military action on the part of Australia, that there must first be a direct reference to the people. Australia is a continent with a population of 5,000,000 souls. We sometimes indulge - and' we are entitled to indulge - in some very proud speaking regarding the heritage that has come to us. But we must recognise that science has annihilated distance, and that we have already shown Europe that it is possible to send considerable bodies of troops right round the world. We can send troops to Europe, and they can send troops here. What would be the position if we were threatened with some hostile invasion here, and there was not a moment to lose? Would we then take a referendum, or would the Government act on its own responsibility ? </para>

                            <para>- Great Britain would have everything to be ashamed of if she paltered with the question in that way when invasion threatened us. But if the referendum, as a principle in a time of great national emergency, is a good thing for Australia, it must be equally good for England. And if it is a good thing for England, my honorable friends opposite must be prepared for the time when an invasion is actually threatened here. </para>

                    <para>I mentioned a little while ago that there were two features in the Government proposal which I thought were capable of amendment. I mention them now, not that I have very much hope that the Government will amend them, because, rightly or wrongly, I have formed the conclusion that the Government have limited their proposal, not because the limitations imposed are an improvement, but possibly in the hope that such limitations may make their proposal more acceptable to those who are known to be opposed to the underlying principle of compulsion. One of the objections which might be raised to this proposal by supporters of compulsory service is that it is intended to allow the voluntary system to run side by side with it, not merely for the current month, but for all time. There are two or three serious objections to that. First of all, are we going to create, even in the minds of the people, a difference between the volunteer and the conscript soldier? That, in itself, would be very undesirable. Is the volunteer in camp to say to the conscript, " I am a superior citizen to you because I came here of my own free will, whereas you waited until the hand of the law coerced you " ? That, I submit, would introduce a very undesirable feeling in the minds of men who enrol after the Referendum Bill has been passed. </para>

                            <para>- I am merely pointing out one of the defects of the Government proposal. The Government having frankly admitted that the voluntary system is not equal to the obligations which Australia of its own free will accepted, it would have been butter to have made compulsion absolute, and to have retired the voluntary system altogether. But apart from the fact that it is proposed to create two classes of recruits, I would point out that it is intended to conscript only single men from twenty-one years of age upwards, whilst at the same time accepting as volunteers lads of eighteen years of age and married men. Now, I hold very strongly that we have been sending away to the front men who were too young for the task that was ahead of them. 1 know that the military authorities are not quite unanimous as to the effect which the strain of a campaign has on these lads. </para>

                            <para>- I accept the statement of the Minister of Defence, but I am curious to know over what area that analysis proceeded. It has been affirmed oy a very competent writer, dealing with the Napoleonic wars, that in all the marches which Napoleon made - and it was his rapidity of movement which was so largely responsible for his startling successes - it was the men over twenty-five years of age who pulled him through. It was the younger men who fell out first. </para>

                            <para>- They were not. But whilst the Australian of eighteen years of age may be better than a man of similar years elsewhere, I am not prepared to admit that the results in the case of bodies of troops from Australia would be very different from the results in the case of troops from other countries. I wish to refer to one of the evils arising from this practice. First of all we have to recognise that the recruiting officers are very keen to get men. Owing to the necessity for this keenness I venture to say that they have not scrutinized too closely well -grown lads under eighteen years of age who have come forward to enlist. It is curious that only in the last week I noticed these two statements in two different newspapers, but on the same day. One is a communication from the Reverend Thomas McVitty, who states - </para>

One can honour the boy's keenness, courage, and patriotism in determining to get through, but I am entitled to direct attention to the need for some tightening up of the recruiting machinery which enabled him to get through.

I have had personal knowledge of cases of a similar kind. It will be admitted that, in the case of well-grown lads of seventeen years of age, it is not easy to say whether they are 17 years, 18 years, or 19 years of age. But I say that if the recruiting officers are assured of an ample number of troops by means of the  compulsory system, there is every reason why they should scrutinize more closely the enlistment of these lads of tender years. Assuming that it is the Government's policy to obtain the necessary men by means of compulsion, there will be no need to rake in every volunteer, and if it be decided to continue the acceptance of volunteers under twenty-one years of age, we should ask for something more from them than their declaration as to their age. We should ask from their parents, in addition to their consent to their enlistment, a statement as to their age. The enlistment of these lads of tender years is in one sense a scandal, whilst in another it naturally fills us with pride that they should be willing to face the dangers of the trenches in the interests of their country. </para>

                            <para>-  I thought I had done so. Seeing that it is proposed to compel only men over twenty-one years of age to serve, if the Government intends to continue the voluntary system side by side with the compulsory system - and I do not think that should be done - they should not accept volunteers under twenty-one years. In the case of lads coming forward for enlistment we should provide by regulation that they should have not only their parents' consent to their enlistment, but a statement from their parents as to their actual age. A boy will quite willingly sign a false declaration if he is determined to enlist. </para>

                            <para>- Then I suggest to the Minister of Defence that a form should be devised under which, if his parents consent to the enlistment of a lad, they should at the same time make a statement as to his age. There would then be a double check. It might oe that the parents would enter into collusion with the lad to tell a falsehood, but the course I suggest would, I think, lessen the evil to which I direct attention. </para>

                            <para>- I say that if we continue the voluntary system, and under it accept lads of eighteen years of age, we should take all the precautions necessary to insure that those who  are  enlisted are eighteen years of age. Any member of the Senate could, in five minutes, devise machinery to require ladE desiring to enlist to bring with them some proof of their age. Proof of age is a difficulty which  we  easily surmount many times in the ordinary transactions of life. I wish now to say a word with regard to the enlistment of married men. The Minister of Defence referred in touching terms to the spectacle presented by a married man with family responsibilities going to the front, whilst single men are staying at  home. I indorse everything he said on the point. Lately the methods of embarkation have been altered, but in the earlier stages I have seen units proceeding to embark at the wharfs and at railway stations, and as the troops have marched along the street, I have seen some woman hanging on the arm of her husband, with two or three toddlers clinging to her skirts, and at the same time the footpaths have been lined with single men without a chick or a child to care for. I say that the Government ought not to accept married men if they volunteer fifty times whilst there are single men without family obligations available. </para>

                                <para>- That is no guide. There will not be 75 per cent, of the men who will not volunteer rejected. Before I went to one town in connexion with a recruiting meeting the recruiting sergeant said to me, "You will have five men come up when you ask for volunteers." I said, "How do you know that?" He said, "They come up at every meeting." I asked whether they were the same men, and he said "Yes, they have been examined here, and two of them went to an adjoining camp and tried to get through there. They come up and offer every time. I spoke to them, and they said they knew it was no good, but they wanted to give the other fellows a lead." </para>

The practice in New South Wales, at recruiting meetings, has been to make an appeal for recruits at the close of a meeting, and they come on to the platform. </para>

                                <para>- I am not dealing with that. The percentage of rejections may be phenomenally high, and it might be worth while to inquire whether there is not some reason underlying the high percentage. But I refuse to consider the percentage of rejects amongst recruits voluntarily offering themselves in Melbourne as a guide to the percentage of rejects under a system of compulsion applied to the great body of the men of the country. </para>

                                <para>- The more unfit there are offering, the greater the need there is upon us to compel the fit to go. I have dealt with what seems to me to be the undesirability of continuing the voluntary system side by side with the compulsory system, but if we are to continue the voluntary system we should accept as volunteers only the class of men liable to conscription, that is men from 21 to 45 years of age, single, and without encumbrances. One other limitation in the Government's proposal which I very much regret is that the authority that the Government seek is limited only to the sending away of reinforcements. I do not imagine that there would be any immediate advantage from widening the authority that is being sought, but, if the war should go against us, and it was found in a few months that the crisis had thickened, it would be appalling if we were then confronted with the necessity of taking another referendum in order to make a further effort. It would, therefore, have been more advisable for the Government to ask the people for full authority to apply the provisions of the Defence Act to oversea service, giving, at the same time, an assurance that there was no present intention to use it to any greater extent than indicated in the present proposals. Such a course would have left them free to face any fresh demand to meet a new crisis should such unhappily arise. </para>

                        <para>It is proposed to issue a proclamation, from 1st October, calling into camp under the home-defence provisions a certain number of men. Will the Minister consider whether it is not advisable to issue that proclamation at once? If it is issued on 1st October, the men called to camp under it will not be in camp and have settled down before the end of October. </para>

I put this matter forward, not simply for the sake of criticising, but to secure the more effective working of the policy which the Government have outlined. If the men are in camp by the middle of October, and I do not believe they can be there by that date, they are the men wanted for reinforcements in February of next year. It "takes two months to send them Home, and in the two months on board ship they cannot do much effective training. From the middle of October to the middle of February is sixteen weeks, and deducting the eight weeks on shipboard leaves only eight weeks for training. When they arrive they will be needed, not to stay in English camps to complete their training, but to go forward as reinforcements. The time for giving them that effective training which is their due before they go to the front is clearly so short that I urge the Minister to consider whether it is not worth while to issue the proclamation before the 1st October, even if only a week before, so as to get the men into camp at the earliest date, and give them a slightly longer period of training. </para>

                        <para>When the Minister was making his speech, I interjected a question which he received in quite another spirit from that which I intended. I asked him whether we could assume that the Government would support the referendum when it was before the country, but the Minister apparently thought I was seeking in some way or other to embarrass certain members of the Government who might not cordially approve of compulsory military service abroad. That was not my idea. I saw that it would make a big difference in the mind of the country if the proposals were put forward with the Government supporting them, or if they were put forward with the Government indifferent to their fate. Part of my question has been answered by the Prime Minister's declaration that he intends not merely to put the referendum to the electors, but to support it when it is there. It is a matter of great interest to Parliament and the country to know what the attitude of the Government will be on the question when the electors are called upon to deal with it, and that was the reason I asked the question. It will make a considerable difference to the success of the appeaL whether the Ministry are divided or united on it. The electors are entitled to assume that the Government contain the men who know at least as much of the actual facts as any other body of men, if not more, and if Ministers are united on the subject, that knowledge must influence the electors considerably. If, on the other hand, they are unfortunately divided, the people will be entitled to say, " It is quite true that some Ministers tell us they regard compulsion as necessary, but others tell us it is not " ; and therefore they may  be pardoned if they decide that it is safe to vote in the negative, as the matter cannot be very urgent, seeing that the Ministry cannot agree on it. </para>

                                <para>- I had no intention of taunting Ministers with inconsistency. On the contrary, if any Minister or other public man or private citizen who has previously expressed a view hostile to compulsion now advocates it in the light of the present position, no- taunt of inconsistency will fall from my lips, because nothing that we thought before the war came with its awful lessons to us ought to restrain us in our actions to-day. </para>

                        <para>The Government propose to submit this matter to the people, and ask them to pass judgment on it. This brings us to the question of whether the people, in order to arrive at a sound judgment, are to have the advantage of a free platform and a free press. There are indications which no one can afford to ignore that the censorship is today being carried to an extreme not dreamt of six months ago, and, strong supporter as I am going to be of the proposal of the Government, I still say that we ought to ask them to give the country, not merely an assurance, but an absolute proof that the censorship will be relaxed as far as it is safe to do so, having regard to military necessities. </para>

                                <para>- It has, but the censorship is being tightened all the same. The policy which the Government have enunciated is not going  to be helped by the present censorship, which will furnish the opponents of the referendum with the strongest and most effective weapon they can ask for. They will be able to say to the people, " The Government ask you to decide, but dare not let you know the truth. You may hold your meetings, bub you shall not let the people in the next village know what you say. Whatever resolution you pass may not be printed." Even in this Parliament, if a question is asked and answered on the subject it is often censored, so that the electors have not the fullest information necessary to vote on the question. The best way to defeat the Government's proposal is to continue the present censorship, and the most effective way to insure its success is to remove the gag which is now placed on both press and platform. </para>

                        <para>I recognise that in the campaign on which we are about to enter, consequent upon the Government's policy, there is going to be a very sharp division of opinion. I am quite unable to understand the mind of those who oppose this proposal, but many currents of thought are at work. The opposition does not all spring from the one motive. Many are, I believe, animated by fears which, although groundless, are nevertheless sincerely held. The same fear was expressed in Great Britain when the Imperial Government proceeded to introduce compulsion there, and I venture to say that members of industrial unions at Home were just as keen to maintain their privileges as are the unionists of Australia. Since then, however, the opposition in the Old Country seems to have evaporated. </para>

                                <para>- Yes, I am. When the Imperial Government introduced their scheme for compulsion, there was a threat of a strike that would have the effect of laying idle the whole of the  English industries;  but that threat did not eventuate, and. to-day the industries of the Mother Country are proceeding more briskly than ever before.  I  mention this in the hope that, whilst these fears are, no doubt, sincerely held by a large number of unionists here, they may take courage from the fact that ultimately they were overcome in Great Britain. I would like to ask unionists in Australia to consider whether, seeing that their brother unionists in Great Britain decided eventually not to oppose the Government proposals, they would be running any greater danger by adopting that course in this country, where they have infinitely more political power. I remember that, at the time of which I speak, the Prime Minister of Great Britain, in order to allay those fears, gave an assurance that any alteration or modification of industrial privileges rendered necessary by the war would not be allowed to affect the position at the conclusion of peace. I do not know  whether it is possible for some such guarantee to be given to the unionists in Australia. 1 can quite understand that it will be answered that, while an individual can bind himself, he cannot bind institutions or other sections of the community; but I do suggest that, in view of this fear that, in some way or other, compulsory military service might be made use of as the thin end of the wedge to destroy the industrial fabric which has been erected in Australia, some form of guarantee might be given that any alteration of the privileges at present enjoyed shall not be continued here after the declaration of peace. </para>

                                <para>- So far as I am concerned, it is not merely a question of getting the verdict of the people. I believe that the verdict will be in the affirmative. But I want something more than that. I do not want to see in this country either a large or a heated minority in opposition to the proposal now under consideration, and, therefore, I invite consideration upon this suggestion. All public men, I think, are under an obligation to give it consideration, because if some such guarantee could be given, it would, I think, remove very largely the hostility shown to the Government proposal - an hostility founded upon fear, but which I regard as without foundation. </para>

                                <para>- Do honorable senators take up the position that they are prepared to risk national safety rather than industrial unionism? So far as I am concerned, every institution we have, excepting that of national existence, should go into the melting-pot first. I am trying to see if it is possible to allay those fears to which I have referred by some form of guarantee as to the industrial conditions of Australia after the war. I have not come here with any cut-and-dried plan, but I do invite honorable senators, believing that they, as well as myself, are concerned with the future of Australia, to give serious thought to this suggestion, and to see if we can allay the fears of those who are at present opposed to the Government proposal. </para>

                            <para>. - Like the Leader of the Opposition, we can all agree that there is not a member of this Chamber, or, indeed, of this Parliament, who is not fully seized with the gravity of the present situation - a situation which is not due to any action on the part of Australia. Let us carry our minds back to the outbreak of the war, when the Cook Government went to the country. As the Minister of Defence has pointed out, when the Government of the day promised to send men to the front no one at that time dreamed that Australia would be called upon to render assistance to the extent that she has done. We well remember that for weeks the newspapers of Australia were emblazoned with headlines to the effect that Australia should aim at raising 100,000 men. At that time it seemed a stupendous task, but to-day the Commonwealth has enlisted for service, not 100,000 men, but over 300,000, and I think we can justly claim that Australia has not only done her duty, but that she has done more than her fair share. I do not say that everything has been done, but, in my opinion, everything has been done in consonance with the safety and continuance of Australia as a growing nation. In regard to the question now under discussion, I think it is fair that one of us, as a member of the Federal Labour party, should take upon himself the responsibility of informing the country that the Government proposals are not the indorsed and approved proposals of the Federal Labour party. I leave members of the Cabinet, individually or collectively, to speak for themselves. I take the responsibility of speaking as a member of the Labour party. </para>

They were prepared to hear <inline font-weight="bold">Mr, Hughes,</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> alone, on them. Personally, I am not going to support the Government's proposals as they are now before the Senate. It has been stated by the Leader of the Opposition that, though as a principle he is against the referendum, on this occasion he is going to support the referendum. </para>

                                <para>- My position is (hat I am in favour of the referendum in general cases, on every occasion possible, but I am opposed to this referendum ; and I feel that I am right, because my views are so divergent from those held by the Leader of the Opposition. I admit my position may appear illogical, but I think I can justify it. I regard the matter of dealing with sacred human life as being one of conscience, and conscience only - a sacred matter of conscience - and in my view, if 99 per cent, of the people said "Yes," that expression of opinion should not bind the minority which said "No." I refuse to any Government and to any majority the right to trade in the lives of the people. </para>

                                    has said that he thought it was the opinion of Australians generally that conscientious objectors would not be worth dealing with, or something to that effect ;. but those who vote " No " have no right to be forced to take any action upon which might depend, and probably will depend, sacred human life.

                                <para>- No, I would not. I do not think the Australian would require any compulsion in such a case. I asked the Minister of Defence this afternoon if the French soldiers who went to Gallipoli were conscripts or volunteers? He replied that he had no information on the subject. I asked <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> a similar question in Sydney, and received a similar answer  but I think they should have been able to inform us that the French soldiers who went to Gallipoli did not go as conscripts, but as volunteers for overseas service, so that in this proposition we are going further than France in asking to conscript soldiers for service overseas. When this Government took upon itself the responsibility of offering a further 50,000 men to Great Britain, I did not think there was any likelihood of the reinforcements not being met by the voluntary system. Up to May last there was no falling off in recruiting. When the Defence Department was charged with the task of getting these men, every day, every week-end, the newspapers urged upon the Minister of Defence and the Defence Department the desirability of laying bare the position. The Minister eventually gave particulars showing that, owing to the temporary cessation of hostilities at Gallipoli, it was not necessary to send forward the same large drafts that had been going. As soon as the Minister disclosed that information, recruiting committees, press, and others at once attacked him, charging him with having brought about a reduction in recruiting. </para>

I have in my mind one meeting in the Prahran Town Hall," at which <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Frank</inline> Madden spoke, and at which a section of the community were described as " greybacks " and " creeping things " - palpably meaning lice. These were the men who were permitted to address public meetings. They were allowed not only the liberty, but the licence to preach conscription, whilst anybody opposed to it who dared to address a public meeting was hounded down and coerced and the Defence Department took no action. </para>

                                <para>- I am speaking of meetings that were held in the heart of Melbourne. The inevitable result was a noticeable falling off in the recruiting figures. Had the Defence Department been firm with these recruiting agents, had it commanded them to stand off preaching conscription at public meetings, there would have been no necessity for this proposal. I refuse to admit that the voluntary system in Australia has failed. How can it be said that it has failed when out of our mere handful of people we have enlisted 300,000 men who have passed the physical test? In such circumstances, how can anybody urge that the voluntary system has failed? </para>

                                <para>- If we cannot keep up our reinforcements I do not think that Great Britain -will allow our volunteers to be slaughtered. Australian volunteers, even during the war, have nobly aided the conscript armies of European countries. Is it not a fact that a mere handful of Australian volunteers at Gallipoli kept the Turks at bay at a most critical time for the Russians, and thus saved the latter from what might have been annihilation? Had the Turks been able to reach the Russians on their flank when they were being so strongly pressed by the Germans, disaster would have been unavoidable. Therefore, our Australian, soldiers have done something for the conscript armies of European countries, and, consequently, I do not think it is fair for the advocates of conscription to retort that Australia will have to rely upon conscripts from abroad. </para>

In the statement made by the Minister of Defence it is set out that the necessities of the immediate present comprise reinforcements to the extent of 16,500 per month, and for the month of September reinforcements to the extent of 32,500. This latter number is made up of the ordinary monthly contribution of 12,500, and of an additional 20,000 that is required to replace what is known as the Fifth Division which is now in England, and which is to be broken up to supply renforcements </para>

                                <para>- The position, then, is this: The Defence Department, or those who are responsible for drawing up this scheme, ask for 20,000 men during the current month in order to make up the big total of 32,500. I would like the Minister to tell us why these 20,000 men, who are needed to replace the Fifth Division in England, are all required during the month of September. In the Northern Hemisphere the next summer cannot commence before the beginning of April. That is seven months &gt;hence. If the men were raised by the end of December they would still have January, February, and March - three months - in which to become trained soldiers. Why, then, are these 20,000 men required during the current month ? This is a point upon which I am not at all clear, and unless the Minister can give us some good reason why it is necessary to secure this force during September, although its services will not be required at the very earliest before April of next year, I shall be forced to conclude that the military authorities do not desire that the recruiting system shall live, and that they wish to kill it by imposing upon it the impossible task of raising 32,500 nien during the present month. </para>

                                <para>- I hold that one of the best services we can render the Empire at the present time is to refuse to deplete Australia of every available man. I do not agree that the Allies have ever been short of men-. What they have been short of is munitions and equipment. I do not believe that they have been short of men at any time, or that they are short of men now. </para>

                                <para>- That may be so; but I may be allowed to express a humble opinion. I cannot be expected to accept the opinion of every one else as correct. If we had been guided by our own opinions in connexion with the Gallipoli landing, and had not depended so entirely on the military advisers, and taken all they said as gospel, the people of Australia would not in those early days have been led to believe that our men would get through to Constantinople. Personally, I now think that they could not have done so. This was not owing to a shortage of men, because there were thousands of Australians in Egypt at the time. If the reason for the Gallipoli gamble or slaughter was a shortage of men, the fault was certainly not due to Australia, because we did not have the direction of the forces engaged. I come now to the consideration of a phase of the Government proposal which I consider the more serious because of its imminence. I refer to the proclamation which the Government are about to issue calling up men under sections of the Defence Act. I think that is a mistake. I hope that even at this late hour the Government will decide not to call up these men before the result of the referendum is known. The vote at the referendum would not alter my opinion of the matter, but it would go far to g reserve peace and good order in the Commonwealth if the Government could see their way not to call up men by proclamation under the Defence Act until the referendum has been carried. There is an aspect of the question which has been given some prominence, and on which great stress might be laid. I refer to the legal aspect of the intended action of the Government. I remember that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Blackburn,</inline> the member for Essendon in the Victorian Parliament, raised the question at a meeting in Melbourne. He pointed out - and his opinion has since been confirmed by other barristers - that the Government have no authority under the Defence Act to call up these men for service overseas. They have authority to call them up for home service only. The Government in their proposal, and neither the Prime Minister nor the Minister of Defence in their explanatory speeches have ever professed that these men are to be called up for home defence, or that their services are to be used for home defence. They are being called up in preparation to be sent abroad in the event of the people ratifying the Government proposal at the referendum. </para>

                                <para>-The Government are calling the men up, but they are not calling them up for home defence. I may say why I should regret to see the issue of this proclamation before the people have ratified the Government's proposal. I listened intently to the remarks of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> when he referred to the industrial aspect of this crisis&gt; because it is a crisis. I agree with the honorable senator that the position is very serious. I profess to know something of the temperament of the workers of Australia, and I say candidly that I fear for the industrial results in Australia if the Government go on with their contemplated action, and call out men under the Defence Act prior to the ratification of their proposal by the people. In 1912, during the general strike in Brisbane, we had an opportunity on several occasions to witness the gathering of angry mobs. We know that feeling at that time was intense, and we have reason to know now, from communications which have been received, that the pent-up feelings of the industrialists of Australia may find very serious vent if instigated or intimidated by any action of the Commonwealth Government in. this regard. I fear grave results may follow. </para>

                        <para class="block">Personally, I do not want to see them. I spoke at a meeting in the Guild Hall, Melbourne, last night, on the question of a general strike. I told the audience not to consider such a matter in a light or frivolous vein. I said that we had had experience in Brisbane of a general strike, and knew that it involved want, .suffering, and care to a great section of the community, and -not to the wealthy section, who, I suppose, made little or no difference in their mode of living because of the strike-. I told the audience also that if the opportunity presented itself to choose the lesser of two evils, they should choose the lesser evil, and I viewed the imposition of conscription, or the contemplated introduction of it into Australia, as being a greater evil by far than would be a general strike in Australia. I beseech the Government to give this appeal more than a passing consideration. The Minister of Defence, by the figures he has submitted in this Chamber, has shown us that even if not another man were enlisted under the voluntary system before the end of December we should  have sufficient men to carry on with up to that date. </para>

                                <para>- In your statement. We must expect that some men will enlist under the voluntary system between now and the end of December. Men are, as a matter of fact,, coming forward now at the rate of 4,000 or 5,000 per month. This will account for from 16,000 to 20,000 men, and it is reasonable to anticipate that there will bean increase in the number of volunteers. </para>

                                <para>-The honorable senator should let me finish what I wish to say. Voluntary enlistments will give usfrom' 16,000 to 20,000 men, and that will meet all the necessities of the Government for a further period of one month after the end of December. A month will necessarily elapse between the proposed issue of the proclamation and the taking of the referendum. So that voluntary enlistments would be sufficient to coyer the additional period to be provided for if the proclamation were delayed, as I SUK. gest, until the result of the referendum is known. I trust that the Minister of Defence will give this matter serious consideration, because I, for one, view it with very great concern. I do not speak without knowing something of the temperament of Australian industrialism. That is why my fears find such expression. On the question of the enlistment of married or single men. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> mentioned that married men had gone to the front whilst single men have refrained from enlisting. I recall the interjections made when the honorable senator was speaking by my colleagues on the other side. Even if the supply of single men should not be exhausted until four or five months have passed, we should, after that period, have to bring the married men in. We should then witness the spectacle of married men going to the war and leaving wives and families behind. </para>

I say candidly that I am not going to take the assurance of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes,</inline> or of the Government, on this matter. I am not going to place filthy lucre on the same plane as sacred human life. I said in this chamber as far back as May last that conscription of men and conscription of money are not to be mentioned in the same breath. Are we to accept a vague, sweeping sort of promise that, after having made provision for the compulsion of men, the Government will see that wealth comes in afterwards 1 The proper procedure would have been to' make provision for obtaining the wealth before mentioning the conscription of men; and even if that were done it would not alter my opinion regarding the conscription -of men. We can judge this Labour Government only by their actions during the past two years, and I say unhesitatingly that they have not done the fair thing regarding the provision of wealth for carrying out Australia's part in the war. </para>

I would ask some of my honorable friends who interject so freely when the question of compulsion of men is under review where they were when amendments were proposed on a previous occasion for raising the war loan at pre-war rates of interest ? Where were they when endeavours were made to amend the Government's policy so that subscribers to the loan should not be exempt from State and Federal income tax, and to prevent members of the stock exchanges getting a commission of 5s. per £100 ? </para>

                                <para>- Why not conscript it and take it, as the Government are now seeking to take the men? Another line of argument used by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> is, " Why should you bo afraid of conscription, seeing that you have your "own Government in power? Surely you are not afraid of the harsh administration of a conscript law by your own Government?" Conscription is wrong whatever Government it is passed or administered by, and as for accepting an assurance that the Labour Government would not administer it harshly, I can judge them only by their administration of the War Precautions Act during the past two years. It is my honest and firm conviction that they have been most harsh and partial in their administration of that Act. Influential and wealthy men, or men with good backing, could take any action they liked regarding the preaching of conscription, but those without influence and money and backing have been thrown into gaol for preaching against it. </para>

                                <para>- The plea has been that they were prejudicing recruiting. If the Minister had made a start on <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Frank</inline> Madden, he would have done something equitable. It was he who referred to the workers as " grey backs " and "creeping things." Dozens of instances can be brought forward in which the War Precautions Act has been put into operation against the working classes, whilst influential men were allowed to go scot free after insulting the workers at their own sweet will. Men who did not enlist under the voluntary system, men with family obligations or other good reasons for not enlisting, were called rotters, wasters, and wastrels, while those who opposed conscription were called cowards and bullies in the leading columns of the influential daily papers of Melbourne. The military authorities took no action against these influential people, but if a man on the stump preached against conscription it could be. twisted into an utterance detrimental to recruiting, and he had to suffer the consequences. We believe that no Labour Administration should bring in conscription. Since his return from Great Britain, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> has, I believe, expressed the opinion that the Labour Government, or a Fusion Government, or a Government led by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Cook,</inline> would have to introduce it. Even if it meant the formation of a Fusion Government to-morrow, and putting us into opposition for the next seven" or ten years, I would sooner receive a proposal for conscription from a Fusion Government than from a Labour Government. </para>

                                <para>- My experience of the workers is that when they are oppressed they revolt and remove the disabilities, but when, as during the past two years, they suffer under the insidious administration of their so-called friends, they put up with far more than they would from their opponents. When the workers have to bow their neck to tha yoke of conscription, it will hurt far more if it has to be riveted up by a Labour Prime Minister or a Labour Government. </para>

All the Labour Government have done has been to follow the beaten track of anti-Labour Governments, and go loan-mongering without bringing in effective taxation. The. first thing that should be taxed is the land, because all the money borrowed by Australian Governments prior to the war was borrowed to improve theland. </para>

                                <para>- In this life-and-death matter, the life of the individual does not belong to the community, and I dispute the right of the people to give that man'slife away unless the man is willing to take on the risk voluntarily. For these reasons I cannot support the  Government  proposals, and trust that before the fatal first of October is reached they will give the matter earnest consideration, with a view to a big modification, particularly as regards issuing the proclamation calling up the men even before the people have said " Yes." In my opinion, the Government are making a fatal mistake, which will alienate, to a great extent, much sympathy which might be given to them at the present critical time. I sincerely trust, therefore, that this aspect of the matter will not be overlooked. Those who agree to the referendum on this question of life and death will be morally bound to support the verdict of the people if the vote should prove to be in the affirmative. That is only a logical conclusion. I am, however, opposed to this question going to the people, because I do not think it should be decided by them. Therefore, if a vote be given in the affirmative, I will not abide by the will of the people in this sacred matter of conscience. </para>

                        <para>- I expect that the Bill will be here to-morrow, and for that reason the Senate should sit to-morrow to deal with it. It is hoped that the Referendum Bill will have passed in another place before the end of this week, and it is necessary that that Bill should be through the Senate before the end of the following week. The Government desire to give honorable senators the fullest opportunity to debate the details of that measure, and it will be advisable, therefore, that the Senate should meet on Tuesday next. No honorable senator will then be in a position to say that he did not have an opportunity to speak on the provisions of the Bill. I am aware that this course will call for some sacrifice on the part of those honorable senators whose homes are in the other States, and whose practice is to return to their homes at the week-ends. </para>

                        <para>- No; I expect it will be here at the beginning of next week, and I am indicating this so that honorable senators will be able to make their arrangements accordingly. The business to-morrow will be the consideration of the Supply Bill. The Referendum Bill will be taken next week, and before Parliament adjourns for the campaign, the Senate will have an opportunity to deal with the financial statement, which will set out the Government's war policy, and which will cover both taxation and other financial proposals of the Government. </para>

                    <para>. - I am sure all honorable senators desire to help the Government to conduct the business in the most expeditious way, and as there appears to be some doubt concerning the progress which may be  made in another place, I suggest that, after transacting the business before the Senate to-morrow, instead of adjourning until Tuesday, the Government might ad  journ  until Friday afternoon, by which time we would be in a position to know what are the prospects of obtaining measures from the other House on Tuesday; and we would know whether we should adjourn to the ordinary day, or till Tuesday. The Minister will see that it would be rather foolish to adjourn the Senate from to-morrow until Tuesday, if, when we came here on that day, we found that the business in the other House had  not  been sufficiently advanced to allow the Senate to proceed. </para>

                    <para>.- What I said just now was an intimation concerning the present intention of the Government, which might have to be varied before to-morrow by any developments in regard to these Bills in another place. I can only say, at the present juncture, that the Government will give consideration to the suggestion of the Leader of the Opposition, because it is not the wish of the Government to bring honorable senators back on Tuesday if there will be nothing for them to do. It is intended to take the formal stages of the Referendum Bill on Tuesday, and enable the second-reading stages to be commenced on Wednesday. </para>
