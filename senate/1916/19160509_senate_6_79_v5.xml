" On the 26th November, 1915, the Commonwealth Government cabled to the Imperial Authorities offering to increase its contribution of troops by 50,000, and also undertaking to supply each month the necessary reinforcements. On the basis upon which reinforcements were then required it was calculated that, with the additional number named in this offer, Australia would have raised by the end of June. 1916, for active service abroad 286,000 men. </para>

                <para>These communications had an important effect on the numbers which it was contemplated would have been required, and also on the period over which they would have to be raised, as they meant that, in order to comply with the promise of the Government as modified at the request of the War Office, 209,000 troops would require <inline font-style="italic">to</inline> be despatched by the end of June, 1916. It will be seen that these modifications were made at the request and on the suggestion of the War Office, and were not proposed by the Commonwealth Government. At the same time, the Government does not take the view that its offer of the 26th November exhausts the possibilities of Australia so far as contribution of fighting troops is concerned, and, as Acting Prime Minister, I have, In statements made, endeavoured to make this point clear, and have appealed to the various recruiting organizations throughout the Commonwealth to continue their efforts to gain recruits. </para>
                <para>The latest available figures show that up to the 6th May, 1916, there had embarked from Australia 189,000 troops, and there were in training throughout Australia approximately 62,000, making a total of 251,000.

                    <para>While Government takes entire responsibility for deciding as to voluntary or compulsory service, and does not invite the Federal Parliamentary War Committee to make any recommendation thereon, it is desired to ascertain from the Committee whether, in view of the necessity of efficiently maintaining our industrial and commercial life, together with the responsibilities of Australia in this war, and in comparison with the contributions of other Dominions, the Committee is of the opinion that the Commonwealth is adequately represented at the front. The Committee is, therefore, invited to offer any advice or recommendation with a view to the improvement of the present system of recruiting.' </para>

                    <para>The Committee notes that the Government does not submit to it the question of voluntary service as compared with universal compulsory service. The Committee, without expressing any views on the question of the comparative contributions of the other Dominions, is of the opinion that Australia is not adequately represented at the front. It recommends that the Government fix an early date for a minimum number of new recruits, accompanied by a public intimation that if the number be not forthcoming by the specified date the whole question of the voluntary system will be reviewed. </para>

                        <para>It cannot be definitely stated how long the war is likely to last ; consequently the time within which Australia will be required to send men to the front is indefinite. It is pointed out that, in the early stages of the war, it was urged upon the Government to fix upon a definite number - 100,000 - as the contribution of the Commonwealth to the Empire. If this suggestion had been adopted, it would, without any doubt, have had a disastrous effect on recruiting, because, when the number decided upon had been raised, it would have been contended that Australia had fulfilled its obligations. The same objection holds good now against fixing any definite number. </para>

That is the particular difficulty to which I wish to direct the attention of the Acting Prime Minister, and I shall be glad if the Government will consider means of overcoming it in some way. </para>

The War Councils in the States have been asked to see that those chosen for the positions have some qualifications, and are tactful. Where cases of recruiting sergeants being unwise in their statements have come before us, the matter has been brought under the notice of .the War Councils, with a view to putting the men concerned on to more suitable work. </para>
