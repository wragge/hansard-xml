                    <para>- (By <inline font-style="italic">leave)</inline> I wish to make a personal explanation. On Saturday last I made some reference to the fact that I believed that certain statements which I had made in a speech from the previous day had been censored from the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> report. You, sir, pointed out that that could not be. On your statement, I unreservedly withdrew what </para>

                <para class="block">I said. I wish now to make a further explanation. I said that, according to. the best of my recollection, something had been omitted from my speech which I thought should not have been omitted. I promised to go more carefully over the speech, and I have done so. I have discovered that it was I who made the mistake. I do not, and. never have, desired, during my public career, that any blame should rest upon an officer of Parliament for any mistake of mine. I may be permitted to say that I was reading the proof of my speech, and was called out of the chamber. This was during the all-night sitting, and when I came back to take up the reading of the proof again things were pretty lively. Instead of beginning where I had left off my reading of the proof, I missed a portion of the report. I have discovered that <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> &#39;did not make any mistake, and that a full report of my remarks was given. I take the first opportunity to remove any blame which may have been cast upon the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> Staff through my mistake. </para>

The Government exercise no control over <inline font-style="italic">Hansard.</inline> The only control exercised over <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> is by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker</inline> and myself. That practice should continue, because I have always held that Parliament should be supreme in the control of what concerns the two Houses, and no Government has any right to say what Parliament shall or shall not do. There is another matter to which I should like to refer in this connexion. Going into the matter raised by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O&#39;Keefe&#39;s</inline> remarks, because I went into it, as well as the honorable senator, I find that any censoring of the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> reports that has been done has been the work of honorable senators themselves, who have at times taken the liberty of cutting out of the reports of their speeches certain things which they did not desire to appear. </para>

                        <para>Private Donald Jones was admitted to the Military Hospital at Broughton Hall and transferred to a cottage which, though in the grounds of Callan Park, is used for severe mental cases in connexion with Broughton Hall, and is a portion of that hospital. He was not certified as being a lunatic. As his case is one of acute mania he was removed to Callan Park proper in order that he might be given special attention. His mental condition is, unfortunately, still bad. Owing to the lack of accommodation at Broughton Hall, such patients, when it is for their benefit, are sent occasionally to the ordinary portion of the Hospital for the Insane at Callan Park. There they receive differential treatment to ordinary civil patients. Additional accommodation is being provided at Broughton Hall. When complete Callan Park will only be used for bad or acute cases needing special attention. </para>

                            <para>- I regret that the honorable senator was not previously in possession of a copy of the Bill, which, is one of an extremely simple character, and on&#169; which I feel confident will be readily approved. It forms part and parcel of the Government scheme of taxation. Originally, it was intended to raise about &#163;1,000,000 by means of a tax upon sports, entertainments, theatres, and picture-shows generally. That estimate, however, was based on a misapprehension. Owing to the fact that many of the States either immediately prior to, or since the announcement of this policy, have adopted this method of taxation, the Government have been compelled to recast their own scheme. , It has become necessary for them to reduce the previous estimate of the revenue likely to be derived from this source by one-half. Originally it was intended to tax these amusements to the extent of about 16 per cent. , but the impost which it is now proposed to levy will average only about 8 per cent. I am not able to give the exact figures, because since the last estimate was made the other branch of the Legislature has excised the proposed tax .on 6d. tickets. </para>

                        <para>. - In this Bill we are invited to impose a tax upon certain institutions, which&#39; are to be indicated in some other measure. The Assistant Minister, seems&#39; to think that the fact that this Chamber will have control over that Bill is sufficient to justify it in finalizing this measure without knowing what that other Bill contains. I submit it is very important that we should know &#39; something of the way in which the proposed tax is to be levied. I. therefore suggest that, after, having passed the Bill through Committee, we should not finally relinquish our hold upon it until we have had an opportunity of considering the provisions of the Entertainments Tax Assessment Bill. </para>

                        may dislike the tax, or we may favour it, but that is quite immaterial. Whether we say &#34;Yes&#34; or  &#39; No, &#39; &#39; it will be levied . The impost being inevitable, we are faced with this further question, &#34; As it is a war tax, which Government ought to collect it, the one which is called upon to face the expenditure  incidental to the war, or the Governments which are not? &#34; If we could avoid placing a tax on the sixpenny, tickets for admission to amusements, I should say that the schedule is right as it stands. But these sixp&#39;enny tickets are going to be taxed. Indeed&#39;, they are already being taxed elsewhere, and the revenue thus raised - if we do riot impose the tax - will find its way into the State coffers,- instead of into the Federal Treasury. &#39; In the circumstances, I ask whether we may not reasonably impose a tax on the sixpenny tickets, with the proviso that it shall not become operative except by proclamation, and that such proclamation shall not be issued unless it is seen that the State Governments are going to raid the field.

                            <para>- Two States have . already done so, and Tasmania has  timidly approached the field by imposing a licence-fee of &#163;10 in respect of a building which will accommodate 700 people. If we pass the Bill in its present form, the New South Wales Government may say that the Commonwealth has not touched the sixpenny tickets, and, therefore, it is justified in doing so. But if we take up the attitude I have outlined, that Government will probably keep its hands off those tickets. I do not wish to tax these sixpenny tickets if the States will give some guarantee that they will not touch them. In the absence of that guarantee, we ought to adopt some precautionary measure such as I have suggested. If the sixpenny tickets are to be taxed, and the people are to pay that taxation in the name of the war and because of the war, the revenue &#39;derived therefrom should find its way into the Federal Treasury. I do not think that the New South Wales Government would superimpose a tax upon that of the Commonwealth. </para>

                            <para>- She is levying a light tax of Jd. on a sixpenny ticket, I think . A war tax ought to go into the war treasury. &#39; It is of no use to abstain from taxing sixpenny tickets out of consideration for the people who would have to pay the tax, if the moment we stand aloof some other taxing body steps in and takes the amount. If this tax is to be collected, it ought to be made clear that the only justification for it is the war. It is monstrous if we abstain, out of consideration for the people, from calling on them for a contribution to the war tax, and immediately some State Government, which has nothing to do with the war, comes along, and, smiling at our consideration for these people, takes from them the dole that we refrain from taking. </para>

I do not mind putting in, &#34; For war purposes &#34; if it will make <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O&#39;Keefe</inline> any happier. If it is not a war tax, I am against it altogether. I am assenting to it only because I believe it is one of&#39; the necessary measures, unpleasant though they be, which must be passed to finance the expenses consequent on the war. That being so, I am strongly disinclined to see another Government collect what is really a war tax, when that Government is in no sense called on to meet war liabilities. It may be a little difficult, but I suggest that we might introduce an amendment levying the tax to-day, but holding it in abeyance until the issue of a proclamation to be issued only .in the event of any other&#39; State Government attempting to impose that tax which we now refrain from imposing. </para>

                        <para>. - I am opposed to this kind of taxation. It is not only undemocratic, but altogether out of line with modern ideas of how the money required to carry on the government of the country ought to be provided. I can show a much better field of taxation than this. If the Government is so helpless as to be compelled to tax the little innocent amusements of the people, it ought to throw up the sponge. We ought to have some clearly-defined ideas as to the finding of revenue. I look on the community as a huge insurance society represented . by the Government, every one paying a premium according to the amount of benefit he receives. The premium ought to be in proportion to the security afforded to the individual by the Government. The Government throws its shield over every man, woman, and child. It preserves our lives, or we expect that it will, our liberties, and our property. Every man&#39;s life is of equal value with the life of his neighbour, and the life of every woman and child is on the same plane. But when we come to property there is a remarkable difference between the various units of the community. Some men own property worth millions ; other people own only what they stand up in. It necessarily follows that those who have a large stake in the country, as it is called, ought to pay a higher premium than those who have a comparatively small stake. Shortly put, contributions to the revenue ought to be in proportion to one&#39;s capacity to pay. That is the principle I would lay down in regard to taxation. I would not tax a man because he owned a motor car,&#39; or because he had a fine and well-furnished house, or because he wore certain kinds of jewellery. I would tax him solely on what he possessed, which is the only legitimate method of imposing taxation. That is the kind of taxation which has always been advocated by the Labour party, of which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie</inline> was, and, I suppose, will tell us he is still, a member. No doubt this tax was proposed by the late Government, but I scouted it then just as I do now. It is a deliberately undemocratic method of taxation, which ought not to be allowed to pass by the Senate, a majority of which is made up of Labour members. It is going back to the dark ages. We read of the existence one or two hundred years ago of every kind of iniquitous tax, the purpose of which was to save the rich from taxation. They used to have a window tax, and all kinds of other tiddly-winking taxation, so as to save the rich from being compelled to pay their fair share towards the cost of government. There was some excuse for them in those times, because the rich were the only people who sat in Parliament, and naturally they passed such legislation as suited themselves; but now the poor are supposed to be represented in Parliament, and here we have a proposal brought down to tax their amusements. Some people appear to think that to go to a place of amusement is absolutely wicked. Every human being must have a certain amount of amusement. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> said this was a war tax, and that he would not consent to it if We were not at war&#39;. I say that in a time of strain like this people require more amusement than under normal conditions, and instead of that being an argument for the imposition of a tax of this character the Government are proposing a tax in a diametrically opposite direction. If we want money for the war we should go to the people who have got it. There are people in this country who own, I believe, nearly &#163;2,000,000,000 worth of wealth. How much of that are we getting? Ought we not to exhaust that source of taxation before we attempt to interfere with picture shows or theatres? </para>

                            <para>- I thought sixpenny seats were taxed. Even so, I do hot think this kind of tax will commend itself to a Chamber the majority of whose members are pledged to quite a different system of taxation. Why should we tax the amusements of the people? If the proposal were made to tax people who go to church every Sunday there would be a howl of indignation, and rightly so. But when we start out- to tax the people who go to picture shows, or theatres, or other places of amusement, quite a number of honorable senators seem to (think it is a legitimate method of getting revenue. God help the community which finds, itself driven to this last resource of the impotent or the stupid. Why not go to the rich at once ? How much are we getting from, land-value taxation? Could pot more be obtained? Have we exhausted that source of revenue? Have we even fairly tapped it yet? What good are we going to do by taxing amusements? It has become quite an axiom with&#39; the medical profession that a certain amount of relaxation and amusement is as necessary for the well-being, comfort, and happiness of the citizen as even food and clothing. Are we, then, going to place obstacles in the way of the poorer section getting that amusement? The rich can have shows in their houses every night in the week. They have their balls and parties, with bands playing; they have their pianos and pianolas, and various other kinds of amusement ; but Parliament does not propose to tax them, nor would I propose anything of the kind. But I would tax these people according to their possessions. If a man is worth &#163;1,000 or &#163;100,000, let him pay in proportion, and&#39; not until we have exhausted those forms of taxation should we degrade ourselves to tax the innocent amusements of the poor. </para>

                            <para>- Every man ought to be a judge of that matter for himself. If the honorable senator thinks whisky is good for him he takes it, and if he does so, he contributes something to the revenue, to which I have no objection. Whisky and amusements are two different things altogether, though I know some people get a certain amount of amusement out of whisky. One would imagine that we were living a hundred years ago, that the Government of every country in the civilized world was in the hands of the rich, and that forms of taxation were being devised for the one set purpose of freeing the rich from any contributions toward the cost of government, and imposing the whole burden on the backs of the poor. </para>

                            <para>- I am not talking about Flemington or the dress circle seats at the theatres, but of a proper form of taxation. We should tax a man, not for what he does, but for what he has. If the kind of taxation proposed in the Bill were carried to its logical conclusion the man who hoards would contribute the least towards the cost of government, while the man who spends would pay the most: If a man goes to a theatre and takes his family with him, he circulates a certain amount of money, and he is, at least, doing some good to the community, because he is helping some other man to find bread and butter, clothing, and house room for his family. The same may be said about those who go to an ordinary picture show, and even to a race-course. Spending money on a race-course may seem to some people a very foolish and useless thing. Personally, I hardly ever go to the race-course, and I never by any chance put money on a horse, because I am not sure of winning. Probably if I were sure, it might be a different matter. </para>

                            <para>- I have no objection, however, to other people going to such places and spending their time and cash in that way. If a man never went to a theatre, or picture show, or any other form of entertainment, he would escape a certain amount of taxation. Honorable senators must remember that the more money we get out of the people by these means the less we will have to look for in other directions. I repeat that the kind of taxation provided in the Bill before the&#34; Senate is bad from every point of view. It is bad in essence; it is against the best interests, more particularly of the poorer sections of the people, and it will act as a deterrent in a large number of cases where people might be thinking of going to places of entertainment. There are other directions in which we ought to go for money to carry on the government of the country. I have referred to one of them on many occasions, and if I remain a member of this Chamber I suppose I shall feel it incumbent on me to refer to it many times in the future, and that is to get from the community the values created by the community. Until that area of taxation, or of revenue - it is not taxation - has been exhausted, not a farthing should be placed upon the amusements of our people. I do not wish to say anything further about the measure. I intend to vote against the second reading, and to oppose any attempt at taxation of this character. </para>

I am going to oppose the second reading, because I do not believe in taxing the amusements of the people, especially, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart</inline> has so ably outlined, when there are in the Commonwealth citizens who are not being taxed to any appreciable extent at all, so far as their contributions to the war are concerned. The late Government, in their financial proposals, set out that there would be a wealth tax of a certain amount, covering a certain period, also that it was the intention to take all war profits, after allowing a certain amount in interest. </para>

That Government had a solid following in both branches of the Parliament, and though certain proposals were submitted to a meeting of the party which I attended, members of the party were not bound in any way to support either. Accordingly I thought myself as free then as I do today to support or oppose them. At that meeting only the financial statement was made. </para>

I was merely replying to an interjection by the Minister for Works. During the recent referendum campaign I told the electors from every platform that I would not support an amusements tax because it was an attempt&#39; to levy upon the poorer sections of. the community. I hold that opinion to-day, and I say the principle is wrong, even though sixpenny tickets may be exempted, to tax any man whose family may wish to go to a picture show, the prices for admission to which may be1s. </para>

                            <para>- It is usually done. When I and two of my colleagues were coming through from Western Australia recently we decided to while away an hour or two at a picture show in Adelaide, where the State entertainments tax is in operation, and we found an intimation on a poster in front of the theatre that the price of a sixpenny ticket was l&#189;d. extra. From our experience, therefore, I am arguing that the1d. tax, as  proposed in this Bill, on a shilling ticket will not be borne by the proprietors of the theatre, but by the patrons. </para>

                            <para>- And because it is a special case, I think that the proprietors of these theatres are better able to bear the loss of that penny, and the taxation itself, than are the patrons of them. So far as the principle of the tax is concerned, I am against it. It is a very old and true saying that &#34;All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy.&#34; We know that one of the most popular forms of recreation for the working classes is the picture show. Whilst there may be exhibited in places films that should not be shown, and should be prohibited, still, it is a cheap and very often instructive method of passing a couple of hours in the afternoon or evening. &#34;But be that as it may, when I see a Government that proposes not to take the whole of the war profits, as was originally intended; when I see a Government not going on with the levy on wealth in the way which was proposed, I fail to see why this Government should come down for a start and want to tax the poorer portion of. the community. After all, what amount are they going to get from this source? It will be very small. </para>

                            <para>- Even had the Government adhered to the original proposal, it is not the amount of revenue obtained from the tax I am alluding to, but the principle. I do, not believe in imposing a tax on the poorer people of the community, who, it is well known, have very little time for recreation. If they have a chance to enjoy a few hours in a cheap way, I do not think it is right for any Government to impose a tax which would prevent them from obtaining that little recreation. </para>

                            <para>- That remark is perfectly true; but Governments and their Treasurers are very loath to let go a substantial source of revenue, once they realize the amount of money which can be obtained by probably one of the easiest methods possible, and that is by taxing the amusements of the people. I am a Labour man, who is now, and always have been, opposed to this form of taxation. In the years that have gone, the classes we represent here had very few opportunities for mental improvement, and had very few of the pleasures which fell to the lot of a certain favoured section of the community. Our platform has been a comprehensive one, making for the elevation&#34; and the betterment of the vast army of struggling industrials, and by the substantial progress we have made in the different States, we have enabled thousands of men, women, and children to have to-day some mental recreation which they had not the privilege of enjoying ten or twenty years ago. The principle embodied in this form of tax is altogether wrong. Are we to adduce as a reason why we should impose taxation that all forms  of luxury should  be taxed? We know  that that is the reason  why some  persons favour an amusements tax. They say, &#34; An amusement is a luxury, and why should not people pay for a luxury?&#34; </para>

Why should they be taxed? </para>

I am one. of those who, whatever my sins or shortcomings may be, have never made known anything which has taken place at a party meeting when it has been held in private. I have held that view through life, but if the honorable senator wants me to tell honorable senators what I said and did, I will tell them, but not otherwise. </para>

That is a very small sum when we cornel to consider the avenues which&#39; are open to the Government. Why is it proposed to tax amusements, and allow to go scot-free from any form of taxation, probably for all time, those patriotic gentlemen who put some money into the war loan? Should this Government be permitted to remain on the Treasury bench, these gentlemen are to be allowed, when the next loan is floated, to go scot-free, and all those persons who participate in any form of amusement, and pay the large sum of1s. for admittance, are to be taxed. </para>

All free shows are to be exempted from taxation, says <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Senior.</inline> The present Government propose, in connexion with the taxation of war profits, that the exploiters shall be relieved of taxation by imposing taxation upon people who, when all is said and done, have too few opportunities of attending places of amusement. During the progress of the war, many persons have made abnormal profits by exploiting the great working mass of the community. These profits are not to be taken from them, as proposed by the late Government, but their taxation is to be eased down as compared with the taxation of war-time profits proposed in the Old Country. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lloyd</inline> George&#39;s Government propose to take the whole of the war-time profits. The late Commonwealth Government proposed to take the whole of the war-time profits for the second year, but the present Government propose to take only 75 per cent. of the war profits in the second year, after allowing a fair profit of 7 or 8 per cent. In the Old Country, the estimate of profits is to be based upon those earned during the three years immediately preceding the war, and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lloyd</inline> George&#39;s Government now propose that the whole of the war-time profits shall be taken by the </para>

                    <para class="block">Government. There is one consideration which ought to guide the Labour party in the matter of taxation. This proposed taxation is opposed to the principles upon which honorable members of the Labour party were first elected. It is a form of taxation to which no one who has given attention to the Labour platform or to economics can subscribe. Honorable senators opposite justify it now because this is war time, but once an honorable senator gives his vote for this form of taxation, because it is war time, he may be assured that future Governments will continue it as long as possible. To justify this taxation, one must break away from a first principle of the Labour party, which is direct taxation. This is not direct taxation, but indirect taxation of the worst kind. It is a special class tax. The taxation to which all members of the Labour party can subscribe is land-value taxation. </para>

He gave the deputationists. no encouragement whatever.

                            <para>- That does not  alter my view of the matter. I ask myself whether this is a proper form of taxation, and I say that it is not. It is breaking away from .the first principles of taxation affirmed by the Labour party. If the Government require money, they could obtain very much more than &#163;350,000 from the taxation of land values, a legitimate form of taxation, which there ought not to be any hesitation about adopting at this time. </para>

                            <para>- I will  admit&#34;  that ; but that is no reason why I should! vote for this tax. Surely the Government do not pretend that &#39; unless they can1 pass this Bill they will riot be able to pay the interest on our war indebtedness.. It is far better for us to say here and! now that we do not believe&#39; in this form of taxation, and we think that the Government should  impose  direct taxation. Much! as I object to the present Government continuing to occupy the Treasury; bench, I say that if they imposed a tax on land values they would be doing something that would commend itself to a very large section of the citizens of Australia. </para>

                            <para>- No,I will not; but I want to point out how extensive a field is open to the Government if they desire to tax land. A much more substantial amount of revenue than can be raised under the proposed entertainments tax might be obtained by the taxation of land values to an extent which, so far from injuring any one, would stimulate industry and make people prosperous who are not prosperous to-day. I feel sure that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Grant,</inline> who has a few words&#34; to say on the taxation of land values, will confirm my statement that by a proper and legitimate taxation of land values it would be possible for the Government to obtain between &#163;2,000,000 and &#163;3,000,000 per annum. If the Government are not disposed to go in whole-heartedly for land value taxation they might still propose a small measure of that form of taxation. It would need to be but a very small tax upon land values that would return the &#163;350,000 which they would lose if this Bill were not carried. </para>

                            <para>- I have no desire to further occupy the time of the Senate beyond expressing the hope that this form of taxation will not be agreed to. I recognise that these are abnormal times, and I also realize the heavy responsibilities imposed on the Government by the stress imposed by the war. But I am inclined to think that if the Ministry had further time to consider their taxation proposals they would not be wedded to a tax on amusements. I know that some of those who will support this Bill would not do so under different conditions. I hope that the measure will not be carried, because I hold that there are other and more legitimate avenues of taxation open to us if we choose to exploit them. I am not at all concerned with what the State Parliaments may do in the direction suggested by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Milieu.</inline> If they are prepared to do wrong, that is their business. But if the principle underlying this Bill is a bad one, we ought not to support it. It is because that principle is unsound that I hope this form of taxation will not be agreed to. </para>

                            <para>- Well, it was the late Government. I say that a proposal to add to the multitudinous taxes which the people have to pay, for the sake of collecting &#163;350,000 annually, has neither equity nor commonsense behind it. As <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley</inline> has already pointed out, this &#163;350,000 could easily be raised from other sources of taxation. &#39; </para>

                            <para>- No. I know of no plank in the Labour platform which says anything about an Entertainments Tax. I never agreed to these second-hand methods of taxation, because I know that by going direct to those who are in receipt of big incomes the same object can be accomplished without creating a new tax. . One has only to look at the new digest issued by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Knibbs</inline> to discover fields of taxation which may be legitimately exploited to-day. According to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Knibbs</inline> there are 7,437 persons in the Commonwealth - and the position is understated rather than overstated, because this is merely a progress report - who take &#163;15,481,487 of the national income annually. Each one of these incomes is in excess of &#163;1,000 per annum, the average being &#163;2,800 per year If, in. lieu of this tax on amusements, which will fall very largely on the working classes whom my honorable friends opposite claim to represent, we levied a super-tax of 6d. in the &#163;1 on all incomes above &#163;1,000 per year, it would yield a revenue of &#163;387,000 annually. What is wrong with a proposition of that kind? </para>

                            <para>- I would like to see figures to prove that in any case in which an income is in excess of &#163;1,000 a year, it would be more than half absorbed by the State and Federal income taxes. Although we have a heavy land tax in operation, its effect has not been to smash up the very big estates. The seasons have been so prosperous that the large land-holders are paying the tax. In 1913-14 there were 404 men in the Commonwealth holding estates of between &#163;50,000 and &#163;100,000 in value. The aggregate capital value of those estates was &#163;24,802,803. During the same year there were 128 gentlemen or companies holding estates worth from &#163;100,000 to &#163;250,000 unimproved values, and these estates aggregated &#163;16,435,560. In other words, there were 532 individuals or companies in Australia whose estates totalled an unimproved value of &#163;42,338,363. What about levying a supertax on them ? If we imposed a tax of only 3d. in the &#163;1 upon these gentlemen, it would realize far more revenue than will be collected under this Bill, and no one with less than &#163;50,000 worth of land would pay the super -tax. </para>

I am not prepared to do it while there are men in Australia who own the greater part of Australia, and are not prepared to shoulder their responsibilities. For that reason I cannot support this tax as to either the rate or the principle, and shall vote against it on the second-reading stage, and also in Committee. </para>

                        <para>. - I give the Bill my hearty support and approval. It is brought forward for the first time, and is quite justified in the circumstances. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Needham, Senator Findley,</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ready</inline> are all opposing a taxation proposal introduced by the late Government, and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley,</inline> in his concluding remarks, said he was doing so honestly and sincerely. These proposals were agreed to at the Caucus which those gentlemen attended, and not a word was said in opposition to, them, but now that they have been brought down by the new Government they are opposed. From that fact we can judge the amount of honesty and sincerity that there is in the opposition shown to them this afternoon. </para>

                            <para>- I am stating what happened there. It is not necessary to be there to know what takes place. The best way to find out what happens in the Caucus is to read the <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> or <inline font-style="italic">Argus</inline> next morning. The only meetings of which those papers cannot get hold of the secrets are those of the new Nationalist party. This kind of taxation is quite justified in the circumstances, and the fact that it was brought in with other measures by the Labour Government before there was any split in the party is. the very best proof of that. We are merely following in the&#39; wake of every other country engaged in the war. War conditions have brought about a change of circumstances in taxation, as in everything else, and we are quite justified in adopting every available source of revenue. It is of no use to talk of raising the old-age pension or of providing pensions for the widows and orphans of fallen soldiers unless we are prepared to take every legitimate means to raise the money. Where can it come from, unless we go to those who have money to spend on entertainments and luxuries? </para>

                            <para>-Although there is not, the taxation of luxuries is as severe there as, and in some ways severer than, in Australia. In Canada there is not only an entertainments tax of the same kind as in Great Britain, but there is a 10 per cent, war tax on a seat in the observation car or a sleeping berth ticket on the Canadian-Pacific railway. There is an extra tax for war purposes on letters, newspapers, and post-cards. Surely an entertainments tax is far more justifiable than a tax on mail matter. As Australia is paying a great deal more per head of population for war purposes than any other country, we are quite justified in looking for new sources of revenue. I am quite prepared to see every reasonable taxation imposed on any kind of land, but it will be found before very long, as many of us who have had a little experience in land have discovered already, that we can tax that form of wealth altogether too heavily. If I had my way I would strike off every tax that is keeping, the working man on the land in the position in which we find him to-day. He is the worst paid worker to be found in any part of Australia. The man on the land is being sweated, and until he is organized he will have to bear the burden. </para>

                            <para>- There is very little land monopoly in Western Australia. Plenty of land is available there for any one who desires it. I can get the honorable senator 160 acres there for nothing. If those who are always howling about land taxation want to test their ability to utilize land, and get that enormous wealth which is&#39; said to be waiting for anybody who takes up land, I can offer them free farms galore in Western Australia. No less than 700 farms have been given up during the last twelve months in that State. I notice that those who howl most about land taxation take very good care to have nothing to do with the land as a profession. </para>

                        <para>. - I have assured the Administration openly in the Senate that I would give them such support as I thought necessary in regard to their war programme of taxation or any other form of legislative activity. Whether the numbers are up for or against this measure, I am prepared to carry out my promise, and vote for the Bill. The only people I am sorry for in this connexion are the unfortunate State Treasurers. In war, I know, we want men and money, and if we were not at wax, I should certainly not vote for this measure, but would regard this field of taxation as one that ought more particularly to be reserved for the activities of State Treasurers and State Parliaments. In war, however, all things are abnormal, and the wise men who framed the Constitution reserved to the National Government full power of taxation over everything and anything. In normal times I objected to the imposition of a Federal land tax, but had it been proposed contemporaneously with the war I should not have voted against it, as I always said it ought to be regarded as a tax for war times. This measure, whatever its merits or demerits, is one about which there will practically be no protests whatever, because the people who go to picture shows will be quite prepared to pay the tax. If a man wishes to take his family or some friends to a picture show, he will be quite willing to pay the prices demanded. We .are told .that upon a ls. 6d. ticket there will be a tax of l&#163;d. Now, a ticket at ls. 6d. will insure to the holder thereof a pretty luxurious seat in the ordinary picture show, and a man who can afford such a seat will not object to the extra l&#163;d. demanded. I must say, however, that I do not like duality of taxation. I do not like to see a&#39; Federal tax superimposed upon a State tax, but this kind of thing is obviously inevitable in our present circumstances, and because of the financial situation arising out of this great war. But I suggest to honorable senators that, in regard to future taxation, we should have some regard for the difficulties of the State Treasurers, and, if possible, avoid hampering them to any great extent by an invasion of fields which, in normal circumstances, might be regarded as State areas of taxation. I know this tax is going to be a fairly productive one, and that in spite of the protests from managers of the picture shows, it will be received by the general public with  comparative  complacency. That being so, my only regret - if I may be permitted to repeat myself - is that it constitutes, to my mind, an invasion of the field that ought to be reserved for the Treasurers of the different States of the Commonwealth. Just one word more. I must say that I have been much amused at those gentlemen who are continually urging the imposition of heavy taxation upon land, and who are saying that land must bear its full share of taxation. It may be that- if this war continues, and our debt increases, the land will have to bear still greater burdens. But I do pity those gentlemen who, while advocating the imposition of heavy burdens on the land, are also prepared to make that taxation heavier by fixing prices for primary products in a downward direction. </para>

                        <para>. - I think one mistake was made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie when he said that the taxation proposals were agreed to by the party with which he was previously associated. This is a measure which, even had there been no political crisis, would have been considered by the Parliament. When we realize that every country affected by this war is in difficulty, especially as regards taxation, and that, so far, Australia has not felt it to the same extent, it seems to me there is ample justification to vote for this measure, as I propose to do. Let us see what it is. We have heard a, lot of talk about hypocrisy in politics, and I have in my mind the Ministerial statement read by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce,</inline> on behalf of the Labour party, before the referendum was taken. It was presented to this House by command, and ordered to be printed on the 27th September, 1916, so it is useless for any honorable senator .to say that he did not know a referendum was to be taken. As a matter of fact, we were preparing then for the referendum. The financial statement to which I have referred contains this paragraph - </para>

                            <para>- Undoubtedly, and what was it that induced honorable senators to agree to this sort of taxation ? We might just as well examine the circumstances and understand clearly the reason. Prior to that time, the exemption on the income of the wage earner stood at &#163;156 a year, with an allowance of &#163;13 for each child, so that a man with a wife and four children could claim exemption on an income up to &#163;208. When this proposal for increased war taxation was brought up, an alteration made in the income tax exemption induced a considerable number of the Labour party to agree to an entertainments tax. The  income tax  exemption for children was raised from &#163;13 to &#163;26, with the- result that a man with a wife and four children under the age of sixteen years could claim exemption on an income up to &#163;260 a year, and escape practically all taxation except that collected indirectly through the Customs. Now, that is the position to-day, and that is the reason - I am speaking personally - that I agreed to taxation on entertainments, for I believe that a man with an income tax exemption of &#163;260 could afford to pay a small amount in the way of war taxation if he patronized a picture show. I admit that the tax is bad in principle, and I do not believe that it would have been proposed or mentioned but for the severe strain imposed upon the finances of this country owing to the war. I think, however, that the Government would have made it easier for the members of this party if they had informed us, before this Bill was introduced, what classes of entertainment would come under the proposed tax, because there are various forms of entertainment which, in my opinion, should not be included. As the measure stands, there is no exemption practically, and we shall have to wait until we. get the Assessment Bill before these details can be ascertained. I repeat that when it was proposed by the previous Government to relieve the family man of other taxation, the Labour party agreed to pass legislation in the form of an entertainments tax, and this would have been carried had not the party crisis occurred. I believe that at that time there would have been a big majority in support of a tax upon the sixpenny tickets which under this Bill are to be exempt. </para>

                            <para>- No. I think that, in spite of the exemption under the income tax, the majority of the members would have objected to a tax on threepenny tickets under this proposal, but I believe that sixpenny tickets would have been included, whereas this Bill exempts the latter. This war has caused a very great deal of inconvenience in every . country -of the world. The war has not been raging in Australia, and so far it has not made a great deal of difference to an enormous proportion of its people. A large number of labourers have been taken out of this country, and so people have been able to obtain employment here. In very many cases wages have been increased during the last two years. </para>

                            <para>- Yes. I believe that this taxation will be of a temporary character. Seeing that the people of this country are enjoying better conditions than are enjoyed in any- other belligerent country, I believe that a big majority of our population are not only able but are prepared to pay taxation for the purposes of the war. There are large numbers of workers here who would be prepared to pay more taxation if called upon, rather than be stuck up every day or two at the street corner and asked to contribute to private funds. I have spoken to many men on this subject. When I was explaining to a friend only a month ago that there would be increased taxation - a tax on pictures and one thing and another - he said to me, &#34; That does not matter.&#34; I told my friend that it was intended to impose a tax of &#163;1 a year on every single man who was making at least &#163;100 a year, and he said, &#34; A tax of &#163;1 a year ! My goodness ! I only wish that they would put a couple of pounds on me, and relieve me from the importunities to which I am subjected every time I go down the street. If I were to give to the various funds to which I am asked to subscribe every time I go out, I would hardly have a shilling to take home to my wife and children.&#34; If this proposed taxation is imposed, it may perhaps prevent persons from subscribing to these funds as freely as they do now. But that will not impose any more hardship. I believe that people will rather welcome taxation of this kind when they know that it is to be only temporary. It is all very well for some honorable senators to turn round and say, &#34; The party need not have considered legislation of this description; they could have imposed a heavier land tax, a heavier income tax, and a heavier tax on the subscribers to war loans.&#34; Let me remind the Senate that there were not many honorable senators who voted to tax such persons. I believe that investments in war loans should be as open to taxation as any other investments into which people put money. That is the reason why I supported the proposal to tax war investments. I did not believe that millions of money in this country should be altogether exempt from any sort of taxation. But we were not able to carry our amendment. If those who now say that it is fair to tax war investments had recorded their votes in favour of our amendment there would have been no exemption today in that regard. We may come back to the proposal later; I do not know. Seeing that the statement laid on the table on the 27th September, and printed, included the imposition of an entertainments tax, and seeing, further, that we as a body had practically agreed to the proposal, because we had exempted a larger measure of income in connexion with the worker than he had previously enjoyed, I propose to vote for the entertainments tax on this occasion. I do not believe in being a humbug. If I had been strongly opposed to the proposals of the late Government, I should have risen and said, &#34;I do not believe in the proposals of the Government whom I am sitting behind.&#34; Seeing that there has been a change &#39;of Government, and that the present Ministers have eased up the taxation as practically proposed by the Labour party as a whole in September last, and that some more relief is given to those who are in the habit of attending entertainments, I propose to vote for the second reading of this Bill. I can quite understand persons saying - for it was a statement which affected me - &#34;How about the man in the  country?  That is the reason why I am  very  glad to see the easing up of this taxation. In the cities persons can go down the street and enter a picture show for 3d., and they think they are paying a big sum if they pay 6d. It is the people in the country districts who will get a little relief from this measure. Travelling companies have to charge a great deal more in a number of towns than they do when they are stationary. When the Government offer cheap fares, country people, who do not get so much amusement as do town people, .come down to the towns at various festivals. They visit the picture shows, and other entertainments because they have not been able to get near them in the country. Again, we are told that this legislation is going to cover persons who go to races and all that sort of thing. During the conscription campaign we could hear from one end of the country to the other this complaint : &#39; &#39; H&#39;ow about those persons who are ready and able to attend race-courses almost every day of the week, and do not propose to do8 anything else?&#34; That is what brought on the whole trouble. To-day we hear not only about taxing persons who go to racecourses, and are able to pay big prices for admission, but we also hear a very large number of persons expressing the view that if that was the reason why we had to go through the turmoil of a  referen-dum,  it was a good reason why the Government should have closed the places of entertainment for a time. But to say that by this measure we are interfering to a very great extent with entertainments like these, seems to me to be so much humbug. I propose, as I did propose when I was following a Government on the other side, to vote for the second reading of this measure. </para>

                        (Tasmania) T5.231. - The arguments raised against the .Bill have mainly been on the line that it imposes a tax on those entertainments which are patronized by the poorer people. Of course, to a great extent that argument is correct. In looking at the entertainments which are patronized by those who earn the lowest wages, that is the poorest people, one naturally turns to the picture shows. As the measure has been altered since it was introduced in another place, and the tax of one half -penny on tickets below the value of sixpence has been knocked out, leaving any charge over sixpence to be the minimum to be taxed, it seems to me that a great deal of the argument which might, in the first instance, have been used against the measure has been swept away. In the cities and towns the prices of admission to picture shows are generally 6d. and1s., or 6d. and children half-price. At almost all the picture shows in Melbourne and its suburbs, the prices, I understand, are 6d. and 3d. I was guilty of attending a picture show on Saturday night, and for the sum of 3s. I took in a rather large family of eight. For four adults I paid 6d. each, and for four children 3d. each. It was a very good show, and 3s. was: the amount which I paid for front seats.

                            <para>- On the general principle of taxing amusements I am going to vote to-day on the lines which I have always followed. I have always been in favour of taxing amusements reasonably. I have always held that as we have to get some measure of revenue to run the country, amusements are a fairly reasonable source from which to obtain part of that revenue, so long as we keep within fair limits. Still I cannot admit that this is a tax on the people who go to these amusements. My view is that an entirely wrong idea is held by those who think that this tax will be passed on. I do not think for a moment that the proprietors of theatres or picture shows who are now charging1s. admission will charge1s.1d. </para>

                            <para>- I am surprised to hear that statement. If. it is being done there now I do not think it will be continued for very long. It will be remembered that when the last increase was made in the Excise duties on spirits - it was a very heavy increase which affected hotelkeepers. very severely - the trade immediately brought into operation a new scale or charges. In many places where there were enough hotelkeepers to have an organization, they combined and adopted a scale of charges. For a little while, but only for a little while, that scale was in force. Then some hotelkeepers began to break away. They found that it paid them better to induce custom by sticking to the old charges, even although they might lose profit, than to turn away custom by charging an increased price for a drink to meet the increased taxation. </para>

                            <para>- In many places in Australia the prices are the same as they were before the increased taxation. Although hotelkeepers increased their charges for the time, they decided it was better to go back to the old prices than to risk the loss of trade. I believe that this tax will fall upon the proprietors of theatres and picture shows, many of whom, even although this is war time, are making a good deal of money from their places of amusement. I have no objection to this, because it shows that large numbers of people are in a position to afford recreation which is the right of every one. At this time, when we are looking to every reasonable source for the production of increased revenue to canyon the war, it does seem to me that it is not an unfair proposal to tax amusements. I have said that I do not think the proprietors of theatres and picture shows will refuse to pay the tax, and even if they should attempt to pass it on, I believe that their patrons will be found ready to pay their share of this taxation, at all events during the continuation of the war. I was&#39; not opposed to this war taxation measure prior to the trouble that arose between the Labour party and the present Government, and I do not intend to oppose it now. I shall support the Bill as it stands. </para>

                        <para>. - The proposals made by the Government in this Bill scarcely warrant the amount of discussion they have received this afternoon. A few weeks ago we were nearly all agreed that it is a fair thing under existing conditions that amusements should bear some taxation, to meet the expenses of the war. &#34;We know that in the Old Land taxation is being raised to-day by means which, in ordinary times, the people would not tolerate. Though the people are subjected to a good deal of inconvenience in the collection of this taxation, they are cheerfully putting up with it, because they know&#39; that the revenue derived from the taxation is to meet the expenses of the war. I am better satisfied with the proposals of the Government than I was when similar proposals were first submitted to the party by the ex-Treasurer. I did not think it was worth while for the Federal Government to go in for the taxation of threepenny tickets. I am glad that they have agreed to. exempt even sixpenny tickets. </para>

                            <para>- Yes, we may leave the threepenny and sixpenny tickets to the States. I should be opposed generally to the Commonwealth interfering with this source of revenue but for the fact that the taxation is imposed to meet the cost of carrying on the war. Some honorable senators abuse the Government for introducing this Bill, and they ask that there should be an increase in the land tax. They are casting about for a means, not of shifting the incidence of taxation, but of embarrassing the present Government. I ask them whether they consider it is a fair thing that persons patronizing race-courses at the present time should not pay something towards the expenses of the war? , At this time, when there is so much real fighting to be done at the war, I ask whether men who are prepared to pay &#163;1, &#163;2, or &#163;3 to see a couple of pugilists knock each other about should not be called upon to pay some taxation to raise revenue for the conduct of the war? </para>

                            <para>- I agree with the honorable senator. We have had an entertainments tax in South Australia for some months, and I have never heard a man or a woman complain about it. But I believe that if the Federal tax were to be added to the State tax on a threepenny ora sixpenny ticket for a place of amusement the impost would be rather too severe. Some speakers have said that if a difference had not occurred between the two sections of the Labour party this measure of taxation would have been brought forward, and would have been passed. Every honest member of this Parliament will agree that it was the intention of the Labour party to impose this form of taxation, and that only the exemptions were to be matters for consideration by individual members. But wherever an opportunity presents itself to do something which might harass the present Government, it is seized upon by certain honorable senators. The Government have been blamed for watering down the taxation proposals of the previous Government to suit the Opposition. To-day we find the Labour senators who made this charge against the Government proposing that this taxation measure should be watered down, and, professedly, in the interests of people who have not asked for it. I shall not refer to the proposals for land value taxation, but I should like to say to my honorable friends who are so keen upon the adoption of that form of taxation that the last word on the subject from the present Government has not yet been heard. We have people in a much better position to pay this amusements tax than many people are prepared to pay an additional land tax. We have farmers in South Australia by the thousand who have had to&#39; go to the State Government for several years for manure, seed, horseflesh, and other things to enable them to carry on their industry. </para>

                            <para>- That is so, and it will take many of them, under normal conditions, ten years to pay off the debt they have incurred. We always find that it is the persons furthest removed from the farming community who are most anxious that the farmer should be taxed. I am quite sure that people who patronize picture shows and sports of different kinds will be quite prepared to pay their share of taxation for the conduct of the war. Had it been possible I should like to have exempted from taxation persons attending picture shows in States where similar taxation has already been imposed. I recognise the difficulty in the way of that.. I know that if the Commonwealth does not impose this taxation the State Parliaments will do so at the earliest possible moment, and as the States are not responsible for the expenses of the war it is the duty of the Federal Government to see that no available means of taxation are overlooked. I should like to bring under the notice of the Minister for Works the fact that we exempt from income tax the income of a man who has gone to the front. I know of instances in small country towns in South Australia, and there may be similar instances in other States, where men who ran small picture shows have gone to the front. They have made the best arrangements they could for the conduct of their shows during their absence. Admittedly it is a fair thing that the income of these men should be exempt from taxation, and it is equally fair that their picture shows should be similarly exempted. In many cases these men have had to pay high rates of wages to those who are looking after their interests during their absence, and in these circumstances they are entitled to special consideration in this matter. Many of them own shows in small country towns - shows which are open only one night each week, and out of which they make very little money indeed. I hope that this fact will not be lost sight of by the Minister. </para>

                        <para>. - Apparently, the taxation proposed to be levied under this Bill is to be limited to the period of the war. It is true that the measure does not say so, nor does it say what entertainments are to be subjected to the tax. If the second reading of the Bill be agreed to, I shall move in Committee that the operation of the tax be limited to the period of the war. Personally, I am opposed to this form of taxation on several grounds. My chief objection is that the tax is one which will fall to a very large extent on those who are least able to bear it, and that it will yield a fair amount of revenue, thereby obviating the necessity for exploiting more legitimate fields of taxation. The same remarks hold good in regard to other sources from which the Commonwealth at present collects revenue. I should like to see the debate upon the Bill postponed until we have before us the Entertainments Tax Assessment Bill, in order that we may see the class of entertainment which it is proposed to tax. There is nothing in the measure which is now under consideration to prevent the taxation of tickets of admission to social gatherings, and indeed to almost any kind of entertainment. I am altogether opposed to this method of taxation. The mere fact that it may have been agreed to by a political party does not carry weight with me. </para>

No reliance whatever can be placed on the statements of gentlemen who were not present at the Caucus meeting, and who, therefore, have no knowledge of what took place. But the question with which I am chiefly concerned is, &#34;Is this a method of taxation which ought to be countenanced by this Parliament?&#34; I have strongly objected on the floor of this chamber to a proposal to tax sixpenny tickets of admission to amusements, and there is some little satisfaction in knowing that the Government have now abandoned the idea of taxing tickets of a less value than1s. </para>

Under the Bill people will know exactly what they are paying to the Commonwealth for taxation purposes. It will be shown on a ticket that its price is1s., and that the additional charge of 2d. is the amount of the tax. </para>

It would be a splendid thing, if, when purchasing a pair of boots, the buyer received an account showing the price of the boots, with the price of the duty added. A good deal of opposition has been manifested here this afternoon to the alternative scheme of taxation which I have suggested, and a strong plea has been made on behalf of the farmers. I looked round Warrnambool yesterday, and found that land-owners there would not permit me to use their land unless I paid them &#163;3 or &#163;4 an acre per annum by way of rental. </para>

If they chose to impose a tax of 6d. in the &#163;1 on estates in excess of &#163;5,000 unimproved value - and these represent about &#163;186,000,000- they would derive from this source alone a revenue of &#163;4,000,000 annually. That is the direction to which the attention of the Government should be invited. </para>

                        <para>.- I rise more particularly to refute the statement generally made that we on this side of the chamber agreed to support a similar measure to this a month or two ago. I held myself free to oppose it from the first moment&#39; it was mentioned. That statement can be verified by various members of this party. I have been opposed to this class of taxation from the time it was first mentioned, and do not want it to go forth that I have changed my opinions because of the condition of parties in the Senate. No one will question that the Commonwealth requires revenue, but there are other and more legitimate sources from which to raise this sum. The Bill fails to comply with the first canon of taxation, that of levying in proportion to the ability of the person to pay. The rich and the poor are taxed exactly alike if they choose to pay the same admission fee to an entertainment. We ought to levy taxation on some defined principle. The rich can even escape the tax altogether. It is the easiest thing possible for them to do so. They can have various forms of entertainment without charges for admission. They can engage private artists in music or elocution, and hold their entertainments in drawing rooms or halls. An ordinary working man cannot have his motor car, or play bowls, or engage in the thousand and one entertainments that the wealthy have, and those amusements cannot be taxed as the Government propose to tax this particular sort of show. </para>

                            <para>- If that were the case, I do not think the proprietors running the entertainments would complain so bitterly as they are doing at present. The fact is that they see a strong probability of their takings, and therefore, their incomes, being reduced, and are complaining accordingly. I do not think the proprietors will bear the tax. They will pass it on. I do not apprehend the difficulty <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O&#39;Keefe</inline> predicted in collecting the odd pence. The Sydney Ferries Company finds no trouble in collecting the pennies there, and I presume if this tax is imposed people will take change with them and pay the extra pennies with their shillings. If the tax has to be paid by the proprietors, we shall be taxing their takings, and not their profits, and they will have some reason to complain. The whole proposal seems to be on the rule of thumb principle, and seems a miserable thing for a National Parliament to come down to. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart</inline> referred to it as a &#34; tiddly-winking &#34; tax, which means something that ought to be beneath the National Parliament. While I disagree with the principle altogether, if the tax is going to be imposed at all, I would rather leave it to the States, because we ought not to take from them every source of taxation. </para>

                            <para>- I think my honorable friend knows better than to ask that question. If he goes there, he goes to entertainments that I never patronize. A moment ago, when he was talking about what people saw for their money, I was wondering whether he went to the stadium himself to see whether the fight was a good or bad one. I am not of the fighting class, and do not go there at all. In the first instance the proposal was to tax down to 3d. tickets. It was next proposed to tax only down to 6d. To the extent that those small amounts have been eliminated, the Bill has been improved, but the principle of it is still wrong. Some say that the tax may be escaped by refraining from going to this class of amusement.&#34; If everybody does that, the Government will get no income from it. People could save themselves the expense of boots by going barefooted. I see a certain amount of education in various forms of amusement: Everyone is not able to travel&#39;, and at picture shows I have seen some very fine reproductions of scenes in various countries that I would never be able to visit. </para>

                            <para>- I do not think they are all faked. I saw some that seemed as real as life. There is also the educational effect of good music, vocal, of instrumental, or of a fine piece of elocution. People who escape the tax by remaining away from entertainments lose a good deal in the way of education. The Government ought to exercise a supervisory control over various kinds of amusements, to prevent anything objectionable creeping in. Our amusements ought to be pure, elevating, and educational, and to that extent I should be in hearty accord with any movement for a supervising control by the Government. Three States are now levying the tax, and if the Commonwealth imposes an additional tax, the double banking will become a burden. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Newland</inline> said they were not complaining in. South Australia because the State put the tax on, but they will object if the Commonwealth puts another tax on &#39; top of it. </para>

                            <para>- I am not going to prevent people playing games which are good and healthy. I would not prevent them playing cricket and football now, although I seldom attend the matches. Games of that kind are healthful from a physical point of view. I am glad to notice that the tax will not be levied on. tickets of less than ls., because sixpenny tickets are exempt, and I do not presume that there will be charges of 9d. for admission to such places. During the debate reference was made to the varying charges of admission to the different places. In Sydney or Melbourne a picture show patron will get for 3d. what a patron of a country show will have to pay ls. for. In that respect the tax will bear rather more heavily on the poorer classes of entertainment in the country than on those in the cities. According to my view, it is beneath the dignity of the Federal Legislature to impose a tax of this kind, because there are other and more suitable means of taxation available to the Commonwealth, as indicated by Senators Grant, Ready, and others. The land is open for still further taxation. And, likewise, incomes may be further drawn upon. There are the big estates and the wealth of the community to be tapped, and there is a solid foundation for that form of taxation, because the principle has been well laid down by Adam Smith that taxation . should be levied in proportion to the ability of the person to pay it. Under this Bill that principle is not observed. </para>

                            <para>- We ought to lay down a principle on which to levy our taxation, and not descend to this miserable kind of tax upon the working man, who, perhaps, may, once a week, desire to get a little relaxation from the humdrum course of his every-day life, while in many cases we allow the rich man to escape comparatively lightly. The man in receipt of &#163;1,000 per annum is to-day paying less in the &#163;1 than the man with &#163;100 per year pays in all forms of taxation, and under this Bill it is proposed to allow the wealthy to escape still further. I would like to know if complimentary tickets issued for entertainments are to be taxed or not. </para>

                            <para>-Evidently it has not been the intention to include .that class of ticket, and it seems to me that the people who get complimentary tickets should pay as much, if not more, than those who purchase tickets. In conclusion, I want to say that I am opposed to this tax, because I- believe it has been devised on a rule-of-thumb method, and that it has no general underlying principle. I have been opposed tq it from the first time that I heard it mentioned. </para>

                        <para>. - I intend to vote for the Bill, because I consider that this form of taxation is just and equitable. I have always contended that the men who have gone to the front have a right to expect those who remain behind to bear the burden, of taxation, and this tax will reach some of the people who have not been touched by any other form of taxation; and, moreover, it will reach people who, I believe, will be perfectly willing to pay the tax so long as they know it is being levied for war purposes. I was opposed to the taxation on the lower-priced o tickets, but I am now satisfied with the measure. I was thinking of moving an  .amendment to exempt the shilling tickets, but when I remembered what a large number of people pay ls. admission to racecourses and other places, I came to the conclusion that they ought to be taxed. For that reason, I intend to vote for the Bill. I do not care very much what the proprietors of the shows have to say, because some of them have been loudest in their condemnation of myself and others on the anti-conscription side of the recent campaign ; and that is another reason why I intend to vote for the Bill. </para>

                        <para>. - I do. not propose to delay honorable senators for any length of time in my reply to the criticism of the Bill. The principle seems to have been accepted by an overwhelming majority, and when we get the Assessment Bill before us we will be able to determine what class of entertainments shall be&#39; included, and what class exempted. I think the suggestion made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen,</inline> that the Bill should not be taken beyond the report stage but retained here until the Assessment Bill has been dealt with, is one that is generally approved by all honorable senators. We are all anxious that legislators may be able to return to their homes, and be with their families for the Christmas season, and therefore I desire to be as brief as possible. Something has been said about this Bill being class legislation. I want to be candid, and I tell the Senate that in ordinary circumstances I would not be found voting for this measure. We have to remember, however, that these are not normal times; that we have to pay for the war; we have to win the war, and not lose it. There are no two sides to that question, whatever other differences we may have. Although Australia is a great distance away from the seat of conflict, she has, I think, responded better than any other people on the face .of the globe would have done. We have been taxed for the war, but compared with the taxation of other countries it has been light iu character, and, moreover, we have not had occasion to appreciate what war really means in our own country. The Bill proposes to tax tickets of ls. to tha extent of Id., and I believe those who claim we are taxing the poor are not doing justice to the people of Australia. At all events, I am of opinion that every man, woman, and child in Australia genuinely desires to participate in the effort to win this war; and this is one method by which they may do something. I take it that this is not the last we shall hear of taxation to be imposed because of the war - we all wish, of course, that it might be - and we do not want to exhaust all the possibilities of taxation, because nobody knows how long this great  world - conflict may last. </para>

It has been suggested that this is a class measure. I do not think it is. Let me point out that tickets up to ls. have been exempted from taxation, and that the man who pays ls. to go to a theatre will pay a tax of only Id,, whereas the frequenters of such places as the Flemington lawn, the other racecourses of the Commonwealth, and the Melbourne or Sydney cricket-grounds, will contribute the bulk of the revenue. At Randwick, for&#39; instance, there are usually more people inside the grandstand enclosure at 10s. and 12s. 6d. than may be seen on the flat at .2s. 6d. </para>

                            <para>- I have been to Randwick on one or two occasions, but generally by invitation. From what I have said as to the incidence of this tax, it will be seen that if it is a class tax, it can only be regarded as such because the wealthy and those&#39; who are comfortably placed will contribute more than any other class in the community. I hope the Bill will go through as it stands. We will be able to deal with the exemptions when considering the Assessment Bill. </para>

                    <para>. - <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley</inline> has directed attention to one thing which, if the request is persisted in, requires attention. The term &#34;for the duration of the war&#34; is too vague. For instance, an armistice might precede the signing of peace. The actual fighting would terminate at a fixed period, and peace would not be signed for some time thereafter. I notice that where it is desired to limit the operation of other Acts in this way, the words used are &#34;till the signing of peace.&#34; If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Grant</inline> decides to persist with his proposal, the wording of it should be altered in that direction. As regards the proposition itself, I entirely agree with the spirit of it. I think that this is war legislation. For that reason I have no fault to find with the request, but, in my view, it is only &#34; a chip in porridge.&#34; If the proposed new clause were inserted, and a needy Treasurer - and Treasurers will be needy in the future-found that if was necessary&#39; to continue to receive the revenue which this tax would yield, he would soon bring in an amendment for that purpose. That has already been done in one or two State Parliaments. In New South Wales, for instance, in the first year of the war the Parliament imposed one or two taxes for a year only. But at the end of the year they renewed the taxes for another year, and in the second year they made them permanent. On the other hand, if this Parliament in future wished to repeal the tax, it would not matter whether this provision was in the Act or not, it would repeal the Act. I do not think that it makes the slightest difference whether the provision goes in or remains out. </para>

                        <para>. - In my speech on the second reading of the Bill, I intimated an intention to move a request for the purpose of imposing a taxon the lower-priced tickets, such tax to remain inoperative until a proclamation was issued bringing it into effect, and the proclamation only to be issued in the event of any State Parliament proceeding to impose such a tax. I drafted a request to that effect, but since doing so I have been confronted with this difficulty, that a tax levied by this Parliament must be uniform throughout Australia, and there are certain States which have already imposed this taxation on the lower-priced tickets. If I were to persist with my request, and it were to become law, this Parliament would stand in the position of imposing double taxation, and imposing it too on the lower-priced tickets, which I think are the last tickets which any one wishes to tax. While I still think that where this tax is collected, it ought to be available to the Commonwealth, in the circumstances I do not propose to submit a request. </para>

It may be all-embracing; it may include any and every form of entertainment, or as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> interjected, there may be some exemptions. </para>

It will exempt all charitable performances which are run for a profit, and all children&#39;s entertainments where the admission charge does not exceed1d. The only reason for bringing this Bill in early was to enable honorable senators to get away; but the Government will throw no obstacle in the way if it is desired by honorable senators to recommit the Bill after the Assessment Bill has been dealt with. </para>

                    <para>. - The Minister&#39;s explanation indicates that the definition of &#34; entertainments &#34; is . going to be comprehensive. The very fact that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> has discovered that some States already impose a tax on the lower-priced tickets is, I think, an additional reason why he should press his proposal. If such tickets are already taxed it will be pretty hard if we put an additional tax on those who are less able to bear it. It is a pettifogging method of raising revenue, seeing that we have any amount of scope in other directions. </para>

                    <para>.- I voted against the second reading of the Bill because I am opposed to the principle of this taxation. I was unable to knock the Bill out on the second reading and the best thing for me to do now is to assist to amend it in the direction which will best serve a section of the community that is not well circumstanced, and that will be handicapped by the imposition of this taxation. It is only within the last few years that picture entertainments have been provided for the people. Whilst a great number of men, women, and children attend the various picture theatres in the different States, a considerable number attend other forms of entertainment, for which the modest &#34; bob &#34; is the price of admission. I suppose that the same thing may be seen in all the principal cities of the Commonwealth, but one has only to go to the theatres in this city to see a large number of people waiting at what is called the early door to obtain a decent seat for1s. When people are prepared to suffer the inconvenience and discomfort of waiting outside these places of entertainment, sometimes for hours, it is because they are not in a position financially to pay for a higher-priced seat in the theatre. </para>

They may take their children to them occasionally, but they prefer to go to the theatres, and usually pay a booking-fee in addition to the price of the ticket in order to engage their seats beforehand. I can see no objection to the carrying of the request, other than that the Government require every penny of revenue that they can obtain. </para>

                    <para>. - It should be stated that the responsibility for financing the war remains with the Government. A majority of the honorable members of the Senate have decided in favour of the principle of the Bill, but it would have been better to have it thrown out on the second reading than to carry the request now moved. The Government have gone a long way, in view of the fact that revenue is urgently required, in granting concessions in response to appeals on behalf of families who attend picture shows. . It is now sought to extend the exemption to shilling tickets. Working class families attending a theatre seldom pay1s. per head all round, and I believe that a single man going to a theatre would not begrudge paying1d. in taxation upon a shilling ticket. Forty thousand people often attend a football match, and the Australian &#34; sports &#34; that we hear so much about, would not, I am sure, object to contribute an extra1d. to secure admission to exhibitions of their favorite pastime, and would, indeed, feel better satisfied, and enjoy the sport offered better, if they felt that, at the same time, they were contributing something to the welfare of the country. The Government have already made a concession involving a loss of revenue under this measure of &#163;100,000. The exception to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Mullan&#39;s</inline> request would involve the loss of at least another &#163;100,000, and that would leave the revenue estimated to be obtained under the Bill at about &#163;200,000. For the purpose for which the measure has been introduced, it would not be worth while to pass it in the amended form suggested. The poorer people would not be called upon to contribute a great deal in taxation under this measure. </para>

                    <para>. - Notwithstanding the superfluous Ministerial statement that we must have funds to &#39;carry on the war, it does seem petty that the National Parliament should be asked to consider such a measure as this, in view of the small revenue anticipated from it, and in view, also, of. the way in which the Government propose to deal with war profits. The policy of the Government is hands off the wealthy man and hands on the working man. The war taxation affects the working classes at every turn. If they are not paying war taxes directly, they pay them indirectly by the increased prices they are called upon to pay for everything they consume and wear. The men who are making enhanced profits as a result of the war are to be allowed to go practically scot free. The next thing we shall hear is that fishing-rods and children&#39;s scooters are to be taxed. We have come to a pretty pass when we are asked to consent to legislation like this. I trust that the request will be carried. The Assistant Minister said that it would have been better to have knocked out the Bill on the second reading, but he did not vote in accordance with that statement. </para>

                    <para>. - I was rather pleased to listen to the remarks made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Russell,</inline> inasmuch as he said he would have preferred that the Bill should be thrown out altogether rather than that it should be emasculated in the way which appears to be intended by the Committee. I counsel the -honorable senator to withdraw the Bill. I think that would be a handsome and a proper thing for him to do. It is a reflection on this enlightened Commonwealth that we should look for revenue to the women and children who patronize picture shows. We have heard a great deal about picture shows, and some of what we have heard is probably true. I think there is something very good in picture shows, and something which has helped the Commonwealth materially in several ways. Wherever I go, I find hotelkeepers complaining that the picture shows have killed their trade. That is enough to convince me that picture shows have been doing some good. No , doubt they have been doing a little harm, and there is some room, I think, for the censoring of films ; but that is another matter. On the whole, I think that picture shows have done a great deal of good. Some of the films are educative in a very high degree, and others are very amusing. I have never enjoyed myself anywhere so well as in a sixpenny seat at a picture show. The Assistant Minister has put forward the plea that we are at war. We know that, and we know that we want to raise, not &#163;200,000, but millions of pounds. Yet he comes along with this tax on picture shows with the expectation of raising a paltry sum of &#163;200,000. I wish to direct attention to the fact that the estimated revenue from land value taxation this year is &#163;1,900,000. Now here is a very ocean, a huge reservoir, a repository of wealth rich beyond the dreams of avarice, which is only waiting to be exploited. Instead of raising &#163;200,000 a year from picture shows, which are educating the people- </para>

                    <para>. - My reason for voting against the second reading of the Bill was that which actuates me now to support the amendment in favour of exempting tickets of admission to amusements up to1s. in value. To me. the whole Bill is based on paltry lines. The Assistant Minister has urged that if the amendment be adopted it will mean a loss in revenue of &#163;100,000 annually. That, however, is an infinitesimal, sum when we compare it with the &#163;5,000,000 which my honorable friends opposite propose to sacrifice in respect of four items, namely, the war levy, the exemption of war bonds from State and Federal income tax, the sinking fund, and the war profits. Yet he cavils at an amendment, which would deprive the Government of a revenue of &#163;100,000 per annum. Many of the persons who are howling most about their patriotism are doing their best to evade any future taxation which may be levied by the Commonwealth. For the past twenty-five years we have been told that socialistic legislation was driving capital out of the country. But strange to say our opponents have been quite unable to point to one concrete illustration in support of their contention. Since the outbreak of the war, in an endeavour to avoid taxation, it is known that sums amounting to &#163;1,000,000 have been taken out of Australia and invested in the Argentine. </para>

                <para>SenatorFERRICKS.- The powers of the Government under the War Precautions Act have been exercised only in opposition to the workers. It is quite true that five or six times the amount which will be collected under this Bill could easily be derived from land taxation. Closely associated with this question of raising revenue in time of war is the repatriation scheme. When that scheme was first outlined there was a veritable rush by land-owners, who were consumed with anxiety to sell their estates for division amongst our returned soldiers. </para>

                        <para>- It appears to me that the Government might very well accept the amendment. The Democracy is bearing more than its fair share of the  cost -of the -war, .financial and otherwise. It is contributing &#163; 1-7,000,000 annually in Customs and .Excise revenue. The entire. Bill is a pettifogging and paltry .one, which will operate harshly so far as a big section of the community  is  concerned. One would think &#62;that under a measure of .this kind .the democratic shilling should be the minimum .of taxation. Surely the people of Australia ought not to be penalized for indulging in amusements. Personally I have always held that the workers have had a lack of amusements in Australia. It would have been far better if the first generation of Australians had had more of them, and less of hard work. A surfeit of hard work and insufficient relaxation are not calculated to promote &#39;the development of a nation mentally and physically. </para>

                    <para>. - <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> is .-quite mistaken in the amount which he imagines will be collected .from &#39;the taxation of shilling tickets of admission to amusements. He says that the amendment will have the effect of practically destroying the Bill. Yet the Assistant Minister toM us only a few minutes ago .that from the shilling tickets he expects to derive only about &#163;100,000, whereas the total tax will yield &#163;350,000. There is one phase of this -question which ought not to be overlooked, namely, that the  &#39;Cost  of all commodities ,has .been steadily . soaring .upwards. Amongst other items of ..expenditure, the amount spent on amusements has been in the same direction. Quite .recently ra (considerable number of picture .shows .charged, .an admission fee as <inline font-style="italic">low</inline> .as 3d. But, with .the exception .of continuous picture shows the charge has .now been advanced to .6d. It is quite possible that .in the near future the minimum charge will &#39;be advanced from 6d. to ls., and consequently we should provide for the exemption of those tickets from taxation. Taxation of that sort is economically unsound, and opposed .to the principles laid down by that world-renowned political economist, Henry George, whose principles of taxation have swept into oblivion and disrepute those of Adam Smith and others. The taxation system of Great Britain is founded on .Adam Smith&#39;s principles, and to that system the whole Democratic movement of Australia has always been opposed. </para>

The men who own the sites on which the. picture shows stand will &#34;be able, when .their lease expires, to demand higher rents from the occupants. I know cases where that has already been done. I support the elimination of ls. from the. operations of the &#39;Federal tax-gatherer. </para>

                    <para>. - I still -say that .there is a great deal of humbug and hypocrisy .coming out in this discussion. A proposal worse than this was instituted by the Labour party previous to the crisis. Had there been no crisis, the people of Australia would ;have been compelled by the Labour party, solid&#39; as it -was then, to pay on every .6d. ticket. If I advocate .a thing when -sitting on one side of the .chamber, I do not believe in going back on it if I happen to cross the floor. The principle of this tax is wrong ; but necessity compels us very often to do things temporarily to raise revenue, and that is so in this - case. It is argued that other people have been released from taxation. When &#34;that legislation comes .before this Chamber, no one will be found more solid than myself to put back the terms .which I, .as a .Labour man, agreed to when I sat on  the other side of the chamber. Whatever happens, I shall be consistent in that matter. This Bill, when first introduced in another place, was framed to tax 6d. tickets, and the members of the Labour party there objected. The Government met them, agreeing to exempt 6d. tickets, and to begin taxation at anything over 6d. I am still a member of the same party, and am not going back on my mates in another place, who accepted the compromise from the Government, knowing that it was a great deal better than would have been the case had there been no crisis. I shall vote against the request. </para>

I admire him for his outspokenness and candour; but he must not run away with the idea that, for consistency and honesty of purpose, he is &#34; the only pebble on the beach.&#34; Those who heard&#39; me this afternoon know whether I am consistent or otherwise on this matter. So far as I can remember, I have never advocated a tax on any form of amusement; and my opposition to this measure is consistent with my opposition to that form of taxation ever since I have been in the Senate. </para>

                    <para>. - <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Turley&#39;s</inline> statement that the party would have voted for the tax had there been no political crisis is open to considerable argument. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ferricks</inline> pointed out this afternoon that the Government, as the price of the support of the Cook party, had modified the financial proposals of the late Government to the extent of &#163;5,000,000. This is the first of the taxation measures that we have had a chance to deal with. Seeing that the Government have relieved makers of war profits, holders of bonds, and owners of wealth, to the extent of several millions, it is our duty, now that we have an opportunity of dealing with the amusements tax, which hits the poorer classes, to modify it if we can. Even assuming, for the sake of argument, that the party might have agreed, some little time ago, to this Bill, with a tax on 6d. tickets in it, the fact that the Government have modified other measures, and so exempted the rich, would justify us in exempting the poor. I, therefore, do not consider myself in the slightest degree inconsistent in moving the request. </para>

                        <para>.- I rise to direct the attention of the Leader of the Government to the question of finding employment for a large number of military officers who, at great expense to the Commonwealth were trained for active service. This morning&#39;s <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> reports that thirty-five Victorians, who have been put through six months&#39; training, and have gained their commissions in a system which, from my knowledge of it in another capacity, I can claim to be the most democratic in the world, are now out of employment. It is most unfair that these young men should be treated in this way after having devoted six months of their time to training, especially as in many cases they gave up lucrative positions to qualify themselves. It would pay the Commonwealth to send these young men to the front, if only to enable them to gain experience as emergency officers. I am sure that there are dozens of young officers at the front to whom a month&#39;s spell would be a great advantage. From conversations which I have had with military men I can say that our military schools compare favorably with the best schools in any part of the British Empire, and in view of the training which these young men have received, it is up to the Government to send them to the front, or if it is not deemed advisable to send them as members of the Australian Forces, they should be given the opportunity of joining the British Forces, and thus get a chance of serving their country in the capacity for which they have been trained. </para>

                            <para>- I can quite understand the reason for the interjection by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie, and in reply I tell him that I want Australian officers to lead Australian soldiers. To-day I received a circular to the effect that one young officer had received only one day&#39;s notice that his services were no longer required. I want now to speak a word or two on behalf of a very large number of senior officers - those men who during the war have been engaged in the training of our Forces in Australia, and who for over two years have sacrificed themselves in order that they might carry out this important work. Surely it would pay the Commonwealth Government to give these senior officers a chance of gaining that experience of actual warfare which their whole life&#39;s training entitles them to receive. Among these men are to be found majors, lieutenant-colonels, and other men of the higher ranks who have been standing back in order to train Australian soldiers, and because they felt it was their duty to remain here for that purpose. </para>

                            <para>- Yes. If I thought that when this conflict was over there would be no more war, I would not make the suggestion, but I do not expect that this will be the last war, and I maintain, therefore, that it, would be to the great&#34; advantage of Australia that these men who have helped to mould our Forces, whose efficiency at the front is a tribute to their training, should now have an opportunity of gaining actual experience themselves. I know from my connexion with the Defence Department that there are a large number of these patriotic men who would like this chance, and I think it is extremely hard that capable and willing officers are not getting the opportunity of serving their country. If they do not go, it is probable that when the war is over, and our other officers return, these men will be cast aside because they will not then have the privilege of wearing the ribbon indicating that they have seen active service, and have gained actual experience on the battle-field. It will be to the advantage of the Commonwealth to have a large number of highly  trained -and efficient officers in Australia after the war is over, and, therefore, the senior  &#39;Officers  to whom I refer should -have that opportunity. </para>

                        <para>.- I ;find myself in considerable agreement -with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> in the matter which he has brought before the Senate. I might say, however, that I  i  confess to a feeling of surprise that the honorable senator, who was foi- over eighteen months in the position of Assistant Minister for Defence should -only now seek to give &#39;expression to his views regarding a grievance which has been taking shape during that period. It is reasonable that a number of competent and experienced- men should be retained in Australia &#34;for the important work of training our Expeditionary Forces, but during the past two years some of the men under training should have been brought on as understudies, so that in time the senior officers could be released for the front. I hop&#169; now that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> is freed from the trammels of office he will continue to insist  On  fair consideration being given to the claims of- these men. </para>

                            <para>- The young officers referred to by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> have a legitimate claim upon the consideration of the Government. In- the first place, we have &#39;to remember that by gaining their commissions they lost their chance, so it now appears, of goingg &#39;to the front as noncommissioned officers, while those who failed in the &#39;competition have gone, to the1 front as -non-commissioned officers, and thus may obtain their commissions in the field. The other men, however, because they succeeded in securing commissions, are now turned adrift. That sort of treatment does not appeal to anybody. I direct attention to the fact that these men were only given their commissions a few days before their services were dispensed with. The Department&#34; ought to have known then &#39;-what  was  happening, and ought to have been in a position to say to these men, &#34; Will -you take your commission -and &#39;your discharge,,  or  will  you  waive your commission and remain  in &#39;the Forces ?&#34; Brit, having gained their commissions, .the &#39;men -were then told that -the Department had -no room for them, and, as the regulations -stand to-day, I am of opinion it is not&#39; possible &#39;to reinstate these men &#39;in the Australian Imperial Force unless they -again. goin .as privates. If &#39;.that view is correct, the &#39;hardship inflicted upon the men is all the more &#39;severe. &#39; </para>

                            <para>-Yes. and, unless I am in error, the regulations -provide that the only method by which they may re-  enter the Forces is by joining as privates. This is a substantial grievance, and entitles .the men to the most favorable consideration at the hands of the Government. It seems to me, however, that perhaps there is a way out of the difficulty.&#39; It is quite clear that if . we have not the men, there must be a surplusage of officers, but, judging from the communication which came from the Imperial authorities some time ago, there are still ample opportunities for young officers in the British Forces, because some time ago the Imperial authorities offered to give commissions to any young fellow of eighteen years of age who&#34; -was sent Home with credentials, but not necessarily military knowledge, from the Defence Department of the Commonwealth. All that was required was that the young man &#187; should be , f.ully accredited by the Commonwealth Government as &#39;to character, physical fitness, and,&#39; of course, -they had to -satisfy the -examiners in the Mother Country. It seems to -me that as -these young men have -really &#39;demonstrated their fitness for the positions the Government .should communicate with the Imperial authorities, and ask them if they are still in -need of junior officers. It -would not be too much then for the Government to take into consideration-the question of providing these &#39;young officers with their passages to Great Britain, in order, that th&#233;y may be able to take advantage of &#39;the opportunities there afforded. The Government -would pay their passages Home if they went as officers of the Australian Forces. If there is no opportunity there now, &#39;the Government must still &#34;recollect &#39;that in &#39;paying the same   passage money, they would enable these men to go and fight for Australia. . Although the men would undoubtedly prefer to be attached to an Australian regiment, I venture to say that they would sooner be -attached to a British regiment than to none -at -all, and as circumstances would permit they&#39; could be gradually seconded from the British -Army and. attached&#39; to the </para>

                            <para>- Yes. When the Prime Minister referred the case to the Judge for  arbitration, I&#39; asked - and I thought it was. a reasonable thing to ask - that the Government, should obtain these particulars-, from the coal-mining companies for the last two years, because there is a. strong, feeling- in the minds of Australian, people that  it. should, not be necessary for the companies to increase the price of coal to the consumer to meet the; increased, cost, . if any, to be brought about .by, the Judge&#39;s decision. The. people would bo - in a better- position&#39; to give a fair and impartial judgment on- that question if- they knew what profits, if: any, had . been made by the companies- during the last- two years. It seemed to me rather peculiar that, after having postponed my question-four times, I should get the reply that the Government were making inquiries of the Government of New South Wales. It may be that because of the position, which has been created here within the last week or two, the Government have only just discovered that they would have to obtain the information from the State Government. </para>

                        <para>. - I. wish to address- you, sir,, very briefly in respect to two matters, one of which has been brought, before the Senate- by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner.</inline> I happen &#39;to know a little about&#39; the termination of&#39; the commissioned officers&#39; term of engagement, because I was one of two parliamentarians, the other being <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Massy</inline> Greene, who introduced a deputation from the officers to the Assistant Minister for Defence this afternoon. I do not lightly, at any time, attempt to criticise the details, of military administration, for I have a chronic dislike to war- being conducted by a debating society, such as Parliament, in one sense,, is. But. I must confess that I am entirely in. sympathy with Senators Gardiner, and Millen in reference to this matter. It appears- that, no. fewer, than thirty-five officers have qualified at Duntroon Military College, after having inconvenienced themselves greatly by relinquishing businesses in civil life, many of them being of a profitable character, and by throwing up civil careers of great promise. These men went to the Military College, and, at a cost of some thousands of pounds to the Commonwealth, acquitted themselves well at the examinations, and became commissioned officers. I understand that at one day&#39;s notice their term of service has been terminated; I believe that that is the correct military term to use, as officers are not discharged. This seems to me to be a singular state of affairs. We know that, owing to  circumstances over which the Commonwealth Government .has had no control, we are not immediately in possession of sufficient men to send to the front. On the- other hand, is it to be assumed that the new recruiting campaign is to be utterly unfruitful? Surely not! Surely it is unwise at this juncture to practically discharge these officers - using the ordinary phrase - and to send them right back to civil life! Is not this a lavish and spendthrift waste of good military material ? I happen to know that these officers are so anxious to proceed to the front that they would enter the British Service, the Italian Service, the Russian Army, the French Foreign Legion - in fact, do anything - to get to the front, and  they purpose in the last resort to even go as private soldiers. But is it good policy, good military practice, on the part of our authorities to train men - men of a great deal more than ordinary mental calibre - make officers of them at a cost of. thousands of pounds collectively, and then turn them out to enlist as privates in the Expeditionary Forces? Is Australian military organisation so far advanced that we can afford that sort of thing ? Surely not ! I, of course, recognise that in some respects the officers may be like the officers of King Cole&#39;s Army., In that Army there were no privates. That may be the position so far as Australia itself is concerned at the present moment, but I hope that the recruiting campaign - although I dislike the system under which it is to be inaugurated - will prove fruitful enough to enable us to .find something to do for these officers on Australian soil in the way of training the raw levies which we are going to hastily send to the front to rein- force men of our nationality who are fighting on the Western front. As these men have to be hastily levied, surely they want as much instruction as commissioned officers and non-commissioned officers can give them ! I ask the military administration to seriously consider whether Australia is in a position to waste, I might say, thirty odd commissioned officers, men who have been given  Hi&#39;s  Majesty&#39;s commission, by compelling them to go abroad, at their own expense, to enter into an Ally&#39;s Army, or to enlist as privates, and be ordinary food for cannon ? I venture to say that proper reflection will assure the Minister for Defence and his expert advisers that that is a very bad kind of policy to pursue. I hope that something will be done to retain to the Commonwealth the services of these gentlemen, who are not only officers, but really strong patriots; men who are anxious to give their services in a military capacity - to, preferably, Australia&#39;s Army, and if not to her Army, at least to an Ally&#39;s Army. I hope that something will be done in the matter. I am never in the habit of repudiating anything being done in which I believe. After perusing <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> - of course, I was correctly reported - I came to the conclusion that an interjection or two of mine, in reply to some remarks which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O&#39;Keefe</inline> was making about prosecutions&#39; at Launceston consequent on the late referendum poll, might be taken to mean that I disapproved of the prosecutions. I do nothing of the sort. I entirely agree with them, and I applaud the civil and police authorities who instituted them under an Act placed on the statute-book, as I understand, at the instance of the Honorable King O&#39;Malley. when he was a leading and shining Labour light. I simply said that I was personally not responsible for the prosecutions, nor was the Honorable Joseph Cook. What I want to bo clearly understood is that I entirely approve of the fact that- the Mayor of Launceston, owing to disorder at. public meetings, owing to the fact that the Honorable Joseph Cook and Father O&#39;Donnell, and others were not properly heard, because of the clamour at their meetings, took the precaution to placard the town with notices, and put&#39; advertisements in the newspapers, to the effect that if disorder ensued at any more public meetings in the city those responsible would be prosecuted under the Act, which was placed on the Commonwealth statute-book at the instance of the Honorable King O&#39;Malley. Those who addressed the meetings had nothing to do with the prosecutions. If I mistake not, the prosecutions were instituted by Superintendent Hedberg, head of the police at Launceston - a man whose political opinions are not known to anybody, and whose ribs were nearly kicked in- at the Honorable Joseph Cook&#39;s meeting, because he assisted his subordinate officers to drag some unruly members of the audience out. I believe that he instituted the prosecutions, and more power to him. I approve of them. Some of the persons who were prosecuted had successively  disturbed several meetings, and I believe that the reward of the drastic and proper action of the police and municipal authorities will be reaped by public speakers in the future. </para>

When I was speaking on the subject I purposely refrained from reading a considerable portion of the report, because the Minister had informed me that the matter had been referred to the Attorney-General&#39;s Department, and that as yet no decision had been come to.

                        <para>. - In regard to the matter referred to by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner,</inline> I have to say, at the outset, that I deplore the fact that there should bo so  many men of military talent in our midst who cannot, at the present time, be satisfactorily placed. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bakhap,</inline> who spoke in the same strain, should recall the position at the opening of the war, and they will realize that the situation with which we are now faced is due largely to events which preceded it. In the earlier stages, instead. of having soldiers qualified for the higher command, the trouble was to obtain* men sufficiently skilled in the* military art to teach those who enlisted in our Army. </para>

                    <para class="block">Much energy was devoted then to induce young men to qualify for leading positions, especially on the Instructional Staff. The result of this, in its turn, was to supply us not only with an Instructional Staff sufficient to meet immediate requirements, but, in the light of our present experience, an over-supply of men qualified for commissions, which gives rise to the complaint made to:day. Speaking frankly, I do not know how this difficulty is to be overcome. </para>

I do not think that statement can be substantiated: Recently, in the north of France, where our men are, we had instances of. men holding the rank of sergeant-major being suddenly promoted on the field to be lieutenant-colonel, far beyond any dream of sudden promotion they had ever had. Following that development of events on the field of battle, we have in&#39; Australia an overplus. of men qualified for commissioned rank. Really events have gone the round of the circle with kaleidoscopic swiftness, one event producing another which has been complained of.  </para>

                            <para>- That is so. Broadly speaking, the position seems to be that we have a surplus of brilliant young men who suddenly regarded the army as a profession to which they could devote their energy for the benefit of the country, and when they have qualified themselves as leaders, we discover that we have no soldiers for them to lead. &#39;We did expect to get all the men we required by the voluntary system, and since it has failed to supply the men, I find it difficult to say to whom the fault is due for the position in which these men who have qualified as officers find themselves. It is not due to the Government, because &#39;we endeavoured to fill the ranks, though our methods may have been disputed. </para>

                            <para>- I shall, of course, with pleasure direct attention to the suggestion made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> and supported by Senators Bakhap and Millen, and see what can possibly be done to satisfy the laudable desires of these young men. I can judge what they are from my knowledge of half-a-dozen of them in Western Australia, who have gone so  far  as to say,&#34;I am thinking of disgracing myself by deserting my regiment in order to get to the front.&#34; I want to disabuse the minds of honorable senators who appear to think that the fault for the position of which they complain rests with the Government. It does not rest with, the Government. I promise to bring the matter referred to urgently before the attention of my colleagues  in  order, if possible, to discover a way to enable these young men to play the manly part which they have, in the most praiseworthy fashion , shown their desire to play . <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Turley</inline> referred to the ever-green Gilchrist case, but I do not know that I can give him any more information than I have already given on the subject. </para>

                            <para>- In addition to grappling with the weighty problems arising out of the war, we have, as I mentioned yesterday, to deal with an infinite variety of problems altogether dissociated from the war. I know that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Turley</inline> is never so unfair as to unduly press a matter in which he is interested, when he knows that questions of far greater importance demand attention. I promise to place the matter to which he has referred before my colleagues with a view to obtaining the latest information as to what the Government propose to do in the Gilchrist case.Senator Bakhap referred to something which was done under an Act for which <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. King</inline> O&#39;Malley was responsible, but he will not expect me to reply to the remarks he made.Senator O&#39;Keefe asked whether the Government would secure the balance sheets of the coal mining companies of Australia, for the purpose, Isuppose, of public information. The honorable senator might discover from the financial journals the dividends declared by the companies, and some idea as to their financial position, but I shall try,inconsultationwith mycolleagues,whetherit is possible to secure a more up-to-date statement of the financial standing of these companies  in New  South Wales and Queensland. </para>
