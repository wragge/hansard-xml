                        <para>There were two variations of awards laid upon the table  of  the Senate yesterday; one concerning the Australian Telegraph and Telephone Construction and Maintenance Union, and the other dealing with the Postal Electricians Association, both of the 29th September last. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Needham</inline> is  concerned about the tabling of a further variation of the award dealing with the first-mentioned union, and given on the 22nd November last. This variation was signed by the Judge yesterday afternoon, and the papers immediately forwarded to the Attorney-General for the necessary opinion  as  to the conformity of the variation with law. The opinion is now being prepared. The Act allows fourteen days from the date of the receipt by him of the award or variation for the Prime Minister  to  table same. As this period only commenced  to  run from  today, it  will be seen that there  is at  present no cause for complaint as  to  delay on the part  of  the Prime Minister tabling the variation in question. </para>

Therefore, it rests entirely with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> whether he will reply to the question or not, but I wish to point out to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Keefe</inline> that he is not entitled,, as a matter of right, to ask a question of a private senator. </para>

I repeat now the statement which I made yesterday, but I direct attention to the fact that the Prime Minister's words were, ' ' the regulation was not issued." By that phrase - and I accept <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes'</inline> statement - the regulation was not issued. But my statement was that it was passed at a meeting of the Executive Council, and that instructions were issued to the electoral officers to carry it out. Whilst I  stand, as I stated yesterday, prepared to support the Government in its -war policy, I am under no obligation, either to the Government or to my honorable friends <inline font-style="italic">on</inline> this side, to allow my veracity to be impugned in the way in which it may be by this question. </para>

                    <para>- So far as my inquiries have led me to an understanding of the position, there were rails enough for the works up to the 16th December, when the Christmas holidays would begin; but, owing to the coal strike, there, was a serious apprehension as to whether the work could be carried on. Now that the coal strike is, happily, overcome, I am in hopes of a continuity of supplies being maintained for the railway, but I am not certain that there will not be a .spell between the exhaustion of the present supplies and the provision of new supplies. I am not at all sure that there will not be an idle time at both ends of the railway on account of the coal strike. </para>

                        <para>. - I join with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> in the opinion that the paper submitted to the Senate is more remarkable for what has been left out of it than for what it, contains. I listened to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen's</inline> speech yesterday with a great deal more pleasure than I should have felt had I been occupying on the other side the position now occupied by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch.</inline> But, while I agree with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> that this Parliament is the place where the public should be enabled to get information of all that Governments are doing, and that if properly questioned <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> will give us the advantage of all the information that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> asked for, I still claim that, because <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> can cleverly question the Leader of the Government, he has no right to shirk his responsibility as the Leader of the Liberal party in this chamber; and, just as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> can be properly brought to book for not giving full information to Parliament and the people about happenings during the suspension of the sittings of Parliament, so <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> has the right, and the people will expect him, , to tell Parliament and them why his party are supporting the present Government. </para>

When <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> is castigating the Leader of the Government for not giving the public certain information and not taking them into the confidence of the Government, why does he not take the public into his own confidence, and let them know clearly and definitely that there is no truth in the persistent rumours that for weeks there has been negotiation between the two parties as to the basis of an agreement that would enable the Government to conduct the business of the country without even a quorum in either House, to say nothing of a majority <inline font-style="italic">1</inline></para>

                            <para>- Honorable senators may shut their eyes to the constitutional position that, at that period, irrespective of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> or his supporters, the Government were fresh from the country with a majority, who had the confidence and support of the country, behind them. The position is now materially altered. The Government holding the Ministerial bench as the constitutional advisers of  His  Majesty's representative, not only have lost the confidence of the country, but have never shown that they have the confidence of this or the other House. The votes may show that they have. I am not claiming that the Government have the support of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> and his party. All I say is that the public, and His Majesty's representative, are entitled io know whether, they have it. If they <inline font-style="italic">lute</inline> the honorable support of the Liberal party; if that party say, " Because ibis is war time, we shall put our fortunes behind the Government, and sink or  swim  with them, and take the responsibility of their acts," the position is a perfectly fair and legitimate one. </para>

                            <para>- I emphasize it, and want to " make no bones " about it. I say, without hesitation, that, so far as the different parties in this House are concerned, on the bench behind me  sit  the Leader of the Liberal party and his followers. Behind me, also-, sit the Labour party and its followers, and opposite me, on the Ministerial benches, sits a remnant that broke Away from the Labour party. </para>

                            <para>- I am not dealing with outside organizations, nor am I discussing this matter from an individual stand-point. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> yesterday referred to the omissions of the Leader of the Government here. He said he had not carried out the proper functions of a leader, because he had not given the Senate full information as to the happenings in the Government during the period of adjournment. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> is leading the party that the public are inclined to think are supporting that remnant of a party sitting on the Ministerial benches, -a remnant which has a quorum neither in this House nor the other, a remnant which has not enough support, if deserted by the other parties which claim to be independent, to conduct the business of Parliament for ten minutes in either Chamber. Their position is such that, if they were not supported by any other party, no vote of censure would be needed to remove them. </para>

                            <para>- There is a belief that such negotiations were conducted, and the happenings of the next few weeks will show whether I am right or wrong in my speculation that there is good reason to believe that as the price of this support from the Liberal party, there will be a watering down of the financial proposals introduced by the last Government. This remark takes me back to the early days of my parliamentary career in New South Wales, in 1891, when the Labour party made similar arrangements in return for their support. On that occasion we had no hesitation in taking the public "into our confidence, and declaring that in return for certain concessions our support would be given to the Government of the day. But there is no room in this country for any Parliament or for any Government that exists by secret arrangement; and this will cease whenever the public have an opportunity of dealing with the Government and the Liberal party. </para>

                            <para>- No, I am still entitled to prophesy and speculate, and I. imagine that within the next few months,, or as soon as the negotiations can be conducted successfully, the present Government will be merged into a National Government, so that then we shall have the spectacle of Liberal members on this side of the House occupying seats on the Ministerial benches as supporters, not of a Coalition Government, but of a National party. Members of this Government, at the outset of their career, should have informed  His  Majesty's representative, the Governor-General, that they proposed to form a Ministry and act as his advisers,, carrying on the affairs of this country without a majority in either House, and? without a party that they could claim as. supporters of their policy. That is another speculation. The Government should have done that, and they may have done it. </para>

                            <para>- And I, for my part, am quite satisfied that, as far as the Ministry are concerned, it does not matter to them whether they have a majority or not, because they are prepared to go on without a majority, so long as the country is prepared to stand it, and so long as they can claim the support of the Liberal party. But no self-respecting Ministers should be content to continue in office when the individual members of the party supporting them repudiate the arrangement in their speeches. That is a sound position to take up. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> yesterday made it quite clear that, while he- was prepared to support the Government on war measures, he freely reserved his right to criticise the Government. </para>

                            <para>- I can promise the honorable senator that if the Labour party are behind the Government it will oe with a No. 11 boot. I want to know -whether any clause in the agreement, or any phrase in the verbal arrangement or honorable understanding, as it may be termed, between the Liberal party and the Government provides that the Government shall throw overboard everything except war legislation. That is another speculation which, I think, I am entitled to make. I understand this was one of the reasons that induced <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Cook</inline> and his party to arrive at this honorable understanding  with the Government, but 1 am proud to know that the whole of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Cook's</inline> party have not agreed to the proposal. Let me now come to some of the more serious matters touched upon by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> in his speech yesterday. </para>

                            <para>- I am aware of that, and I only wish I had the ability to reply in such a manner as to refute effectively those pessimistic utterances made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> yesterday - utter.ances that aTe calculated to create a panic in this country. I felt inclined to term them pro-German utterances, but I do not want to play with words, merely to put the matter in a false position. The utterances may he defined, not as pro-German, but as German utterances, for the honorable senator stated most emphatically that if the war were conducted on the present lines he predicted, not the defeat of Germany, but that Germany would win. </para>

                        <para>Seven other vessels were torpedoed, but managed to reach port. In the period covered by these figures 183 British vessels were sunk, and, in addition to these, 144 British shipping vessels of smaller tonnage were sunk. As an average, the number of steamers, arriving and sailing, was each week 1,400, and the losses were altogether insignificant. </para>

                            <para>- This is a serious subject, and I should like to be permitted to deal with it in my own way. I am showing that during that period of eight months after Germany declared her blockade, 183 British vessels were sunk by German submarines. I do not for a moment say that that is not a serious statement to have to make, or one that should not be a cause of anxiety to all who have the interests of the people at heart; but I do say that in view of the magnitude of our shipping, it does not call for the utterance of panic statements to the effect that the German blockade has put England on a ration basis. </para>

Speaking from memory, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> said that there were thirty vessels sunk in a month, but he omitted to mention that these included vessels belonging to other countries as well as to Great Britain. </para>

                            <para>- I need not go into further details, which would only cloud the issue. If  in  times of peace, when industry was unorganized, ship building in the United Kingdom gave at least twenty-seven new vessels each month, will honorable senators tell  me  that the Imperial Government have not taken care, with industry organized, to see that for every vessel that is sunk by a German submarine there is another launched to replace it? The Imperial Government have met the greater difficulty of preparing to meet the increase of the German Navy, and when they have been able to provide superior forces for the Navy I decline to believe that the organization of industry in Great Britain has not been accompanied by equally good results in the matter of mercantile snipping. In the circumstances there  is, in my opinion, no  reason for panic statements because in a particular month thirty vessels - English and foreign - were sunk, and there is no reason to believe that such a result has made a ration list necessary in England, or has brought the people of the United Kingdom to the verge of starvation. </para>

"When <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> made the statements to which I am referring they gave me, personally, a good deal of concern. I recognise that the honorable senator is the type of man who deals seriously with these questions, and his utterances have considerable weight with a great many people in the community. When he makes a statement that a great number of vessels were sunk in one most disastrous month I wish to point out that that is not so very serious a matter when the figures are compared with the enormous number and tonnage of vessels entering and leaving British ports during the same period. </para>

                            <para>- But the honorable senator overlooks the fact that the space which the troops occupy is considerable. To answer <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen's</inline> question, I would say that the shortage of shipping is due to the fact that in time of war vessels ordinarily engaged in the mercantile marine are used as troopships and for war purposes. I have said that we are using between eighty and ninety ships for the purpose, and honorable senators from this can imagine the number of ships that are being used Tor war purposes by other countries. The number that Great Britain is using will easily account for the shortage of shipping for mercantile purposes at the present time. I would say, with all due respect to the policy of organizing man power in order to win the war quickly, if the food question is becoming serious the Government might get into communication with the Imperial authorities for the use of ships to convey food from Australia to Great Britain. </para>

                                has said that if certain things happen we will fail to win the war, and that .the only remedy is greater man power. The speech of the honorable gentleman yesterday was like a ray of light to me because it supplied the reason why the State, which I have the honour to represent, gave such a magnificent " No " vote on the occasion of the recent referendum. If
                                <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline>
                                delivered speeches of that kind throughout New South Wales, I can readily understand why the people of that State thought that it was time Australia looked after herself.

                                should know, as every member of the late Government knows, that I never entertained any doubt of the success of the voluntary system. I can prove beyond dispute by figures that the voluntary system has not failed. The Minister for Defence showed that it failed during the first months of recruiting.

                            <para>- I claim that it has never failed, and I propose to put before the Senate figures which will prove my contention. Will anybody say that during the first fourteen months after the outbreak of war any complaint could be made in regard to the voluntary system? From the 4th August, 1914, to the end of September, 1915, will any man claim that the voluntary system failed? I take it, from the silence of honorable senators, that there is a general agreement that during that period it proved satisfactory. </para>

                            <para>- That may be due to one of two things - either that we are gloomy pessimists or  pannicky  prophets who are demanding more of Australia than it is possible for her to give. From the beginning of the war to the end of September, 1915, the enlistments amounted to 147,000. During the next fourteen months, under the voluntary system, they numbered more than 150,000. The second period of fourteen months, therefore, supplied more men than did the first. In October, 1915, under the voluntary system, 10,789 men enlisted; in November, 9,674; December, 9,307; January, 1916, 22,6SS ; February, 1S,665; March, 15,S62; April, 9,908; May, 10,656; June, 6,592; July, 6,170; August, 6,161; September, 9,072; and October, 11,522; making a total of 147,066. If I add to that total the enlistments for November, which exceeded 3,000, the aggregate for the- second period of fourteen months is brought up to more than 150,000. Is it a fair thing, I ask, to select one or two months in which the enlistment figures were small, and upon them to base the allegation that the voluntary system has failed.

                            <para>- The most glorious victories will always be associated with the saddest casualties. According to the Imperial Army Council, in order to keep up the strength of our Australian forces in the field to 100,000, it is necessary for us to supply 16,500 reinforcements monthly. I repeat that such a tremendous wastage would mean the entire wiping out of our present forces within a period of six months. Let us apply a similar rate of wastage to the German Army. To-day Germany has about 4,000,000 men at the front. Assuming that she has suffered wastage at the same rate, her losses since the war began must have totalled 20,000,000. Our men went to Gallipoli on the 25th April, 1915; and they fought there for eight months. </para>

                            <para>- If in this period of eighteen months there was one month of such grave disaster as is represented by the loss of 19,000 men, I venture to say that we could estimate our reinforcements on a basis of 5 per cent., and not 16^ per cent. That would mean the provision of 5,000 men a month. I challenge any honorable senator who wishes to answer me to take the French figures, or the Italian figures, or the Russian figures - advancing and retreating as the Russians did, under conditions which led to awful slaughter - or even the Serbian or Belgian figures, and I venture to say that an analysis of those figures will give you a great deal nearer to a wastage of 5 per cent. </para>

                            <para>- I can give  a  simple remedy for increasing the number of enlistments under the voluntary system, . though it would be an unpleasant one for the honorable senator. It is simply the removal of a Government  whose actions the public view with, suspicion, and who have not the confidence of the people of this country ; a Government whose leader told the people of this State that they were pro-Germans; a Government whose leader participated in a party fight, and exhibited on the walls a placard which depicted the people of my State who voted " No " as murderers of soldiers, driving a dagger into their hearts. </para>

                            <para>- My honorable friend reminds me of something which would require a much cleverer man than myself to explain. I did remain with the Government, but I led no one to believe that I had altered my views ; I remained with the Government on the condition that I would not open my lips on the conscription question until a vote of the people had been given, and I honorably kept that promise. During the whole of that period I never uttered a word on the conscription question. 'I quite admit that I had not the firmness of mind to see clearly how things were going. I had not the firmness of mind to say " I will destroy the Government in the middle of the referendum campaign." I was rather inclined to wait until the people had voted " No," and the party and the Government could have been saved. I did everything in my power to that end. But that does not say that I am going to condone the action of the Leader of the Government, who, by his wild utterances, branded anti-conscriptionists as pro-Germans, as people handling German money, as " I.W.W." men, as men who were prepared to sell their country for their own personal advantage. Having had this proposal turned down by the people, the Leader of the Government could not expect success from his present system of recruiting. There can be no success in the conduct of the war while the present Government remain in office. </para>

                            <para>- I certainly have to be the judge of what is dishonorable, because I am the maker of my own reputation. I intend to make the public the judge on this occasion as to whether what I was called upon to do was a thing about which an honorable man could remain silent. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Groom,</inline> a lawyer; the Right  Hon.  W. -M. Hughes, a lawyer; and <inline font-weight="bold">Sir William</inline> Irvine, a lawyer, say that a Minister has to keep  secret and sacred everything which comes before him as Executive business. It may be a code of morality for lawyers that, if their fee is sufficiently large, if they are briefed in the proper fashion, they can hear recitals of crime from the vilest criminals, and keep them a secret in their own breasts. . But let me tell the Senate that that is not the code of morality of a representative of the working classes and that is not my code of morality. I took an oath of secrecy, and honorably I kept that oath. I propose to read to the Senate the regulation which the Right  Hon.  W. M. Hughes prepared and asked us to accept, and I am still keeping to the letter and the spirit of the oath of secrecy which I took when I make public the act of a man who was aiming a blow at our fairest and best institution, at the very Crown. But before I read the regulation, let me say that the lawyers' code of morality is that they can hear vile statements of infamous doers, but that is not my code. In regard to Executive documents, these lawyers are very sensitive. They say that to take a document, out of the Executive Council chamber is actually to pilfer it. Goodness gracious me ! If I caught a man burgling my house - if I caught a man committing an infamous crime, and picked up his handkerchief with his name written thereon, would I be guilty of stealing the article if I were to take it to the police as evidence of his criminal act? The code .of honorable lawyers, of course, would be, " This is another man's property, and you cannot touch it." The regulation in my hand never came before&gt; the Executive. Certain questions were to be asked of every voter who appeared to be under thirty-five years of age at the polling booth, and those questions I will read. </para>

                    <para class="block">It was proposed, if any intending voter answered in the negative, or if the presiding officer had reason to believe that the person claiming the vote was the person to whom the proclamation applied, and he had failed to obey it, that the presiding officer, before permitting him to vote, should mark the ballot-paper with the word " Proclamation " or "  Proc."  All such ballot-papers were to be dealt, with in the same manner as ballot-papers indorsed under section 9, which deals with persons whose votes may be challenged on the ground of nationality. There was also a clause providing for the appointment of tribunals empowered to determine whether the electors had wilfully failed to comply with the proclamation, and that such wilful failure was to be deemed disloyalty. This was printed on the day that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Garran,</inline> the Solicitor-General, handed the papers to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Higgs.</inline> The essence of the regulation was that the voters were to be questioned at the polling booth. This is what happened : <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Higgs</inline> called my attention to the report of a speech delivered by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes,</inline> in which he said that at the polling booth he had " the surprise of their lives" in store for the young men who had not registered. I was endeavouring, to the best- of my ability, to conduct the business of the Defence Department, and I thought the most serious thing that could happen to this country would be a conflict between the civil and military authorities on such an occasion. For the Prime Minister to make a statement that the polling booth was to be used to spring a surprise upon the electors astonished me beyond measure. That, of itself, was sufficient to justify our resignations. I inquired if a regulation had been framed to give effect to this statement. I went to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Starling,</inline> the then Acting Secretary to the Prime Minister, and he said he would see the Solicitor-General. I saw him go into the Solicitor-General's room. When he came out he told me there was no such regulation, and I informed <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Russell</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Higgs</inline> that no such regulation was intended. When the Executive Council met that afternoon three regulations came along. This regulation, the essence of which <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> had given, was put before us. It should have been signed by the Minister for Defence, but it was not. </para>

                            <para>- When I left the honorable senator's office I was under the impression that he had returned on the Wednesday. In any case, that has nothing to do with the regulation. My point is that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator P</inline> earce agreed between themselves to submit to the Executive, and inflict on the people through the ballot-box, a military punishment, and that no other member of the Cabinet was consulted about it. Other members of the Cabinet could not get the document, although they asked for it, until the Executive Council met. I am pleased to be able to make this statement in the presence of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Russell,</inline> who will agree that I have not misstated the case. When we refused to pass the regulation, the Prime Minister made a public statement to the effect that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Russell, Mr. Higgs,</inline> and myself had prepared a " childishly dramatic " retirement from the Cabinet. As a matter of fact, there was no organization or preparation to retire. The question of resignation was not discussed by us until <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Russell</inline> called us together, and we met in <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Higgs'</inline> room. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Russell</inline> then informed us that the regulation which we had turned down had been given effect to at a meeting of' the Executive Council in Sydney, and that his officer, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Oldham,</inline> had been instructed to give effect to the regulation which <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> claims was never issued. The details of this matter are worth remembering. I went to the room between 5 and 6 in the afternoon. It is to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Russell's</inline> credit that he met the position by saying, " I think this action demands the dignified resignation of the members of the Cabinet," and we at once acquiesced in that. On the Saturday following, our resignations appeared in the press. There is another story attached to that, but as it is a personal one, I will leave it till a more convenient period. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes'</inline> comment was that he looked upon the resignation of his Ministers as a sure omen of victory. He said - </para>

                        <para>I propose to say nothing more to the press than that I have noted their resignations, and have nothing to say by way of comment, except that if they hope by their childishly dramatic action to persuade the electors that they are men who are prepared to sacrifice office for principle, they will be bitterly disappointed. They pretend that they have resigned because of the issue of certain regulations that interfere with the electors going to the polling booths. Their attempt to impose upon the credulity of the electors is on a par with the Maltese coloured labour dodges, and is no doubt the last card in the anti-conscriptionist pack. Personally, I hail their resignations as a sure omen of victory. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Higgs,</inline> in a spirit of lugubrious prophecy, told a reporter the other day that if conscription were carried he would have to resign. He and his coadjutors have only anticipated the inevitable by a few hours, and the people now know the kind of men who stand behind the anti-conscription party, and understand perfectly well the motives that animate them, and are resolved to vote them out. </para>

                    <para class="block">I do not want to comment adversely on that statement, but it left no other course open to me, seeing that it imputed motives to me, and impugned my integrity, than to lay the whole of the facts concerning the regulations before the public at the earliest possible moment, and I did it. If there is a class of men who say that these things must be kept secret, that the man who is laying his unholy hands on the ballot-box, the man who proposes to bring discord and dissension into the polling booth, must be allowed to go scot free, because under the oath to His Majesty whatever comes before the Executive Council must be treated as secret, let it be distinctly understood that whatever council or company I am in, no dishonorable conduct will be kept secret while I have a tongue to speak. These are the things that have brought this Government into contempt. The Government are now putting before the public a proposal to ask the men they have insulted to flock to their standard and give them the kudos of carrying on a system of voluntary organization. I give place to no man in this country in my loyalty to the British people. I perhaps very often put my loyalty to Australia first, but no matter what campaign is inaugurated by this Government I will be no party to it. It is foredoomed to failure, because of the men who are placing it before the community. The Government is foredoomed to failure because it lacks the first essential to success", that is, the confidence of the people. Are the members of the Government  going  to the men whom they have branded as Industrial Workers of the World men, to those whom they have branded as pro-Germans, and as the murderers of our soldiers at the front, and to ask them for help? </para>

                            <para>- I am sorry because I am an Australian. I am sorry to see an Australian Parliament governed under conditions that are so unprecedented as the present. If the Government and their supporters had the courage of their conviction that the country was with them, why did they not tell Parliament that they would arrange for an appeal to the people? Not only am I sorry that was not done, but I am sorry that, by their attitude, this Government have not given the people of Australia that opportunity of doing as much as they want to for the Empire in the present struggle. This Government, by intrigue, and support that is repudiated by the voice, is carrying on the affairs of the country. Would not that make any true Australian sorry? Is that a pleasant prospect as far as the country is concerned? This Government, without the confidence of the people, cannot prosecute the war, or do anything else successfully j and it appears to me that, irrespective of the results to their individual selves, the Government and their supporters should appeal to the country, so that the people should have the opportunity to reconstitute Parliament according to their wishes. , </para>

                            <para>- I take it that that interjection reflects the statement made by the Prime Minister at the. Lord Mayor's banquet recently, when he hinted that both Houses of Parliament would be  sent to the country at the same time. I have had something to do with hurrying -on that process once before, and I hope to have the opportunity again. The Minister knows as well as I do that, in order to bring about a double dissolution, there would be a waste of four months of valuable time - a time full of immense possibilities - during which the affairs of this country would be carried on, as <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> have done, by regulations. Is not this prospect enough to make any one gloomy ? <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> has told us, of course, that this is not the Hughes Government as formed in October of last year, but that, it is a new Hughes Government. If the veil of 'secrecy could be raised, I should like to know if, when advising  His Excellency  to send for himself ' to form a :new Government, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> told the 'Governor-General that he had not a quorum in' either House of the Parliament, but that he hoped the business would be conducted somehow or other with the aid of the Liberal party. </para>

                            <para>- It might be possible to approach  His Excellency  by -some other means than by deputation, and by a method which, I think, a majority of this Chamber might approve. We might convey that information by a resolution to  His Excellency  in the usual formal way. The question at issue in this debate, and which forms the topic of discussion in every club, is how long this unique experiment is to continue; how long, with ten men behind <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> and two doubtful supporters in the other House ; how long, with ten. members, and perhaps ten supporters in this Senate, the Government will presume to be the advisers to  His Excellency  the Governor-General ? No doubt <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> are perfectly happy "with the present arrangement. Perhaps they think they represent the people in Australia, and that the interests of this country could not be intrusted to any other "hands but their own. Probably they are thoroughly satisfied that the members of -the Labour party who sit on this side of the Senate are merely representatives of that dangerous section of the Labour movement to which reference has been made lately, and that, therefore, we have to be kept out of office at any price. </para>

                                did for the party all that a great man giving twenty years of honest work could do, and I give him the fullest credit for it publicly. But even twenty years of honest work does not warrant any man in attempting to disrupt the party that exalted him to the leadership of the affairs of this country.

What I am saying is that the Parliamentary Labour party gave the Prime Minister no grounds for his resignation, or withdrawal. He acted in this matter on his own initiative, and, for reasons best known to himself, he withdrew from the room, taking a following of members with him. </para>

It has been said that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> was not given the fullest and fairest opportunity to state his case at the party meeting. He was asked to call the meeting, and, as Leader of our party, he called it. As  chairman  of the meeting, and Leader' of the party, he was invited to make a statement, and, in reply to that invitation, he said that it was up to those who called the meeting to say what the business of the meeting was. I, for one, as a member of the party, do know what the decision of the meeting would have been if <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> and his following of their own free will had not withdrawn themselves from the party. </para>

                    <para class="block">I wish to make is that, .when. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> and his party withdrew from the meeting, nothing unfair or unreasonable had been done, and nothing had been done which any body of self-governing  men had not a perfect right to do. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> still denies the issue of the regulations which brought about the resignation of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Russell, Mr. Higgs,</inline> and myself. What is the use of such a denial when we have the Returning Officer informed and the instructions given to his officers from one end of the Commonwealth to the other. We have men in the telegraph office aware that the instructions were sent out, and we have Returning Officers and officials engaged at the polling booths on the day of the referendum aware of the existence of those instructions, and if further proof were necessary we have the existence to-day of ballot-papers with the words "Proclamation" or " Proc  " stamped upon them in accordance with the instructions. It is a most serious thing that a Prime Minister should attempt to impute to three men, who were members of his Cabinet, what is unfounded and untrue. There are two men in the public life of this country who are in a position to remove the imputation cast upon these men by the Prime Minister. One is <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Jensen,</inline> the Minister for the Navy, and the other is  His Excellency  the Governor-General. It is within their power to remove this imputation of unfairness, or of acting from improper motives on the part of these three men, and I say that, if they are willing that we should remain under that imputation, I shall take any means in my power to prove that the statement <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> now makes, that the regulations that have been referred to, were never issued, is untrue and unfounded. We know that they were issued. The Prim¬© Minister also shelters himself under the fact that, in this matter, we are- dealing with the secrets of the Executive. * Is this the same <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes,</inline> and the same Prime Minister, who attacked one of his own colleagues by revealing secrets of the Cabinet ? </para>

                            <para>- The point I wish to make is that the Prime Minister has led the way in these recriminations, and if a bad example has been set he is not altogether blameless in the matter. I have occupied more of the time of the Senate than perhaps was justifiable, but for that I must blame honorable senators who, when I desired to make some point quickly, diverted me by their interjections into the consideration of other matters. I commenced my speech with the intention of dealing with the address delivered by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen,</inline> in which he put before the country the most dismal view of the present war situation. I have given figures as to shipping to show that, in view of the enormous shipping of Great Britain, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen's</inline> references to the number of ships that have been sunk are not so serious as they may at first appear, though I do recognise that they are serious. The honorable senator has told us that Germany is holding us on the Western front and on the Eastern front, and has at the same time been able to raid Roumania. During the present summer Germany has had no reason to congratulate herself upon what has transpired at the Western front. When the spring campaign commenced one of the highest officials in the German Parliament predicted that within a few weeks' time the German flag would be flying over Verdun. Has that happened? We know that the Germans have sacrificed army after army there, and after a campaign of six or eight months they are in an in- </para>

                <para class="block">finitely worse position, facing the French forces, than they were when they commenced that campaign in February. Then, if we consider the Western front on the Somme, however serious the view <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> may take of it, the fact remains that, as the result of the summer campaign, the Allies are in an infinitely stronger position than they were before it began. </para>

                        <para>- No one is disputing that; but does the honorable senator shut his eyes to the fact that the combined forces of the Allies, during the last six months, have not only held their own, but have been gradually drawing the ring of bayonets more closely around the armies of the Central Powers ? <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> has said that the Germans are holding us upon the Western front, and are at the same time making a raid into Roumanian territory, and he has put this forward as a grave reason why our organization and our policy should be altered, lest otherwise we should not win the war. If Germany, during the whole of the last spring and summer, gained nothing, and lost much on the Western front, that is the result of the organization of the Allies in the production of new guns and explosives. They have, during this period, driven the German forces from trenches which they expected to be able to hold during the coming winter. They have produced guns which out-distance the range of the German guns. They have surpassed the Germans in the production of explosives, and have driven them out of the dug-outs in which they expected to spend the winter in comparative comfort. In face of the facts no one of British birth should, in his place in a British Parliament, attempt to maintain that ' Germany is holding us on the Western front. To go further afield, if the Allies could hold the prepared Germans in 1914, when they expected that their flag would be flying over Paris, and the Kaiser made the impertinent statement that they would trample over the insignificant British Army, what is to be said now when that insignificant army has grown into an enormous organization, with hundreds of thousands for the thousands it represented before? </para>

                            <para>- I say that since then there has been a vast organization of industry by the Allies. We cannot -make guns and munitions and organize factories in a week or a month, but I say that the position has changed since the earlier stages of the war, and to-day Great Britain and France, in the matter of the number of men on the Western front, outnumber Germany and Austria. They have exceeded their preparations for war, and slowly and surely the Germans are being driven from their prepared positions. The whole of the 1915-16 campaign has been a slow, but sure, advance to victory by the Allied armies on the Western front. These facts should, I think, be stated when we are told by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> that the Germans are holding us on the Western front. We have captured strongly-fortified positions, and hundreds of miles of trenches, and though the Germans staked their military reputation that their flag would be flying over Verdun in February  or in March, it is not there yet, and it never will be there. </para>

                    <para>Seator GARDINER.- I say that it is impossible for Germany to win, but it may take a considerable time before final victory is achieved by the Allies. That is the position as I view it. What are we to do in regard to additional man power ? I say that, as regards man power, Australia has not only done well, but that she has done excellently. Allowing for subsequent rejections and exemptions, the number of men recently passed as physically fit in a great State like New South Wales - some 30,000 - shows clearly that not more than 15,000 or 20,000 fit young men are now available there: In other words, four out of five of the eligible single men in that State have already volunteered, and proceeded to the front. Yet, because they would not vote for conscription, their brothers and sisters have been described as pro-Germans. That is an intolerable position in which to place a free people. I wish to make it quite clear that the Government can do much more for the Empire than has yet been done. The quickest -way in which it can do this is by giving place to men who possess the confidence of the country. </para>

                            <para>- Those members can speak for themselves. I venture to say that, during the time that I occupy the position of Leader of the Australian Labour 'party in the Senate, there will be no attempt to curtail the speeches of my colleagues. For two years the late Government gave effect to the Labour policy. During that period, its actions gave satisfaction alike to nine-tenths of the people of Australia, to the people of Great Britain, and to our Allies, while it bitterly disappointed those who wished to put party politics before the welfare of our country. </para>

Our policy is that, which, thanks to our compulsory military training system, enabled us to quickly send trained men to assist the Empire on the outbreak of war, and which permitted us within a brief space of two years to organize, arm, equip, and train 300,000 men to participate in the great struggle that is now in progress. </para>

                            <para>- I am now speaking as their mouthpiece, and I have no hesitation in affirming that our policy is unchanged. The Minister for Defence may put us in the position of our bitterest enemies - the members of the Industrial Workers of the World. But our worst enemy is William Morris Hughes, who would put a fire-stick into our Constitution, if he could.. I repeat that there has been no change in the policy of the Australian Labour party, and that we shall always treat the people of this country with the consideration to which they are entitled. </para>

At the same time I confess that there were grave problems confronting me, which rendered my position an extremely difficult one, and I putin about two as unpleasant months as a man could, in seriously considering it. </para>

                            <para>- If they had said that, they would have had my resignation immediately. I can safely assume that the outside political organizations which for twenty years have made the biggest success of a political movement' which the world can show, are not going to ask questions of that kind. I venture to say that, while the common sense of the working classes prevails, while they are driven into corners by the lawyer-like classes in the community, you will find none of those things calculated to disrupt our movement. I have been led by interjections into speaking much longer than I had intended to do. As the mouth-piece of the party for the time being here, I desire to make it quite clear that there has been no change in the party because there has been a change in the leadership; that there has been no change because of the existing breach. It is the same party, with the same policy - a policy which, I venture to say, with its Commonwealth Bank, its Fleet, and its compulsory trainees, has enabled Australia, during the last two years, to go ahead so successfully as it has done. I hope the same policy will continue, and I know that the honorable senators who are following me on the present occasion will carry out those same proposals which have been given to us year after year by our Conference, but .which have generally crystallized the common sense of the working classes of Australia. </para>

I wish to be perfectly fair, both to my honorable friend who interjected and to myself. I will give as briefly as possible a detailed account of what happened. The first business of this particular meeting was the reading of the minutes. When the minutes had been read and adopted, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Finlayson,</inline> the member for Brisbane, at once jumped up and moved a certain motion. </para>

                        GOULD (New South Wales) [3.7]. - I hope that this little storm is over. It has been most interesting to listen to the addresses we have had concerning the Ministerial statement, ' and though those addresses have been confined to two honorable senators, still there was a good deal of electricity in the air during the course of their delivery.
                        <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline>
                        was at very great pains to let us into a number of secrets in connexion with the administration of the Government during the time he was in office. The most interesting part of his address related to the issue of the proclamation for home defence, which it is alleged was done in a peculiar way. I certainly agree with both
                        <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline>
                        and

                        that it was a very great mistake to attempt in any way to prejudice the position of men who came to the poll to record their votes, either in one direction or the other. When a ballot of the people is about to be taken in regard to a great question, the less it is mixed up with other matters the more likely is it to get at the true judgment of the people. Had the ordinary course been adopted by the Government of considering these matters in Cabinet, where every Minister would have had an opportunity to express his opinion, we would not have had all this, discussion in regard to these particular regulations. So far as the Executive Council is concerned, the course of procedure is very simple. If the question of a departure from the ordinary policy of the country is raised, it should be determined by the Cabinet, and a minute should go to the Executive Council bearing the signature of the Minister whose Department is involved, or, if it is a matter of national importance, the signature of the Prime Minister. The function of the Executive Council is simply to record the determinations which have been arrived at by the Cabinet or by individual Ministers, and then there is no question of the disclosure of anything done in Executive Council. It is simply a question as to whether debates in Cabinet should be made known to the public. We find that there has been a break in the Labour party, and that a certain number of the Ministers have  retired from the Hughes Administration, which was in existence when both Houses of Parliament were adjourned for the recent referendum. We have heard a great many disclosures which, perhaps, it would have been better, in the interests of all parties concerned, if they had not been made. While
                        <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline>
                        has taken to himself a great deal of credit for the position which he occupied, and the attitude which he took up in connexion with the anti-conscription campaign, there is one thing which he has not explained to the Senate yet, and that is why he remained a member of the Cabinet, though silent when it was exercising its power to induce the people to vote for a system of conscription to which he was directly opposed.

                            <para>- The proper position for the honorable senator to have adopted at that moment was to get out of the Cabinet and let his colleagues go on; not to hang on to the Ministry, leading the public to understand that they were asked to vote on a matter of public policy approved by the Cabinet, although it was one to which he himself was diametrically opposed.  His  eyes appeared to have been opened to the action of his colleagues long before he decided to retire. Time after time, during the recruiting campaign, he told the people that the voluntary system of recruiting was the only correct system - that it was getting all the men whom we required, and that he was not in favour of a system of compulsion. The possession of these views was made abundantly clear in every speech which he made to the electors.  His  proper course, I repeat, was to have retired from a Ministry which desired to fasten upon the community for the time being a principle to which he objected very strongly. We all realize that it was not a principle to be fastened upon the community for all time. It was only sought to be adopted to meet a very grave emergency which it was believed by a great many persons could not be met except by the adoption of compulsory service. If we were in that fix, why should not the country adopt a system of that kind? Our object all through ha3 been to assist the Empire to win the war, and at the earliest possible date - not  at some remote period. </para>

The issue was put to the people, and, rightly or wrongly, they came to a conclusion which we, under the Constitution, are bound to respect.. At the same time, I personally deplore the result of the referendum. I believe that the verdict might have been different had. certain circumstances which occurred from time to time been eliminated from the campaign. I realize that it is easy to be wise after the event. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> was very much concerned with regard to. the attitude of the Opposition to the Government at the present stage. I admit that, here, we are very few in number, and possibly our votes may not have very great weight or influence. It cannot, however, be made too clear that the Opposition do not depart one jot from the policy which they believe is the best in the interests of this country. But when it comes to a national question like the prosecution of the war, we feel that our duty, is to be behind any body of men who are working honestly, fairly, and conscientiously in trying to win the war in a speedy way. If we did otherwise, we would not be worthy of the position which we occupy in the public arena. It is the duty of every honorable senator to do all that lies in his power to assist" to bring the war to an end, and if any honorable senator can show any better means than the Government have adopted it is his duty to put it before the people. I am prepared to support the Government in all matters which I consider will help to end the war successfully, but I reserve the. right to criticise the proposals and methods of the Government whenever I see fit to do so. My criticism, however, when offered, will not be hostile, but will rather be that of a friend who desires to assist them in the very grave duties they are called upon to perform. It is true, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> says, that the Government represent the smallest party numerically in both Houses. No doubt it is desirable at all times to have a Government with a fair working majority at their command on all matters of public policy, but we are faced with the alternative of supporting that portion of the Labour party which has advocated the principle that we believe to be necessary in the interests of the country, or the other portion, which is entirely opposed to that principle. Our party is not sufficiently strong to rule in both. Houses. "We have, therefore, to accept the position as it stands, and are going to follow the men whose policy we consider to be best in the interests of the country in the present great national struggle. I hope the Government will not' attempt to bring forward any of the Labour ideals which have been put before the country from time to time regarding matters of every-day concern. I. trust they will see that their duty is simply to do all they can to assist in carrying the war to a successful conclusion, and to provide adequate measures of taxation, combined with rigid economy, not only for war purposes, but for the interests of the country at large. If the Government do this, they may be very well satisfied that they will receive the support and approbation, not only in this chamber, but in the country, of the right-thinking portion of the community. One honorable senator behind me interjects that they will have to bring down their taxation proposals. It will be time enough to consider those when they come before us. I saw a forecast of them in the press, and, if that is correct, I think the Government can appeal with confidence to the people for fair support for their financial, policy. The proposals submitted by the previous Treasurer would have been absolutely ruinous to the object the Government desired to attain. </para>

                            <para>- The honorable senator must remember that there are differences of opinion even on that matter, and that the ideas of those whose views are very much opposed to his may possibly bring in a much better revenue. We were told, before we went to the country on the referendum question, that the war was practically over, and that, as we were winning, there was no need to adopt any extrememeasures. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley</inline> quoted speeches made in the Old World, to which the lie has been given already by subsequent events. We are all proud of the power of our Empire, and believe that it will emerge -victorious, but we cannot be victorious in a war like this unless we strain every nerve to win the victory. We may have to spend a great many more valuable lives, and much more money, before that end can be attained, and our aim must be to attain it in the shortest possible time. Matters have not been progressing in a way which encourages ms  to expect a speedy end to the struggle. The peace terms laid down by the Allies mean the humiliation of the Central Powers, which will make every effort to avoid being brought to their knees. We must prevent the possibility of an inconclusive peace. We want to be in a position to tell the people that they may be sure that there will not be such a bloody war again in the next fifty years; but, unless we are prepared to sacrifice ourselves to the fullest extent, we cannot hope to attain that end. If  gigantic  efforts are not made, all the warring nations will be bled white, and will have to cease fighting from  exhaus-tion.  The result will be that the nations we are fighting will do again what they have been trying to do since 1870 - build up a great army and navy to obtain the world-power which this time they have failed to secure. Unfortunately, the smaller nations that have joined in on our side have been in most cases practically wiped out. Servia and Belgium have to be rebuilt, while the Germans, although offering autonomy to Poland, make it a condition that troops must be provided by it to fight the Allies. Most of us thought, when Roumania, with her 600,000 troops, was brought into the war, that it would bring the end appreciably nearer, but up -to the present the Germans have proved too powerful. I hope that we shall drive them out of Roumania, but we shall never do so unless we cease frittering away our strength. We are called on to provide 16,500 troops a month. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> says we do not require that number; but how does he know ? Ministers get their advice from the Army Council at Home, which is the best -authority, and can have no object in exaggerating the necessities of the position. It knows that our population is small and sparse, and that we have great primary industries to carry on. </para>

                            <para>- I doubt the correctness of the honorable senator's information. It will probably be found that most of those are not eligible. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> quoted a return this afternoon, which showed that, amongst our own people, an enormous number have been rejected as unfit. In view of the information from the British Army Council, it is the duty of the Government to do their best to raise the number required to keep up our establishment at the front. We have not raised in any one month the number that we were told would be required. We are informed that a great fillip was given to enlistment for three or four months, but even during that time the full numbers were not secured, nor did we consider that it was necessary to secure them. It seems remarkable that we should want 16,500 a month to meet the wastage on 100.000 in the firing line, but that is the information we have from the best possible authority. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> will admit that, allowing for a wastage of 10 per cent., which is regarded as the average, it would be necessary to provide about 10,000 men per month. It is ridiculous to talk about 5 per cent, being sufficient. Moreover, men who have been in the trenches for a time require relief from their nerve-racking experiences, and if we sent sufficient to take their places, we should strengthen them, and make them more fit for their work. If we sent 16,500 to the front per month, we should probably be making our Forces actually better by 20,000 to 25,000 men. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator 'Gardiner</inline> attempted to belittle a great deal of what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> said with regard to submarine warfare, and quoted statistics to show the extent of shipbuilding in 1911, 1912, and 1913 - the three years prior to the war. We have not the particulars of British ships destroyed since the war began. Although fresh ships have been built, have as many been built since the war for mercantile purposes as were built in the three preceding years? Have  we built as many as are necessary to make up for those destroyed? If there is an excessive amount of destruction, it is necessary to build many more ships than we did before in order to keep up our strength. The submarine warfare as at present conducted is a very serious menace to the Empire, for it is not now confined to the North Sea, the British Channel, and the Irish Channel, but it has been carried across the Atlantic to America, where submarines are now operating with a radius of 4,000, 5,000, or 6,000 miles. This kind of warfare might be further extended until ultimately it reached the coasts of Australia. In that event, where would Australia be if the Mother Country were destroyed ? Is it not much better that warfare in which Australia is so vitally interested should be conducted on the fields of Flanders and in the North Sea than upon our own shores? We must realize that we are portion of the Empire, and that no other portion can be injured without the effects being felt in Australia. If Great Britain lost in prestige, and had to surrender her command of the sea, what would be our position ? What would become of the ideals of members of the Labour party ? They have great ideals, and I have no doubt they believe them to be in the interests of humanity  but I remind them that the attainment of  those  ideals will be impossible unless the Empire proves to be strong and all-powerful in this struggle. That being so, we should be ready in an emergency like this to do what <inline font-weight="bold">'Mr. Fisher</inline> promised - we should be prepared to go to the last man and the last shilling to maintain the integrity of our great Empire. We have no alternative in order to protect ourselves and our Empire. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator. Millen,</inline> I notice, was taken to task for being pessimistic in his views concerning the outlook; but on the other hand there are other men who are so optimistic as to mislead the people concerning the necessity to act with our utmost strength in this dangerous situation. While <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> may have given expression to some views that we do not all indorse with regard to the present position, he was justified in pointing out the strength of Germany to-day, as a result of which the enemy are still in occupation of nearly all the territory on the west that they acquired in the early stages of the war. It is true Germany has been driven back to a limited extent, hut at what cost? If Great Britain had been prepared to accept the situation and not made strenuous efforts, the enemy would have been in a much stronger position to-day. But the Imperial Government called upon every man and woman of Great Britain to use every possible effort to enable victory to be attained. Are we to hang back, in these circumstances, especially when we have before us the example of the neighbouring Dominion of New Zealand, where the compulsory system of enlistment has been introduced ? Their men are just as good as ours. We are proud of our men and of all they have done, and surely we are not going to say that we are not prepared to help to the fullest possible extent? </para>

                            <para>- I believe that that verdict was not arrived at after the full and fair consideration of all the circumstances, because during that campaign opponents of the proposal magnified the possibilities concerning the arrival of 247 Maltese in Australia to such an extent that the people were grossly misled. If the arrival of 247 Maltese workers is going to take the work out of the hands of our own people, as was suggested during the referendum campaign, then all I have to say is - " God help the workers of this country." </para>

                            <para>- Yes, I am aware that there was a good deal of noise in New South Wales, and I accept the verdict of the people, although I do not think it was a wise verdict in the circumstances. I assume, however, that the bulk of the people did what they thought was the best in the interests of the community, but I warn honorable senators of the Labour party that if they do not take care they will have within their ranks an element which will surely wreck them as a political -party, because men of anarchical ideas, who are prepared to destroy property and destroy the very fabric of society, are now gaining an undesirable influence in the party. </para>

                            <para>- 1 am surprised that the . honorable senator should have alluded to an incident connected with the shearers' trouble during which the leaders of the men said, "Well, if the country is going for conscription, you had better leave these sheep alone. Let the wool rot on their backs." Why should not these men do their bit in defence of the country as well as those who have gone away voluntarily? I am surprised, I say again, that the honorable senator should attempt to use that as an argument in relation to this matter. I could quite understand it if the honorable senator were a disciple of the principles advocated in <inline font-style="italic">Direct Action,</inline> and favoured sabotage, but at present I cannot understand the reason for his reference to that incident. </para>

During the campaign we heard also a rumour that the authorities were going to introduce Chinese and black labour in order to carry on the industries of this country if conscription were carried, and I am sorry that the people who looked to public men for light and leading found that during the campaign they were led into darkness. </para>

                            <para>- If the honorable senator wants to know if I approve of the censorship concerning the statement about Maltese being introduced, I say "No." In matters of that kind it is far better to place all the facts in their true light before the people, for if that is not done, statements will filter through somehow and become grossly exaggerated. It is not my intention to speak further, but I want to put my position clearly before the Senate, as well as before the Ministry. I have said that whilst members of the Government are doing all they can to help the Empire in this war they will have my support, but I will reserve to myself the right, wherever I think it necessary, to indulge in criticism which will be directed in an entirely friendly manner towards the Government, and with a desire to help them in discharging the duties devolving upon them. That has been the policy of the Opposition since the commencement of the war. After all, we are only a handful of people. While we may differ strongly in our opinions we must remember that we are all living in one house, and if it catches fire it behoves all of us to do the best we can to put it out, notwithstanding the divergencies of opinion to which I have already referred. </para>

I realize perfectly the difficulties of the situation, due to the tripartite grouping of members of a Parliament under which a Government in power with only a small number of followers may have to depend entirely upon outside support. It is a dangerous position, unquestionably, under which to govern any country, but if there <inline font-style="italic">ig one</inline> broad policy upon, which all can agree, as in the present circumstances, it is our duty to support the Government in discharging that duty. This Parliament, as we know, has not very long to live, and if honorable senators who have broken away from the Government want to get before the people at an early date they will have the opportunity. Then if they can win, and return with a majority, they will be entitled to office. </para>

I do not speak on behalf of the Opposition, though as a member of it I. believe in the principles it is advocating, and am prepared to support them. I always reserve to myself the right of freedom of action, and I deny to any body inside or outside of Parliament the right to hold me in its pocket, and direct how I shall vote. I say that it is a public scandal and disgrace that the executives of the Political Labour Leagues should have taken it upon themselves to expel from their ranks some of their ablest men, and amongst them those who have been most instrumental in establishing their party. One would have thought that common gratitude would have urged them to adopt a different attitude. </para>

                            <para>- Nonsense. The Government will no doubt do what they consider best in the interests of the community. We certainly know that a number of honorable senators on the other side, and a number of those sitting on the right of the  Speaker  in another place, have had the manliness and courage to tell the Political Labour Leagues that they would hold by their convictions on the question of conscription, and refused (to be browbeaten. I should like to ascertain from some of those who spoke against conscription during the campaign how long they had been converted from the opposite view which we understood some of them to hold until the great organizations outside held up the stick and threatened that if they did not act in a certain way they would not be supported, that they would be expelled from their unions, and would be prevented from ever seeing the inside of Parliament again. I say that no member of Parliament should be placed in such a position as that. </para>
