                <para class="block">I regret that by the action of a majority present on Friday last, taken in the absence of a number of those who support the Government in wishing to refer the question of compulsory service to the people, representatives of the other States have been kept in Melbourne unnecessarily. This applies not only to those who support the referendum, but also to many who intend to appeal to the electors to reject the Government's proposal. I ask those who agreed with Ministers that the question of compulsory military service should be left to the decision of the people to vote for the motion now before the Senate. I do not appeal to those who are afraid to let the issue go before the people, or who object to the people being allowed to decide it, because it would be useless to do that. But many who oppose compulsory service are nevertheless of the opinion that the people should have a voice on the question, and I ask them to support the motion I have just moved, no matter what amendments may be brought forward with the object of trapping honorable senators. Friday's experience justifies us in thinking that such amendments may be moved. </para>

It has been stated by those" who opposed this special- adjournment that sufficient reasons have not been given for the. proclamation that has been issued under the Defence Act. That was an argument that came from the lips of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Mullan,</inline> on. Friday. As a representative of Western. Australia, I say that all the reasons, necessary to satisfy me? have- been- given to justify the proclamation. The State which I represent will stand behind the Commonwealth'. Government- in doing whatever- it thinks necessary for the successful, prosecution of the war:. In. that attitude, ray- State is. sound as a bell&gt; and. solid; as a rock, and- it will be well if the fact can: be. mads, known- throughout the- Commonwealth. It is useless at a crisis like this to. think one thing and. to say another. Since those of us who- have been so long in the fighting, line, who have- made, great sacrifices- for the movement that we- have helped to build, up, have been called names,, and have- had wrong- motives imputed, to- us, it is necessary to. look at the facts calmly, and- to show clearly where we stand. </para>

It is this : the war must be won, and Australia must pay current, not sweating, rates for her share of the cost of the struggle.. I speak authoritatively- regarding ' the present .position of Western- Australia. I may be called a traitor or a humbug, and other names- of reproach - the vocabulary of unpoetic epithets has been drawn upon to an unlimited extent by our opponents - but I still claim to represent Western Australia truly and absolutely. Western-. Australia, is behind the Government in what has been done, and I am behind it, too, because I know that those who form the Government have, before <inline font-style="italic">now;</inline> on many occasions, had the- utmost confidence, placed in. them. Upon their, word has depended the fate of not hundreds, but thousands', of the citizens of this country. These men-, who have been trusted in the past, and upon whose.- word the confidence of thousands has been based:, are not, in the-, opinion of Western. Australia,, men who. to.-day will be false to their trust. Therefore, it is that in Western Australia, after two and. a half days' debate, the representatives of Labour came to the conclusion by forty-one to twenty-six votes - let that ring throughout the Common-: wealth: - to stand behind the- Government. </para>

At the- present time there are, I will not say stupid men, but short-sighted men, squint-eyed men with the best intentions in the world, striving to advise the people of this- Commonwealth, and in. the words of Sydney Smith, I tell them that sincerity of purpose will not carry them through;, and. they must make- way for men who see&gt; further and' more clearly than they do, and who for that reason are better fitted to steer the Commonwealth through times that are more troubled than any we ever experienced before.

                        <para>- We have scores of Victorians in Western Australia, but let me remind those men who stayed home in Victoria, in the State where the soup kitchens were while Western Australia was being developed, that that State offered them a home, and a chance for advancement, which they had not energy or opportunity enough to take advantage of in the State they left. Western Australia is the pioneer Labour State of the Commonwealth to-day. Today she has a line of steam-ships on her coast that is flying, not the house flag of a private company, but the flag of the people of Western Australia. There is an implement works there supplying every requirement from a steam engine to a garden hoe, owned and worked by the people of the State in the people's- interests. There is a State dairy farm there, and right through the list of Labour reforms there is proof that if there is any State in the Commonwealth that has translated Labour profession into practice it is Western Australia. The people have demonstrated to the world that as a Labour State Western Australia stands in the vanguard. </para>

Here we -have the representatives of Victoria and Queensland constituting those who are in opposition to the present proposal of the Government. Western Australia has a record, and" not merely professions, mouthings, and frothings to point to as a result of its efforts in support of the Labour movement. We are here to-day to stand as a target for the taunts and slings of men who do nothing except criticise, pull down, and groan at earnest men. The critic, as Beaconsfield has said, is a man who has failed in everything else. These men come forward, and taunt me, though I come from a State that "has shown them how things can be done. </para>

                        <para>- If those to whom I refer have not said it in words, they have said it by acts which indicate their character. They have expelled good men, and branded them as traitors. We have not done so in Western Australia yet. The position qf Western Australia is very different from that of Victoria, where freedom is still supposed to reign. Freedom 1 We have arrived at a lovely position in this party that rose on the ruins of other crumbling parties, and whose watchword was, " Give us liberty to  express our thoughts." In the past, men went round this country, and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley</inline> was one of them, telling the people over and over again that they had perfect liberty in everything outside the platform. Has <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley</inline> liberty now? No; both he and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ferricks</inline> are bound, and they are freely yielding to the clanking shackles, to-day as firmly as any slave ever was. They are following others as humbly as " poor dog Tray." </para>

                        <para>- I am wrong; poor dog Tray was never so humble. He was a' rampant lion compared to these men who are supposed to be free. In spite of the fact that they are indulging in taunts, and are telling the people that outside the Labour platform they are as free as air, yet on a matter within the State sphere of action, and outside the platform, they are bound and tied. Fair play ! we are just on the eve of a dissolution because our party, unfortunately, so far as the official section is concerned, is usurping the position of those tyrannical employers who in years past sent me and other members of this Chamber towards the setting sun because we wanted freedom of thought and speech. </para>

Figuratively speaking, you have to hit them on the ear-hole to bring them to their senses. Let it be understood that we in Western Australia are no traitors.

                <para>We are told that the Senate has been brought back in order that the anti-conscriptionists may make a fight. The statement is too funny for words. This pretence of making a fight has come to them as an after-thought. There should be no after-thoughts on a great principle. If they are really fighting for principle, as they would have the people of Australia believe, they have neglected their opportunities. What sort of fight did- they put up when we were dealing with the Referendum Bill? You, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. President,</inline> will remember the mosquito known as the " horse grey " which inhabits the Gulf country of Queensland - a long-legged, grey, bodyless and bowelless representative of the insect fraternity, which, when it landed on its victim, shivered because it was so destitute of vitality. The fight which is being made by a section of the Senate is no better than the fight of that rheumatic mosquito. We well remember <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Turley</inline> fighting in the Senate for two hours because some Queensland bandmaster could not get his uniform. We have known. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Barnes</inline> to debate at length paltry issues, but upon so vital a question as conscription they are mere shivering mosquitoes. Their hearts are not in their work, and the tragic aspect of the situation is that they wish the people to believe that their hearts are in sympathy with their tongues. What is in a man's heart is in his mind if he is sincere, and if he has anything of the make-up of a man in him he will fight for that in which he believes or submit to be called something less than a man. These men fought no better than that rheumatic mosquito in Queensland that used to suck our blood, and yet was so shivering during its attack that it could hardly hold on to its victim. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Story,</inline> to his credit be it said, made a speech extending over eight hours in the endeavour to convince the Senate that a factory was to be .placed on the wrong site. Why did not these anti-conscriptionists do as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Story</inline> did ? If he could make an eight hours' speech on the choice of a factory site the anti-conscriptionists could have made a forty hours' speech if they had any sincerity in them. On the selection of the Federal Capital site the Senate was kept engaged all through one night and the next day, but on a question so high that we cannot visualize it mentally these men who ask the country to believe that they have made a fight fought no better than that despised specimen of the insect fraternity. </para>
                <para>I do not know what they have in their minds, but I know that the sons of toil in Western Australia have discussed this issue, and have viewed it from every stand-point, and in the end have said that if the Federal Government, in order to win this war, desire to introduce conscription they in Western Australia will support them. The Western Australian representatives have a record as independent men. We did not wait to hear what the people were saying. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Henderson</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Buzacott</inline> went before their supporters to face the music and give a lead. Labour leaders they were in truth and essence. These other men also call themselves Labour leaders. Heaven help us ! It is related by the French historian Lamertine that a revolutionary leader was asked why he did not check the excesses of his followers, and he replied, " I have to follow them, because I am their leader." The time was when we had Labour leaders throughout the Commonwealth, but apparently they have all gone to Western Australia. </para>

                        <para>- South Australia is an honorable exception, and I am hopeful of Tasmania. For the last 27 years I have been associated with the Labour movement, my heart has been in it, and I have believed in it, because I know that through its agency we can bring about the social regeneration of man. It is because I am a Labour man that I am a conscriptionist to-day. I say with all the sincerity of which my heart is capable that those men who are opposed to the Government policy, who have gone out of their way to revile me and mine, those foolish and designing men are about to bring the Labour movement to destruction. They, sooner than anybody else, will write its epitaph. Upon what have we relied in the past ? You, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. President,</inline> know what campaigning has meant in this country during the last 27 years, and do you mean to tell me that all the eloquence and logic which has been brought to bear on the conscription side of the argument counts for naught against the extravagant clamour of our opponents ? We have had in this country opponents of the Labour party - that party which grew, so to speak, from a grain of mustard seed into the spreading tree that it is today - who, owing to their bent of mind and their eager desire to forward the cause in which they had faith, did things which spoke in tongues of fire. Need I recall what <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Walpole</inline> did in this State when he affirmed that marriage was a luxury? There has never been a more burning, eloquent discourse delivered by a Labour man than is contained in that extravagant statement by this champion of capitalism. I am going to point an argument, which, I hope, will strike home into <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Barnes'</inline> honest breast. </para>

                        <para>- Of course it is not. But the interjection of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ferricks</inline> shows the nature of the arguments that are being employed upon it. What I wish to point out to my comrades in this struggle is that there are no more powerful agents of the rooted, strong, and inveterate opponents of the Labour party than are men like <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ferricks</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Frank</inline> Anstey in the other Chamber. These men to-day are the unconscious champions of capital. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ferricks</inline> is bowed down with the weight of the burdens of our political opponents, and he doe3 not know it. So are all those who stand with him. On the other hand, the advocates of conscription know what they are doing. We do not fool the people for the sake of their votes. I told 1,500 miners at Kalgoorlie, " If you think I have come here to buy your popularity by telling you nice things that will please you, I say damn your popularity." </para>

                        <para>- Did the honorable senator ever say that at the Trades Hall <inline font-style="italic">1</inline> If he had done so, we would have had a healthier Labour movement in Australia to-day. But <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley</inline> is bound hand and foot - he is mentally in bondage. To the everlasting credit of the men on the gold-fields, the stamp of  men who made this country, and the stamp of men who alone can hold this country, if our security is ever threatened, they heard me clean through, though they did not agree with me, and gave me an ovation on leaving, them. That is the right spirit. Western Australia has not prejudiced <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley,</inline> but he has prejudiced the representatives of Western Australia. He has put us in an impossible position from our point of view. I realize that we are not at the parting of the ways, but that we shall be rushing headlong, to a precipice if the official heads of Labour in some of the States prevail. It is only because I know that the heart of Labour throughout the Commonwealth is sound, while the official head, in at least three States, is rotten, that I believe that those who were once Labour leaders will be wade to feel their feeble position, their plain dereliction of duty, and made also to think what they are about. But they will have to give a lead to the rank and file of the movement, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley</inline> did once. What is he now ? He is like " poor dog Tray." He is following on. These men look for a lead because, by reason of their occupations, they are not able to weigh the pros and cons of a mighty problem like this. Where .do they get their lead? From the French political leader, who led from behind. </para>

The system which they advocate never was good enough to win the battles of England, for in the days of the Peninsular War the British Government went abroad for mercenaries to the number of 54,000. </para>

                        <para>- I am a firm believer in the virtue and merits of the Labour policy as a regenerating agency in Australia, and for that reason I am a conscriptionist. If we lose the war, where will our party be? We shall have to bow the knee to that great Juggernaut which is threatening us. It is because I have seen twenty-seven years' solid service as a member of the Labour party that I am going to fight for conscription, and I hope to have with me, not only my party, but the thinking people of the Commonwealth. I shall endeavour to make the public realize and awaken to the seriousness of the position - awaken to the fact that our destinies are at stake. That is what I am here for, and for that I shall remain to the end, independent of what may happen. Considerations of the past do not weigh with me. I look around and see a Democracy; and what is a Democracy if it does not mean the rule of the people by the people? Democracy does not mean that there shall be a privileged class; but there is a privileged class if, when the country is in danger, a man may please himself whether he fights- for her. A man who claims to be a Democrat, and yet seeks to preserve a privileged class, is a. downright, absolute fraud, or he. does not know what he is talking about. I advocate conscription because I am alive to Australia's danger, and I support the policy of the Government because it seeks to make all able-bodied men stand to their guns in defence of this dear country. I have used what may be considered hard words, but I see no occasion to apologize for them. As I have- said repeatedly during the last eighteen, months, I am a conscriptionist because I am. a staunch and true believer- in. Labour - principles and in the Labour party. I am a conscriptionist because I am a practical Socialist, believing that if our country goes down neither party, platform, policy, nor anything else will count. I realize the danger, which, if not here to-day, is at the outer gates of our common, country, and I support conscription because I believe that the interests of the wealth-producers can be best conserved by that policy. T am in favour of conscription because I am an Irishman. Under the other system, and its iniquitous operation in Ireland, the best blood of that country has been spilled in more than fair proportion in the interests of the Empire, which was slow to give it a measure of justice. I do not want that to be the case iu Australia. If the men who now call me a traitor, to Ireland wish to see the best blood of the country spilled, as in Ireland, I do not; if that is their brand of patriotism, it is not mine, and never will be. </para>

                <para>The matured and best intelligence of Western Australia is with me in the stand I am now taking. Australia, I recognise, is the greatest and- freest country on God's earth. I have lived under the American, the French, and other flags, but it is here that I breathe the true atmosphere of freedom - that glorious freedom which has enabled some of the opponents of conscription to rise from the lower strata in the social sphere. It is our duty to take no chances or risks, but to see that the liberty we now enjoy is preserved for future generations. We require leaders to-day - men who are prepared to drop the party blinkers altogether. How many parties are there in Great Britain to-day on this war issue? How many parties are there in France? How many in Belgium; and how many in Italy? How many? Only one party. How many were behind Washington when he fought for and won. the independence of his country; and how many -behind Lincoln, when, by the instrumentality of a measure similar to this proclamation, he effected the emancipation of slavery in his country? There was only one party, and thus in this great crisis, as a Labour man, and as one recognising that if freedom goes everything is lost, I stand for conscription and equality of service. Otherwise we shall have the iron hand of the foreign aggressor on this free Australia of ours. It is because I have recognised this fact that for the last eighteen months I have been advocating a change of policy in order that Australia should play a manly part in this gigantic struggle. </para>
                <para>We have close upon a quarter of a million men under arms. Surely that is fair evidence that we are at war. And having that number of soldiers at the front, it is unquestionably our duty to stand close beside the allied nations. Will Australia be content to allow other comrade nations to fight her battles? These men who are opposed to conscription say, "Yes," but I say "No," because when victory is won, Australia will cover herself with immortal and indelible shame if, not having done her fair share in the struggle, she seeks the fruits of victory. And if, in such circumstances, it were possible for me to stand in the position of the British Empire, when an appeal came from Australia in her hour of peril, I would say to Australia, " What did you do when we wanted your assistance? What did you do for us when we were fighting for you in Flanders? You put up a fight of a kind, it is true, but you did not put up your best fight. From charitable motives we may assist you, but, as a matter of right, you are not entitled to any assistance at all." </para>

                        <para>- No true Socialist can stand idly by without sending help to Leibknecht, or responding to the message sent to us the other day by the British Socialists. What are our alleged Socialists in Australia doing to help? Why, they send a greeting, and call the Socialists of ' the allied countries " Comrades!" If I were a French Socialist, coming from the trenches be spattered and blood-stained, and received greetings of that nature from the Australian Socialists or the Australian Labour party, I would say, ' ' Damn your greetings ; send us help!" And the French Socialists would be quite entitled to say that, because the alleged Socialists in this country are not even decently neutral. They want to prevent help from being sent to their comrades in France, though the Socialists of the allied countries are fighting as they never fought before, and fighting, too, for the Australian Socialists as well. If we do not help the cause of freedom now, and in some future crisis appeal for assistance, the Socialists who are now in danger, and fighting the common fight, will be entitled to say, " When we were in trouble, you assembled on the Yarrabank, and talked about the conscription of wealth and the freedom of Australia ! But what did you do to help us ? Where were tEe men you could have sent? There were men by our side, it is true - men who were honest enough never to call themselves Socialists before - they were here with a rifle in their hands ; but you, cowards that you are, where were you ? Now that you know what trouble is, and you appeal to us for help, we send you greetings, and we call you comrades. That is as good as five army corps.  Perish and die,' because you, in your hypocritical hearts, said that to us." </para>

                <para class="block">Thank God, I have still a spark of manhood in me. In this struggle we need to put up our greatest effort. We have to put up a manly effort, and unmanliness is as foreign to the Australian as virtue is to the serpent. We need to do our best, so that no Frenchman or Britisher who may meet us hereafter will be entitled to say to us, " You did not do your fair share." As one who has travelled over thousands of miles of this country, I know that every Australian desires, above all things, to be independent, and to be able to look the wide world in the face. Australians will never consent to place themselves in such a position that, in our hour of danger, others will be able to say to us, " You did not do your share, you did not play the game, and now that you are in trouble you can fight your own battles." Those men of our party who think that they are the soothsayers of the hour are the unconscious enemies of the country. It is because I want the Labour movement to progress, and because I desire that the freedom of this country shall be preserved, that I advocate, with all the power that I can command, the action for which the proclamation provides. I regret that I have detained the Senate so long. I have spoken, as is usual with me, in the calmest language I can command, and I trust that what I have said will have a beneficial effect on those of my party who differ from me on this question. Even if my remarks represent only a grain of seed dropped by the wayside, I hope that that grain will have fallen on fertile soil, and that it will germinate and fructify. </para>

                    <para>. - After the hysterical outburst - the speech, or screech - in which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> has just indulged, I think it is about time we got down to business and discussed the main question. Before proceeding to do so, however, I should like to puncture one of the arguments used by the honorable senator, who, I regret to say, has had to leave to catch a train. Had he remained, I should have dealt with other points raised by him; but I do not wish to be unfair by referring to them in his absence. The honorable senator said that the people of Western Australia were solidly behind the Government and behind conscription. I deny that. I saw a telegram from a Western Australian gold-fields centre in which it was stated that the anti-conscriptionists would win by four to one. </para>

                        <para>- The same remark might well have been addressed to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch.</inline> One of the biggest meetings ever known on the gold-fields of Western Australia was held at the Boulder last Saturday night in support of an anti-conscriptionist, who is fighting <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Scaddan,</inline> and who has every prospect of beating him. It is just as well that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> and others from Western Australia, who say that that State is solidly in favour of conscription, should not count their chickens before they are hatched. The honorable senator threw out a challenge which I am quite prepared to take up, and in doing so I am sure I shall receive the support of many others. I hope we shall get a majority to support the meeting of the. Senate from day to day throughout this campaign, so that we may thresh cub this question. I should like the Senate to continue its sittings so that we may keep  a  watch on the Government. If the Government could play such trickery as that resorted to last Friday, when the Senate was actually sitting, what would it not do when Parliament was not in session?  I  should like to say, in passing, that there was no trickery in connexion with the amendment carried last Friday. Those who supported it were seized of their duties and responsibilities. </para>

We realized that the Government were not complying with the laws of the country - that they were endeavouring to evade them - and it was in order to bring them before the bar of public opinion, and to expose their tactics, that we decided to  bring honorable senators back to-day. A proclamation was issued last Friday, and, but for the questions that were raised cn the motion for the adjournment of the Senate, we should have known  nothing  about that proclamation until the Senate had been closed down. Regulations had also been issued in connexion with the proclamation, and we should have had no opportunity to discuss them but for the action of those who were responsible for the adjournment of the Senate until to-day. What is the law on the subject ? </para>

                        <para>- I will leave the honorable senator to answer his own silly question. Of course, Parliament is sitting, but the reasons have not yet been communicated to Parliament, and I claim that they ought to be. The truth is that :he Government were unable to give the reasons. They have called up the men ostensibly for home service under the Defence Act, but really they want them for service abroad. They gave no reasons, because they could not be candid and frank, and a proclamation which should have come before us last Friday was carefully locked up in a safe by somebody, until, as  arranged,  so I understand, Parliament was shut up. But there were other people alive to the situation as well as the Prime Minister and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce.</inline> Section 60 of the Defence Act distinctly provides that, if Parliament is not sitting at the date of the issue of the proclamation, it shall be summoned to meet within ten days after that date. It is clear that if Parliament is sitting, Parliament should have all the information in connexion with the proclamation, and the reasons for issuing it, and that, if Parliament is not sitting, it must be called together within ten days. If Parliament had not been sitting, would any one argue, that we should not be called together, and what should we be called together for except to hear the reasons for the proclamation ? It, therefore, undoubtedly follows that when Parliament is sitting it must be given those reasons. I have tried to get some legal opinions on this matter. </para>

                    <para>In my opinion, the proclamation is invalid, and, consequently, of no effect. My reason for so stating is that the  proclamatory  power of the Governor-General is a matter dependent entirely upon the commission constituting his office, and upon any Statute conferring such power. There is no power to call out the citizens for military service under his commission, and the power conferred under the Defence Act is to be exercised only in strict conformity with that Act, and, so far as the published statements of responsible Ministers have gone, the conditions of the Defence Act have not been complied with. If this be so, the proclamation must be held to be invalid. </para>

                <para>The power of the Governor-General to issue a proclamation calling upon persons liable to serve in the Citizen Forces to enlist and servo as prescribed can only be exercised in " time of war." " War," in the Defence Act, has a special definition to mean " invasion or apprehended invasion of, or apprehended attack on, the Commonwealth, or any Territory under the control of the Commonwealth by an enemy or armed force." Admittedly the powers are not being exercised in a time of " war," according to the foregoing definition, and are, consequently, an abuse of the Defence Act. </para>

                        <para>- I am not advising any one to do so, or in any way suggesting it. I am simply pointing out that, in view of the opinions I have just read, fortified by the language of the Defence Act, which is very explicit on the question, a man who disobeys the law in that regard would, I believe, be discharged by any honest tribunal. Leaving the proclamation, which is apparently invalid, and coming to the regulations, I understand that the regulation issued on Saturday last, Statutory Rule No. 20, has not yet been tabled, although the Senate is sitting to-day. The Government are not tabling it simply because they want to prevent the Senate passing an opinion on it. They know they can delay tabling it for fourteen days, and they know also that, in order to disallow it, we must keep Parliament open for fourteen days, and it may be necessary to do so. The Government are sheltering themselves behind the law. The Minister for Defence, who is primarily responsible for these regulations, seeks to save himself from public opinion and from being challenged in the Senate as to whether they are just or otherwise. </para>

                        <para>- I would not be arrested if I gave sureties for my appearance in the Court on the following day. In hundreds of cases proceedings are taken by way of summons, but in this case, without any question of first establishing a man's guilt, he is to betaken to a military depot and practically interned. No Labour Government should send a man to gaol or intern him before he has been heard in his defence. No matter how the Minister seeks to explain the matter away, he cannot avoid the charge that this man will be liable to what is practically gaoling - because an internment camp would be as bad as a gaol - before he is heard in his defence ; and no honorable senator should allow a Government to enforce such a regulation until Parliament has had an opportunity of assenting to it or otherwise. Now I come to the pernicious system that has been introduced - the thumb-print - to be succeeded, I suppose, by the thumb-screw a little later. This is a nice sample of the Prussianism that is being inaugurated by a Labour Government. The second paragraph of regulation 74 says that the military registrar or his assistant shall, "after taking the thumb or finger prints of the applicant "- </para>

                        <para>- So am I, and I am doing it just as effectively as is the Minister. One of the strongest arguments in support of conscription was that the men in the trenches should get a fair deal ; that they should be relieved oftener. It was said that it was a shame that men who had come back here should be sent again to fight. The Government, however, are actually providing in these regulations that discharged soldiers shall be called up just like every one else. They are to have no exemption and no privilege. If we are going to have conscription - I do not think that we are - those who have been to the front, and have returned, should be given some privilege. </para>

Every man who helps <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> to get into recess now must be taken to approve of the first step towards conscription, namely, the issue of the proclamation calling up men. He must be taken also to be in favour of every one of the regulations that have been issued. He must be regarded as voting for the thumb-print system, and as wishing to imprison men without trial. I intend to put the acid on this Senate, so that the public may see where the responsibility lies. </para>

Either House of Parliament has the right to disallow any regulation within a prescribed time. Now the Senate is so placed that it cannot deal with the regulations which I have been criticising, because the Government have skilfully prevented it by not laying the regulations on the table. But these regulations must be laid on the table within fifteen days if we continue to sit, and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Watson,</inline> or any other honorable senator who may disagree with any of them, can move to disallow it if he compels the Senate to continue sitting for another fourteen days. The course which I am about to take is not intended to put him or any other honorable senator in an awkward position. My object is to let the people of Australia know the little scheme of the Government, and to show them that some members of the Senate are prepared to do what they can to defeat it. To put <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Watson</inline> and others in the right, if they desire it. by giving them an opportunity to disallow any regulation, I move - </para>

                <para>Had the Government been straightforward, had they done what they should have done in an important matter like this, the regulations would have been laid on the table. They are dated 29th September, and are signed by the Governor-General and " G.F. Pearce, Minister for Defence." Why were they not laid on the table last Friday? It may be said that there was not then a copy of them available. Even though that may be so, they could have been laid on the table today, because I was able to get a copy of them yesterday from the Government Printer. Every one knows why the regulations have not been laid on the table. The Minister for Defence is afraid that the Senate might disallow some of these Prussian regulations, which provide for the taking of thumb-prints and the imprisoning of men without trial. I did not intend to deal with these regulations at length ; this action was forced on me. My amendment gives the Senate the only opportunity it can get of discussing and disallowing the regulations should it so desire. </para>

                    <para>. - I second the amendment, and I am pleased that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Mullan</inline> has moved it. It is inconceivable that regulations of the important nature of those which have just been issued should be kept from Parliament. In Saturday evening's Melbourne <inline font-style="italic">Herald</inline> I noticed, under great headlines, statements to the following effect : - </para>
                </talk.start>
                <para>On Monday every single man and widower without children between twenty-one and thirty-five years of age in Australia will automatically be called to the colours, and may be retained in the ranks until the end of the war. Those affected must report in alphabetical precedence at the places and hours mentioned in the advertised lists. There will be a preliminary medical examination at the places of enlistment, and a final examination at the camps or elsewhere. Finger-prints will be taken to identify the men. </para>
                <para>That statement was made public through the press on the Saturday. Seeing that the Senate was to meet to-day, it was only reasonable for us to assume that the Minister for Defence would, as his first action this afternoon, have tabled these regulations. If they can be given to the country through the press, it is unreasonable that they should be denied to the members of this branch of the "National Parliament. The proclamation and the gist of the regulations were telegraphed to the InterState newspapers on Friday, while the Senate was sitting, but the Minister of Defence, for reasons best known to himself, but which seem a little suspicious, as though he were afraid that they would be discussed or criticised, neglected to table them in the Senate. That is a position .which I do not think any Government can justify. The Minister for Defence talked of honorable senators responsible for the sitting to-day "trapping" other members of the Senate, but in saying that I thought he was living very convenient to a glass house. These regulations are of serious moment to the people of Australia, in view of the unprecedented action that has been taken in the issue of the proclamation, and in view df its consequences. In addition to those enumerated by my colleague, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Mullan,</inline> there are a number of other regulations to which I think public attention should be called. Regulation 8 provides that - </para>
                <para>All officers in the service of the Commonwealth and of any State, and all officers in "the service of any local governing body, are authorized and required to furnish to a military registrar all such information as is required relative to the liability for military service of any person liable to serve. </para>
                <para class="block">By that regulation the Government are throwing upon every public servant of the Commonwealth or a State, and every servant of a local governing body, a responsibility which, in many cases, they will be unable to fulfil. The regulation has a subtle savour of the introduction of the informer, or spy, system amongst Australians. By what right is one of these officers to supply to a military registrar his opinion of John Smith's qualifications for home service ? It is not fair to the public officer, nor is it fair to the men called up for service. Surely the military organization of Australia should be sufficiently elastic to do all that is required of it without the creation of what might be called a subsidiary organization of public servants to assist it. This appears to me to be an extension of the hateful secret service institution which I suppose is considered necessary in war time </para>

The Minister was not then so definite concerning the refusal of counsel as he is in this regulation. Neither counsel nor paid agent is to be allowed to appear in these exemption Courts. That is all right, as it applies to both sides, but under the regulation a representative of the military is to be before the Court as a party to each application. </para>

Is it another instance of the democracy of conscription? A military officer, who by virtue of his calling must be well informed on every question that is likely to arise, is to be a party to each application. John Smith, the wharf labourer, going before the Police Magistrate, is confronted by a military officer, with all his decorations and plumes, and attended probably by an orderly or a couple of orderlies, who is to have the right to state the case to the magistrate against John Smith's application. </para>

                        <para>-Quite so. They always made sure of their juries. The arrangement of the panel was always carefully planned. The railway men who went on strike in Victoria were confronted with this danger: If the Government were not satisfied with the measure of severity that would be handed out in a particular district to those whom they prosecuted, they had the power to change the venue to any part of Victoria. This is a very dangerous power to invest in the military authorities. When we consider the rate at which they have been advancing since the agitation for conscription was set up, we can imagine to what length the military caste in Australia will go if given the unbridled licence which they will enjoy under the conscription system. It is absolutely essential that public attention should be drawn to these regulations. The members of the Senate who secured the adjournment on Friday to the present sitting performed a public duty to the people of Australia. I was rather surprised at the attitude adopted by the Minister for Defence when the Senate met to-day. Before waiting to see whether honorable senators desired to ask questions, or to have an opportunity to discuss matters of vital importance, the Minister at once moved that the Senate, at its rising, adjourn to a date to be fixed by the  President. </para>

                        <para>- I say that my visit to Adelaide was educational. It confirmed the view I always held of the danger of leaving the destinies of the Labour movement in the hands of politicians. Under regulation 35, an application for exemption may be made on the ground that serious hardship would ensue if a man were called up for military service owing to his exceptional domestic or financial obligations. This is one of the grounds upon which exemptions may be applied for. I mention it now that it may be given due publicity. I know that many people in Australia may be involved, as they have to live upon modest wages, and it is due to them that the existence of this regulation should be made known. It is quite conceivable that many of them have not had an opportunity of reading the regulations, as we have had a brief opportunity of doing. I say feelingly that we owe no thanks to the Government for that opportunity. In regard to regulation 80, dealing with thumb-prints, I think the Minister contended by interjection that this system is to apply to exemption certificates only. The regulation reads - 80. (1) For the purposes of identification, thumb-prints shall be taken of the palmar surface of both thumbs, but if the palmar surface of one or both thumbs should be damaged, then the print shall be taken of the index finger or fingers, as the case may be. </para>

                        <para>- That is the point upon which I desire to be clear. Although nothing can make us wonder in these days, it would have been inconceivable that persons who had merely enlisted should have had to leave an imprint of their thumbs in the hands of the military authorities. But even in regard to those who have been granted exemption, can it be seriously contended that such an extreme precaution is necessary? I assume that the reason for that drastic regulation is the fear that persons might trade in the exemption certificates. If that assumption is correct, the Government are paying a very poor compliment to the Australian people. </para>

                        <para>- I agree that the military organization should be sufficiently safeguarded in its operations to prevent cases such as the Minister has indicated. But we know that the secret service system in Australia, as in every other country which is at war, is conducted on deep-laid lines. Nobody is able to discover what persons in the community are members of the secret service., That is illustrated by a Queensland case which we brought under the notice of the Minister for Defence. An Australian had been interned on the ground of disloyalty. During the Brisbane strike, in 1912, this man was a relentless critic of those men who acted as special constables or scabs, and he maintained that attitude subsequently. He was employed at the Ipswich Railway Workshops, and I believe that a conspiracy was hatched by some of the persons whom he had criticised in order to bring about his internment. That man, Richard Gehrmann by name, went to school with me, and so far as I know there is as much German sympathy in him as there is in me. At our request the Minister granted an inquiry. Then I asked the Minister if the man might know the grounds upon which he was charged. The Minister replied, "No; the evidence will be given at the inquiry." When the man was interned, he was not charged with the statements which he is alleged to have made, but only the vaguest information was conveyed to him as to why he was under arrest. When granting the inquiry the Minister for Defence told us that even if the Court of inquiry found in favour of the man, he, as Minister, would come to a decision, not only on the evidence adduced at the inquiry, but also on the evidence supplied to him by members of the secret service. I asked the Minister if it would not be fair to supply the man with information as to the statements he was alleged to have made, so that he might have an opportunity of either denying or confirming them. But the Minister told me, and I suppose his answer was feasible enough, that if such information were imparted, the whole secret service would break down. John Smith would be informed of the charge laid against him by members of the secret service; he would remember having made the remark and, consequently, he would gain an inkling as to what persons were members of the secret service. That just illustrates again the democracy of warfare and military rule. </para>

The exemption ques'tion will present many difficulties, and I was much impressed by the following paragraph in last night's Melbourne <inline font-style="italic">Herald -</inline></para>

                    <para>One of the police magistrates who has been appointed to deal with applications for exemption suggested to-day that, in order to secure uniformity in decisions when reasons were practically similar, certain cases should be adjourned to permit of magistrates meeting at night and conferring. The magistrate said that heartburnings would be caused if one applicant were denied exemption in one district for reasons which were considered sufficient to warrant exemption in another district. If procedure were as near as possible similar in all Courts, there would be no ground for complaint. </para>

                <para class="block">There we have an admission by one of the magistrates appointed to deal with these applications for exemptions that appeals sometimes are not practicable, even when the case is meritorious. That is a very serious statement from a responsible source, and it just emphasizes how careful we must be if there is to be any approach to justice in the operation of the exemption Courts. Like other members of the Senate, I was considerably entertained this afternoon by the speech of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch,</inline> who, I regret to say, has been called away to Ballarat to address a conscription meeting in conjunction with <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Watt.</inline> The honorable senator was hardly doing me justice when he stated that I advocated the hiring of other people to fight for Australia. I interjected at the time that his leader, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes,</inline> had expressed himself in favour of that policy. It has been stated repeatedly, without any attempt to produce proof or argument in support, that Australia was depending on conscript countries to fight its battles. I think Australia has done remarkably well. I do not wish to reiterate my previously expressed opinions in that regard, but it is necessary to point out again that Australian volunteers at Gallipoli did much to assist Russia by holding the Turks at bay when the Russians were sorely pressed, and a flank attack by the Turks would have done much injury to them. Therefore, Australian volunteers can claim to have done something material to assist those of our Allies who have conscription in force. On 31st July, 1901, as will be seen by reference to <inline font-style="italic">Hansard,</inline> page 3298, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> said - </para>

The quotation which I have made is an appropriate reply to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch's</inline> unfounded allegations. I have here another utterance of the present Prime Minister, which deals with the payment of soldiers who may be called up for home- service. We have been repeatedly assured that under .conscription the Government will not tolerate any change in the payment of our troops - that all will receive the same rate of pay, regardless of the duration of the war. What were the sentiments of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> on this matter as expressed by him on the -5th August, 1903, when the Defence Bill was under consideration ? On page 3094 of <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> he is thus reported - </para>

                        Undoubtedly ; the basic idea of my amendment is that it is the duty of every citizen to fit himself for the defence of the Commonwealth. The Minister proposes to take the

                        Surely not. The Minister has power to call upon every male inhabitant of Australia, except those who are exempt from service - that is, those who are already in the Defence Forces - and who have resided for six months in the Commonwealth, and aTe British subjects, and who are between the ages of eighteen and sixty, to serve in the  militia. It is inconceivable that when the whole nation has to respond to a call to arms, every man should be paid.

                        I have already said that I do not. If I did propose to pay thom, the right honorable gentleman would tell the Committee that it would cost, perhaps, ?500,000 a year to do so, and would ask honorable members if they are prepared to vote so large an amount of money. We do not pay men for doing their duty to the State by recording their votes, although in New South  Wales, and, I suppose, in Victoria too, thousands of men lose a day's work at every general election.  Why, then, should we pay men for doing their duty in regard to the defence of their country?

The conclusion which I arrived at after a perusal of these reports is that if the war continues for any long period our financial burden under conscription will be more than Australia can bear. It would not be equally as heavy under the voluntary system. Experience has shown that we have not been able to send our men to the front as expeditiously as we would like, and the indications are that we shall be able to do no better in the future, on account of the less shipping that is available every day. Quite a large number of men will enter our training camps, and they will have to be equipped, maintained, and paid, so that the financial strain will be very great. </para>

                        <para>- But under the proclamation they will be called up for service " during the continuance of the war." That is a departure from what was generally expected, and the only conclusion which can be drawn from it is that they will enter our home service camps and will remain there during the continuance of the war. To some extent that departure has lessened the conviction which I had previously held that the action of the Government in calling up these men was invalid. The Government now say in effect, " We are calling up these men, not until the referendum is taken, but ' during the continuance of the war.' " That is the plain unvarnished statement which is set out in the proclamation that has been signed by the Governor-General. When we consider what the financial responsibility and burden on Australia will be on account of this new departure, and the adoption of the Government proposals, does any honorable member think for a moment that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> may not change his attitude in regard to the rates of pay ? <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> has publicly stated that he is prepared to eat his words as to the sending of men out of Australia for military service - words uttered in July of last year. The right honorable gentleman has publicly stated a dozen times since that he has eaten those words, and that he has been forced to do so by necessity and experience. Hence my fear that he is just as liable to change his opinion again; and I am fortified in that by the remembrance of his earlier speeches in another place. I believe that the Prime Minister was utterly sincere when he used those words  over a year ago, as I think he is sincere in his whole-hearted Imperialism to-day. </para>

I am afraid that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> will be one of the first to change his own opinion, and that of the Government, in regard to the rate of pay of Australian soldiers, seeing that he has apparently changed the opinion of his Government on the question of conscription. If I am convinced on any point, I shall certainly change my opinion. If the day should come for me to disagree with the Labour party or the Labour platform, I shall do so, but I shall get out of the Labour party to do it; and that makes all the difference. "We have to consider what Australia has already done, and the financial burdens which are heaping on us, and which must be continued even if the war happily were to end before the close of the financial year, as some judges are prone to prophesy. Certain people are taking to themselves the flattering satisfaction that the wealth tax proposed by the Government is the be-all and end-all of that class of taxation. I welcome the modest proposal of the Government to impose a tax of lj per cent, on the wealth of Australia, spread over three annual instalments; but I am not sanguine or optimistic enough, to believe that we shall thus be enabled to get rid of our responsibilities financial and otherwise - repatriation, pensions, and so forth - as soon as the war is over. I am strongly convinced that, instead of this little instalment of lj per cent.- </para>

                        <para>- I think that, at the end of three years, public opinion will be so strong that whatever Government is in power - whether it be a Hughes Government, a Cook Government, or an Irvine Government - it will be compelled to do the people's will. My idea is that, instead of the public favouring any relief from such taxation, the party in power will have to give the screw a few more turns. </para>

                        <para>- I think that the Australian public will see to that; and I agree with it. Public opinion will be so strong in favour of the wealthy section oi the community doing its share, that no Government will be able to shirk its responsibilities. The other day those of  us  who had stated our intention to take the platform in opposition to conscription signed a declaration to that effect; and on une following day there appeared in the press a list of the names of those who had not signed. I think that was hardly an honest presentment of the situation, as existent in the different sections of our party. To have been honest, those responsible for the publication of the names in the newspapers ought to have done as we did - they ought to have attached their signatures to a declaration that they were prepared to go on the platform, and urge the people to adopt conscription. </para>

                            takes the view that silence gives consent, and it is a reasonable assumption, but we are forced to the belief that a comparatively large section of those whose names were mentioned will not go on the platform ' and advocate conscription, and, therefore, the press statement is misleading. In fairness to the people, these men should have made a declaration in " concrete and definite terms," to quote a phrase very often used by the Prime Minister. I have no more to say at this juncture, except to urge the Government and the Minister for Defence to see that the regulations are administered justly and equitably. Parliament will be denied the right of confirming or rejecting the regulations, owing to the fact that they have not been tabled, although they were given to the press and published throughout Australia. These regulations were denied the members of this Chamber, who would have been debarred from discussing them but for the action of those who secured the adjournment on Friday last. I trust that government by regulation, hateful and unfair as it is, will not be accentuated by government by hidden regulation - bv regulation which has not seen the light of day, and has not been indorsed or rejected by the Parliament of the Commonwealth. This circumstance  will, I believe, have a most important bearing on the result of the referendum.

                        <para>- These meetings were of a class that a man likes to address, and the audience were evidently giving the matter their most earnest consideration. I have no apprehension in regard to the issue to be decided, though I admit with you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. President,</inline> that it is a very hard matter on which to decide. When, however, we are told by such a Conservative organ as the <inline font-style="italic">Argus</inline> that there were from 55,000 to 60,000 people on the Yarra-bank at an anti-conscription meeting, we may take it that that journal has not over-estimated the figure. Such meetings are an indication to me that the people are taking a deep interest in the issue; and that is all that we who denounce conscription can reasonably ask. If the people continue to take that interest, it will make up for the handicap of the press oppression instituted by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> through the censor ; and it is one of the most hopeful signs for the defeat of the referendum on the 28th October. That interest, I think, will not only continue, but, like the snowball, will gather strength as it goes along; and, so far as one can possibly judge on so serious and so momentous an issue, I believe that the referendum is going to be defeated. </para>

                    (New South Wales) [5.45J. - I do not propose to detain the Senate long, but as the question has been raised as to the right of this Chamber, in common with another place, to consider the regulations, I should not like the vote I propose to give - which will be in support of the motion submitted by the Minister - to be given without some statement and explanation of the views I hold on the matter. I can find no fault with those who have taken the course they have in ventilating what they regard as the right, and which I accept as the right, of Parliament to have the regulations placed before it. I am not going to labour the question, but I do stress the point that the Defence Act itself distinctly provides that, if Parliament is sitting, the reasons for calling out the Forces shall forthwith be communicated by the Governor-General to both Houses. It would have been better if the Minister had made that statement to Parliament. As it is, the proclamation is issued, and the responsibility for it does not rest with this House, but with the Minister. There may or may not have been good reasons for the action taken, but it was the clear intention of the Act that Parliament should have the reasons for any such proclamation submitted to it by means of a Vice-Regal message. Having said that, I would now like to say a word or two as to the regulations. I regret that we have not had an opportunity of discussing them, because they contain matters which are open to debate. Indeed, it would be curious if a set of regulations were not so open to debate; but I feel that in these regulations there are some things which will be misconstrued and distorted by opponents of compulsion, and that it would have been much better if the Government had given Parliament the time and the opportunity to discuss them, with a view to their amendment, if necessary. Let me refer to one. In spite of the limitation placed upon it, the proposal that we should have thumb-prints is distasteful; and, even now, I trust that the Minister will reconsider his decision, and see if it is not possible to secure some guarantee, which he evidently requires, without resorting to a practice which, in the minds of Australians, and, I believe, of the whole civilized world, is associated with criminality. The Minister has stated that this action has been taken with a view to avoiding fraud against the Department. I would do- anything to prevent fraud, which would rob this country of its right to claim from every citizen that service  which he should render it; but if the resources of the Department are not capable of detecting impersonation to that extent, may I ask the Minister whether it would not be better to resort to the passport system?

                    <para>- But not in this country, I understand. I am supporting the Government war policy, but the matter of the proclamation and regulations having been raised to-day, I do not think I would be acting fairly to myself if I abstained from expressing my views on that subject, and I am making my appeal to the Minister because I do not think there is any argument that can be used against compulsion which will be more effective and more freely used by opponents of the Government policy than this practice of having placed on the certificate the thumb-prints of the men called Up. I understand the official explanation with regard to thumb-prints is that they are included with the object of identifying the persons exempted ; but it should be possible, even now, to devise some precaution which would be less objectionable to the public sentiment of Australia, and which would rob opponents of the Government policy of what might prove to be one of the strongest weapons in their armoury. When <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Mullan</inline> was speaking, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Watson</inline> made a very pertinent interjection when he asked what good we could do by staying here, in view of the fact that we have agreed, by a decisive majority, to refer the matter at issue to the electors. I do not think it would be claimed that I am egotistical when I say that the qualifications and training of members of Parliament are such that they are better equipped for platform work than anybody else, and having debated the matter in this House they are in a better position than anybody else in Australia to enlighten the electors whose votes will decide the question. For that reason, if for no other, the sooner we terminate our proceedings here the better it will ' be; at any rate from the point of view of obtaining an intelligent vote of the people in regard to the referendum. </para>

Then, this afternoon, he said that he would not pay any man to fight for us. What is he going to do ? He will not have volunteers, conscripts, or mercenary soldiers, so by what wonderful stroke of magic does the honorable senator imagine that we are going to bring this war to a successful issue ? </para>

Now, what is the alternative according to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ferricks,</inline> who is one of the spokesmen of the party, and whose opposition to the Government's proposal is so pronounced that recently he was deputed to speak in the New South Wales capital, and also in South Australia ? He will not have volunteers, conscripts, or mercenaries. That being th© case, we must presume that the portals of Australia would be opened wide for the entry of the German hordes. Until these gentlemen show their <inline font-style="italic">bona fides</inline> by submitting some practical alternative course to that laid down by the Government, I am inclined to agree with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Barnes</inline> that there is no argument in the matter at all. But according to our opponents there is one alternative. We have this on the authority of the New South Wales Anti-Conscriptionist Council's manifesto, and if we were not dealing with such a serious matter, I should' almost be persuaded that I was perusing a Gilbert and Sullivan opera, instead of a proposal emanating from the New South Wales body referred to, which, by the way, is composed, I take it, of representatives of the Labour Council, and of the industrial section of the Political Labour League - together with the Industrial Workers of the World - and speaks for a certain section of the unionists. </para>

                        <para>- Certainly I am in favour of direct action. But I am complaining that if some honorable senators had their way we would have no action at all to save Australia. Now, let me get back to the alternative, which has been suggested by the New South Wales Anti-Conscriptionist Council, and that is that the Democracy of Australia, which has emblazoned upon its banner the policy of a White Australia, should now turn round and say, " We ought to conscript the coloured people to fight for us." Surely nothing could be more disgraceful, and nothing more repugnant to an intelligent Democracy, than that subject races of the Empire, the people of India, who are denied the freedom of this country, should be called upon to fight for us! Surely, if there is a sense of humour in Australia, the absurdity of this proposal will be apparent! It has, however, bean put forward as a definite proposition by one of the official organizations leading this movement against conscription. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> was quite right the other day when he said that the proposal suggested degeneracy. It would, if it were adopted and indorsed by Australia; but I refuse to believe that the people of Australia would accept as their only alternative a scheme that would be a disgrace , to the Commonwealth, and which shows how utterly bankrupt of sound argument are the opponents of the Government proposition. Then there is the further proposal that Russians should be employed to do our fighting for us. One very strong opponent of compulsion, ex-Senator Rae, recently said that we could get ten Russians for the price of one Australian. That is a novel proposition to come from a so-called Democrat, who has stood for the policy of high wages, that Australia should employ Russians because they are cheaper than Australian soldiers. Let me say that, whether we are going to employ men because they are the coloured subject people of India, or the cheap labour of Russia, the moment any nation, no matter what its form of government may be, reaches the point at which, preferring a life of ease to love of country, it refuses to do its own fighting, that nation may write " Ichabod  " over its doors, and pass out of history. There may be occasions on which nations may find safety by means of the courage and the military capacity of others; but, sooner or later, the nation that will not fight for itself must decay. History gives innumerable instances where empires, powerful at one time, have called in other nations to fight for them, and where there has been, possibly, some appearance of temporary success attending such a policy. But it has always been followed by one of two consequences: either the armies paid to do the fighting have, in turn, conquered those who paid and employed them, or the very action taken to employ them has not merely indicated a measure of decay, but - has fostered that decay, and has been followed by national disaster. Let Australians recognise that the moment it is published to the world that they are not themselves prepared to fight for their country, their ideals, their freedom, and, above all, for their homes and their women, they will not find other nations prepared to do the work for them. They may find other nations that are prepared to come and take their homes and their country from them, but they will never find a nation ready to fight for a country that is not willing to fight for itself. On this question of home defence, an attempt has been made - and it is an absolutely flimsy one - to show that there is a difference  between  compulsion for home defence and compulsion for foreign service. If home defence is good for Australia, it is good also for other nations. It cannot be a sound principle in Australia and absolutely unsound in Great Britain. Every man knows that if Great Britain once adopted the principle of military service for home defence only Australia would quickly go out of business. We are safe to-day, and have been safe for the last 120 years, not by reason of anything we in this country have done, but because of the knowledge that England would not stop to argue and palter over whether or not her territorial boundaries had to be passed in order to help us. </para>

What is more, he is quite prepared to send another 150,000 men- to the front as long 'as they go as volunteers. So far as his public utterances enable us to judge, he would not mind sending the last man out of Australia as long as he went as a volunteer. But, whilst we may denude the country of its men by means of voluntarism, the moment we proceed to denude it by compulsion the country, according to him, is in danger. </para>

                        <para>- When face to face with a great necessity, Great Britain did what Australia is going to do. We shall shrink from no effort or sacrifice necessary to give effect to the brave words we have been uttering for the last two years. We shall show by our acts that we mean what we say. If we refuse to adopt the proposal of the Government, then Australia, or that section of it which secures the defeat of the referendum, will stand in' the eyes of the world not merely ashamed, but condemned as the biggest braggart the world has ever known. We have declared that we shall see the war through, and that we shall never cry a halt until victory has been secured. On the last anniversary of the war, did we not pass resolutions to the effect that we would see the thing through ? But now that we are called upon to make a more strenuous effort than was contemplated in the early days of the conflict, we hear some honorable senators say, " Let us take our hand from the plough. The furrow is but half through, but let us withdraw our hand. We have made a big enough sacrifice. Our effort has been strenuous enough. Let us be comfortable and leave the responsibility of completing this tremendous contract to the men who are fighting for us as well as for themselves." I refuse to believe that Australia will indorse that attitude. Arguments, are being put forward to-day in opposition to compulsion which I find difficult to regard as sincere or <inline font-style="italic">bond fide.</inline> They so nearly approach a wilful distortion of the truth that I can only assume that they are part of one general scheme. I did hope that, having regard to the big issues involved in the reference of this matter to the people, there would be an effort to put the plain facts to the popular judgment. But there is evidence of a systematic effort to misrepresent the truth. </para>

                        <para>- There was an anti- conscription meeting in the Sydney Domain on Sunday last. There were several thousands there - I did not stop to count them, as it was raining - but is it to be claimed that they were all anti-conscriptionists ? I was one of them, having gone with several others, as thousands must have done, out of curiosity. My object in attending was to see two things : the peculiar type of individual who would be advocating anti-conscription, and the still more peculiar type that would be persuaded by him. I did not consider my afternoon wasted; I came away a much happier man than I went, concluding that if the stuff I listened to that afternoon constituted 'the case on which the " anti's " relied, there was too much intelligence, patriotism, and common sense in Australia to be moved by it. If that is the strength of their case, it only needs a little ordinary effort on the part of those supporting conscription to insure a triumphant verdict on the 28th of this month. I propose to vote with the Government on this motion. I have expressed a little disappointment at their action in regard to the regulations, and their failure to acquaint Parliament with the proclamation, as the Defence Act requires. But one has almost to do this, whether supporting a Government to which one is ordinarily attached, or, as in my case, supporting a Government from which one is ordinarily detached. We must take things by and large. </para>

                        <para>- There is no alternative. As the honorable senator and his friends cannot hope to defeat the Government's proposition, I appeal to them to allow the sitting to conclude, and ' enable us to get to the platform. They have made their protest and stated their case, and I would urge them not to take those steps which have been resorted to on previous occasions to drag the debate out merely for the purpose of keeping it going. I hope we shall arrive at a decision without any attempt to erect that not always effective structure known as a "stone wall." </para>

                    <para>. - I am glad that I was one of those responsible by my vote last Friday afternoon for calling the Senate together to-day, and I venture to say that those who were by that vote compelled to return to the Seat of Government will not have against me now that animosity which perhaps they might have felt when they received from the Government the telegram summoning them back, because, if I have done nothing else; I have, at least, given them the opportunity to hear the calm, dispassionate, and very classic speech of my colleague, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> - I am sure they would not have missed that effort for a great deal - as well as the usual courteous and clever speech of the Leader of the Opposition. I would have travelled much further than from New South Wales to Melbourne for the opportunity of listening to my Western Australian colleague. If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> were present, I should like to deal in detail with a few of his statements, but as lie was compelled to go to Ballarat to voice the sentiments that he so ably expresses in the Senate, carrying out the conscriptionist views that he so sincerely holds, I shall wait for the opportunity to reply to several of his statements on the public platforms of Western Australia, when he and 1 will be taking different sides. I do not concede to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> the right to speak in this Senate for Western Australia wholly, so far as his views on conscription are concerned. I give him all credit for deep-hearted sincerity. In fact, I know of no man more sincere in his advocacy of his views; but, although I am a duly elected senator from Western Australia, the people's votes having put me here, I cannot arrogate to myself the right to speak wholly for Western Australia in the views I hold. </para>

It is very hard to avoid personalities when such innuendoes are thrown out, no matter how strong and resolute a man may be in his desire to conduct the campaign in a proper spirit. When such interjections are made it is a heavy strain on human nature to refrain from hitting back. </para>

                        <para>- The information that we obtained in the newspapers on Saturday morning should have been given to this Senate by the representatives of the Government. The Defence Act lays it down very distinctly that if Parliament is not sitting when a proclamation is issued under the Act it shall be called together within ten days, for the purpose of discussing the reasons for the issuing of the proclamation. In an interjection on Friday <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> said that every member of Parliament knew the reasons for the issue of the proclamation, but even admitting that this was the case, the Government were not fulfilling the law. Parliament must be called together to discuss the reasons for the issue of a proclamation, even if it is perfectly well acquainted with them, and if it is sitting at the time it should have the opportunity to discuss the reasons. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> has told the Government, which he is heartily supporting at the present time, that if they had come down boldly to Parliament with the proclamation and allowed honorable senators to discuss the reasons for it, it would have been the better course to follow. </para>

                        <para>- It may be legal under the War Precautions Act, but it is not legal under the Defence Act. The Government cannot expect citizens to obey the law . if they set a bad example by breaking it themselves. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> also said on Friday afternoon that I had seen the Prime Minister hand a typewritten document to him. The statement is absolutely incorrect. At no time on Friday did I see the Prime Minister while the Senate was sitting, though I saw him in the Queen's Hall immediately after the Senate adjourned; but, even if I had seen the Prime Minister hand the Minister for Defence a document, it would not validate the action of the Minister in not taking the Senate into his confidence earlier on Friday. Had he made earlier the statement that he made about half-past 4 o'clock, that the proclamation was issued, my vote would not have gone in the direction it did on that afternoon. I registered that vote as a protest against what I considered was a breach of the law. However, we are meeting to-day, and have the opportunity of discussing the regulations that have been issued. They have not been laid on the table or distributed officially, but honorable senators have been able to secure copies by a fluke. I ask the Minister for Defence whether it is intended to exempt theological students from the proclamation ? </para>

Parliament wisely thought that, as these students were preparing for an avocation which would not be of a combatant nature, so far as military service is concerned, their studies should not be interfered with by the military requirements of the Defence Act. </para>

                        <para>- I think the Minister will find that theological students are included in the exemptions. When speaking on the second reading of the Commonwealth Military Service Referendum Bill, I suggested that the destiny of a man seeking exemption should not be entirely in the hands of a stipendiary magistrate. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Buzacott</inline> also took that view. I also pointed out the penalty that would be imposed on the working classes by the different appeal Court provisions. The rich man will have opportunities to appeal from the stipendiary magistrate to the Supreme Court, and from the Supreme Court to the High Court. The working man will have the same opportunity, but, unfortunately, his stumbling block will be the fact that he will not possess the means for submitting an appeal to a higher tribunal. At a later stage, when I asked the Government if they had reconsidered the matter, I was informed that they had reconsidered it, but intended to adhere to their proposal. It is not too late to appoint exemption Boards in each district, comprising representatives of the workers and representatives of the rich men, with independent chairmen, and make the decision of these Boards final. I ask the Minister whether it is not possible to review the matter from that stand-point ? I cannot understand how any Government in free Australia, be it Labour or anti-Labour, should introduce such a repugnant principle as is contained in the thumb-print regulation which has just been- issued. No matter how one feels on the subject of conscription or anti-conscription, the taking of finger-prints suggests criminality. The two cannot be separated. That such a taint should be put on a free-born citizen in any part of the world is extremely repugnant. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> has pointed out the seriousness of such a suggestion in the regulation. I am always prepared to submit to the will of the majority, and to obey the law. During the last fortnight I have been asked on several occasions, " What will I do if I am called out under the proclamation?" and my advice has always been, " Obey the law." Surely the Government and their advisers are not so destitute of ideas that they cannot find means of detecting that person who is desirous of evading the proclamation other than this finger-print business. In all friendliness and sincerity I appeal, even at this eleventh hour, for an assurance that this regulation will be revoked and cast into that limbo from which it should never have emerged . If the people were consulted in regard to it, they would with one voice cry "Anathema!" It is true that, on Friday last, I voted to bring about a meeting of the Senate today. For that action I have neither apology nor explanation, as I acted entirely within my rights, and I should act in the same way again should the occasion demand. But I realize that were I to support <inline font-weight="bold">Senator</inline> Mullan's  amendment nothing would be gained. The regulations to which he referred were issued under the War Precautions Act 1914-16, in conjunction with the Defence Act 1903- 15, and, no matter what we may do, will take effect, because the War Precautions Act supersedes every other. It is true that I voted for that Act, and I take the fullest responsibility for doing so. I considered it necessary, in time of war, to give the Government wide powers to protect this portion of the Empire. I realize, however, that, like Frankenstein, I helped to create a monster, and were the thing to be done again, I should hesitate about agreeing to all the provisions of that legislation. However, I have made my protest. I have criticised certain of the regulations issued in connexion with the proclamation, and, having done so much, I can only throw myself on the hands of the Government. This Parliament is at the mercy of Ministers. I yield to no man in allegiance to the party of which I am a member, and it ill becomes any one, whether a senator or a member of the public, to say that a person differing from him in regard to conscription is false to the Labour party or to the movement. </para>

Before sitting down I wish to say to the Leader of the Senate that I shall not put on the. cap which he wished some of us to wear when he spoke about laying traps for fellow senators. I supported the Referendum Bill in order to give people a chance to determine this question for themselves, and I shall support the motion for adjournment, because I realize that, if we sat until the 28th October, we could do nothing. Into the merits and demerits of conscription I shall not enter to-night, though, if life and health are spared, I shall do so fully elsewhere in Australia, and shall stand or fall by the verdict of the people. </para>

                    <para>.- As one of those who on Friday brought about to-day's meeting of the Senate, I resent the imputation that we were guilty of trickery on that occasion. Our desire was simply to obtain the fullest information regarding matters affecting every citizen of the Commonwealth. We desired a definite statement from the Leader of the Senate as to when the proclamation would be issued, and we wished to know what regulations would be made under it. The intentions of the Government were at the time veiled in mystery, and we felt that, in justice to ourselves and to those whom we represented, we should do all that we could to get the information that we needed. I have never been a party to anything in the nature of laying a trap for a fellow senator, and none of those who voted with the majority on Friday last would do such a thing. We have no desire to place any member of the Senate in a false position, and we would be false to our trust if we tried to do so. We have made known our views regarding conscription. I have never hesitated to express my opposition to it, and I shall take every opportunity that presents itself to prevent this yoke from being fastened on the necks of the people. In the columns of the Melbourne daily newspapers lengthy and costly advertisements have been inserted, and if similar advertisements have appeared in all the leading newspapers of the Commonwealth, the taxpayers will have to pay a considerable sum for advertising. I wish to know, therefore, who is responsible for the errors made about the dates on which men are to be called up in different parts of the Commonwealth. It was stated that in some of the military areas, or constituencies, as they are better known, men were not to be called up until towards the end of November, although we had been told  that  men were needed as early as possible in October. </para>

                        <para>- In quite a number of the districts in the Melbourne metropolitan area. It has been stated in the newspapers that these errors, if they can be so called, were viewed seriously by the Defence Department. Who then, I ask, is responsible for them ? The Government and the military authorities have had ample time to make all their arrangements, and we should know who is to blame for these mistakes. We have been told that men are being called up for home defence, and that if the electors vote for conscription they will subsequently be sent overseas. According to the proclamation, if the electors do not vote for conscription, these men will be retained during the continuance of the war. I wish to know from the Minister whether it is intended, should the referendum be defeated, to keep these men in camp until the war is ended. If I am any judge, the electors will vote against the referendum by a large majority, and I think that, in that case, those who have been called up for home defence should again become free citizens. In the interval, they will be away from their usual spheres of activity, and it may be difficult for some of them to get back to the positions that they left. The regulations are interesting, if not informative. Regulation 11 says - </para>

                <para class="block">I want to point out that this gives an opportunity to almost every man called up to make an application for exemption from military service. It is provided that any person making an application to be exempted under the Defence Act, or under this regulation 35 which I have just read, is not to be called upon to perform any military duties until his application is dealt with. He makes his application in the first instance to the local exemption Court. He has an opportunity subsequently, if his application is not granted, to appeal to another Court, and finally to the High Court. It has to be borne in mind that the military authorities have the same power to appeal, where they believe an application has been improperly granted, and so I say that if these regulations are complied with, numbers of people claiming exemption will be free from the performance of military duties until probably many weeks have elapsed. I want to know who is to bear the expense of all these appeals. Are the persons concerned to bear all the expense incidental to this procedure? I suppose that, where the military authorities appeal against the granting of an exemption, the expense will be borne by the Government, and that the applicants for exemption will have to pay their own expenses if they consider it necessary to appeal. On Friday last we were told by the Minister for Defence that, in addition to these three tribunals for considering applications for exemption, there is to be a committee, com-1 posed of three or five gentlemen, whose names none of us know, and about whose responsibilities or powers we are quite in the dark, to be appointed to strengthen the hands of the Government from time to time in deciding what shall or shall not be considered exempt industries. We should be made aware of the <inline font-style="italic">personnel</inline> of the proposed committee, and also of the duties it is to be asked to perform. In to-day's newspapers I saw a statement to the effect that men engaged in the railway services would not be called up immediately, and that it was the intention to ask for a month's exemption in respect to some of the men engaged in State services. By whom is the application to be made ? No doubt there are to be starred, or exempt, industries, but we ought to know what they are. </para>

                        <para>- We have every right to ask what the Government have in mind in respect to these exempt industries. Those responsible in this State for the running of the tramways are, apparently, much concerned about their enterprise. I saw a statement to the effect that it was not their intention to employ women, because they consider the work of running the trams is not fitted for women. In the Old Country we know that women are performing various tasks, and are employed in many spheres of activity in which, they were not engaged prior to the outbreak of war. In the Old Country they have, and had prior to the war, what we have not here, and that is a surplus population. We have been spending large sums of money in Great Britain and in other parts of the world to induce people to come to Australia because of the opportunities offered to them here. In response to appeals and advertisements by the Commonwealth and State Governments, many women came to the Commonwealth, and their services were availed of by persons having employment for them as soon as they arrived here. If there was a desire to introduce female labour for some of the industries of Australia, I do not know whether women would be available to take up the work. Many of our industries involve work which is totally unfitted for them. No one would suggest that women should be engaged on our wharfs, or in driving railway engines. I have already said that the tramway people do not intend to employ women in the running of the trams. No one would suggest, I suppose, that the women of Australia, those physically strong women who live in our so-called better-class suburbs, with small families and big bank balances, however physically strong, would roll up " bluey," ''« waltz Matilda," and go shearing. Even if they were disposed to do so, there are not a great many of these women. No one will suggest that women will be available to do the ploughing and harvesting work of the country, or that they are physically fit to go deep into the bowels of the earth and carry on the mining industry. </para>

                        <para>- I am putting my case in my own way, and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> can do the same. I know that there are some who are extremely anxious that absolutely the last man should be sent out of Australia by conscription. The Statistician's figures show that if the war continues for ten or twelve months more, these people will get the last man. Then they will be happy, no doubt. But those honorable senators who are so extremely anxious to see the last man go out of Australia are not so very enthusiastic about the " last bob." The " last bob " is the last word they utter, and we are far from securing the "last bob" yet. If there is one thing about which I was " profoundly disappointed," to use the words of some of our new-found friends in another place, it was the Government's taxation proposals. Our new-found friends were not profoundly disappointed by the announcement in another place of the intention of the Government to tax certain forms of wealth. Their beaming countenances, when the announcement was made, proved to me that they considered they were having a day out. They expected that wealth would have been to a greater or lesser extent conscripted. But what are these financial proposals of the Government for securing the " last bob " ? It is proposed to tax - what? To tax amusements. If there is anything for which this party has stood, in season and out of season, it is that the great mass of the people should have more leisure, and some opportunity for the improvement of their minds; that they should have some mental pleasures which were denied them up to the advent of the Labour party. But to-day the Government propose, in order to help to finance this war, to tax the little kiddies who go to the picture shows at the rate of £d. for each 3d. ticket. What did the proprietors of some of the picture shows say recently? They said that the bulk of their audiences in the suburban areas are children. We know the joy which the children derive from attending these picture shows, which are educational and humorous. No grand opera is to me so cheering or inspiring as is the music of the laughter of the kiddies at the picture shows. What pleases them pleases me. This tax is to be imposed, not upon the proprietors controlling entertainments, because they say that they will pass on the tax. To whom will they pass it on but to the mass of the working classes? It is proposed, as a further help to finance the war, to increase the income tax by 25 per cent, on the amount people are paying to-day. By whom is this increase of taxation to be paid? In the commercial world to-day they are discussing this, and they say that they are not going to squeal because of the Government's proposals. Of course, they are not. They say things will right themselves, and this taxation will be passed on. </para>

According to the statement published in the commercial columns of the newspapers, the commercial people of this country have stated that the income and wealth taxes will be passed on, and that the last measure of taxation imposed by the Commonwealth was so passed on is shown by the announcement of the Government's intention to recover £3,000,000 from people who have been making undue profits during war time. </para>

                        <para>- I say they will pass on indirect taxation, but a tax on land values they would not be able to pass on. An impost on incomes is indirect taxation. Whilst it may be justified to a degree as a matter of expediency, in the main it is a tax on industry, effort, and enterprise; a tax on land values is not. Every form of wealth other than land is the creation of effort. But the land is there; you can neither add to, nor take away from, it. Land values are created by the community, and the increments should be returned to the community from time to time. There is not a man in the Labour movement today but came into it because of his advocacy of land-values taxation, but some of them now seem to be afraid of such taxation. We are on the wrong track altogether with our taxation; let us try to get back to the right track. When I see the Opposition joining hands with the Government to carry through these taxation measures, and eager to give a hand to the Government to fasten the yoke of conscription on the people of the Commonwealth, I ask myself where in Heaven are we drifting. In a recent editorial, the <inline font-style="italic">Argus</inline> - that "friend of the masses," that paper with one hundred eyes, above the editorial columns of which is the motto, "I am in the place where I am demanded of conscience to speak the truth, and therefore the truth I speak, impugn it whoso list" - it was stated, in the most heartless and cold-blooded manner, that the Government propose to increase the income tax by £1,000,000 a year, and that sum was to be made a free gift to the old-age and invalid pensioners, who are non-producers. In this Christian age, when the cost of living is abnormally high, this paper offers strenuous opposition to additional taxation because it will give an extra half-a-crown per week to an invalid man or woman who through total incapacitation are non-producers. </para>

                        <para>- The taxation proposals of the Government do not meet with my approbation, although they are supported by the Opposition. I know that this taxation is merely the first edition. Sometimes we read the first edition of a paper, knowing that there is to be a second, a third, a fourth, and a final edition. We may be only partially satisfied with this first edition of taxation, but there is some comfort in knowing that it is by no means the final edition. The fact stares us in the face, however, that the first edition will stay with us for a very long time, and the people of Australia will realize that to carry on the war successfully they have to p-&gt;y. </para>

                        <para>- I said the Germans were well "  stouched,"  and that the end of the war was within measurable distance. I admit that I am alone in that prediction, but I have stood alone in my views many times, and the event has proved me right in regard to many of them. I said that Germany was beaten, and that statement was accepted literally by those who wished to make capital out of it. I have attended football matches, and long before half-time some of the spectators have left the ground, and when asked why, have said, " The game is only in the second quarter, but the blacks are beaten." I have been on the Flemington race-course, and have occasionally staked a shilling or two on a quadruped which I thought to be more fleet than any other in the race, but after the first furlong a friend has said to me, " You have lost your money," and although only 1 furlong out of 16 had been run, I knew that my horse was beaten. I have the same conviction in regard to the war. Germany is well beaten, and the end of the war is within measurable distance. But there are some who think that, unless we conscript the single men in Australia - one of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes'</inline> little jokes is his statement that he does not think it will be necessary to extend conscription to married men - defeat will overwhelm us. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> says that the single men only are necessary to bring victory to the Allies, to save Australia for all time, and prevent the British Empire from crumbling. I give way to no man in my admiration of the Australian for intelligence, resourcefulness, courage, and determination. He is as good as the best, if not better than some of the best. But if any one tries to " kid " me, to use a colloquialism, that 50,000 single men are going to " wallop " our foes, and that without their assistance the earth is doomed, and damned, and civilization is blasted, I say that person is talking so much "piffle." The advocates of conscription discover now that the people of Australia realize that such statements will not bear examination. If the people really .believed them, possibly every Australian would alter his views accordingly; but the Australian people do not believe anything of the kind. I say that the enemy is beaten. </para>

                        <para>- The enemy is beaten to-day. I stand by the authorities I have quoted. The recent statement by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lloyd</inline> George shows that there is no possible shadow of doubt as to the ultimate success of the Allies. So the contention of the conscriptionists that, unless we compel these few thousand single men in Australia to serve abroad, the Commonwealth will be a prize of the enemy does not hold water. My affection for this land of my birth is as deep-rooted as that of any man, and it is because of that affection that I have fears, not of the enemy of to-day, but of what may be in store for us in the future. Therefore, I urge the people of Australia to hesitate before they allow every available man to be taken out of the Commonwealth. Australia ought to be a land where every citizen need fear no foe, where there should be no nightmares about invasion. If I were a dictator in this land, I would so fortify it that we should have no fears of foreign aggression. I was one of the first men in the Commonwealth to point out the possibilities of aerial defence, and I said years ago that excursions through the sky would be as frequent as motor car trips through the country were at that time. That was twelve years ago, and there were men, some belonging to my own party, who said that I was a dreamer. I have lived to see the day when, according to a published statement by an aviator, there are more flying machines in Great Britain than there are motor cars. I know that past Administrations have given no encouragement to the establishment of an aviation school in the Commonwealth. The Minister for Defence will bear me out in that. Whatever differences I may have with the present Government in regard to the question of conscription, I give them full credit for having helped on a scheme in which I whole-heartedly believe - the establishment of an aviation school and the building of aeroplanes. I am strongly in favour of constructing aeroplanes by the thousand, and also of building a 'fleet of dirigibles. This means of defence, if we were to go in for it whole-heartedly and systematically, would secure us for all time against an invasion. A fleet of flying machines and dirigibles would not resemble our Navy of to-day, which is non-producing; they could be utilized for the conveyance of passengers and mails in different parts of Australia. Only the other day I read in an American newspaper that tenders were being called for the carriage of mails by air fleets, because it was held that by this means the mails could be delivered more expeditiously and economically than by existing methods. I dare say that in some parts of the United States of America mails are now being carried by flying machines. I am glad to see that some of the States of the Commonwealth are taking up this question enthusiastically. In Ballarat an aviation school has been established, and quite a number of men are qualifying as aviators. </para>

                        <para>- And come down safely, too. I am satisfied that, ere long, these machines will be so automatically stabilized that a person will have no more hesitation in travelling by them than he has in travelling by the Sydney express. Experience has taught us that many of our fears are based upon superstition. We have only to carry our minds back a little more than a century - to the time when it was proposed to construct the first railway in Great Britain - in order to realize this. When that railway was projected, it was proposed that trains should travel upon it at a speed of 10 miles an hour. What was the result? Members of the British Parliament rose and denounced what they declared to be an insane and preposterous idea. One member of the House of Commons said that any person who would risk his life in a train travelling at such a speed was fit only for a lunatic asylum. Another affirmed that the smoke from the engines would injure the wool on the sheep's backs. A third said that passengers who would risk their lives in travelling through the tunnels would contract consumption, catarrh, and kindred ailments, and, as a result, the hospitals would be full. Others declared that the whizz and the whirr from these terrible machines would drive "the people off their  mental balance, so that the lunatic asylums would not be large enough to hold them. So strong was the opposition to the building of a railway station near the city that ultimately it was erected 5 miles distant. All this goes to show the progress that the world has made, and is making. </para>

                <para>I have no fears in regard to the outcome, of the present war. I am strengthened in my opinion that absolute victory is within measurable distance by the statements of some of the best authorities who are engaged in it. It is because of my belief that I wish to see preparations made now for the future defence of Australia. Any man who can lightly view the possibilities of an invasion of this country must be blind to passing events. </para>

But the future of this country is in our keeping, and it is our duty to look at the matter seriously, and to see that we do not denude the Commonwealth of its manhood, and thus prevent the possibility of our providing the money that is necessary to build up a scheme of defence which will make us absolutely secure in the event of a threatened invasion. If I were a dictator, aeroplanes in Australia would be as numerous as swarms of bees, so that if an invader attempted to set his foot upon our shores we could annihilate his battleships and decimate his forces. </para>

                        <para>- My honorable friend is not an enthusiastic airman, although he went up in an aeroplane once. When he was Minister for Defence he was never favorably disposed  towards the establishment of an aviation school. It is an indisputable fact that on the western front to-day our successes are largely due to our mastery of the air. That such mastery is all -important is demonstrated by the circumstance that Great Britain is already making preparations in the building of air fleets, for another war. Only in to-day's paper the statement is made that, if she possessed sufficient machines, they could travel to Germany in the day-time and annihilate Krupp's works. </para>

                        <para>- There is no doubt of it. The future defence of Australia is in the air and under the water. That was my prophecy a few years ago. I say that we should build additional submarines, together with thousands of aeroplanes, and a fleet of dirigibles ; that we should undertake the construction of strategic railways ; and that we should unify our railway gauges. </para>

                <para>Australians have done remarkably well during this war, and we should hesitate before we make applicable to them that which they went out to kill, namely, conscription. Let no man or woman delude himself or herself with the idea that conscription, if once it is fastened upon this continent, will disappear when the war is over. Once the electors of the Commonwealth vote " Yos " to conscription it will remain with us for all time. The referendum upon which the people will vote is as to whether they will give the Government the same power to call up men for service overseas as they already possess to call them up for home defence. In other words, if the referendum be carried, everybody between the ages of eighteen and sixty years can be conscripted. I am aware that many persons who are past military age feel earnestly upon this question, and fear that unless conscription be adopted we may lose our heritage. They may be grandfathers or grandmothers, and consequently may be inclined to vote " Yes " on the 28th October. But they ought to remember that if they do vote " Yes " their grandchildren of to-day will be the conscript soldiers of to-morrow. When once the door to conscription has been opened - and especially when it has been opened by a Labour Government - it will be kept open by all future Administrations. The Minister for Defence has said that the voluntary system has failed, and must fail, in all big wars. That is a very significant statement to make. Although Australia's contribution to the war has been a noble one, he says that the voluntary system has failed. That means, if it means anything, that the only way in which we can prevent failure in this and in all future wars is for Australia to have a conscript array. Personally, I am not in favour of that. I know that the nationalization of human life is merely a stepping-stone to the conscription of labour for industrial purposes. That has been the case in the Old Country, and it is because I see the dangers arising from the nationalization of life, and realize that it will be followed by the nationalization of labour, that I hope the people will turn it down. The advocates of conscription believe in the nationalization of human life, but the nationalization of monopolies is to them anathema. They do not believe in the referendum as an instrument, but on this occasion, when it is to be applied to the most serious and most sacred of questions, they are whole-heartedly in favour of it. Were they in favour of the referendum a little while back when it was proposed to alter the Constitution ? They then said that to have a referendum in time of war would create party strife and bitterness, and would disfranchise the soldiers at the front. It was pointed out to them that provision could be made for the soldiers to vote, but they urged that that could not be done. However, as I say, when it is a question of a referendum to conscript human life they say that the vote can be taken, and must be taken. We were also told that a referendum on that occasion would put the people of Australia into two hostile camps. Is this referendum not likely to put the people into two hostile camps? Shortly after <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes'</inline> return to Australia the principal daily newspapers of the various States, and their yapping echoes throughout the Commonwealth, airily assumed that the people were eagerly and anxiously awaiting the application of conscription, and that only an infinitesimal number were opposed to that policy. These newspapers urged that conscription is a democratic principle, and on that ground the <inline font-style="italic">Argus</inline> advocated it. Of course, we all know that the <inline font-style="italic">Argus</inline> is essentially a democratic newspaper, and representative of the workers ! We also know that the <inline font-style="italic">Argus</inline> maintains that some citizens should have only one vote, while others should have more than one, because they have more ' ' stake in the country !

Efforts have been made to belittle the Trades and. Labour Councils of Australia, but I know that without those institutions the pathway of many industrial workers would not be so easy as it is to-day. I know the conditions that obtained here three decades ago. Our Labour movement first saw the light mainly because of militarism. I remember, less than thirty years ago, a meeting held on Yarra-bank, while within a building not far removed were the military, who had been specially called out. A famous historical address that will live to the end of time was delivered by a gentleman who has now gone the way of all flesh. He told the soldiers in lurid language what they had to do when the order was given, but I think that if I were to repeat that language I should be ruled out of order. </para>

                        <para>- Well, I shall  " chance it." These were the words that man was reported to have uttered : "If you see your father, your mother, your sister, or your brother, in front of you, and an order is given to fire, fire low and lay the adjectives out. Give the adjectives an ounce of lead in the guts, so that the dose will not need to be re-  peated." That was the address delivered to the troops that were assembled in the morgue at that time; and from that day of the maritime strike we have seen the growth of the great Labour movement. Men, like myself, have seen obstacles overcome that appeared at the time insurmountable. As I have said, militarism was largely responsible for the birth of our movement; and if there is any strength to-day in it - and I feel that it is just as strong and steadfast as then - there is no fear of militarism, as we understand it, in the shape of conscription. I shall have other opportunities of furthering the anti-conscription movement in this State. I believe that if a vote were taken to-day in Victoria the policy would be rejected by a very large majority. I cannot speak for other States, but when <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> said today that his voice was the voice of the West, I could not help thinking that his voice was north, south, east, and west. </para>

                        <para>- I know that a meeting can be got up in favour of conscription - it would be a very poor cause on which there are not two opinions - and the probability is that before many days there will be a meeting at Fremantle against conscription. There is no doubt that the meeting in the Melbourne Town Hall was enthusiastically in favour of the policy. </para>

                        <para>- A number of people were privileged to go into that meeting; they had passports, and passports are very handy things to have when conscription meetings are held. We, on the other hand, have no privileges and no passports; but we had a meeting at the Exhibition building, in Melbourne, much larger than the Town Hall meeting, and there was also a large meeting on the Yarra-bank on Sunday afternoon. </para>

                        <para>- That was in Fremantle or Perth. It is not many weeks ago since a number of anticonscriptionists, who held a meeting on Yarra-bank, were threatened with a ducking in the river, and had to be escorted into safety by policemen. Then, again, in Sydney yesterday, we are told that while a procession of conscriptionists, with a band of music and carrying banners and bannerettes, was allowed to pass unmolested, a procession of anti-conscriptionists later in the day - a procession on its way to MacDonnell House, erected by workers - was intercepted by returned soldiers, had their banners and bannerettes broken, and suffered other maltreatment. I must say, in justice to the Minister for Defence, that when his attention was called to what had occurred on Yarra-bank, other arrangements were made, and nothing  of the kind has occurred since. We can only hope that nothing of the kind will occur again. </para>

We give credit for sincerity to those who advocate conscription, though we believe them to be off the right track. We regard conscription as a vicious principle, and we believe that, once it is approved, it means conscription for all time for overseas service. I believe that the people of the Commonwealth will turn it down on the 28th of October. </para>

                        <para>- I have no doubt that when <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> made that statement he believed he was speaking strictly in accordance with facts, because he is prepared at all times to express his opinion; but for the information of honorable senators who may be misled by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen's</inline> remarks, I desire to state that the two bodies are distinct from each other, and, generally speaking, are violently antagonistic. The body known as the industrial section of New South Wales is comprised of delegates elected by the various trade societies, chiefly in the metropolis, but some of them outside the metropolitan area, and they meet as a distinct body and quite apart from any other organization, to decide on the legislation which, in their opinion, should be passed to meet their requirements. The Industrial Workers of the World, as they are known, do not meet with that section at all. I suppose at the present time the industrial section comprises quite 150 delegates, elected by the various unions throughout the city. It will be seen, therefore, that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen's</inline> statement has no foundation in fact. The honorable senator very pertinently asked : What alternative scheme is submitted by those who oppose conscription ? Well, I want the Senate to consider the scheme put forward by the Government. </para>

                        <para>- The Government, we are told, want 32,500 men this month and 16,500 men for every succeeding month. In three months' time that scheme will empty Australia of every eligible single man; I challenge contradiction of that statement. Apparently, the Government want us to believe that this enormous draft of men is required in three months to supply the gaps caused by the casualties. But what are the figures? For a time we had 20,000 men at the front. Later on we offered 30,000 more, and still later on another 50,000, or a total of 100,000 men, and in the course of two years they have suffered casualties amounting, in round figures, to 60,000 men killed, wounded, or missing.  The Prime Minister and the Government would like the people of Australia to believe that we must have the number asked for in the ranks inside of three months; but that is a demand which cannot for a moment be entertained on the figures. We have enlisted, under the voluntary system, all the men who are at the front, and I say without fear of contradiction - I challenge the Minister for Defence to disprove the statement - that the Australians are prepared to continue to supply at least 6,000 men every month under the voluntary system. That number is more than sufficient for requirements. </para>

                        <para>- I believe the enlistments from, the 1st J  January  to the present time have considerably exceeded 6,000 men per month, and that number, I repeat, is more than sufficient to provide for the casualties suffered during the two years up to date. No question ever submitted to the people of this country will cause such a division of opinion as this referendum. Men who are themselves too old to go to the front, and women also, should hesitate before they vote to send any young man to the firing line, and possibly to his death. I am confident that if we had a system under which every man from twenty-one to sixty years of age was summoned to the colours, and if we picked the men by ballot, irrespective of age, a considerable number of those who are now enthusiastic conscriptionists would probably modify their attitude on this question. </para>

                        <para>- I have no objection to organization at all, but I say that, up to the present, Australia has done very well, and would still do well under the voluntary system. Why should Australia be called upon to send away all her young eligible men when Canada, or South Africa are not doing the same? Indeed, I doubt very much if Great Britain herself is doing so much. There is no justification for Australia to be forced to adopt this course so long as we can find 6,000 men per month to meet requirements. It is interesting to observe all the exemptions provided for under the proclamation. In addition to the exemptions mentioned in the Defence Act, young men engaged on works of national importance, or training for such work, are not to be asked to go into the firing line; and that exemptions will, also be authorized in cases of exceptional domestic or financial obligation, as also in cases where single men are the sole support of widowed mothers, aged parents, or of orphans, while remaining sons where half the family have already gone to the front will not be expected to enlist. In the face of all these exemptions, I want to know who will go. Does it not appear that, after all, it will be the unskilled labourers engaged on railways and works of that kind? These undertakings are not regarded as national works by many enthusiastic conscription advocates, who, if they had their way, would close them down, thus bringing about the dismissal of the men. This has been done many times in the history of Great Britain during war time, in order to compel such men to enlist because they were hungry. It has been questioned whether the workers of Australia are against conscription. There is not the slightest doubt about their attitude. They are in deadly opposition to  conscription, and not because large numbers have not gone, because the records show that a very substantial number of them have enlisted. On every occasion where the organized workers have had an opportunity of dealing with this question, they have expressed their determined opposition to it. Bodies like the Sydney Labour Council, after having been addressed by the Prime Minister, resolved, by 116 to 60 votes, not to have anything to do with it. Other bodies, like the New South Wales Coal and Shale Employees Union, the Railway Workers Union, the Amalgamated Railways and Tramways Union, and the Australian Workers Union, have all declared their undying hostility to conscription. This is typical of the attitude of unionism in New South Wales, and also of the organized workers of Queensland, Victoria, and elsewhere throughout the Commonwealth. I do not object very much to the action taken by those honorable senators who were responsible for our being brought back to-day to review the position. I should not mind even if we were called upon to sit here continuously for a few days and nights to discuss this question, for I know of no subject of more importance that has been submitted to the Senate. When I received a message requesting me to return here to-day, I had already completed arrangements to address, under the direction of our executive, at least a dozen meetings in various parts of New South Wales. Whilst I am opposed to conscription, I believe that the question is one on which the electors should have an opportunity to express their opinions. I am glad that the responsibility of recording a direct vote upon the question of conscription has not been thrown upon me. The Prime Minister proposed to the party that the question should be submitted to the electors, and our party by a majority agreed to the adoption of that course. </para>

                            GOULD (New South Wales) [9.48].- Having regard to the debates that have already taken place upon this question, I do not think that much remains to be said on the present occasion. No one is anxious that our country should fall, and I am sure that no honorable senator would favour conscription unless it was absolutely necessary. There are honorable senators who have repeatedly expressed their opposition to the principle, but who to-day are voting for the reference of the question to the people, and will urge them to accept it because they recognise that something more than the voluntary system has become absolutely necessary. If the voluntary system had not failed to provide the requisite numbers, I am sure we should not have heard one word in regard to conscription.

We are at death grips with a nation that we profess to regard as worse than barbarians. We express abhorrence of the atrocities committed by that nation whose armies have destroyed the whole population of villages and towns in Belgium, France, and Servia. They have practically destroyed Servia and Belgium, and are now trying to do the same with Roumania because the people of that country  have elected to join the Allies in the fight for freedom and justice. And yet we are asked by the anti-conscriptionists to say, " We have done enough.

In the same breath, these men demand that when we come to the consideration of peace terms Australia shall be consulted. If Australia desires to be consulted, she must be prepared to do her share of the work yet to be done at the front. </para>

                        <para>- I believe she will be. I believe that the heart of Australia will beat as true as the hearts of Great Britain and her Allies. We are glad of the declaration made a day or two ago by Lloyd George that, " We are going to fight this through to the bitter end." Germany, at the outset of the war, boasted that she would bring the Empire under the iron heel of the Prussian oppressor ; but- now that Britain and her Allies have prepared themselves to see the thing through, peace kites are being flown. We should be worse than poltroons and cowards if we were to adopt any other attitude than that voiced by Lloyd George. If the people of Australia are not misled as to the true position, and yet decide, on the 28th instant, against conscription, we shall be branded for all time in the eyes of the world as a nation of cowards and braggarts. The Labour party, at the last general election, declared that, if returned to power, they would help to carry the war to a fitting conclusion. They asserted that Great Britain would find Australia, under a Labour Government, prepared with men and money to fight to the bitter end. Is that promise to be carried out, or are those who are now speaking against conscription going to use their power and influence successfully to  destroy  the reputation and honour of Australia ? In the early days of the war, we heard much of the iniquity of the nation that was prepared to disregard what was described as " a scrap of paper." Are we to have no regard for our own honour ? Are we to forget our promise to our cousins overseas that we should be with them to the last ditch ? We are proud to belong to the British Empire, and as part of that Empire we must be prepared to recognise that rights involve responsibilities, and that our duty must be shouldered. It is difficult to understand how any one can oppose this proposition. If the voluntary system had not proved insufficient, tha position would be different; but in the last extremity we are driven to conscription. We believe that defeat is impossible. Over and over again we are told that the war is going in our favour, and we believe that it is. But it is not yet won. The Germans are still in Prance. Belgium is still under the heel of the German oppressor. The war has not yet been carried into the enemy's own country. It is up to us, therefore, to do our very best to assist the Mother Country and her Allies to push whatever advantage they have gained. Let us do our best to end the war as soon as possible. When men are fighting hard, and supports are slow in coming up, they are apt to become a little weary. They may, in the end, be successful, but at what a cost. And so with the nation. We may be successful in the end, but unless every part of the Empire does its share, at what a cost will victory be achieved. We do not want the war to drag on. The sooner it is over the better for every man, woman, and child in the Empire. But if we are going to disregard every principle of honour, then God help Australia! Unless the people be misled, there need be no fear as to the result of this referendum. The danger is, however, that they may be deceived bv the talk in which some people are indulging as to this being but the thin edge of the wedge for the conscription of labour and the loss of freedom. It would be deplorable from the point of view of the best interests of the Commonwealth if the people were so misled. Let them once understand the exact position; let them realize that, owing to the wastage of war, a certain number of reinforcements must be sent month after month in order to maintain our present strength at the front, and I am confident they will not turn their backs on what has been done. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Grant</inline> has said that there is not a union in Australia which has not sent its contingent of men to the front. Are there not thousands of unionists still in Australia who are prepared to back up their comrades? Is it to be said that we have not still in Australia thousands of men of the same courage and determination as have been displayed by the men of Anzac ? They have shown what Australians can do, and we desire to let the rest of the world see that we have still many more men of the same grit and courage who are prepared to fight in the cause of freedom. </para>

                <para class="block">Surely the people are not to be led to believe that they may safely follow their ordinary trades and occupations under the most comfortable conditions of life in Australia unless they are prepared to take still another step to make secure our rights and privileges. Those who declare their opposition to conscription should realize that the time has come when we must resort to that system in order to put an end to the system, of Prussianism which they so abhor. The Government ask only for the same powers to send troops oversea as they have now to call up the citizens in the case of invasion, and only during the course of the war. How can any honorable man ask people to believe that once the Government are given the power for an emergency like the present, they will have it for all time, and injure Australia in every direction? The people in Great Britain, who dislike conscription and war quite as much as any man here does, had the situation brought home to them by sending some of their representatives te the trenches to see what war was like, and by reports of atrocities committed. Their objections then disappeared, and Great Britain to-day, with the enormous number of men who have consented to conscription, stands pre-eminent as a nation that has risen to the occasion, not from any desire to fight for mere fighting sake, but to bring to a successful issue the mission on which it set out. That mission means freedom to other countries, the maintenance of England's own freedom, and possibly even the granting of freedom to residents of various parts of Germany who are now under the iron heel of Prussian militarism. The justice of ' the case seems so abundant that I quite fail to understand the position taken up by these who take the opposite view. I believe all the anti-conscriptionists are anxious that Great Britain should win the war; but if they can suggest no other means than those put forward by the Government, what are they to do? Our desire for peace or objection to conscription will not help us one jot or tittle in dealing with the enemy we are called upon to face. Democracy, with its rights and privileges, carries with it obligations and responsibilities. If we want to be free, we must strike for freedom when freedom is threatened, and strike with the </para>
                <para class="block">Weapon that will he most effective. The question of calling up all the manhood of a nation is not novel. It dates back thousands of years, when men were called upon to fight to maintain the integrity of their nation. It is so to-day, and will be so for all time. I fear the day is far distant when battles will be determined by mere speeches, no matter how eloquent. If honorable senators who are opposed to conscription, and those in favour of it, will confine themselves strictly within such lines that there can be no doubt about the correctness of their statements, this issue can he fairly fought. I have never been a supporter of the present Administration as an Administration; but when <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> went to England he had an opportunity to make himself thoroughly acquainted with the needs and necessities of the hour. I am certain that when he went away he never thought Australia would be faced with the question with which it has to deal to-day; but he is a man of considerable ability and astuteness, and is not likely to have been led into a mistake on this very grave question, of which he has made so particular a study. If honorable senators opposite have any confidence in him, they must believe that he had good reasons for taking up his present attitude. </para>

When new circumstances are brought to our knowledge, placing the position in a different light, it is our duty, as sensible men, to accept the facts, and see what can be done to meet them. I can see nothing for it but to accept conscription as proposed. If there was any alternative course, I should be perfectly willing to take it, because I have no brief for conscription or war, but I have a brief to maintain the integrity, dignity, and honour of Australia. In assisting to maintain that, I am assisting to maintain the honour and dignity of the British Empire, to which we, as Australians, owe so much ' of our happiness, prosperity, and freedom from danger. </para>

                        <para>- They have been fighting with the capitalists so earnestly and determinedly that they have obtained many things that perhaps otherwise would not have been granted. I will give the honorable senator all that, if he likes; but those workers ought to be prepared, if necessary, to fight for the integrity of the Empire. They ought not to halt, or attempt to draw back from the mission to which they are called. Every citizen must go to the front, and risk his life and his property, when the emergency demands it. It is nonsense to talk of each individual being able to hold his life in his own hands, and not being liable to serve his nation to maintain its dignity and freedom. I believe in the old principle that a man's life belongs to the State where that is necessary. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Grant</inline> took <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> to task for saying that the Industrial Workers of the World and the industrialists were one and the same body, but what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> distinctly said was that at certain meetings places were allotted to the Industrial Workers of the World as well as to many of the Labour organizations, showing that there had been a scheme of co-operation and organization to make the affair a success.

                            GOULD. - The trouble is Chat there is a noisy crowd of anti-conscriptionists there who will not listen to the advocates of conscription. One of the curses of this country is the intolerance and impatience shown by the crowd towards people who do not hold exactly the same views.

                        <para>- -If the honorable senator could get a little property, he would hold it the same as does any one else. He said that he had put his money into the war loan, so that he actually has some of that sacred property that he decries. I know what his answer would be if I offered to take his property from him, and risk all the opprobrium that it would bring with it. On the broad general question, if Australia does its duty on the 28th, as I believe it will, when the people realize the importance of the position, there will be no need to fear that the nation will stand branded as poltroons, cowardly, or braggart. Australia will not say that now we have gone so far we must withdraw our hand from the plough, and suffer a stain on our escutcheon which will take many years to wipe off. </para>

                        <para>- I remember <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Fisher's</inline> phrase, and, after all, it is only a phrase, like "equality of sacrifice," a thing which is absolutely impossible. If any man had advocated conscription for service abroad at the last election, he would not have seen the inside of Parliament House. I believe I know what was the feeling of the people at that time. As I have always been opposed to conscription, I feel perfectly justified in laying my views on the subject before the electors, just as much as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gould</inline> is. I have no objection to his putting his views before the public. All that those who are opposed to conscription are asking for is a fair deal and the right to be heard, and that the newspapers shall be allowed to publish our speeches,  if necessary. Apparently, no news is being published now of what is actually taking place. I have heard to-night, for the first time, of large meetings being held in various parts of Australia against conscription. These are not reported in the newspapers, and what we heard to-night were apparently private telegrams. </para>

                        <para>- They are faithfully reported. I do not know whether there is a conspiracy among the newspapers to suppress everything that they do not wish to have published; but it is apparent that those who are opposed to conscription are not going to get a fair deal in regard to having their views spread abroad. The honorable senator glared at me to-night when I interjected. He has taken up the <inline font-style="italic">role</inline> of Mother Shipton. He was prophesying as to all things that were going to happen during the next hundred years, and then he told us that they were going to happen in a military sense. He said that he had been to the races, and when the horse he had backed had run a short distance, he was told, " You have done your money in," and he was perfectly satisfied. If his prophecies are not better than his tips, I do not think that we need be very much afraid that they will come true. Certainly there will be advancements in all classes of machinery. Everybody looks forward to it. No one is surprised when science enables the people to get from one point to another more quickly. We are all looking forward to the time when distance will be further- annihilated, and the world from that point of view made smaller. I am sorry that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> had to leave the chamber. One does not care about saying anything in reference to the remarks of an honorable senator who is absent, but what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> has said can be read in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard,</inline> and if a previous engagement, or any other cause, induced him to go away from Melbourne, that is no reason why any one who remains here should not reply to what he has said. The speech of the honorable senator was a very amusing episode. The honorable senator claimed that I was laughing. I was not the only one laughing. Most honorable senators were enjoying themselves. I have been to some entertainments in Melbourne, and laughed, but I have never laughed so heartily as I did at the antics of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> when he was telling us all the little tales he was unfolding in regard to senators, and those opposed to the doctrine he supports. It is a good thing when one meets a person who can amuse an audience. I remember a reception that the people of Kalgoorlie gave, some years ago, to visitors from the eastern States. It was a large meeting, and the Mayor of Kalgoorlie, in introducing <inline font-weight="bold">Sir George</inline> Reid, who was the man of the hour, finished up his eulogistic remarks by saying that he felt that <inline font-weight="bold">Sir George</inline> Reid would say something that would amuse the people. I have heard some very crisp and caustic remarks made in regard to persons, but I have never heard a man get the dressing down that <inline font-weight="bold">Sir George</inline> Reid administered to the Mayor of Kalgoorlie on that occasion. He described him in every conceivable way, and wound up by saying that he was the funniest thing he had seen for quite a long time. Then he pointed out that any one who possessed the faculty of being able to amuse others should certainly use it at every opportunity. If he was able to amuse a crowd, he thought that it was the best thing he could do, because people enjoyed life more than anything else. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> stood in that <inline font-style="italic">role</inline> to-day; not that he was not in deadly earnest - I believe he was - but some of the statements he made were quite over the odds. He first said that he had no intention of indulging in personalities j he would not dream of doing so; he. simply wished to deal with ' the question as he understood it, but he finished by dragging in <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ferricks, Mr. Anstey,</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley,</inline> and telling us what abominable hypocrites they were. In fact, any one opposed to the ideas he holds is regarded by him as an abominable hypocrite. When I rise, without intending to indulge in personalities, I omit them, and I do not get worked up to a tearing passion and abuse every one within the sound of my voice who does not agree with me. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> did not carry out the intention with which he started. He proceeded to tell us that he had made an ' arrangement to go through Australia. What was the agreement, and with whom was it made? If it was an arrangement with any honorable senator I know nothing of it. If it was an arrangement made with the Government it was not an arrangement with members of this House, and I therefore take exception to the public being led to believe that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch,</inline> or any other person, had an arrangement with members of this Senate which honorable senators, by a breach of their agreement, had caused him to break. There was no such agreement with honorable senators, and we, therefore, committed no breach of agreement, as the honorable senator would lead the public to believe. He seems to have the idea that there is no one in the Labour movement to-day except those who are able to see eye to eye with him. " I have been twenty-seven years in this movement," he said. Many members of this Parliament have been in the Labour movement longer, but that does not enable them to do more effective work than men who have recently joined it. A man who has joined the </para>

                <para class="block">Labour movement quite recently and is able to do good work for it is just as welcome in its ranks as those who have been in it longer. Even if a man is getting o.'d he is entitled to no kudos for having been straight for so long. The honorable senator cannot claim that because he has been in the movement for so many years - I have been in it longer than <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> - he should be able to carry more weight than those who are new-comers to it and honestly support its principles. I do not wish to say what the chance of the conscriptionists will be in Western Australia. I do not know what they will be. I cannot say what chance they will have in Victoria. I do not know what their chance will be in Queensland, though I take it as very significant that the newspaper that has been boosting conscription for the last few months is informing the people of that State that if conscription is not to be carried there the rest of Australia will carry it. That statement seems to be a good indication that Queensland will vote against conscription. I might, I believe, prophesy a considerable majority against it, because at the time of the last election the Labour party was totally opposed to conscription being imposed for service abroad. But I am not foolish enough to say that Western Australia may not carry the proposal. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch's</inline> remark that he comes from the " premier State of Australia " seems to me to be nonsense. The honorable senator says that it is the only State where they "do things." They " do things " in some of the other States. I do not know that Western Australia even has a Labour Government. I believe that it is the only State outside Victoria that does not possess preference to unionists. That principle has been wiped out, and the workers in Western Australia have to abide by that decision whether they like it or not. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> says that " they are trying experiments in Western Australia." They are doing the same in almost every State of the Commonwealth. Queensland has tried various experiments. Many of them have been successful. In the matter of public money put into works on behalf of the people of the State, Queensland is equal, if not considerably superior, to the State which the honorable senator calls the " premier State of the Commonwealth." This gibing by one State of another adds no dignity to our debates, and is not likely to create a good feeling among members of the Senate or people engaged in the Labour movement. \Ve are told by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> that men have been gagged and expelled from the Labour movement. It is true that at one time or another quite a large number of men have been expelled from it. In Queensland we have had to deal with a number of men in that way, because it was believed that they had acted contrary to the avowed principles of the movement. Two leaders of the party had to be passed out because they thought they were able to get on better with those people to whom we were always opposed. Coalitions and many such things took place. This is not the first case of expulsion from the Labour movement. The honorable senator says that" there is no freedom in connexion with it. On the contrary, there has been more freedom in connexion with it than in any connexion with any other brand of politics we have so far had in Australia. On a question like this I do not propose to go on the platform and defame people. I realize that the matter of compulsory military service was not definitely on the Labour platform at the time that the Senate was elected ; every one knows that. But if there had been any doubt in the minds of those who drew up the platform it would have been there, even if it had to be printed in big letters, and I do not think that there is one member of the party who would not have put his name to it had it been there at the time that he was returned to this Parliament. I further believe that not one of these men, had he subscribed such a plank, would have gone back on it. I am opposed to the policy of the Government, and as soon as I get the opportunity I shall tell the people so from the public platform. </para>

                <para class="block">Townsville may know something of such an insect, but <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> may have been referring to what is known as the Scots Grey. Years ago I helped to put up many a good fight in the Queensland Parliament, and could do my share now as well as any other honorable senator if it were necessary. I do not think it is necessary. It seems to me that when the numbers were against us, all we could do in regard to the Referendum Bill was to enter our protest against it, stating our reasons, and voting against it on every opportunity. Having done our best, we must be content to go before the people, and, stating our views, ask them to indorse our action. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> stated that extravagant language had done a great deal to help the Labour movement. He instanced statements made by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Walpole</inline> and others derogatory of those connected with the movement. But he, in his turn, made extravagant charges against those who cannot at present see eye to eye with him. I do not abuse him because I am opposed to him on this question. I , give him credit for sincerity in an attitude which he says he took up long ago. I never dreamt that any of us would live to see the day when this Parliament would be asked to vote for conscription. The honorable senator says that there should be but one party in Australia now. But less than two years ago the Labour party turned down that proposal, and it was one of the best things that it ever did. The honorable senator asked us to look at Great Britain, There they have a Coalition Government. But was not one of the causes of the success of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> in Great Britain, the fact that there was a Coalition Government in power which the press had been vainly trying to induce to do certain things it believed to be necessary ? When it was found that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> was on their side, the influence of powerful organs like the <inline font-style="italic">Times</inline> and others was put behind him, and enabled him to make a name such as no other public man coming from the Dominions had ever before made. Can it be said that the British Coalition Government, a coalition of opposing and conflicting interests, whose representatives are by no means happy together, is one party? By using <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes,</inline> the newspapers were able to compel the British Government to do things which for months they had been unable to make them do. Who doubts that, later, the present coalition will fall asunder, and there will be harder fighting between political parties than ever before? <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> told us that there is only one ,party in Prance to-day. That is so. France has had conscription for many a year, and practically every one of its citizens has been sent to the front. We hear of its members of Parliament taking part in the fighting, being called together only when it becomes necessary to vote supplies for the war, the administration of public affairs being intrusted wholly to the Government. Are the people of Australia prepared to leave everything to this Government without parliamentary check ? I do not think so, and many members of this Parliament would not be satisfied with such an arrangement for five minutes. We have seen too much of the administration of this Government, even though St is the administration of a Labour Government. A good deal of soreness has been caused by it. I ask <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie</inline> whether the men who were conscripted by the Navy Office, and made to work under conditions differing from those which prevail in the coastal trade, were not sore? We shall be told that nothing of the kind will happen again. Let us hope that it will not happen again. But I am disinclined to put unlimited power into the hands of any body of men, because abuse, is likely to follow sooner or later. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> asked us to look at Italy. That country is much in the position of France; everything being left to the Administration, and Parliament being called together only to vote supplies. He asked us to look at Belgium. There, the affairs of the country are administered almost wholly by the soldiers who have overrun it. We look forward to the time when they will be driven out, and it will be possible to re-establish a Belgian Parliament for the conduct of affairs. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> referred us to Washington; but in his time the United States of America were practically under the colonial government of Great Britain, and there was no opportunity, under the conditions then existing, for a number of political parties. Were there many different parties in Australia when we had the same system of colonial government? That was the system practically in operation in the United States of America in </para>
                <para class="block">Washington's time. The legislators -were mostly nominees. There were practically none elected, and how could there be political parties under such conditions ? Then the honorable senator referred us to Lincoln. I ask whether there were not political parties in Lincoln's time? Any one who has read the history of the United States of America at that time knows that there were not one or two, but at least half-a-dozen, different parties, each battling to get ite own way. It was only because of the tremendous power which the American Constitution vested in the  President  of the United States of America that Lincoln was able to withstand the assaults made upon him by the various parties and cliques in his time. Of what use is it for <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> to tell people who, like himself, have read the history of the United States of America that the condition of affairs in that country at that time was as he has stated it? There were parties in the United States of America at that time led by men whom Lincoln had himself placed in responsible positions only a little time before. They went back upon him and exerted all the influence they could to put him out of his position. It was only his enormous power as  President  that enabled him to brush aside all the opposition coming from those parties and cliques. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> had something to say about the Socialists. The Socialist, according to the honorable senator, is only a comrade now, but he was not such a bad sort of chap some time ago. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> asked us to consider the position of Leibknecht and his comrades in Prance and Germany; but it is somewhat significant that French Socialists have passed resolutions not to' have anything whatever to do with the Socialists of Germany for quite a number of years. Socialistic societies in Great Britain have passed similar resolutions. I think they have decided not to have anything to do with the Socialists of Germany for the next ten years. In view of these facts, it is difficult to understand the passion which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> displayed against the Socialists of Australia, because they happen to be opposed to the system which the honorable senator is advocating. I have no objection to his advocacy of conscription. If it squares with his conscience, the honorable senator has a perfect right, as has every other member of the Labour party, to support or oppose conscription, or any other matter that is not on the Labour platform. </para>

                        <para>- I had no say in the matters to which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> refers. The labour organizations in the various States have taken that action. I do not know whether they did so wrongly or not. If they have the power, and they believe they are representing the big majority of their members, it seems to me ' that they have only repeated what was done in the movement on many occasion's before, when they expelled people who had been advocating principles opposed to the principles of the Labour party. I am not going to vilify any man because he opposes the principles I hold. What I ask is that the misrepresentation at present in evidence shall not be made worse than it is. Speaking of myself, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> said to-day, " I will tell the people something about you." The honorable senator is quite welcome to do so. The whole of my life in connexion with the Labour movement is an open book, which can be read by anybody. The honorable senator can go to the State from which I come and tell the people there anything he pleases concerning me, because they know that I have never acted contrary to the Labour principles I have always advocated, and I did not come into the Labour movement only yesterday, but, as I have already said, some little time before <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> came into it in Australia. There seems to be an impression that honorable senators who on Friday voted to bring about the meeting of the Senate to-day entered into some sort of conspiracy. It is suggested that there was some whip-up, and that they took advantage of their mates who had gone away in good faith. I was glad to hear <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> say that he had no fault to find with the honorable senators who compelled him and his colleagues to come here from Sydney to-day, and that he thought they were justified in the circumstances. I wish to state exactly what happened, so far as I was personally concerned. The Government Whip came to me before the Senate met after lunch on Friday, and told me that, in all probability, the Senate would be sitting a little late, and that as some of our men wished to get away, he desired to know whether I would be here in order to assist to keep a quorum. I told the "Whip that I would be here. I mentioned that I had something to do down the street, and as others would be here to keep a quorum until twenty minutes to 5 o'clock, I would then go away, and be back in time to take the place of those who desired to get away. </para>

                        <para>- I was. I always try to be as good as my word, and it is an accident if I am not. "When I came back I did not hear from <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Mullan</inline> or any other member of the Senate that it was likely that the Senate would be meeting this week. I had booked my berth for Saturday. I entered the chamber only ten minutes or a quarter-of-an: hour before the vote was taken on <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Mullen's</inline> amendment. After entering the chamber and hearing the debate, I asked what was the matter, and I was told that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Mullan</inline> thought that there should be some promise from the Government that when the proclamation was issued Parliament would be called together, in the sense ordinarily understood by laymen, to deal with it. There was no such promise given. I heard the Minister for Defence say, ""We are going to act in accordance with the best legal advice given to us." I shall not say whether that was right or wrong, as I am not able to criticise it. During the debate no one dreamt for a moment that the proclamation was already in existence until the Minister for Defence said, " The proclamation has already been issued." Inquiry was at once made by honorable senators as to why the proclamation had not been laid upon the table of the Senate, so that we might know what was happening. In my mind was a suspicion that the Government were waiting until Parliament had adjourned to announce the issue of the proclamation. It may be technically right to say that Parliament is sitting at any time between the opening by the Governor-General and the prorogation, but the majority of the people would interpret section 46 to mean that Parliament should be actually sitting. </para>

                        <para>- The idea has always been in the minds of honorable senators that a proclamation of this description would necessitate Parliament being given an opportunity of expressing its opinion in regard to both the proclamation itself and the regulations to be issued in connexion with it. Realizing that the other House had adjourned, many of us were resolved that the Senate should have that opportunity of discussion. I have not read through the regulations. I did not know that they were available. Nowadays the Government seem to go direct to the newspapers with any information of importance, and we may be sure that they obtained copies of the regulations at once. But Parliament is the place where these regulations ought to have been produced at the earliest possible moment. From the dates on the proclamation and the regulations, we realize that the Government desired that Parliament should not have an opportunity to debate them. Even <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> does not altogether agree with regulation 80 in regard to thumbprints. I am surprised that the Government did not proceed further in that direction. The police have a system of taking, in addition to thumb-prints, two photographs  - one full face, and the other in profile - so as to be able to identify criminals. Could not the Government have done something like that? I do not believe that the' adoption of the thumbprint system in connexion with men called up for defence work will meet with the approval of the people, although it may be a very excellent thing for the tracing of criminals passing from one country to another. In any circumstances, I should have been opposed to the proclamation calling up men for home service. The people have not yet had an opportunity of expressing their opinion, but our young men have been called up for home service for the term of the war. We know what that means. Those who are in favour of the policy of the Government believe that the people, by an overwhelming majority, will decide that these men shall be sent oversea. Therefore, it was decided to call them up at once, so that, before the referendum is taken, they may be given a few weeks' training. That very action will militate against an affirmative vote being recorded, because the people affected will be far more active agents against conscription than they otherwise would have been. It has been said that there would not have been enough men coming forward if the voluntary system had been relied on, but I believe that had there been as much energy put into the voluntary system as is now being shown in connexion with conscription, we should have been able to maintain our position without resort to compulsion. I shall vote for the amendment, because I voted previously in favour of the Senate meeting again this week, and if there is anything I can do, by vote or voice in this chamber, to kill the conscription proposal, I shall be only too happy to do it. </para>

                    <para>. - I did not expect a lengthy sitting today, but <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> was full of vigour, and kicked off the ball of debate. The consequence is that the Senate is still sitting. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> says that he is entitled to speak for Western Australia, and to commit that State to conscription, because he has been guided by the consensus of opinion in the party that has placed him in this Senate. I remind <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> that he did not wait for the decision of the Western Australian Labour movement before putting forward his opinion in regard to conscription. He did that long before the Western Australian Conference gave its decision. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> feels aggrieved on finding that there are some honorable senators who stand here to speak for the Labour movement as they understand it in the States to which they belong. Surely, if he is entitled to speak for the Labour movement in his State, every other representative in this Chamber possesses a similar right. With the exception of Western Australia, the work: ing classes of every State in the Commonwealth emphatically say that they do not want conscription. This afternoon, the honorable senator gibed at some of us because we did not see eye to eye with him on this question, and spoke as if we had only joined the Labour movement yesterday. He affirmed that he had been identified with it for twenty-seven years. I know that he has been associated with it for a long time, and that he has done very fine work in connexion with it. But I may tell him that, although he is an older man than I am, my record is a couple of years longer than his own, and consequently I am in a position to speak for the movement with just as much authority as he is. It has been said that those honorable senators who are opposed to conscription took an unfair advantage of the* Government supporters on Friday last. In what we did, we acted conscientiously, believing it was necessary that the Senate should be called together to discuss certain actions of the Ministry. I was under the impression, and so were many others, that before Parliament rose for the referendum campaign the proclamation and the regulation calling upon the citizens of this country to submit their thumbs for examination would have been laid upon the table of both Houses. We were entitled to expect  that. When the proclamation was not presented to Parliament, some honorable senators became very suspicious of what the Government might do. They therefore resolved to watch them, and hence the vote of Friday last. It has been said that, in the forthcoming campaign, both sides will receive a square deal. But what is the position ? In the newspaper? of this morning a whole page is devoted to recording the doings of conscriptionists all over Australia, while only about ten lines are occupied with the doings of anticonscriptionists. Since the War Precautions Act became law, it has been used for quite a number of purposes for which I do not think the Government were justified in using it. I propose to tell them one way in which it may be used justifiably. They affirm that they are anxious that the people of this country shall not be misled upon this question. I give the advocates of conscription credit for the utmost sincerity, and I expect them to be equally generous in regard to myself. The Minister for Defence has stated that the Government do not conduct the newspapers. I am well aware of that. But they have recently done quite a lot of things in the direction of suppressing information which would otherwise have appeared in the newspapers. I hold that they should use their powers under the War Precautions Act to see that, in the forthcoming campaign, both sides are accorded a square deal by the newspapers. If these journals devote a page to recording the utterances of the advocates of conscription, they should devote an equal amount of space to recording the speeches* of those who are opposed to it. I am quite satisfied that if the newspapers did not give prominence to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes'</inline> side of the question, they would very soon hear from him. It has been affirmed that the opponents of conscription wish to desert our men in the trenches, that we want to see them die with their rifles in their hands simply because we do not favour sending more men to the front. But I would remind honorable senators that only the other day the Minister for  Defence stated that all the sacrifice which Australia was required to make at this juncture was represented by the despatch of an additional 60,000 men. He declared - as will be seen by reference to <inline font-style="italic">Hansard,</inline> page 8415 - </para>

                <quote>
                    <para>Wo have already 72,000 with which to meet that demand, and we should be able to realize from the 150,000 single men available the remaining 60,000 men, fit and without dependants, ready to stand by their comrades in the field, and to give them the relief they have every right to expect. That is the worst sacrifice Australia is called upon to make under the Government's proposal. </para>
                </quote>
                <para class="block">The worst sacrifice the people are called upon to make under the proposal of the Government they know nothing whatever about, because the Government have not been frank with them. The Minister stated that the limit of our sacrifice was represented by 60,000 additional men. Yet, a little later, we were told that 32,500 men were required for last month, and 16,500 for each succeeding month. It will thus be seen that by the end of the present year over 80,000 men will have been called up. The people should be told these things. That is why the Government should use their powers under the War Precautions Act to see that the newspapers devote to the doings of anti-conscriptionists the same amount of space that they grant to the advocates of conscription. At present, they refuse to report our utterances, and, unfortunately, <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> does not find its way into the hands of many people. The other day, when speaking in this chamber, I gave some figures as to the probable cost of the war to Australia. Further information from official channels has shown me that I was quite wrong in my estimate of our financial responsibilities. That, however, was not my fault. I endeavoured to obtain the desired information from official sources, but failed to do so, and, as a result, I had to be guided by the best information that was then available. Since then, however, the Treasurer has made an interim financial statement, in which he estimates that, by the end of next June, the national debt of the country will have reached £175,000,000. </para>

                        <para>- It includes the war loans; that is the whole national debt. The war' debt is £141,000,000, and the people have to consider that the war, in all probability, will not be over by next June, though I believe <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley</inline> when he says that Germany is now beaten. My own opinion is that from now on Germany will only be sparring for terms of peace. That nation knows that there is now no possibility of conquering the earth as it set out to do; but it will hang on as long as it can - for as long as it takes our people to drive its forces over the frontiers. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce,</inline> as I have said, told us that all the additional sacrifice that Australia had to make was <inline font-style="italic">60,000</inline> men, and yet, in view of the fact that the war cannot possibly end before June next year, we shall, for at least five months, have to continue to send monthly 16,500. The people of Australia cannot possibly vote on this question with a clear vision unless they know these facts. If, next June, we are faced with a total Commonwealth debt of £175,000,000, and we have 400,000 at the front, it will take at least two years to get these men back again, at an expenditure of at least another £70,000,000. We who oppose conscription are being charged with deserting the men at the front, but are really those who are standing to the promise that we made to them. We promised these men that, if they went to fight for the liberties we enjoy here, their dependants would be looked after, and that they themselves, if crippled, would be provided for; and I believe that the financial responsibility, as shown by the figures, is the limit to which this country can go in honouring that promise. It is time, as I have said before, that this country had the courage to cry a halt. Australia is a long way ahead of any other country on earth. Some honorable senators who come from other countries say that t'hey have the greatest affection for Australia, more affection than for any other country except the land of their birth. Well, Australia is the land of my birth, and I have no respect for the country that starved my father and mother out of it. There is no sentiment in me about that country, but I have a sentiment about the chaps at the front. It is suggested that Australia has to fight on the whole western front, and that if we do not send some more thousands of men we shall lose the war, and that the loss will be put down to the fact that we have deserted the men who up to now have gone to the "front. This is said, despite the fact that on every frontier there are millions of men who are not now being used. That fact is disclosed by this morning's newspaper, and I suppose that the <inline font-style="italic">Argus</inline> would not say such a thing if they thought it would be of any use to us who are opposing conscription. Although we are informed that there are about 8,000,000 Russians available, but not now in the firing line, we have been twitted with desiring the Hindu, with his dirty shirt and doubtful turban, to do our fighting. In the name of Heaven, can any sane person believe that England, Italy, or any of our Allies, desires Australia to send a paltry 100,000 men - a mere drop in the bucket - 12,000 miles when these millions of men are not being used? These facts ought to be made known and thought about. Some who pose as patriots ought to remember that this country owes very little to any other country on earth. It has forged its way up by the efforts of the people who came here first, and, owing to labour organization and other means, it is now the country best worth fighting for. Britain is the next best country, and I wish to see her win the war, as I think she can, without any other sacrifice by Australia. If the Home authorities knew as much as we know, they would say, " For Heaven's sake, look after your own country, and do not be any further foolish." So far ai I can gather, the people in France and Great Britain, when the Prime Minister went <inline font-style="italic">to</inline> England, were found to know so much of us that they were surprised to find that he was a white man, so that they cannot be expected to know as much of the conditions here as we do, or be able to judge as well as we can of our circumstances. Within the next twelve months it is proposed to take men from the industries of the country, and this means that we must repudiate the promises made already to the men at the front.

The lands of the country will be idle, with no harvest gathered, and no one knows this better than the farmers, who are not so stupid as to shut their eyes to the effect of draining the country of its manhood. Under such circumstances, our harvest can never reach the granaries of the world if we had fifty times the number of ships that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> bought in Great Britain. These are all facts that the people of the country ought to know before they vote on the referendum. Here, I should like to say that I cannot see the reasons why the Government are submitting our young men to the indignity of having their thumb-prints taken on enlistment. Was that done to the men who volunteered? If so, I am not aware of the fact. I feel confident that men who volunteered, if asked to do this thing, would have resented it to the utmost. They would have said, " I am not a burglar, or a garotter,  or anybody who has been associated with criminality in this country." Some explanation should certainly be given to the Senate concerning the use of these thumb-prints, and the system should be abandoned immediately. Possibly it was introduced because of the fear of desertions, but, apparently, the Government did not fear desertions among the men who volunteered, and who are now at the front fighting the battles of Australia, and doing so well there. But what would a young man in the trenches think if his parents wrote and told him that his brothers left behind were being dragged up to recruiting depots, and were having their thumb-prints taken, just as if they were burglars or  garotters </para>

                <para class="block">Personally, I do not care whether it is done or not, as I do not think that the Government will get anything like the majority they expect from the soldiers' vote. I have been in conversation with quite a number of returned men, and they have told me the feeling of the men at the front, so I have no fear that the soldiers' vote will have much influence in the direction of foisting conscription on Australia. I was informed to-day - and I hope the Minister will make a note of the statement - that the men who are going into camp now are being asked to sign an oath differing in some respects from the oath signed by the men who volunteered, and are now at the front, and that the oath binds them willy-nilly to go overseas  to fight. I do not know whether there is any truth in that statement or not, but it ought to be replied to by the Minister. The men signing on now should be required to take no other oath than that laid down in the Defence Act. So far as Victoria is concerned, I believe we will get an overwhelming majority of " Noes " at the referendum. I cannot speak for the other States, but I hope that the Democracy of this country will never force conscription on its people. Those acquainted with the history of the Labour movement know why the power of the Government to call upon the people for war services was limited, and they know also that there is no authority for calling on the manhood of Australia to fight outside the Commonwealth. In all probability other people also know the reason for this decision. I want to make it clear that to-day I am fighting where I fought twenty-nine years ago - on the side of organized labour, which enabled me to get into this Parliament, and which captured the government of this country. I have been fighting all the time against the men who advocate black labour for Australia, against the men who sweated the women and children of this country until we got Judge Higgins and a few more Judges to work to prevent them. These people talk about patriotism! Tes, it is the patriotism by means of which they would shove other men into the trenches. Perhaps the men who volunteered were not able to put their thousands of pounds into the fighting fund, but some of them gave their lives, and some are doing it to-day. We have yet to hear of the patriot who has come forward, and placed his money at the service of the country for nothing. The women and nien who have sons overseas, some in the hospitals, and some .in the trenches, come forward to put a shilling or two shillings into our funds, and they are saying to us, " For Heaven's sake, give us literature to stop conscription. We do not want it, and we will not have it." That is the sentiment of the people who are linked up with the Labour movement. Parliamentary parties do not count for very much in such a matter as this, for members of Parliament come and go, and it does not matter to the people whether a man is here for one year or ten years. The people outside, however, do want to know what we are thinking and doing, and, nakedly and unashamedly, I confess I care for no other opinion. The people outside are responsible for my presence in this chamber, as they are for the presence of every other honorable senator, and it has grieved me to think that during the debate of the last two or three weeks, so little regard has been paid to the opinions of the people honorable senators are supposed to represent. It is quite easy to get out of touch with the electors. I know that members of Parliament are busy, and, possibly, when they get in here they find other and more pleasant things to do than to go out amongst the people to keep in touch with them. I regret to think that this party may split, and, perhaps, vanish, but, after all, the Labour movement itself stands as firmly as a rock, and it will be unimpaired in vigour when I and other members of this Parliament have gone. The Labour movement is ever green, ever growing, and ever gathering strength. Those who think otherwise are making a huge mistake. Of course, Labour has made mistakes. No man' and no movement that has ever been worth anything has avoided mistakes. Quite probably the Labour movement will make mistakes again, but it exists in the interests of the people, and I am satisfied that no other political body can so well care for the welfare of Australia. The Labour organizations that are fighting against conscription to-day are doing the right thing. I am satisfied that they will come back from this appeal to the people, as they have done on the last two or three occasions, with a triumphant majority behind them. They will deserve it, and I believe further -that the British, French, Russian, Italian, and German soldiers on the battlefields of Europe today will say, if we reject this proposal, that Australia has acted wisely. We have sent more men to the front than any other nation  SO'  far removed from the scene of conflict would have ever dreamt of sending. The people of the Old World, many of whom thought we were all blackfellows out here, never dreamt that we would send as many to the front as we have. I venture to believe that those people, if consulted, would be the first to say, " For Heaven's sake, consider the welfare of your own country. After the war, complications may arise of which we know nothing at present. Do not leave Australia with none but its old men, its women, and its children to protect your magnificent heritage. Keep some of your fighting material at home." Let us show the world that, although we have sent something like 300,000 of our finest fighting material to the other end of the earth, Australia has still a " kick " in her. Place in the hands of the men remaining here the means of putting up a fight, and I venture to say that we shall be able to protect ourselves against any nation that tries to trouble us. I do not desire to " ski te " about Australia, but, having regard to our geographical position, I am confident that, given a Government willing to spend on the equipment of our men one-half the money we have already spent on this war, there is no combination of nations - and you can chuck Great Britain in - that would trouble us. </para>

It is not many years since the most powerful maritime nation on earth took on the job of defeating one of the weakest countries. A nation of 45,000,000 people, with the greatest Navy on the seas, took two and a half years to conquer the Boer Republic, which could only put in the field about one man to every seven that we could put in the field to-morrow. I believe I am well within the mark when I say that, given men decently armed and equipped, we need not worry about other nations taking Australia. I have no desire to import any bitterness into this fight. When we go into the country, our endeavour must be not to engender any ill-feeling in the minds of the people. I shall put before them the position as I see it. I shall tell them of the danger to Australia that I see in the proposals of the Government. Those dangers, to my mind, are very real, and the people of Australia are alive to them. Having said so much I shall leave it to the people to decide this question. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable senator should be one of the last to interject in that way, seeing that, although a little time ago he was a revolutionary, he is now the silent member of the Government. Having regard to the intricacies of the situation, it would be as well if the sittings of the Senate were continued, if possible, until the date of the referendum. It is advisable, I think, that the people should have a watchdog, in the form of a majority of the Senate, looking after their interests at a time like the present. We are asked to take a retrograde step. Notwithstanding our vaunted freedom and our knowledge of all for which Democracy stands, we are invited to throw back to some fifty years ago. We all remember the  black-birding  that was indulged in when kanakas were recruited from the southern seas. You, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. President,</inline> recollect the effect of that recruiting on Queensland. The result of the employment of kanaka labour in the cane-fields of Queensland was such as te cause grave concern throughout Australia, with the result that as soon as it was established, the National Parliament legislated to give effect to the policy of a White Australia, and the supporters of that principle did not cease to agitate until the kanakas were returned to their island homes, and Australia was made white. We intend to keep it white, and unless Australia is drained of its manhood by the adoption of the Government's proposals, there will be no room here for any coloured alien races. In view of legal opinions that have been given, it seems to me that the action of the Government in calling up men ostensibly for home service, but actually for service overseas, is illegal and unconstitutional. I have heard it inferred by the Minister for Defence that in time of war the Constitution is cast into the national dust-bin. That seems to be the position to-day; but one good effect of the referendum, which I hope will be defeated, and of the proclamation which has been issued, is the fact that it will give the lie direct to those who have said that Australia has not done her duty in the way of voluntary enlistment. It has been shown already, within two days after the issue of the proclamation, that very few eligible fit men remain to be called into camp.

                <para class="block">In the case of Ballarat, six are available out of eighty-one. I do not say that all those who apply for exemptions will get (hem, but a percentage of the applications will be upheld, and the figures strikingly show how few will go into camp from that district. This is a compliment to that and other districts, proving, as it does, how many public-spirited, patriotically-minded men, lovers of their own free Australia, have gone abroad willingly and freely to serve Australia and the Empire. The Bendigo figures show ten available out of seventy-six, if all the applications for exemption are upheld. This afternoon, our honorable friend <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lieutenant-Colonel Sir Albert</inline> Gould, to give him his full title, joined with that picturesque word-painter of rheumatic Queensland mosquitoes and Western dawns, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch,</inline> in referring to those who have not gone as " cowards,'  " cravens," and " shirkers." Yet to-day's figures show how very few men who could have gone are still here, and no one knows whether the circumstances that prevented them from going before have yet been removed. Some may not have had the heart, and it is cruel, if they have no stomach for the fight, to throw them into the trenches, where they may be in the way of good men. Will <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gould</inline> remember that the same foul epithets were applied to those who did not respond to the first call of the bugle in the early days of the war? Yet, many of those so designated now lie in lonely graves on the Gallipoli peninsula. Last year public speakers and the press were also endeavouring to shame into enlisting, by the application of such names as "cold-footers" and "wasters," many men who to-day lie buried in France, having made the supremo sacrifice for their country. So, to day, you may be doing an injury to men who could not go before. Only a few days ago I met a man who, in spirit, has been at the front all these heart-aching months, but could not go, because he had to stand by his invalid mother.  Her  death left him free, and he went, yet for two years he had to bear the taunts of those who call themselves patriots. </para>

                        <para>- Certainly not. Many of the " would-to-God " brigade, whose years protect them, say things of that kind of the younger men, without inquiring into their circumstances. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> again made his oft-repeated statement that he is a conscriptionist because Ireland has been bled white under voluntarism. The members of the Labour party have had for many years to fight calumnies, including charges of tearing the marriage certificate to pieces, dissolving the marriage tie, conscripting the children of the nation and putting them into communistic nurseries, advocating polygamy, and stirring up sectarianism. That issue has been trailed through our ranks for years, but we thought that we had scotched it at last. Now, some of these people, and those standing behind them, are endeavouring to introduce that cursed, dastardly thing known as sectarianism into this fight, in order to throw odium cn those standing against conscription, using it as the Liberal-cum-Conservative party tried to do in days done by, although unsuccessfully, to hoist themselves into power. In striking contrast to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch's</inline> statement, other people in this community have stated repeatedly in recent weeks that they are conscriptionists because Irishmen have not volunteered in Australia. What an incongruous position ! One man is a conscriptionist because Ireland has spilled her blood voluntarily, and others are in the same camp because Ireland has not. As a reader of history, one who knows his countrymen, and looking at the meagre returns coming in now as showing the few eligible men left, I know that Irishmen, Englishmen, Scotchmen, Cornishmen,  and Welshmen have played their part manfully and well. It is unkind, it is unfair, it is a thing that we should not expect in a supposedly broad-minded country such as this, the recent fine deeds of whose sons will shine from the pages of history in letters of fire in days to come, rivalling the doings of the Irish Fusiliers in the great offensive on the Somme, that men calling themselves Irishmen should say they are conscriptionists because Ireland has given so much of her blood, while Others in the same camp bring in the sectarian serpent again by saying that they are conscriptionists because Irishmen in Australia have not volunteered. I refuse to believe that the position is as they represent it to be, but I take this opportunity to try once again, I hope for the last time, to get my heel on the head of the serpent of sectarianism. </para>

                            <para>- If the honorable senator does not know it,. I do. One of the surprises of this campaign is to find that it is as insidious as the serpent itself. If the honorable senator wants my authority, I can refer him to some of the leading men in this country, although they are not game to get on the platform; but if they can get hold of the ear of some old woman, whether in skirts or in trousers, they will pour the story out in order to get their unfortunate victim to vote " Yes." In characteristic style, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> has reiterated the slander that has been levelled against the Socialists of Australia, but as progressive figures show that so many workers have gone to the front it is surprising that any representative public man would stoop so low as to try to discredit the great Socialist cause. </para>

The fact that a big percentage of those who have gone to the front are Labourites is admitted by conscriptionists and by the opponents of the Labour party. No Labourite is worthy of the name if he is not a Socialist. We are here in this chamber because Socialists have put us here, and we are expected to fight for them. I stand by those who put me here, and I say that they have played their part faithfully and well in the battles of this war,, and as bravely as any other unit of the Empire or of the Allies who are with us. </para>

                            <para>- Socialism is essentially for peace, but the Socialist is not a peaceful man when he gets a crack in the jaw. As the honorable senator has experienced in many a campaign, the Socialist can hit back. We are expected to keep faith with those who have sent us to the Senate by not bringing in conscription. If we bring into being this accursed thing, which will brand every man it sends into the ranks as Cain was branded, those maligned Socialists and other free Australians who have gone to the front, leaving a country noted for its free institutions and its advanced thought, will return to find a Prussianized Australia. I have seen letters written from men at the front hoping that this thing will not be done. Despite the oft-repeated  mentionings  on the conscriptionist platforms to the contrary, our men at the front do not want Australians conscripted to bring them out of the trenches. 1 believe that they will fight their own way out of anything. Talking of the brand of Cain brings me to a matter which we did not suspect when, thinking that something which we should know and which we should debate might be done under the proclamation, we prevented the adjournment of the Senate. The thumb-prints of men who are called up and are rejected as medically unfit are now being taken. Those of us who have been on gold-fields know what fights we have had to make against mine-owners to prevent the personal search of miners and the imposition of other obscene indignities. Yet, now it is proposed to class with Chinamen, criminals, and lunatics the men who are called up for military service. I am pleased that I am, for once, in agreement with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen.</inline> He says that it is not playing the game, and that men should not be classed as criminals by having records of their thumb-prints taken. Another method should be adopted. A statutory declaration on the discharge certificate, with a notification that it must not be transferred to any one else under the pain of a heavy penalty, would make a man very careful about letting it go out of his hands. I do not agree with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen's</inline> suggestion that photographs of medical rejects should be taken. It savours too much of the Rogues' gallery, because the Criminal Investigation Department has photographs, as well as thumb-prints, of criminals. T think that the signed declaration on each certificate should be ample safeguard. I know that the Government are anxious that the Senate should adjourn, but I am not anxious to see the sittings of the Senate conclude. There is much to be watched. Ministers withhold too much. We know that they have quite enough to put up with, and we have no desire to increase their worries, but their position would be much better if they were franker and more candid with Parliament. The censorship is too rigid, and we know that the Government could secure from the newspapers more impartial treatment of those who are opposing conscription. At other times, if a public man secures one report of his speeches, he does not expect any more, but now it frequently happens that the same type of speech that a supporter of conscription is making appears time after time in the press; whereas the anti-conscriptionist, breaking new ground, and speaking possibly for the first time, does not get from the press that consideration that he should get in order that the people may be made acquainted with the principles and aims of those who are opposing the imposition of compulsory military service overseas. The municipal representatives are being asked to take a hand in this business. </para>

                            <para>- Some of them are, and the ratepayers- later will want to know why. Urgent telegrams have been sent to the mayors and presidents of shires throughout Australia, many of whom have been in the past the opponents of the Prime Minister and of his party. They have been asked to call public meetings to foist conscription on the people, and to beat down the anti-conscriptionists. Last week I asked <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> where the money to pay for these telegrams was coming from. The amount must be considerable. I asked if the Government were paying for the telegrams. The honorable gentleman said that the Government was not paying for them, and when I asked who was paying, he very impolitely told me to mind my own business. I consider that, as a representative of the people, it is my business to know who is paying for these telegrams. As a ratepayer, I consider that the telegram sent to my district is an insult, and I object to the public halls in it being hired with the money of anti-conscriptionist ratepayers to advance the conscriptionist cause. What is being  done shows the lengths to which the Government and its supporters are ready to go in order to strike down the anticonscriptionists, and to force conscription on Australia, so that our men may be cast into the trenches whether they like it or not. Our soldiers have done re-'  markably  well. Australia has given as much as she can afford in men, but not as much as she can afford in wealth. More will have to be done for the raising of revenue. It ill becomes those responsible for the present position to cast the odium upon us. Although thirteen years have elapsed since <inline font-weight="bold">Sir William</inline> Irvine tried to coerce the people of Victoria, his action is remembered by the Democracy as though it were the action of yesterday, and after thirty-three years the people" will not forget this attempt to put a blot upon them. Unfortunately, the die has been cast so far as the Referendum Bill is concerned, but it is for the people to say whether they will indorse the action of Parliament. I believe that they will refuse to indorse it, and that Svengali and his Trilbies will find themselves one and all discredited when the vote has been taken. </para>

                        <para>. -I am very sorry that my health has not permitted me to take part in an earlier discussion of this matter. I am not equal to-night to the task of expressing all that I feel regarding the present position of affairs, but I wish to make it clear that I believe that the Government are doing the right thing in the interests of Australia. I believe that they are doing that which is making for the welfare of our country and of our nation. I agree with the two previous speakers that the anti-conscriptionists have as much right to express their opinion as the conscriptionists, but no power is so equal to the expression of an opinion on this question as the people of Australia. I hold that the electors have the right to express their opinion, and I wish it to be clearly understood that my vote on the referendum question will be "Yes." When a candidate at the last election, I promised faithfully from the platform that I would do everything within human capability for the prosecution of the war to a successful finish, and I stand to that position still. I should regard myself as recreant, not only to my nation, but to my manhood, were I to depart from it at the present moment. </para>

                            <para>- I told them that I would advocate anything that would win the war, and I say that now. If I were wanted to fight, I would do my share, old as I am. I am prepared to go to-morrow. It has been said that conscription will do an injury to Australia, that it will prejudice Australian interests, and interfere with our freedom of government. I have more faith in our people than to believe that possible. They will take all sorts of care, while the banner of Democracy floats over them, that democratic principles are fully recognised. To use the word of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch,</inline> it is hypocritical to attempt to persuade the people that conscription will cripple them for all time. We have four divisions at the front, four noble divisions of noble men. Many of my friends, men whom I adore, are among them. The anti-conscriptionists ask us to give these men the go-by. They ask us to say to them, " Fight on, but we are no longer prepared to assist you in the great struggle for our national existence." In my opinion, it is infinitely better that Australia should be fought for in Flanders than that Australians should have to defend their country on their own soil. When we have to defend this Commonwealth in Australia, it will be God help Australia. I believe that every man's common sense should impel him to a recognition of that fact. What can we do to defend ourselves in Australia? We are absolutely unable to fight for our own country. It is only because we have the big battalions of the Allied Forces on our side that we can consider ourselves secure. Some honorable senators have talked about Socialism, but I pass all that over. Socialism is all right, but what we have to consider is what is best for our nation. I am not going to upbraid the anti-conscriptionists. They may be against anything they please, but, so far as I am concerned, when I go on to the public platform I intend, not only to try to point out to the people the obligation we owe to the men fighting for us in the trenches, but to advise all I know to send as many of the able-bodied qualified men as we can from Australia to support them, in order that we may win a victory by which we can secure Australia's welfare and the nation's right at the same time. That is all I have to say. </para>

                            <para>- I rise to a point of order. I am reluctant to interrupt the Minister for Defence or to delay the proceedings, but I point out that there is an amendment before the Senate as well as the main question. The Minister has already spoken on the amendment. I submit that the amendment should first be put, and the Minister for Defence should exercise his right to reply on the main question. If he replies to the debate now any honorable senator who might desire to move a further amendment would be unable to do so by reason  of the fact that the Minister for Defence had replied, not only on the amendment, but on the main question. I do not say that any further amendment will be moved, but some honorable senator might desire to move a further amendment, and I therefore think that the Minister's reply to the debate should be deferred until the amendment is decided. </para>

I propose to deal with some of the criticisms that have been directed against the Government with regard to the method of issuing the proclamation and regulations, and also with regard to the regulations themselves. As I said before, the Government have taken the responsibility of issuing the proclamation and regulations, and that responsibility must rest with them. The regulations were not completed before Friday last, and any honorable senator who carries his mind back over the last two or three weeks will realize how little time the Prime Minister and I, as the Ministers chiefly responsible for the formulation of the regulations, had in which to deal with them. </para>

                            <para>- I do not think they can. This is an entirely new departure for Australia, and probably as a result of experience we shall have to alter many of the regulations. They are not, like the laws of the Medes and Persians, unalterable, and it is the desire of the Government that this innovation shall be introduced with as little friction as possible. Indeed, any Government that consults its own convenience is bound to adopt that policy. The regulation which seems to have caused most criticism is that in regard to the taking of thumbprints. That regulation is confined entirely to the issue of exemption certificates for medical or other reasons. In this connexion, we have some experience to guide us. We have found that there were men who, though medically unfit, were anxious to enlist, and in very many cases - how many we do not know yet, but they number upwards of 1,000 - those men obviously went to the front on medical certificates that did not belong to them at all. Men who were physically fit had been examined and passed, and their certificates were later presented by men who have been found to be absolutely unfit, and obviously had been unfit for a considerable time. </para>

                            <para>- A bank deals with signatures that are well known, but the Defence Department is dealing with men who may disguise their signatures for a deliberate purpose. At any rate, we had to rely entirely on the signature, and it has proved an inadequate safeguard against deception. This has been most firmly impressed upon me in a report that came to hand from Egypt during the last month. In that document it was stated that over 300 men were being sent home, none of whom had ever done, or had ever been able to do, a day's fighting. It had cost the country hundreds and thousands of pounds to equip them and send them to Egypt, but the doctors who conducted the examination in Egypt said it was obvious that the men had been suffering from infirmities for years, and could not have passed a medical test. Every one of those men must have secured a fit man to personate him in order to get a certificate. Then they went into camp, and the country was put to the expense of training and equipping them, sending them to Egypt, and finally repatriating them. </para>

                            <para>- We do not know what became of him. It is just possible that he made a business of doing this sort of thing, and went from camp to camp. Now. I come to the question of the thumb-print. One honorable senator has suggested that we should do away with the thumb-print and substitute a photograph. 5Tet I heard another honorable senator say that the photograph is associated with criminality. So it is. But does that prevent the photograph being used for identification purposes? I cannot see the difference between a man putting his thumbprint on paper and putting his signature on paper, except that the thumb-print has been used very largely in criminal cases because it has been found the most effective method of detecting crime. </para>

                            <para>- I do not. But, after all, the impress of a man's thumb upon a paper is only a modification of the impress of his signature upon paper. If we substituted a photograph, would it be argued that we were, therefore, making a man a criminal ? We all have our photographs taken at some time or other. The thumb-print is merely the means which we propose to adopt to protect the State against fraud. </para>

Surely the country has a right to see that that certificate is used by him and by nobody else. <inline font-style="italic">AL</inline> present the only protection that we have against fraud is the signature of a man, and experience has proved this to be faulty. Are we, then, to avail ourselves of no other means of protection ? But the only other methods open to us are those of the photograph and the thumbprint, and the same objection can be used against both. Both are used in connexion with criminal investigation. </para>

                            <para>- Yes, but it is only a question of degree, and even the signature of a man is used for the purposes of identification. It so happens that the thumb-print is used more in criminal cases than is his signature. Those who argue against the thumb-print, view this matter in a very narrow light. Merely because it is used in one form of criminal investigation, they urge that it is associated with criminality. </para>

                            <para>- I am not going to please the honorable senator. The objection that has been urged against the thumb-print can also be urged against the photograph, and in a lesser degree, against the signature of a man. It has been repeatedly argued that the thumb-print is associated with criminality, and that we have adopted the idea from Prussia. But I would remind honorable senators that every soldier or sailor entering the United States army or navy has his thumb-print taken. Why? America is not Prussia. America is not a nation which is ruled by an oligarchy or a military caste. The thumb-print is taken in the United States army and navy to enable the authorities to trace deserters. </para>

                            <para>- In the case of exemptions, on the ground of physical unfitness, it will be, on account of the numerous cases in which fraud has been perpetrated. I am not so foolish as to say that if any better means can be devised, I will rigidly adhere to the thumbprint. But I want to see that the Commonwealth is not defrauded in the future as it has been in the past. If honorable senators can suggest some better means of identification I am prepared to adopt it. At present I do not know of any other means except the photograph, which is not as reliable as is the thumb-print. </para>

                            <para>- When an exemption is granted to a man on the ground of physical unfitness or for some other reason, that exemption will be stated on the certificate which is issued to him. The Department will not hold that certificate. It will keep the attestation papers, and, in order that a comparison may be made between the certificate and those papers, the thumb-print will be impressed upon both. To make quite sure of this, yesterday I issued instructions to that effect to all commandants, because I saw that the regulation might be read to mean that the thumb-print was only to be put on the attestation papers when a man presented himself in response to the proclamation. But anybody who reads it closely will see that it refers only to those who are exempt after medical examination. However, I am quite prepared to give further consideration to the matter, and if I can be satisfied with some other form of identification I am not wedded to the thumb-print, although I think it is the most effective means of identification. In regard to exempt industries, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley</inline> asked what will be the nature of the committee which will be established to deal with them. My reply is that it will be a committee which will have nothing to do with individuals. It will be an advisory committee to the Government. The Government will have the right to accept its recommendations, to refuse them, or to modify them. The committee will consist of Professor Lyle, Professor of Engineering of the Melbourne University, who will be its  chairman  ; <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Leitch,</inline> Director of Munitions, who is in close touch with a great number of businesses, because, as honorable senators know, all importations of machinery or plant have to be referred to him before permission can be given for their introduction, in addition to which he is a business man, who has given his services for the period of the war; <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McClelland,</inline> the Railways Commissioner, a representative of the Chamber of Manufactures, a representative of the Trades Hall, and a representative of the Mines Department. </para>

Exemptions in time of war are dealt with in an earlier section; but these students are exempt from service in the Citizen Forces while they continue as theological students. Ministers of religion are exempt, and persons who have conscientious objections to bear arms may be allotted other duties, as also may theological students. </para>

The central head-quarters sent out similar instructions to all the States; but, of course, you may get six men to read a document in six different ways, and, unfortunately, some officer in the Victorian office read the instructions wrongly, and gave the extended dates. </para>

                            <para>- What honorable senators have seen on the front pages of newspapers is not paid for at all; the advertisements appear elsewhere, and are much smaller. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Mullan</inline> raised the question of the arrest of persons before trial under these regulations, and quoted paragraph 9. But the honorable senator has apparently not read the Defence Act, because had he done so he would have seen that the regulation is merely a repetition of section 122. </para>

It has also been said, in the course of the debate, that a man on going into camp is asked to sign an oath different from that to which other men have to subscribe, and that such oath compels them to go oversea. The oath that the men are asked to subscribe is that set forth in the second schedule, and it does not call upon them to serve overseas. </para>

An advantage that a wealthy client always has is that he may employ counsel, and go from one Court to another, a procedure which is denied to a poor litigant. </para>

                            <para>- I can give the honorable senator an assurance that the military representative will in no case be a lawyer. I have already informed the military secretary that we are not to appoint, as a military representative, any person who in private life is a lawyer, but a person who follows some other occupation. I can only say that the desire of the Government is that these regulations shall be brought in with as little friction as possible, for we do not want criticism and trouble among those who are called up. There is one other matter to which I might refer, though it was not raised in the discussion, and that is the statement which has appeared in the press to the effect that discharged returned soldiers were being called upon to give up their discharges, and were not getting a receipt for them". As soon as I returned to Melbourne this morning, I rang up the administrative offices, and found that the military secretary,  Colonel Dodds,  had already issued an order to all districts to the effect that immediately a returned soldier gave up his discharge he was to be furnished with a receipt. </para>

(2) Are scrutineers allowed access to polling booths? (3) If not, will facilities be given for scrutineers to be present ? (4) Will soldiers be given the option of recording their votes with Electoral Registrars? </para>

That is to say, whatever privileges are allowed in other polling booths will be enjoyed also in the polling booths attached to the different camps. </para>

Will it be necessary for these men to have their names on the roll, or will they simply vote by virtue of the fact that they are in uniform and of twenty-one years of age? </para>

                            <para>- All military camps in Australia are treated in exactly the same way as towns. Moreover, voting in the camps is no novelty, because soldiers voted in their camps at the last Federal election, and at subsequent State elections, and I have never heard of any complaint. So far as I understand the position, a soldiers' camp is treated as a citizens' camp, and the polling booth there is conducted in the same manner as any other polling booth. </para>

As to the poll in Australia, I would remind the honorable senator that the eastern States are some two hours ahead of Western Australia, so that counting might commence here and some progress reports might appear before the poll closed in the western State. That has happened in connexion with ordinary elections. </para>

I told him of the representations made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ferricks,</inline> and he paid that he would give them the most favorable consideration.

                        <para>- There is absolutely no truth in the statement that we have imported saddles from Japan. It is true that some employees of the Harness Factory had to be put off because there was no work for them to do. The great rush of orders for the Light Horse, especially in the saddlery department, is over, and there is no work available for them. The Light Horse has not been required so much as was anticipated in the earlier stages of the war. It is absolutely incorrect to say that any saddlery has been imported for the Department from Japan, nor is it the intention in the future to import saddlery from Japan or anywhere else. On the contrary, we are communicating with the British Government, offering to make saddlery for them, and hope to get an order from them before long. </para>

(2) That the men asked to be allowed to go to their homes owing to all the blankets being wet, and were refused ? (3) That 300 of them did go home, and when they came back next morning were immediately placed under detention, and are still there? (4) That they have no tents or blankets or anything else to sleep in ? (5) Will they get leave to go home before embarking ? </para>

                        <para>Owing to the wet weather practically the whole camp were given week-end leave from Saturday to Monday. When they turned up on Monday it was still wet, and leave was extended to Tuesday. On their reporting again on Tuesday they were issued with new blankets, put in buildings and huts, and everything was done to make them comfortable. It was on the Tuesday that the men, or some  section  of them, wished more leave, and they marched out of camp. On turning up next morning they were each fined £2, and awarded fourteen days' detention. The question of final leave is not affected. Those who have not had their leave will get it. </para>

The men marched out of camp in defiance of orders, so that the punishment was for disobedience of orders as well as for absence without leave. The principle to which the honorable senator has referred relates to cases where men have overstayed their leave. These men asked for leave to go out, were refused, and, in defiance of that refusal, marched out of camp. </para>

The answer I supplied to him waa that which I was able to get in response to inquiries made over the telephone. I shall have further inquiries made when I return to the Department, and if I find that these men have been harshly dealt with I shall mitigate the punishment. If, however, I find the circumstances to be as stated, I do not see that I can mitigate it. I shall certainly ascertain, however, whether there are any mitigating circumstances which would warrant a reduction of the punishment inflicted. </para>

We have asked that when men are sent back to Australia to undergo imprisonment all the papers relating to their cases shall be returned with them, or as soon after as possible. A committee, consisting of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Cohen,</inline> police magistrate, of Victoria, <inline font-weight="bold">Major Mclnerney,</inline> who is a barrister as well as a military officer called up for duty, and an officer who has been returned, wounded, from the front, has been appointed to go into the facts of each case as disclosed by the papers. That committee has power to recommend a mitigation of the punishment inflicted. A number of cases have been dealt with, and in some instances a remission of the sentence has been recommended and granted. The remaining cases will be dealt with as the papers arrive. </para>

                    <para>. - An award has been given by the  President  of the Arbitration Court in the case of the Telegraph and Telephone Instrument Linesmen and the Postal Electricians Union. The law provides that, when an award is given under the Public Service Act, it must lie on the table of Parliament for thirty days before it becomes operative. I approached the Minister yesterday afternoon to ascertain whether the award would be laid on the table before Parliament adjourned. He told me that he would see if it was possible to have it officially handed to him, so that he could lay it on the table. Later in the evening he told me it was impossible to get the award officially, and consequently he could not table it. Under the award, the members of each organization have been given increases in wages. I do not blame the Government or the Minister for the delay. It is the fault of the Act. It is ridiculous that men who have fought their case through the Arbitration Court should be deprived of practically two months' benefit of the award because Parliament will not assemble till a certain date. Outside organizations have their awards dated from the date of determination. If Parliament had been sitting, thirty days would have elapsed after the tabling of this award before it operated ; but under present circumstances the delay will be much longer. Is there any way, short of an amendment of the Public Service (Arbitration) Act, by which, when Parliament reassembles, the two organizations named can be given the benefit of the award from the date of determination? If not, will the Government take the earliest opportunity of amending the Act so that the people employed in our Service who are members of organizations within the Service will get the benefit of an award from the date on which it is given by the Judge? </para>

                    <para>. - It is quite correct that I told <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Needham</inline> that I would endeavour to have the award laid on the table before the Senate rose, but I find that if I had done so it would not have affected the position, because the award has to be laid on the table of both Houses in order to comply with the law. The delay has been occasioned by the fact that the award had been forwarded to the Attorney-General, whose certificate that it complies with the law has first to be obtained. There are difficulties that are encountered in following what is prescribed by the law. I cannot make any promise that the public servants referred to shall be paid from the date of the delivery of the award, though at the same time I hold the view that they should get the benefit of any improvement made in their conditions at the very earliest opportunity it is legally possible to give it to them. </para>

                <para class="block">That question also is hardly necessary. I do not think it will have any beneficial application. There are no penalties among religious bodies in Australia. If a person who has religious scruples objects, it is not because of any penalty that may be imposed on him by religious organizations. As the question is a very delicate one, it might with advantage be deleted. Information to hand, I regret to say, indicates that the censorship has not been relaxed to the extent that we might have expected after the way in which the subject has been ventilated. When speaking previously on this question, I referred to the elaborate preparations which were being made by the Prime Minister to conduct the affirmative campaign, and disseminate literature supporting the Government's proposal.  I  stated that the Prime Minister had engaged a prominent Sydney journalist to come to Melbourne and supervise the distribution of literature in favour of the affirmative throughout Victoria. In the <inline font-style="italic">Ballarat Star</inline> of the 2nd October appears a column of paragraphs arguing the affirmative in regard to conscription, and signed by Adam McKay, 390 Collins-street. This confirms my statement that arguments in support of the affirmative are being spread broadcast. We are not told who is bearing the expense of this propaganda - whether the money is coming out of the Consolidated Revenue or out of  a  secret service fund. There is another journalist in Sydney with a staff engaged in distributing literature in New South Wales. These people are not working for nothing, and it is due to the Senate  to  be told whether the expense is being borne by the Consolidated Revenue ; that is, by the people as a whole - whether they are opposing conscription or supporting it. We should know who is paying the piper. </para>

                <para>The Minister of Defence. - Nonsense. Of course, it is nonsense, but it is also true. I have seen this typed instruction from the censor, and at little trouble can dig it up and send it to you. The irritatingly stupid censorship carried it to the length of censoring a theatrical paragraph in advance of Henry Lawson's play, "While the Billy Boils," because the comment on the fact of the play was that " It had nothing to do with Billy Hughes boiling in England." And the Minister for Defence, by the censor's suggestion, is sacrosanct against criticism as a politician, because criticism of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> is hostile criticism of military administration. </para>
                <para>The censorship, whilst suppressing facts that could not help the enemy, has, on occasion, suggested the printing of falsehoods, and it has only broken down because Sydney editors threatened to leave the Sydney conscription meeting of September 18 severely alone unless the right of free speech were re-established. How old, too, are the censorship instructions against the mention of "White Australia" or " Cheap Labour "? </para>
                <para>But the worst of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce's</inline> replies, <inline font-style="italic">re</inline> the censorship, is that to the question of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McKissock(Age,</inline> September 22) - " The Minister for Defence repeated that it was not true that there was trouble at Broken Hill, nor had the news about trouble been censored." </para>
                <para class="block">That statement is untrue in spirit and in fact. Every newspaper knows that Broken Hill news is censored, and the Government has probably good and sufficient reason for censorship, owing to its faulty conception of the Australian character. If there is danger from any active enemy, a statement of the facts to the public would demand less of this amateur diplomacy, which is the science of lies. </para>
                <para>One of the most flagrantly stupid examples of this diplomacy is that of the case of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Noonan,</inline> proprietor of four hotels at Broken Hill. He left for Adelaide on holiday, having instructed his manager to send an urgent wire on anything of moment to his business. Trouble came along among the employees. The manager telegraphed to his employer, and the telegram was censored and suppressed. When <inline font-weight="bold">Mr.</inline></para>
                <para>Koonan leisurely returned, he found his business disorganized; made trouble with the manager; traced the wire to the censor; and not beyond. And yet <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> says there is no censorship of Broken Hill trouble; which is just as true as his denial of the fact that in Egypt Australian private soldiers are forced to travel third class on the railroad, whether they offer to pay first class or not. </para>
                <para>Either <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> knows nothing of the military censorship, or he rivals <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Asquith</inline> in that which is called "diplomacy" in England, and " side-stepping " in Australia. </para>
                <para class="block">The stand taken by the Sydney daily newspapers against the dictatorship of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> confirms my statement about the suppression of resolutions by the Executive Labour bodies of Victoria, New South Wales, and Queensland denouncing <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> and his proposals. That statement was challenged, but we know that the only information which the press was allowed to publish was that authorized by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes,</inline> with his own colouring. After the Political Labour League executive and the Labour Council of New South Wales had turned down <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes'</inline> proposals by immense majorities, he prevented the news from being published in the Sydney papers, and sent an authorized statement, with a colouring favorable to himself, or putting the best construction on the facts. The Sydney <inline font-style="italic">Daily Telegraph</inline> refused to publish his authorized statement, and the threat of the newspapers of Sydney to leave unnoticed a conscription meeting at which he was to speak had the effect of relaxing the censorship. But if things are to continue as they are, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes'</inline> promise of a fair deal to both sides will not be fulfilled. We have reason to believe that the censor is again on the job, and is rather strict in regard to Inter-State news, such as resolutions passed in some of the States favoring temporary stop-work meetings as a protest against the proclamation calling men to the colours. It is strange that nothing has appeared in the newspapers regarding what is happening in the other States in this matter. The information which has been made known to-night about the holding of anti-conscription meetings in Western Australia is proof of the interference of the censor. Probably it was anticipated that the Senate would adjourn yesterday after a merely formal meeting. Obviously the despicable art of suppression is being again practised to an unwarrantable degree. I suggest that the Minister for Defence should here and now give the country an undertaking that the despotism initiated by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> shall not continue throughout the referendum campaign. If he does not, we shall be forced to a conclusion that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> desires to pursue the policy of a dictator. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Randolph</inline> Bedford and others speak of the censorship as stupid, foolish, and unwarranted. I trust that serious consideration will be given to this matter, because, otherwise, those opposing conscription will have no chance of getting their views fairly represented by the press. </para>

About a week later, I was informed that they had been laid on the table of the Library, but, on investigating the file, I found that only two or three comparatively unimportant papers had been produced. Although, in reply to my question, it was stated that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Griffin</inline> recommended the engagement of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Oliver</inline> to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Kelly</inline> when he was Assistant Minister for Home Affairs, and also to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Archibald</inline> when he held the position of Minister, the first of the papers produced is dated 8th May, 1916, or only two or three months ago. It is a document . from <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. King</inline> O'Malley, as Minister for Home Affairs, informing <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Oliver</inline> that, on behalf of the Government, he engaged him as consulting engineer to report on the water supply and sewerage works required for the Federal Capital at Canberra. It lays down the conditions of engagement, and states that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Oliver</inline> was to be at liberty to appoint an expert sewerage draftsman and a skilled water supply draftsman, that he was to have the entire services of both these men; that he was to have complete office accommodation and such a staff of clerks as he required, with full control of all these officers, including the right to appoint and suspend them. The conditions provided, further, that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Oliver</inline> was to say whether the staff placed under his control should be engaged in Melbourne or at Canberra. It was further provided that he was to have all his expenses paid, including board and lodging when away from Melbourne. Some notice should be taken of this shameful waste of money by the Home Affairs Department, and I shall probably take a more fitting opportunity to deal with that aspect of the matter in detail. I wish now specially to direct the attention of the Prime Minister, through the Minister for Defence, to the fact that, whilst all the papers connected with the engagement of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Oliver</inline> were promised, only a few comparatively unimportant papers have been produced. The first of these, as I have said, is dated 8th May, 1916, and the second is dated 25th May, 1916. This was a request from the Acting Prime Minister, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce,</inline> to the Minister for Home Affairs not to finalize the contract with <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Oliver</inline> until He had supplied a memorandum setting out all the circumstances connected therewith. One would naturally expect to find amongst the papers a reply from the Minister for Home Affairs giving the Acting Prime Minister the particulars asked for, but amongst the papers that have been produced there is no document of this kind. There is a short scribbled note on the corner of one of the papers, I presume in </para>
                <para class="block">
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. O'Malley's</inline>
                    handwriting, to say that the matter was settled by a private chat with the Acting Prime Minister. When the Senate meets again I shall be glad if
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce,</inline>
                    who , should have some regard for the [dignity of this Chamber, will see that it is not flouted by a weak Minister of the Crown who is governed apparently by a gentleman who has been imported from America. From all I can learn, it would seem that ever since
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. O'Mal</inline>
                    ley assumed office for the second time as Minister for Home Affairs that Department has been run wholly and solelyby

                </para>
                <para>Griffin. Every recommendation m made by that gentleman has been adopted by the present Minister for Home Affairs . <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Griffin</inline> has on more than one occasion treated the Public Works Committee with scant courtesy, and that expression scarcely describes the treatment of that Committee by the Home Affairs Department. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Griffin</inline> has practically defied the Public Works Committee. He has, apparently, influenced the presentMinister for Home Affairs to endeavour to discredit the work of the Committee. After careful inquiry, and the taking of evidence from practically all the sanitary engineers accessible in Australia as to the construction of sewerage works at Canberra after the submission of the Committee's report to Parliament, and after the bulk of the work had been practically finished, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Oliver</inline> was engaged at the very extravagant fee of £1,000, and perhaps another £2,000 or more for the expenses of the staff he was allowed to employ. This money has been absolutely thrown away at a time when we certainly have none to waste, apparently in order that the work of the Public Works Committee may be discredited. These who know anything about the Federal Capital are aware that the water supply works have been practically completed. The mains and service reservoirs have been completed, and the main sewer world have been practically completed, and <inline font-style="italic">yet</inline> the Minister for Home Affairs engages <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Oliver</inline> to report upon these works. The special grievance I desire to ventilate on this motion is that the Home Affairs Department has in my opinion deliberately flouted the express desire of the Senate that all the papers connected with the engagement of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Oliver</inline> should be submitted for the inspection of senators. </para>

                    <para>. - Last week there was laid on the table of the Senate the award by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Powers in the case of the Postal Assistants Union. Though, in the main, I have been able to agree with the decisions given by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Higgins, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Powers, and other Justices of the Arbitration Court, I wish to enter my protest against the award given in this case by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Powers. The members of the Postal Assistants Union spent about £500 in getting their case before the Arbitration Court. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Powers, by his decision, has raised the wages of senior postal assistants by £6, namely from £126 to £132 per annum, but the wages of those in the junior grades are left stationary at £126 by his award. As this may be the last opportunity to protest against the award, I wish now to say that I am totally opposed to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Powers' decision, and formally enter my protest against it. I know the union has spent about £500 and levied fees to the extent of about a guinea per member, and yet, after fighting this case over a lengthy period, the men find that they are no better off than when they entered into litigation. I trust that the Senate will see that the award is altered. </para>

                    <para>. - I cannot allow the opportunity to pass without once more referring to the vagaries of the censor - that military demon who is causing so much trouble. Over and over again we received assurances from the Minister and his departmental officers that the censorship was to be relaxed, but I find that the censor has been busy on a speech of mine made last Thursday. Of course, the censor could not touch the speech in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard,</inline> but somebody thought fit to republish it as a pamphlet, and the censor proceeded to mutilate it. I made a perfectly innocent quotation, although one necessary for the purpose of proving my point, but the censor has rendered the whole quotation useless. I was quoting a letter written by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Ross,</inline> of the <inline font-style="italic">Socialist,</inline> and a portion which I quoted stated - </para>

                    <para>I have also to complain of the wording of a wire from myself to the Amalgamated Miners Association of Broken Hill being altered by the censor. </para>
                </quote>
                <para class="block">In the name of Heaven, what is there in that statement for the censor to take exception to ? Yet it is an important part of the letter. The letter continued: - " The wire was not sent as written, and, consequently." That also was struck out. Further, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Eoss</inline> stated, " I cannot now get <inline font-style="italic">Barrier Daily Truth</inline> through the post." That has been struck out. What advantage can there be in the censor cutting up a speech in that fashion ? If a senator's speech has been allowed to appear in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard,</inline> and it contains nothing of a seditious character or prejudicial to the safety of the nation, there is no reason why it should be mutilated. </para>

I have here news from Broken Hill which it was desired to publish in the <inline font-style="italic">Socialist,</inline> but because the writer stated that " batons were freely used " at a certain gathering - a statement of fact - ;the news has been censored.

                        <para>- This is entirely new matter. I have here an item of news dealing with the proposed general strike, which appeared m the Brisbane <inline font-style="italic">Daily Standard</inline> over a week ago, and yet when it was desired to insert the information in the Melbourne <inline font-style="italic">Socialist,</inline> the foolish censor intervened. I do not blame the censor for carrying out his instructions. That item of news  merely.  imparts general information as to the procedure to be adopted in Brisbane to-day in connexion with the stoppage of work, and if such, information could he allowed to appear in the daily press of Brisbane, there is no reason, except the stupidity of the censor,, why it should be refused .publication in Melbourne. I have other matter which appeared in <inline font-style="italic">The Worker,</inline> Sydney, some weeks ago, but, although it passed the censor there, the <inline font-style="italic">Socialist</inline> is -denied the right to republish it. Can the Minister justify such action? I "have volumes of matter which show how stupid the whole censorship is, how difficult it is to control, and how impossible to have uniformity in connexion with it. The censor in one State has a certain plan, and the censor in another State a different plan. </para>

                        <para>- No ; but we could have the same policy in each State. An item of news from Wonthaggi regarding the action which is to be taken there today in connexion with the stop-work protest has also been censored. There is nothing seditious in it, nothing that by any stretch of the imagination could be construed into jeopardizing the 'safety of the nation, and yet it has been suppressed. I might quote volumes of matter .which has been censored for no good purpose during the past few weeks. J might usefully occupy the time of the Senate for an hour or two in showing the enlightenment which has been lost to the public through the stupidity of the censor. But in deference to the wishes of honorable senators I will not delay them longer. I make this final appeal to the .Minister to give  u9  a fair deal in the forthcoming campaign. If the censorship as it is practised at present is to be adhered to, there is no guarantee that the opponents of conscription will receive a square deal. I hope that the Minister will prove him-  self  a big man in this matter by giving us unlimited latitude to discuss its pros and cons so long as we do not utter anything traitorous or seditious. # </para>
