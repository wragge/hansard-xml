                    <para class="block">Australia to do this, and as they believe that their opinion is one which is held by the country generally, they have formulated a policy which they believe to be at once adequate to meet the gravity of our circumstances and compatible with the principles of democratic government under which it is our privilege to live. </para>
                    <para>The Prime Minister intends to-morrow to lay before members of both Houses the position as he knows it to be, and as set out in the recent secret communications from the Army Council of Great Britain; but it is due to the public that they should be told how imperative and urgent the demand for men is. The number of reinforcements required for next month is 33,500, and subsequently 16,500 a month. The number of recruits for June was 6,375, July 6,170, and up to 23rd August 4,144, or a total of 16,689. The most recent list for eleven days shows the number of casualties to be 6,743. These figures speak for themselves. </para>
                    <para>They show that the position with which the Government confronts the Parliament and the people is that, while it is our clear duty to keep the number of our Forces up to their full strength, the stream of recruits under the voluntary system has fallen to less than one-third of what is necessary. </para>
                    <para>The great offensive, in which our troops have covered themselves with glory, has cost a fearful price, yet it is, and must be, pressed forward with implacable resolution. To falter now is to make the great sacrifice of lives of no avail; to enable the enemy to recover himself, and, if not to defeat us, to prolong the struggle indefinitely, and thus rob the world of all hope of a lasting peace. The sure road, the speedy road, the only road, to victory is to press on. Now is the psychological moment when every ounce of effort is called for. </para>
                    <para>To the principle of compulsion for military training and service the country has long been committed. But a clear line has been drawn between compulsory service within the Commonwealth and for service overseas. For the first we relied entirely upon compulsion; for the latter upon voluntaryism. Until recently voluntary recruiting proved sufficient to meet the demands made upon us, but latterly </para>
                    <para class="block">It has quite failed to do so. This failure, however, does not release us from our obligation to the Empire, to its Allies, and to the Commonwealth, whose fortunes rise or fall with the ebb and flow of this dreadful war. For it is literally true that defeat in this war sounds the death knell of all our hopes and aspirations, and robs as at one stroke of all the privileges and liberties that make our lives worth living. Though voluntaryism fails, the country must not fail. It dare not ; its honour and its safety are alike at stake. </para>
                    <para>But this is a country where the people rule, and in this crisis - in which their future is concerned - their voice must be heard. The will of the nation must be ascertained. Autocracy forces its decrees upon the people; Democracy ascertains, and then carries out, the wishes of the people. In these circumstances the Government consider there is but one course to pursue, namely, to ask the electors for their authority to make up the deficiency by compulsion. </para>
                    <para>Set out briefly, the policy of the Government is to take a referendum of the people at the earliest possible moment upon the question whether they approve of compulsory oversea service to the extent necessary to keep our Expeditionary Forces at their full strength. If the majority of the people approve, compulsion will be applied to the extent that voluntaryism fails. Otherwise it will not. </para>
                    <para>I now make an earnest appeal to every recruiting agency and centre to use their every effort to encourage voluntary recruiting, and to the men of fighting age to enlist in the defence of their country. If volunteers respond in sufficient numbers there will be no need for compulsion. But to the extent that voluntary recruiting fails to supply the numbers necessary the Government will use the authority of the people, if given, to call to the colours, until the supply is exhausted, single men without dependants. It is not intended, until the supply of single men without dependants is exhausted, to apply compulsion to married men, youths under twenty-one, to single men with dependants, or to the remaining sons of families in which one or more of the members have, already volunteered. </para>
                    <para>As the necessity for more men is not only imperative, but urgent, and in order that the approval of the people, if given, should not be abortive, and, coming too late, leave our soldiers at the front without support of an adequate supply of trained reinforcements, the Government have decided that if within one month the appeal for volunteers does not bring in a sufficient number of recruits, they will issue a proclamation under the Defence Act and call up for purposes of training the number of single men without dependants necessary to make good the deficiency. I hope that the appeal which I now make to the patriotism of Australian manhood will make such proclamation unnecessary. </para>
                    <para>Unless and until the, people of Australia approve of extending the compulsory provision of the Defence Act to service overseas, no man will be sent away against his will. </para>

                        are passing through the greatest crisis in our history. Our national existence, our liberties, are at stake. There rests upon every man an obligation to do his duty in the spirit that befits free men. The Government asks men to make a great sacrifice; it asks them to risk their lives in order to save their country.
                        <inline font-weight="bold">Sir, I</inline>
                        believe that they are prepared to make this sacrifice. Bat the country must in its turn prove itself worthy of such men. There must be, as far as humanly possible, equality of sacrifice. Wealth has its duties; it owes all it has to the State, and must be prepared, if necessary, to sacrifice that all to the State. Many wealthy men have responded nobly to the call of duty; others have not. But they cannot be allowed thus to evade their responsibilities.
                    </para>
                    <para>All other considerations must be swept aside; one great principle must now govern our every action. Whatever is necessary for the salvation of the country must be done; and since we are calling upon men to sacrifice their lives, we ought not, and shall not, hesitate to compel men to sacrifice their wealth. </para>
                    <para>The secret session of both Houses of which I have spoken will commence at 5 p.m. to-morrow in the Senate Club Room. I ask leave to continue my remarks on the next day of sitting. </para>

                        <para>. - There was one announcement made by the Minister of Defence to which I should like to refer. He intimated the desire of the Government that there should be a secret session of members of both Houses of this Parliament to-morrow afternoon. I wish to ask honorable senators to regard it and accept it as an obligation that after that secret conference is over there shall be no reference made to it, good, bad, or indifferent, by any one present at it. I feel compelled to make this request because, on a previous occasion, after such a gathering, statements were made in this chamber and elsewhere which, whilst they in no sense disclosed what transpired at the secret session, constituted a suggestion that the information imparted led only to one conclusion. That may have been due only to thoughtlessness. </para>

                        <para>- Order! <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> is, under cover of the motion for the adjournment of the Senate, proceeding to discuss a statement made by the Minister of Defence which has not yet been completed, and which there will be ample opportunity to discuss on Friday next. Its discussion has become a part of the business of the Senate set down -for another day. It will appear on the business-paper of the Senate, and our Standing Orders are emphatic that no honorable senator may anticipate the discussion of business on the paper. As soon as I understood the direction in which the honorable senator desired to proceed, I stopped him. I rule that he will be out of order in proceeding on those lines. </para>
