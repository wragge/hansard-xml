          <para>The  PRESIDENT.-  I call attention again to the fact that I have repeatedly ruled that, under the Standing Orders and the practice of Parliament, questions with or without notice are only permissible for the purpose of obtaining information, and that the answers are subject to exactly the same limitation, that is to say, they are limited to supplying the information asked for by the questions. The questions asked by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Story</inline> are plain and direct, and each could be answered by a plain &#34;Yes&#34; or &#34;No.&#34; I have allowed the Minister to proceed with his reply to the questions, up to a certain point. It must be admitted that the answer he has so far read more than adequately answers the questions put. But the answer proceeds to argue a contention with regard to something about which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Story</inline> did not ask for any information at all. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Story</inline> asked for no information as to the plans or estimates that were submitted to the Public Works Committee. The answer the Minister was proceeding to give enters upon a long explanation and reasons on this subject; and I have, therefore, to rule him out of order on that portion of the answer to the questions that have been put. </para>
