An appeal will lie if an applicant desires to appeal from those Courts to a State Supreme Court; and, if he has grounds, with the consent of the State Supreme Court, to a Judge of . the High Court. </para>

                        <para>- Statements have been published in the newspapers regarding the manner in which the proposed tax on amusements will affect certain industries. I have no doubt about the operation of the tax, but in order to remove doubts in the minds of people outside I ask the Minister representing the Treasurer whether the tax will affect, not merely places of amusement generally recognised as such, but will apply to cricket, football, racing, golf, angling, tennis,- and other clubs, to regattas, and to every kind of association that can be said to cater for the amusement or pleasure of the people? </para>

The total amount provided under the Supply (Works and Buildings) Bill (No. 1), 1916-17, and this Bill, which together will cover five months of the current financial year, is &#163;214,045 in excess of five-twelfths of the amount appropriated for 1915-16. With that exception, the measure has been framed on the basis of the Estimates for 1915-16, which have been approved by Parliament.

The increased expenditure in the Department of Home Affairs is explained by the fact that the Works Estimates for 1915-16 were reduced to the lowest possible amount, but that commitments have resulted in payments having to be made during the earlier portion of this year in excess of the annual rate for 1915-16. The increase in the vote for Naval Works has been caused by the acquisition of land  at Cockburn Sound, the purchase of which was not contemplated when the Estimates for last year were framed, but which it has been found wise to purchase on account of the rapid increase in land values there. This purchase has already been approved, and payment is expected to be made before the 30th November. The extra amount set down on account of </para>

                            <para>- I have not beard of it. In regard to Division 14, relating to the construction of the Fleet, I wish to say that the remittances to London happen to come into this portion of the financial year, and are in excess of the five-twelfths expenditure on that item. The proposed appropriation on account of vessels for other Departments is mainly for the construction of steamers for the Department of Trade and Customs, for lighthouse purposes. Owing to the taking over of the lighthouses, it will be necessary for the Commonwealth to secure additional steamers, and the expenditure upon them will come into this portion of the financial year. Hence the excess on that particular vote. With these exceptions the remainder of the expenditure provided for in the Bill. is normal, and is based on the commitments for various works throughout the Commonwealth, which Parliament has approved. </para>

                <para>I wish to say that it is one of three amending Bills which are necessary in connexion with our various taxing Acts. All have the same purport, and deal with the same subject. As honorable senators are aware, the amount of our taxation, and the scope of it, have immensely increased since the outbreak of the war. We had a Commissioner of Taxation in the person of the late <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McKay,</inline> who was one of the most valuable of our public servants, but, unfortunately, we lost him through death. Before his demise, the Government had arrived at the conclusion that it was absolutely necessary that he should be provided with assistance in the form or an Assistant Commissioner, and we had decided to ask Parliament to agree to the creation of that office. This Bill, and the two which&#39; will follow it, provide for the appointment of an Assistant Commissioner of Taxation, who, in the event of the illness or absence from duty of the Commissioner, -will be able to take his place, and who at other times will be in a position to relieve him of a certain amount of work. I am sure honorable senators will agree with me that, dealing as we do with so many forms of taxation, it is necessary we should have ample and competent officers at the head of that Department. In the circumstances, therefore, I think -there will be no opposition to &#39;this Bill. </para>

                    <para>I desire to point out that the Bill authorizes an increase in a maximum payment of pensions under the Invalid and Old-age Pensions Act, from &#163;26 per year to &#163;32 10s., or, in other words, an additional 2s. 6d. per week -to those who are entitled to the maximum rate. Where a claimant for a pension is in receipt of board and lodging the maximum amount which shall be included as income on account of such board and lodging, is to be increased from 5s. to 7s. 6d. per week. A sum of 2s. per week is now proposed to be paid in cases where a magistrate has decided that a claimant is unfit to be trusted with a pension, but that&#39; sum is not to be paid until the claimant enters a benevolent asylum. A new provision is proposed to be made authorizing payment of moneys due to a pensioner, while in a benevolent asylum, to the asylum for the benefit of the pensioner. Production of the pension certificate in such, case may be dispensed with. I feel sure that all honorable members of the Senate are heartily in accord with this Bill, and with the provisions by which inmates of benevolent asylums will be able to get a few shillings to spend on tobacco and other comforts. This has been a sore point with them for years, and is a concession which, I think, is thoroughly justified. No doubt there are many other ways in which the Old-age Pensions Act &#39; could be further liberalized, and I wish to say that the Government intend to look into a number of questions affecting this measure. There is, for instance, the question of exemptions, and 1 know several honorable senators are interested in the matter of pensions for blind people. The Treasurer has given a promise- that he will see whether there are any cases of hardship to be remedied. </para>

                        <para>. - Whilst I am profoundly disappointed at the taxation proposals of the Government which, we are informed, will be submitted to this- Chamber later on in the session, I am pleased beyond measure at the introduction of this Bill, which seeks to- give a greater measure of justice to those who have laboured long and incessantly in the field of industry throughout Australia and some of whom to-day are in receipt of the invalid or old-age pension. The Bill provides for an increase of 2s. 6d. per week, and, directly bearing upon this point, there appeared in the editorial columns- of the <inline font-style="italic">Argus</inline> yesterday an article which, for cold bloodedness and heartlessness, has never been equalled in the columns of any newspaper in Australia before. That article contained the statement that the proposed increase in income tax would realize &#163;1,000.000, which was to be handed over as a gift to the invalid and old-age pensioners. The article went on further to say that it was to be given over to persons who- could make no productive use of it. Here in Australia we have a large army of men- and women invalided and totally incapacitated, and because they are not able- to produce in </para>

                    <para class="block">Australia now, this paper says that, in these times, when the cost of living is so high, they should be denied the very necessaries of life. This party stands for justice to the people who are unable to do anything for themselves. I would not. care if the amount of pension were doubled, &#39;if the occasion demanded it. In such circumstances the Government would be justified in introducing even a larger measure of taxation in order to deal justly with these people.- It is proposed to raise, approximately, &#163;3,000,000 by war profits taxation. From whom will that sum be exacted but the people who, apparently, during this war have made undue profits, and, in doing so, have increased the cost of living all round ? No section in the community has felt this burden more than the invalid and old-age pensioners. It appears to me that there is a move, in certain directions, to prevent the invalid and old-age pensioners from getting the increase, for in to-day&#39;s <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> I read a copy of a circular which apparently is being distributed in Western Australia dealing with this matter.

                            <para>- I have seen it stated that he has had a pension for some years and that he will enjoy it for the remainder of his life. And yet he is one of those who, apparently, are prepared to subscribe to a fund the object of which is to oppose taxation proposals to be submitted to us later on. When  Invalid  and Old-age Pensions Bills were last before the respective Chambers, they met with a good deal of opposition in both places, and the newspapers which supported those honorable members then are, apparently, just as determined now to prevent, at all hazards, an increase of this very small sum to the  unfortunate  citizens of this country. No man with a vein of sympathy in him could find any fault with the measure before us to-day, and yet that circle of readers catered for by the <inline font-style="italic">Argus</inline> appears to be indifferent to the sufferings of those who have not been able to provide for themselves. No section of the community should enlist fuller sympathy. To me the proposed increase does not seem to be enough, for if 10s. were considered necessary before the war, another 5s. at least ought to be added to the amount now paid. The opposition of the <inline font-style="italic">Argus</inline> is apparently dictated in the interests of that section of the community which has never borne its full share of the burdens- of government. The only way they think the country can be governed and financed is to lower wages, increase the cost of living, and wipe out old-age and invalid pensions. I hope the day will never come when a majority of the members of this Legislature will wipe such a humane Act off our statute-book. It is an Act which we take some pride in, having passed through both Chambers, and which commends itself to the humanistic feelings of every one who possesses them. When a paper such as the <inline font-style="italic">Argus,</inline> with a circle of readers probably next in size to that of its contemporary down the street, goes out of its way to attack this section of the community, it stings one to think that in this altruistic age such a cold-blooded and heartless leader could be published, and that that journal should have the audacity - as it had - to ask that section which it supports in Parliament, and that section in the community which subscribes to it outside, to do all they can to prevent the passage of such a measure, in order that those who are able to bear more burdens than they are carrying to-day may be relieved even of those burdens, and that pensioners shall continue to endure hardship and misery, possibly multiplied and intensified. I have no time or sympathy for such writers or for the people who agree with them. When we have another opportunity of considering the Government&#39;s financial proposals, I shall endeavour, with other honorable members, to see that the taxation expedients of the Government, which were, apparently, received with applause in another place because they were not what the Opposition anticipated, are replaced by something which will not cause them so much satisfaction. I rose to express my pleasure at the opportunity presented to me and others to support this liberal measure, which, I hope, will be the forerunner of one still more liberal to the old-age pensioners of Australia. </para>

All who are now present in this chamber belong to the one party, the Opposition being invisible, and I would impress on them the absolute necessity of sinking non-essentials and sticking to our platform. Only in that way can we maintain the confidence of the people and remain in a position where we shall be able to resist any encroachment upon the measures placed on the statute-book by our party. </para>

                    <para>We have been told that the proclamation is to be issued on Monday next, and there does not appear to be the slightest intention on the part of the Government to call Parliament together within ten days after the issue of the proclamation. The Government would appear to intend to sidestep the law as it stands to-day. In this supreme crisis they should be straightforward. They should put their cards on the table so that every man in the Commonwealth may know exactly what ia their intention. If they intend to summon Parliament that they may be able to explain the reasons why they are calling up the troops, and that Parliament may be given an opportunity to approve or disapprove of their proposed action, they should say so. The real position is that they do not contemplate calling Parliament together, and. they intend to rely upon the fact that what is proposed is only an adjournment, and not a prorogation; to claim that Parliament will technically be sitting, and that the law will be complied with. That may be a technical compliance with&#39; the law, but it will violate its spirit, which is that in such a supreme crisis Parliament should be called together so that honorable members may have (stated to them the reasons why the Government propose taking so grave a step, and they should then decide, in view of the reasons submitted, whether the step is justified or not. It is the duty of every member of this Senate to maintain his rights and the rights of the people in this matter, and that he may be given an opportunity to do so I intend to move as an amendment to the motion that the Senate, at its rising, adjourn till Wednesday next. I understand that the proclamation will have been issued before that time. If it has not been issued by Wednesday next we can have a further adjournment. I want to put the position fairly and squarely before honorable senators. Let them make no mistake about it. Every man who votes for the motion submitted by the Minister for Defence will take upon himself the responsibility of aiding and abetting the Government in calling up our men. That is the position, and it is just as well that it should be defined to honorable senators. Every member of the Senate who votes for the motion will be helping to give effect to the proclamation, because he will be enabling the Government to take the course proposed, without giving  Parlia-ment  .an opportunity to challenge their action. If my amendment be agreed to, whilst the proclamation may still be issued, it cannot be given effect without our indorsement. Who is to be supreme in this crisis? Honorable senators must decide on this motion, whether it is the Government for the time being or the Parliament. So far as I am concerned, I arn not going to allow any Executive or any coterie of men to decide my action in the matter. I sincerely hope that those who are against the action of the Government in attempting to disregard Parliament and to violate the laws of the land in this supreme crisis, will, by supporting the amendment I have indicated, refuse to permit them to do so. I move - </para>

All that it is necessary for the honorable senator to do to accomplish what he desires is to negative the motion. If the motion is not carried the Senate will meet at 3 &#39;o&#39;clock on Wednesday, in accordance with Sessional Orders. If the honorable senator were to move that the Senate, at its rising, adjourn to some unusual hour, such as 3 o&#39;clock on Tuesday, or some other non-sitting day, that would be an amendment which I could accept, because it would not be a direct negative of the motion. </para>

No matter of greater moment to the people of Australia, or to this Parliament, has been dealt with in this Chamber than that which is involved in the amendment submitted by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Mullan.</inline> We are told that the proclamation is to be issued pn Monday, and &#39;that regulations will also be issued; but none of us have the slightest idea what those regulations will contain.- This morning I put two or three questions to the Minister for Defence which were pertinent to the matter we are now discussing. He said, in reply, that when the call is made of men between twenty-one and thirty-five years of age, an opportunity will be given to those who desire to be exempted to make an application for exemption before recognised tribunals. Some who make application will go into camp and remain there until their applications have been decided. The Minister said, further, that there will be some who will not be required to go into camp after making application for exemption. He told us that a committee is to be appointed of civilians and not of military men - though he did not say how many would form the committee, or who were to be the members of it - to deal with applications from all parts of Australia for exemptions. </para>

When a motion such as that submitted by the Minister for Defence is passed, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker</inline> and myself look upon ourselves as placed in the same position as that occupied by the Governor-General, and we act only upon the advice of the responsible advisers of the Crown. I would never call the Senate together upon my own initiative. It would be useless for me to do so if the Government were not prepared to go on with business. I would refuse to accept the responsibility of having to call the Senate together on my own initiative, because that is a responsibility which should not be , placed upon the presiding officer of the Senate, who occupies a semi- judicial position. It is a duty which devolves upon the responsible Ministers of the Crown, who are charged with the . duty of carrying on the business of the country in an orderly and proper way. </para>

                        <para>. - On behalf of the Government, I wish to say that the proclamation has already been issued. It was issued to-day, and it was issued in accordance with the provisions of the Defence Act. Honorable senators may rest assured that all the requirements of the Act have been, and will be, most carefully observed. I cannot say more than that for the simple reason that I am not a constitutional lawyer. But the action taken by the Government has been taken in accordance with the best constitutional advice that we could get. The proclamation has been issued, and we are complying with the law. </para>

I ask honorable senators to accept that assurance, which is given in all honesty and sincerity.

                        <para>. - With all due respect to him, I think that the Minister for Defence has made his case much weaker than it was. If, in response to the questions which I put to him yesterday, he had given the explanation which he has now given, I might not have taken the stand which I did. The Defence Act provides that when the proclamation calling up men for service is issued Parliament shall be summoned, to discuss the reasons for issuing that proclamation, within ten days. Last night the Minister stated that he would follow the law and the Constitution in regard to this matter. But we did not then know whether Parliament would be sitting when the proclamation was issued. In the newspapers this morning, however, the Prime Minister is reported as having definitely stated that Parliament will not be sitting next week. If I had received that reply yesterday it would have been a straight-out, honest answer to an honest and courteous question. I contend that the Defence Act is not being observed in regard to this matter. The Minister has told us that the proclamation has been issued. That is all the more reason why this Parliament should meet to discuss the reasons for the issue of that proclamation, and to debate the proclamation itself. If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Mullan</inline> had not moved his amendment the Senate would have been adjourned till an indefinite date, and we would not have known that the proclamation has already been issued. The information has only now been dragged from the Minister. </para>

But under the provisions of the Defence Act, this Parliament has the right to discuss the reasons why the proclamation has been issued, and also the regulations in connexion therewith.

                            <para>- As <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Mullan</inline> has interjected, we have not seen a copy of the proclamation, and we have not been made acquainted by the Government with their reasons for issuing it. My reading of the sub-section which I have quoted is that if Parliament be sitting a copy of the proclamation must be laid on the table of the Senate, and the reasons for issuing it must be stated to Parliament, whereas if Parliament be not sitting it must be summoned to meet within ten days of the issue of the proclamation. For what purpose must it be summoned ? To hear the Government&#39;s reasons for issuing the proclamation. Now I think that the Government have an easy way out of this difficulty. They can at once state their reasons for issuing the proclamation. Parliament is sitting. The opportunity is here. The Government will be well advised if they take advantage of that opportunity. If they do so, they will be complying with the Act, and the necessity for meeting next week will be obviated. </para>

                            <para>- I have information which shows that there is trouble there. I have been told that on Monday evening,, at Broken Hill, forty policemen threatened with revolvers and used their batons upon a decidedly good-humoured crowd of men, women, and children. This, it appears, is the first blow in for the conscriptionists. My information shows that there is a great deal of excitement and indignation there as the result of this action, and that probably there will be a general strike at Broken Hill on Monday next. </para>

                            <para>- I am pleased to know that the honorable senator&#39;s position is so perfectly clear. I want also to define my position, and I draw attention to the fact that there is altogether too much censoring of news just at present. The public ought to know what is being done. Even in this Senate we cannot get information from the Minister concerning the happenings from day to day. We have been told that the men at Broken Hill regard this as a dastardly, and probably an inspired, attempt to place them in a false position. Anyhow, if they go out on strike next Monday, it will probably be as a result of the great provocation they have received by this wholesale batoning of men, women, and children. I understand that six women were batoned and injured on Monday night; and my information shows that an attack was made upon peaceable citizens holding a good- humoured demonstration. This, then, is a sample of that Prussianism, which at the outbreak of the war, we all hoped would not be imported into Australia, and which our men have gone overseas to fight against. This, it appears, is the sort of treatment we are going to get even before we adopt the pet scheme of conscription favoured by some honorable senators. </para>

                        <para>. - I wish also to urge upon the Government the necessity of paying a little attention to this much-abused Department of the Commonwealth Censorship. I realize, of course, that it is- impossible for the censors to . satisfy all parties, because the men appointed to these positions are only human and liable to err on both sides; </para>

                            <para>- I am glad to have the honorable senator&#39;s manly expression of opinion, because it makes my task all the lighter. I intend to repeat what I said the other day, that the censorship in Western Australia, by some means or other, has been directed against the cause of conscription. At a recent meeting of the Trades Hall Council, Fremantle - a body composed of a large number of delegates whose business it is to look after the industrial interests of the western State - a motion was tabled in favour of bringing about a general strike, in the event of conscription being decided upon. Notice . of that motion was given wide publicity; the public knew when it was to be debated ; but when it was defeated by 35 votes to5, although the representatives of the press were present, and reported the overwhelming rejection of the motion, the censor censored it. The much-abused office of censor is just as much directed against one - side as the . other. In Western Australia, at a meeting of the metropolitan council, held to discuss the question of supporting or rejecting the Government policy, the question was debated at full length, and it was ultimately decided by a majority, which I am not in a position to state, that the council stand behind the Government. That was censored. Where is <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Mullan</inline> now, that he does not protest ? Where are the other&#39; honorable senators who look -upon the censorship as an evil instrument, to be used on all. occasions against theanti-conscriptionists&#39;? I should not . mention these trifles but for the extraordinary attitude of those who look on the censorship as a kind of weapon that will shoot in one direction and not in another. Those are two important cases, where the censorship in Western Australia . was directed towards suppressing opinions in favour of conscription. Therefore, I say, let these men hold their peace. </para>

                            <para>- Does the honorable senator . call the metropolitan council of his fellow workers in Western Australia  an isolated case ? Is the opinion of a body representing 80,000 persons in the western  State an isolated case ? That argument will . not hold water with me. It looks both ways in most awkward fashion for honorable senators who think they see the hand of the tyrant in this . matter,. Complaints have also been made about mayors receiving notices from the Federal Government with regard to the referendum. </para>

                    <para>I have to . lodge a complaint - on the strength of rumours, it is true; but, seeing that many statements are made on the strength of rumours, I may as well be in as out of the fashion. We have, a very important centre in Western Australia, called Yorkrakine. The mayor has not been invited up to date to take action, nor has he had any notification from the Federal Government. I want to enter my protest here, as. solemnly as I can, and with all the force, at my command, against such treatment of that dignitary. It is not fair to this rising centre that ite mayor should not be treated with the same consideration as the mayors of other States. </para>

                            <para>- Honorable senators around&#39; me who ask where Yorkrakine is have evidently not. been far &#34; out-back.&#34; They, may have been as far as Flemington ; but even that&#39; is not far enough to enable&#39; them to gain &#34; out-back &#34; experience. They do- not know where&#39; Yorkrakine in. I am treating this matter quite seriously in the interests of that rising and flourishing centre in the western State. I protest against the action of the Federal Government in not sending an invitation to the mayor of that classic resort to see that the common sense of that community is aroused in this great crisis. I am speaking in the interests of the pioneers of the western State, which is made up of the best men in the Commonwealth; because, after all, those who remain in this State are the people who stopped behind where the soup kitchens were some time ago. The men in the West are the men who pressed out, and are to be found in the neighbourhood of Yorkrakine. They and their families have gone to build up the prosperity that surrounds that centre of advanced civilization, culture, and prosperity in Western Australia - Yorkrakine of to-day. Again I say, according to rumour, its mayor has not received an invitation. I admit that I am going on no better foundation than rumour; but, all the same, I want to enter my earnest protest against the action of the Federal Government in not seeing that the mayor of Yorkrakine is treated with the same courtesy and consideration, and regarded&#39; as of the same importance, as the mayor of Melbourne, Sydney, Brisbane, or. Adelaide. </para>
