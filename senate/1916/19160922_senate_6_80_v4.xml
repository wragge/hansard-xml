                            <para>- I speak peculiarly and particularly as a representative of Australia. I say at the outset that I support the proposal for a referendum, because I believe that the people of the whole Continent are those best qualified to decide the question which has been raised, it being they who will have to bear the effects of the decision arrived at. Look at it as I may, I cannot take the view of some of my honorable friends who, because they do not believe in conscription, object to this referendum. They have a right to their view, and I do not question their motives, but, having been a humble student of Democracy, it appears to me that the members of the Labour party, who have advocated the principle of the referendum, and particularly an initiative referendum, whereby the whole people may decide every great question, should not shrink, or pause, or falter when the issue happens to be one which they may wish to have decided in the negative. If the principle of the referendum is sound, it should be made to apply equally to proposals which we favour and to those which we oppose. </para>

                    <para>In this instance, I shall not vote against the submission to the people of the conscription proposals of the Government, although. I hope that an affirmative answer will not be given to the question to be asked. We have had a good many exhibitions of inconsistency in regard to the principle of the referendum in Tasmania. Honorable senators opposed to us have repeatedly supported the submission of questions to the people when it suited them to do so, and opposed the referendum at other times. I am not going to be. guilty of that inconsistency. At the same time, I  am in opposition to the policy of the Government in anticipating the will of the people of Australia regarding military service. I cannot support their action in calling up men for training before the people have said whether the principle of compulsion is to be adopted. </para>

                            <para>- Were I to vote against the Bill, I should vote against the principle of the referendum, and that I am not prepared to do. In proposing to inaugurate a policy of conscription, the Government have, in my opinion, made a grave mistake. Prior to the introduction of this proposal for conscription, we had in  Australia a nation absolutely unanimous as to the conduct of the war; all slight differences of opinion had been dispersed and replaced by a remarkable unanimity of purpose; few persons were actuated by  any  other motive than that of successfully carrying on the war. What will be the effect of the Government&#39;s proposal ? That splendid singleness of purpose, and that cohesion of all parts of the continent, will disappear, and be replaced by discord, dissatisfaction, strife of the worst possible kind, angry recriminations, and feelings of bitterness induced by a referendum fight. Both sides will exert themselves to do their utmost to secure what they believe to be right, and to the outside world we shall present the spectacle, not of a united Australia, but rather of a warring and disunited continent. The Government&#39;s policy will divide the nation and introduce suspicion - disorder will be avoided, I trust - but from that standpoint Ministers have made a grave mistake. </para>

                    <para>Why has this proposal been brought forward ? Twelve months ago we read of German successes everywhere and every day; we had to evacuate the Dardanelles; Servia was overrun by the enemy; the Germans were steadily encroaching inch by inch on Verdun; and though the actual position may have been skilfully concealed in the headlines of the newspapers, we could not help feeling that things were going badly with the Allies, and that they were not holding their own. What was the stand-point of the public then ? Every one was optimistic, and assured of victory; so much so that I frequently used to ask myself whether we were not like ostriches, hiding our heads in the sand and refusing to look at the stern facts. Twelve months ago the calm assurance of the man in the street that we were going to win was amazing. To-day, when we know, from evidence given daily in the press, and from statements by leading men in the Empire, that the position of the Allies has improved, we have the anachronism of an urgent request for men. Will honorable members accept the word of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bonar</inline> Law, quoted by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley</inline> last night, and General Joffre, that Germany is defeated ? </para>

Although the outlook is brighter today, although the horizon is clearer, we find, instead of optimism, nothing but pessimism and gloom. From the utterances of the Prime Minister and many supporters of conscription, one would imagine that the Empire was tottering to its fall, and that, unless we can send 100,000 men from Australia to the fields of Flanders, we may as well give up the ghost and become slaves to the Germans. On the other hand, General Joffre and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bonar</inline> Law say that Germany is defeated, and that it is only a matter of time before we drive the enemy back. </para>

                            <para>- Then, does not the honorable senator regard it as a peculiar fact that the British Government have thought fit to appoint a Royal Commission for the purpose of inquiring into the conduct of the Dardanelles campaign ? If the honorable senator had talked with some of the Australian soldiers and officers who have returned from Gallipoli, as I have done, he would wish for an inquiry. I am not afraid of having my words recorded when I say that the Dardanelles campaign was messed by the high command from end to end; and the British Army Council was responsible for that messing. This war correspondent shows that the campaign was badly conceived and badly carried out - not so far as our gallant lads were concerned; they covered themselves with glory, but were hurled into the slaughter. The conception and carrying out of the scheme were in the hands of British generals. This writer says that the initial blunder was the attempt to force the Dardanelles with warships alone, and that every tactician is opposed to such an unreasonable mode of procedure. On page 2i, he says - </para>

                        <para>A neutral officer who has been with the Turkish armies from the beginning of hostilities assured me that three divisions disembarked on that fatal day in March might have marched triumphantly from the heel to the neck of the Gallipoli Peninsula at  Bulair.  This statement was based upon the knowledge of the number of Turkish troops in the sector at that time, and their state of preparedness. A German officer  confirmed this assertion. He argued that the loss of this opportunity stamped the British staff, or those who planned the coup, as men of mediocre military calibre. </para>

I would have called up the men of Australia for home defence, and would have done so in such a way as not to interfere with their ordinary avocations. I should have done this by requiring them to attend Saturday afternoon and evening parades.

                            <para>- Yes. If the Government are correct in the statements they make in regard to the seriousness of the position, then the only legitimate course open to us is to pool all we possess, and to draw out only enough to live upon. That is a simple scheme to conscript the wealth of the country; but it does not commend itself to honorable senators who whole-heartedly support conscription. </para>

                            <para>- I have been asked what would happen under this scheme of conscription if it were approved by the people. My reply is that even if we did conscript the manhood of Australia, not one man so conscripted would go to the front within the next six months. I do not think we should adopt conscription; but, if it were carried, not one conscript would be at the front within six months&#39; time. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> said last night, in the Melbourne Town Hall: &#34; Now is the time when every man is worth ten in six months&#39; time. It is with nations as it is with <inline font-style="italic">men</inline> in the prize-ring.&#34; Thus, on the Prime Minister&#39;s own showing, the men conscripted could not reach the front - and I have not torn his statement from its context - in time to be of any real service. </para>

I do not desire to wittingly misrepresent him. He has been inferring that the war will be over by the end of June next, and that only single men will be required by us; but we know that, if conscription is carried, not one conscript can go into the field from Australia within the next six months. </para>

                            <para>- If we had that assurance, more men, no doubt, would be sent. I am opposed to conscription, however, on the further ground that I do not believe that the men we could send would be anything like the deciding factor in this war. I am opposed to it, also, because I believe the people will resent and resist it. Instead of making for national efficiency, and for the co-ordination and co-operation of parties, it will divide us. Instead of making for strength, it will make for inherent and lamentable weakness. I am against conscription, too, because I am not assured that if the .people were to vote &#34; Yes,&#34; the present Government would be on the Treasury bench six months hence. I have no guarantee of that. Events happen very rapidly in politics. </para>

The Prime Minister and others make light of industrial conscription.&#39; It is no light matter, however, for those who produce the wealth of this country. For them it fs a matter of very serious concern. It will not affect the members of this Parliament. But what about these men ? It is idle to say it will not or may not affect them. I have here a quotation from a statement made by M.- Merriman, the Secretary of the French Metal Workers Federation, with regard to conscription in France - an Allied country.

It would be a terrible weapon in the hands- of your employers, 8s it is actually in the hands of French employers. Already they are demanding the continuance after the war of the arbitrary discipline and general draconian conditions of labour that exist in the factories to-day. Some have passed resolutions demanding the permanent return of a twelve-hour day, mtd even to prolong the hours of labour without the payment of overtime. The workers cannot express their opinions freely; all action on their part is prohibited; and their protests are smothered and repressed by courts martial. </para>

                    <para>SenatorREADY. - That is not likely to occur with trade unionists. You have only to tell the men in the workshops of Australia that the men at the front want things, and they will work overtime, if necessary, to make them. The honorable senator knows that such an imputation on trade unionists is unwarranted. </para>

                            <para>- Yes, and the workmen responded as they will respond in Australia. That is an unfair argument like the argument that the absence of conscription will mean deserting the men at the front. The statement is often made that conscription means equality of sacrifice. That is the great democratic argument that we have had hurled at us. They tell us that conscription is Democracy. </para>

                            <para>- Yes; but members of this party have also sincerely made it and believe it. I do not accuse honorable senators of being base, or pocketing German gold, because they happen to be conscriptionists. Those are unfair tactics. At the same time, I do not want them to accuse me, or any other member of the party, of pocketing German gold, because we happen to be anti-conscriptionists. My own leader, the Minister for Defence, said, &#34; There is no difference between conscription for military service and conscription for industrial service.&#34; </para>

                            <para>- Yes; that is what I was trying to get at. I can see a real and vital difference. When you conscript a man for trade unionism you improve his conditions physically, materially, economically, socially, and morally. He is a better man for it. He has more to spend, and more reproductive force. There is an uplifting moral force behind trade unionism that cannot be overlooked. It benefits the man; it does not force him to love or hate; it does not touch his life, and it improves his conditions on this earth. </para>

No one can say that. military service benefits a man from an economical, moral, or social stand-point, and it trades with his most sacred possession - his life. A man is not forced in trades unionism as he is under military service to go out and kill another man, to inculcate a gospel of hate that he does not feel, to- shoot others, and be shot at. If we admit the principle that a man may be sent by compulsion to kill and be killed, it can be equally argued that a woman may be told, &#34;You must marry and bring life into the world ; whether you love a man or not your body must bring forth a child ; whether you believe in it or not you must create life.&#34; If these powers over life are claimed, there is no logical half-way stopping place. </para>

                            <para>- That may be  bo,  but the honorable senator has personal and conscientious rights over his own life that the State should not filch from him. To return to the argument that compulsory service means equality of sacrifice, if the people voted conscription, and the principle were applied to-morrow, every man in Australia fit to bear arms would not be forced to take the field. We have already been told of lists and lists, and still further lists of exemptions. That is one of the reasons why, when this supposed democratic principle is put into operation, it will be found not to affect every one alike, One man in an exempt occupation would be left; another who could be spared would be taken. The accident of occupation will determine whether a man should be sent away against his will. Is that equality of sacrifice? </para>

                        <para>Serious allegations regarding the treatment of conscientious objectors undergoing imprisonment in detention barracks were made yesterday by Private Clarence Henry Norman. Private Norman, who was a member of the No-Conscription Fellowship, now belongs to the Grenadier Guards, and was court-martialed at Chelsea Barracks for disobeying an order to parade at 9.15 a.m. <inline font-weight="bold">Major du</inline> Plat Taylor presided at the court martial, the other members being Captain the  Hon.

                            C Hawkin,  who represented Norman, took objection to the jurisdiction of the Court in view of the Prime Minister&#39;s statement that courts martial on conscientious objectors would he referred to the scrutiny of the War Office. Therefore, he asked to put in evidence that the offence was the result of a conscientious objection. Accused pleaded objection to the jurisdiction on the ground that he was a civilian.
                        </para>
                        <para>Captain Hewett, Assistant Provost Marshal, called evidence to prove that Norman was lined by a magistrate and handed over to the military. </para>

                            Hawkin  contended that the law had so changed that he could claim that accused was still a civilian and not subject to the Court&#39;s jurisdiction. When tribunals were given power to grant total exemption, Norman had applied to Westminster Tribunal to hear his appeal. The Tribunal had refused on the ground that the application was not in before the appointed day. He had a right to appeal from that decision to the Appeal Tribunal and the Central Tribunal, and as Mb appeal was not finally disposed of the Court had no jurisdiction.
                        </para>
                        <para>Accused, giving evidence, said that he was not fit to obey the order, as he was suffering from the atrocious treatment of the last week. On two occasions he had been put. in a straightjacket for over twenty hours, and he was in hospital for seven days. He then declined to attend parade, and was put on bread and water diet and went on a hunger, thirst, and sleep strike for forty-eight hours. He was forcibly fed on two occasions, being laid on the bed on a straight- jacket. Food was pumped up his nose on the first occasion for fifteen minutes, and he was afterwards kept in a straight-jacket and the Commandant was abusing and insulting. The next day he declined food, and he was fed for twenty minutes through a tube in the mouth. It occasioned him the utmost agony. </para>
                        <para>He contended that the treatment accorded him was unnecessary, because he would have taken food if administered in the ordinary way. It was done as a punishment. The Commandant called him a swine, a beast, and a coward, though he never said a discourteous word to any one. He was put in a straightjacket fifteen minutes after he had entered the place, and it was deliberately done to break his health. </para>
                        <para>Captain Hewitt. - Have you any one to support your evidence; they are serious allegations? </para>
                        <para>Accused. - So serious that the Commandant has been removed from the War Office. </para>

                <para>It is just as well, when we talk of equality of sacrifice and of a system of exemptions insuring fair treatment, to ascertain how the principle is operating in other countries. The above is one of the instances that do not get into the big Australian papers. No matter how we frame the exemptions, we are in for trouble. No Government can create a system that will work smoothly and give satisfaction to the people outside. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> dealt with the number of men to be sent from Australia, and showed conclusively what will happen if the proposed rate of conscription is maintained. We have 152,000 single men between the ages of 18 and 44. At least 30,000 or 40,000 of these are under the age of twenty-one; and we may estimate another 30,000 or 40,000 on account of the exemptions. Thus we then arrive at 60,000 or 70,000 available men. </para>

And how long will it take to conscript these men? We shall take 48,000 in the first two months, and in three months&#39; time the 70,000 will be exhausted. </para>

                            <para>- This is no assumption. Then let us say that the available single men will be sufficient for four months, when, I contend, we must inevitably take married men. If that be so, why not honestly and honorably tell the people the fact? <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> says that these are hypothetical calculations, but I remind the . honorable gentleman that the provision of the necessary transports is also an hypothetical calculation. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> says that we have the necessary ships, and we believe him; but if mine are hypothetical calculations, it is a dead mathematical certainty that under conscription we shall, in three or four months at the longest, be conscripting married men. This reminds me of a story I heard in my childhood about a giant who had caught eight men, and, being a cannibal, was consuming one of them each week. One of the men claimed that, as he had done a lot of work for the giant, and had made himself agreeable, he ought to be spared, and the giant was good enough to say that, under the circumstances, he would eat that man last. Under conscription the married men will be &#34; eaten last.&#34; So long as it is made known that the married men will be called upon, people will vote with their eyes open; but it is not wise, or generous, or fair- </para>

                            <para>- That is so; in some regards Australia is in a worse position than that Dominion. Australia is an isolated island continent, whereas Canada is closer Home, and under the friendly wing of the United States of America. In our case, if we were attacked, it would take time for assistance to reach us; and there is need for far greater care in our case than in that of Canada. </para>

                            <para>- That might be necessary at the start; but we found the money and the Navy. I have obtained the latest figures available, and they throw light on the relative positions of Australia and Canada. The population of Canada is 8,400,000, or close on 9,000,000, whereas our population is 5,000,000. In July, 1916, the Canadian recruits numbered 350,655, while the Australian recruits were 282,000. In the home camps in Canada there were 175,000 men - showing that the Dominion is keeping a large home reserve - while in the Australian camps there were 43,000. In England and on the water Canada had 60,000, and Australia 60,000, while on the various fronts Canada had 70,000, and Australia 125,000 men. Wastage, losses, &#38;c, were, in the case of Canada, 40,000, and in the case of Australia 55,000. Based on the Australian enlistments, Canada ought to show 485,000 recruits, and 72,000 men in the home camps; 100,800 men in England and on the water; 210,000 at the various fronts, with a wastage and &#39;losses of 92,400. To reverse the process, Australia, on the Canadian enlistments, should show 208,723 recruits; 104,166 in the home camps; 35,700 in England and on the water; 41,100 at the various fronts, with a wastage and losses of 23,810. Thus, on Canada&#39;s figures, we have enlisted 74,000 men above our population percentage basis, have 60,000 less in home camps, have 25,220 more on the water and in English camps, and have 83,500 more on the various fronts, while our wastage and losses, instead of being 55,000, should be under 24,000. The comparison is all in favour of Australia; and yet we are told that we have not done enough. That I regard as a slur and a libel in face of what we have done. </para>

It seemed like a large contract; but if it was essential to carry on the fight, then he would acquiesce. They must repel at once the idea that it was the first step towards conscription. There must be no conscription in Canada. There had been mcn in this House who had said that the naval law was the first step towards conscription. The naval law was still on the statute-book, and there was no conscription in England. He had expected that England would be able to carry on the war under the old system, but the British Government had thought otherwise. Conditions were not the same in Great Britain as in Canada. For one thing, conscription could not be passed here without giving a blow to immigration; already it was affecting immigration from the United States. </para>

                            <para>- So far as I know, Canada&#39;s patriotism has never been questioned. We have also to consider the financial conditions. Other honorable senators, notably <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Mullan</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley,</inline> have touched on the effect the drain by conscription will have on production and our industrial and business relations. Any man who knows the conditions of the labour market in the various States must anticipate with dread the effect of the proposed withdrawal of men. The list of exemptions must lengthen, and the men singled out for service will be incensed because, through no fault of their own, they are compelled to serve, while others remain behind. What is the financial position of Australia ? Do honorable senators imagine that, year after year, we can go on contributing men without feeling the financial strain, and without seriously endangering our national credit? We cannot &#34; have our cake and eat it &#34; - a point with which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley</inline> dealt most admirably. I wish to supplement that honorable senator&#39;s argument with a few bald facts that will make the financial position quite clear. The States debts or Australia amount in round figures to &#163;370,000,000, while the Commonwealth debt is already considerably over &#163;100,000,000. </para>

                            <para>- Australians who vote for conscription will realize that my picture of the whole of us being on soldiers&#39; wages is not so much overdrawn as they imagine. We are spending &#163;1,750,000 a week on the war. The adoption of the proposals of the Government will increase that expenditure to &#163;2,500,000. While our money is being used up our production must go on. But if we take men away from the fields, the factories, and the workshops, our production of wealth must decrease, and it is clear that we cannot burn the candle at both ends. If conscription is introduced, there will not be much left of our national asset should the war last for eighteen months. </para>

                            <para>- We shall run out of men if it lasts for another twelve months, according to the figures submitted by the Government. Honorable senators must realize that there is a limit to the number of men that Australia can supply. No blinking of the facts can alter tha. We could maintain four divisions in the field under the voluntary system. This would involve heavy taxation, but it could be done with financial safety, whilst the Government proposal involves the taking of men from production and the burning of the candle at both ends. We have four divisions of Infantry at the front, and one of Light Horse, and there is another Infantry division in process of formation. What is to be done with the new division? Is it to be asked to take over another portion of the British line? If it is not, what will be the use of it? We are told that 20,000 men will be required this month for the new division, and 12,500 for reinforcements. We should be told what is to be done with the new division when it is formed. If the men recruited for the new division were to be used as reinforcements, the present line held by Australian troops could be maintained without conscription. If, instead of adopting that course, a new division is to be formed, it must mean that our line is to be extended. Could we not refrain from putting that new division into the firing line and keep our present divisions adequately reinforced as an alternative? I think that if we adopted that course we could carry it out under &#163;he voluntary system. There is another aspect of conscription which deserves consideration. Many of our soldiers and their relatives in Australia fear that with the introduction of conscription there will be a reduction of our soldiers&#39; pay. </para>

                        repeated that again and again. There are some persons who will not advocate that now; but, should conscription be adopted, we shall find, after it has been in force for some time that it will be insidiously argued that we cannot afford to maintain the present rate of pay. It will be said that we cannot find the money, and that, in the circumstances, the soldiers must accept less pay.

                        s utterances in this chamber, as a member of the Liberal party, shows that the fears entertained by soldiers and their relatives are not altogether groundless.

                    <para>I trust that the people of Australia will reject the Government proposal. I hope that both those who are in favour of conscription and those who are against it will carry on the discussion on the question apart from prejudice, and will not resort to appeals to feelings and emotions and to catch-cries calculated to distract the attention of the people from the facts. It is our solemn duty as legislators and leaders of the people to place the matter so clearly before them that after the vote is taken no elector will be entitled to say, &#34; We thought so-and-so, but unfortunately we have discovered that we were wrong.&#34; It is our duty to take a stand according to our light on this important question, regardless of considerations concerning our political career, and whether the course we believe to be right be popular or not. We should put the truth as we see it to those whom we represent. I know that the cry in favour of conscription is a popular one. </para>

                            <para>- I believe that it is a popular cry in Tasmania. But when the people know the facts I think there will be a change in public opinion. I know that every Labour man who takes the platform in that State against conscription will be vilified and told that he is disloyal, is not in sympathy with the Empire, and does not desire that Australia and the Empire should win the war. I feel, however, that those who are against conscription will be in a position to disregard all these cries. Years ago, when I was younger in this movement than I am to-day, I can remember the storm that arose in Tasmania when Andrew Fisher frankly and openly and doggedly declared that he would not give a Dreadnought to Great Britain. Every kind of abuse was hurled at him. It was said that he was not fit to represent Australia, and should be dragged from his place as Prime Minister.One  speaker  at a public meeting in Australia advocated that he should be tarred and feathered. How many of those people who then abused him have been sleeping soundly in their beds during this war because Andrew Fisher refused to give that Dreadnought to Great Britain, and created an Australian Navy instead ? How many have reason to-day to bless him and the party of which he was leader for the stand they took at that time? </para>

                    <para>I say that we have contributed a fair number of men to carry on the war, and that we should set ourselves to the work of training Australians for home defence. This policy may be unpopular to-day, but the people will realize its value to-morrow. When the proposal for conscription is defeated at the referendum, as I hope it will be, the one clear duty before us will be to train the men of this country for home defence. We must undertake every industry that we can legitimately conduct, and must be prepared to supply our needs later on in the matter of big guns and ammunition. </para>

                        <para>.- The speeches we have so far heard on this very important question have thrown a great deal of light upon the proposal to be submitted to the electors at the referendum. It would be as well to remember that we are not, at this juncture, discussing the merits or demerits, or the justice or injustice of conscription, but whether the supreme authority, the people of Australia, should be consulted before the objectionable policy of conscription is adopted. Before offering the observations I propose to address to the Senate on that question, I may be permitted to say a few words in reply to  the abuse and vilification which has been directed against the distinguished gentleman who, to-day, leads the Australian Labour party. I want to say right here and now that in all circumstances we should stand out for absolute freedom of speech and freedom of thought in the consideration of this great national question. If <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> believes that certain lines of policy are essential in the interests of the country and the Empire, surely those who have been associated with him so long, and have profited so much by that association, should be the first in this Parliament and in the country to do him justice, and to admit that he is actuated by none but the highest possible patriotic and national motives. Although I may be prepared to combat his arguments and do all I can to defeat his present proposal, I feel bound to denounce the unjust, mean, and contemptible charges of treachery which have been levelled at this man who has done nothing to deserve them. I have read some disreputable, mean, and unworthy criticisms in the Tory press concerning him in years gone by, when he has been fighting grand battles for his party, but I have had to wait until now for the meanest and most contemptible criticisms ever directed against him, and they have come from members of his own party, both inside and outside of Parliament. </para>

Who but the Prime Minister has carried the burden of the Labour movement for several years in the other Chamber by answering the arguments of legal luminaries, and among them some of the greatest in this country ? Who but the Prime Minister has sat up night after night preparing the case for the next day from a Labour point of view in the Parliament of Australia? The Prime Minister has sacrificed much, has done much, and is willing to do much more for the Labour movement in this country. Notwithstanding all that he has done, he is being vilified by these nincompoops outside as a traitor. </para>

                            <para>- I have done nothing of the kind. I intend to support the passage of this Bill under which it is proposed to consult the people of Australia; but I shall oppose the question on the platform in my State. If, however, the people of Australia decide, by a substantial majority, in favour of conscription for active service abroad I shall vote to give effect to their will. That is my position, and in my opinion that is the only logical position that any man claiming to be a Democrat can take up. </para>

                            <para>- Instead of taking an autocratic course, the Prime Minister has adopted the democratic course of referring this matter to the people, and is prepared to stand by their decision. Those who favour this Bill have a dual obligation, viz., to support its passage through this Parliament, and then, when the wishes of the people are made known, to give effect to them. Early in this discussion I was disappointed that only one question, that of conscripting men, was to be submitted to the people. Every one knows that the three factors in the successful prosecution of the war are men, material, and money. All along the line we have been getting excited over the question of raising men, and still more men; but no one has become excited about raising the other two equally necessary factors. The Government have unlimited powers of taxation, and having confidence in the Government, I am prepared to trust them to do the fair thing in their financial proposals, namely, to compel those who hold the wealth of Australia to do their fair share - and indeed more than their share - to make some sacrifices in their contributions to the funds necessary for this war. I am satisfied, and I think that honorable senators must also be satisfied, that when these proposals come before us, there will not be unanimity, as there is to-day concerning the conscription of men, between the Labour party and the party in opposition. When the financial proposals are laid before them in detail, I feel sure there will be a sharp line of demarcation between the two parties. </para>

                    <para>SenatorLONG. - I am willing for the present to leave the question of raising money in the hands of the Government; but I am not satisfied with the way in which the question of material necessary for this war has been handled. I suppose it would be impertinent for me to offer any criticism of the Imperial Government in that connexion; but I have no hesitation in saying that they have been even more lax than we have been in Australia. During the last eighteen months or more the Government of this country have very properly commandeered the whole output of the woollen mills, a course of action which resulted in a very considerable benefit. </para>

                            <para>- T have nothing but commendation for the action which the Government took in regard to the woollen mills, but I regret that they did not earlier extend that policy, so as to deal on exactly the same basis with metals necessary for the production of munitions. Never in their history have some of the mining companies enjoyed such immense profits as during the last two years, and that is all the more regrettable when we remember that those profits have been made out of the blood of hundreds of thousands of men who have fallen on the battle-fields of Europe. Early in the. war the Commonwealth, on behalf of the Imperial Government, entered into a con tract with the companies to take all the copper produced in Australia at &#163;100 per ton. That price was &#163;20 higher than the record price in the preceding twenty-five years, at least. Copper, lead, zinc, antimony, molybdenite,  sheelite,  and all metals used for the making of munitions, the Government should have commandeered. Their action would have been&#39; applauded had they gone to the Mount Lyell and Broken Hill Companies and said, &#34;This is a time of war, and your metals are necessary for the successful conduct of the Allies&#39;&#34; operations. We shall allow you a price 10 per cent, above the cost of production, and we shall take the entire output of your mines.&#34; That would have been a fair proposition. When I state that, with copper at &#163;58 per ton, the Mount Lyell Company can make a good profit, honorable senators will understand to what extent profits have been increased during the war, when copper has been purchased by the Government at &#163;100 per ton. </para>

                            <para>- The North Broken Hill Company. I know that it is a mighty difficult proposition to reach a company by means of a tax on war profits. The saner and fairer course, in the interests of the companies and the people, who have to foot the bill, would have been to commandeer the whole of the output of the mining companies, and paid 10 per cent, above the cost of production.  The Government have not acted in the best interests of the people in not having taken drastic action in connexion with the mineral products of th&#163; Commonwealth. I do not wish to introduce side issues by dealing at length with the enormous profits which certain agents for minerals are exacting from the consumers. The existing contracts ought to be reviewed, and the mighty corporations that are extorting unfair profits ought to be dealt with severely by means of a war profits tax. The same position obtains in regard to coal. The shipping companies and the coal companies are practically identical, and they are making a fine profit out of the war. The mere fact that any company is making unreasonable profits out of the war ought to be sufficient to bring the Government, certainly a Labour Government, down upon it at the earliest possible moment. </para>

                            <para>- Why? Because they have taken mighty good care to restrict shipping, so that the price of coal may be raised. The Minister knows that at the outbreak of war coal from the &#34;United Kingdom was delivered in. Italy at 26s. per ton. After fifteen months of war, Italy, one of our Allies, was paying as much as &#163;9 12s. per ton for coal. The explanation was that a number of so-called patriotic ship-owners had registered their ships under neutral flags in order to be able to limit the number of ships available to carry coal to Britain&#39;s Allies. The more they restricted the shipping, and the scarcer freights became, the higher rose the price of coal. Even greater profits were reaped by the coal-owners, many of whom, according to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lloyd</inline> George, acted in combination with the shipowners. In regard to the supply of meat to the troops, the conditions prevailing reflect nothing but discredit on the commercial capacity of the Defence Department. This remark does not apply to the State of Tasmania, in which the best possible policy in the circumstances has been adopted. There, the Defence Department has its own butchers, and buyers in the open market, and the result has been the complete elimination of the middleman. </para>

                            <para>- I guarantee that it does. The system has been such a success during the fifteen months it has been in operation in Tasmania, that I am confident its adoption in Victoria and New South Wales would give equally satisfactory results. If in connexion with the large quantity of meat used by the troops on the mainland, &#163;50,000 or &#163;60,000 per annum could be saved, surely the possibility of effecting such an economy should commend the policy to the early consideration of Ministers. If the system has been a success on a comparatively small scale in Tasmania, it should be equally as great a success when operated on a larger scale on the mainland. In my opinion, the Government have not shown the greatest possible discrimination in connexion with the purchase of materials and food for our troops. </para>

Remembering that, according to the repeated . assertions of the Prime Minister and the Minister for Defence, the very existence of the Commonwealth and of the Empire is at stake, we should not hesitate about any action that may be necessary to conserve the resources of the country, and to insure their best possible use. The policy of the Government in regard to shipping has not been as aggressive as it might have been. Other honorable senators have referred at length to the enormous profits made by shipping companies throughout the Empire, including ship-owners who have found it convenient and profitable to register under neutral flags for the currency of the war, and who will probably, after the war, come again under the protection of the flag which they have so meanly and despicably deserted. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Winston</inline> Churchill is of opinion that the British nation has failed to properly marshal its forces for the successful carrying on of the war.

                    <para class="block">That is the opinion of one of England&#39;s leading statesmen, who has at last awakened to the necessity of the Government controlling national resources. The Government of Australia, in its more limited sphere, might well follow his advice and the example of the Imperial Government by taking control of the railways, coal mines, and other services essential to the war. There are those who say that Australia has not done enough in this war, and has not yet discharged her duty to the Empire. That is a slander upon the country. The part that we have played is under the circumstances a magnificent one. Not only has Australia, under the voluntary system, contributed a force of 300,000 men, but she has contributed a Navy which has played a very important part in the naval activity of the Empire. No other Dominion can boast of having done so much. Although the Commonwealth is the most distant of the self-governing portions of the Empire, she has, in proportion to population, contributed more men, more money, and more ships than any of the sister Dominions. Those who say that Australia has not played her part nobly in this contest are not doing justice to their country. The voluntary system has achieved all that its most sanguine supporters expected from it, and the results have been magnificent. The falling off in enlistments now is due, not to the cooling of sentiment, which is just as warm now as on the day when we sent our first men away, but to the implacable and inevitable logic of  arith-  metic. To send away 16,500 men a month means the losing of 198,000 men in a year, or twice that number in two years, and it is not beyond the bounds of possibility that the war may continue for another two years. Figures show that we cannot continue to send away so large a number of men, because they are not here to send. Preceding speakers have pointed out that we have nearly reached the limit of available men, and that within three months at the outside we shall have exhausted our supply of available single men. Having regard to those who must be kept here for the carrying on of necessary industries, we shall, before the end of the year, have exhausted our stock of eligible fighting men. The question therefore arises, &#34; Are we justified in sending more men out of the country?&#34; It has been said that Australia has a more serious menace than that of Germany. If it be true, and we have no reason to doubt the authority for the statement, every man who leaves Australia increases her defencelessness. In proportion to population we have sent away almost twice as many men as Canada, and have therefore done all that can be reasonably expected of us. Moreover, Canada can never, under any circumstances, be exposed to the perils that threaten Australia. She is as safe, geographically, as is the United Kingdom. </para>

                            <para>- Almost 200,000, and Australia has sent away nearly 300,000, notwithstanding that our expenses are five times as great as those of Canada. Will any honorable senator, no matter how warm an advocate of compulsory service abroad, say that the prospects of the armies of the Allies were ever better or brighter than they are to-day? The Minister for Defence has told us that, if we fail to send reinforcements, the line held by Australians must be shortened; but he did not tell us that the German line has been lengthened by over 700&#39; miles because of Roumania&#39;s action. That more than counterbalances any possible shortening of the line on the western front. I say that it is unfair to make Australia responsible for a further division. There are enough men in camp here and in the Old Country to provide reinforcements for the divisions .now in Trance for the next ten or twelve months, and adding, to these the voluntary recruits, we shall have nothing to fear in the way of lack of reinforcements, and shall not be open to criticism for failing to send enough men. The fifth division should be used to reinforce the other four divisions at the front. </para>

                    <para class="block">Surely such statements as these justify the belief, and certainly the hope, that the time is not very far distant when the efforts of the Allies will be successful, and Germany will be beaten absolutely to her knees, without any further call upon the resources of Australia. A weakness of the referendum proposal may be said to be the fact that, while all are entitled to a voice as to whether conscription shall be imposed, very few will be penalized by the imposition of it; but I do not agree with the contention. I think that it is very difficult to find any person in Australia who will not be concerned or interested in the decision to be given by the people. It is said&#34; that women, who are not called upon to fight, should not be permitted to vote; but I hold that no  section of a community at war suffers more keenly than the women, and to deny them a voice on this issue would be cruel and unfair. I am in entire accord with the proposal to poll the votes of the soldiers at the front, but one flaw in it is its limitation. I think that every soldier on active service, no matter what his age may be, should be entitled to a vote on this question. The lad of eighteen years of age, who is physically and mentally capable of discharging the duties of a soldier, and is doing so, is also physically and mentally capable of exercising a vote on a matter of this kind. I have a boy who will not be twenty years of age until November next, and by that time he will have been two years at the front. It is not an isolated case. These boys - for they, are only boys - should not be denied the right to vote on a question of this character. This referendum is upon a national question, and should be conducted in a reasonable and logical manner. The most appropriate way&#39; of conducting meetings in any centres or country districts will be by having the platform occupied by persons supporting both sides. </para>

                            <para>- The Yarra-bank is not Australia. I have sufficient confidence in the fair-mindedness of my fellow countrymen to believe that they will be prepared to hear arguments for and against the Government&#39;s proposal submitted to them in a reasonable and logical manner, especially when they realize that it is a national question, and not a party one, and that it is one upon which all have an equal say at the ballot-box. One important result has already been achieved by this Bill. The Liberal party have been unequivocally converted to the principle of the referendum. By supporting the Government&#39;s proposal for a referendum on this issue they cannot escape the position that they believe in the principle underlying the referendum. In connexion with the  one-sidedness  of some people who talk about free speech being a priceless jewel of human right and a palladium of sovereign Democracy when one is with them, but have quite a different sentiment regarding it when one is in opposition to them, let me tell honorable senators of the words of that famous Frenchman, Marshal Murat. He was inspecting a regiment of soldiers after Napoleon Bonaparte had been elevated to the position of First Consul, and he said : &#34; Soldiers of France, - Remember that under our glorious flag speech is free, as free as the air we breathe. Consequently it is open to every soldier co discuss as freely as he likes the elevation of Napoleon Bonaparte to this position, but I think it only my duty to warn you that any soldier found or heard uttering a word detrimental to the interests of Napoleon Bonaparte will be instantly shot.&#34; We do not want that kind of free speech in Australia. We want the question discussed from every possible standpoint. Every person for or against conscription should have absolute freedom to place his views before the electors. I support this Bill for the taking of a referendum, and on the platform I shall oppose conscription; but if the verdict of the people is that men shall be conscripted for active service overseas, as an Australian Democrat I shall feel bound to give effect to the wishes of the people. </para>

                        <para>. - I express my pleasure, and, I believe, the pleasure of the Senate generally, at the moderation which marked the utterances of the last  speaker  in the views he expressed and the language he employed, more particularly in his references to those who differed from him. It was a speech entirely free from many of those defects which have marked some utterances since the debate commenced. I should like to make reference to one of the closing statements of the honorable senator. He assumes that honorable senators of the Liberal party who are supporting the Bill are necessarily expressing a belief in the principles of the referendum as applied to a matter of this kind. I have already said that I am accepting it as a necessity arising out of the circumstances which confront us. I am in the position of .a man who  is in a room when a cry of fire is raised and finds the door locked against him. Because that man finds an exit through the window, is it to be said that he holds the belief that the window is the proper means of leaving or finding access to a room ? I am supporting the referendum because I am in that position. That is the only practical way I see out of the difficulty confronting us. I regard this as a window to escape from a room the door of which is bolted by the known political convictions of members of this Chamber. </para>
                    </talk.start>
                    <para>I have never listened to such a continuity of self-destructive criticism as that which has been addressed to the Chamber in this debate. Although only four honorable senators have addressed you, I think .hardly a single argument has been advanced by one of them which has not been successfully met by an argument advanced by another, yet they are all on the same side. I propose to refer to some of these pleasing contradictions, more particularly on the part of the small minority that voted against the first reading yesterday. Unlike the last  speaker,  who is supporting the Bill, although opposed to an affirmative answer to the question to be submitted to the people, they were actually against referring the matter to the people at all, although they are members of a party which has had as one of the main planks of its platform for many years the principle of the initiative and referendum. When an opportunity arises, as it has on this occasion, to submit a referendum, they turn round and say, in effect, &#34; Whilst we regard it as essential to the proper working of Democracy that the plank should be there as a fixed institution, when there is an opportunity of using it we are absolutely opposed to it.&#34; Let me remind them that if that plank of &#39; their platform had become law, and the initiative and referendum were in existence to-day as part of our political machinery, the people themselves, without consulting Parliament, could have expressed the opinion which we are inviting them to place on record. Yet these stalwart Democrats, these &#34; true-blue merinoes,&#34;  who have, in season and out of season, at convention after convention, and on public platform after public platform, held up the initiative and referendum as the coping-stone of the democratic arch, when they have a chance of utilizing it, are found voting to prevent the people giving expression to their will. </para>

                            <para>- It is a phrase not unfamiliar to some of my honorable friends opposite. We are confronted with this peculiar spectacle : We have in this Chamber a part of the Labour party, claiming to represent the official section, opposing the referendum. In the great northern State of Queensland, the Labour party are to-day putting a referendum proposal through the State Parliament as a general measure. It is, apparently, a perfectly sound principle as a general measure, but utterly wrong when applied to a particular case. They forget that if we had it as a general measure it would be utilized only when applied to particular cases. </para>

                            <para>- .They are showing their faith in the referendum by submitting it to Parliament as a general measure. When it was introduced there, the Home Secretary, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Huxham,</inline> referred to it as a boon to the people, and, quoting Dicey, added that it &#34; would  no doubt be opposed by every man who feared the result of an appeal to the people.&#34; I invite <inline font-weight="bold">Senator</inline> Mullan&#39;s  attention to that remark. I do not know whether the fear indicated by the Home Secretary of Queensland finds any echo or not in the breasts of those  who  are opposing this measure in this chamber; but it seems to be a sound assumption that those who in principle believe in the referendum as a general law, and oppose it as applied to a particular case, do so because they fear that on the particular occasion the voice of the people will go against their view. One of the main grievances expressed by so-called Democrats for quite a number of years is tha&#39;t Democracy has had no voice in the making of wars. In this chamber quite recently a very florid picture was drawn of the diplomatic service as a select body to which admission could be gained only by those with private incomes, the &#34; representatives of a brainless aristocracy.&#34; We were told that these were the men who, by reason of their entry into the diplomatic service, were the cause of war or peace, and that Democracy was never consulted. That view comes strangely from those who are now opposing an effort to give the Democracy an opportunity to express itself upon this point. Either they are not sincere when they affirm that hitherto those few chosen diplomats have been the makers of the war and the  secures  of peace, or, if they are, they are inconsistent when now the opportunity is offered to them they refuse to give the people a chance of saying the extent to which they will continue in the war. Before I pass from the referendum, may I join with many other members of this Chamber and enter the realms of the prophets ? It is a dangerous occupation ; but I am disposed to think that the adoption of the referendum at this juncture, as an expedient, consequent upon a division of opinion between the two Chambers, may yet in the course of time leave a permanent mark on our Constitution. It seems not at all unreasonable to suppose that being employed now, it may be adopted ultimately by the people as a solvent of a division of opinion between the two Houses. It seems not at all unreasonable to suppose that its successful use on this occasion as a solvent of a division of opinion between the two Houses may seize upon the popular imagination as a better means of bringing Parliament into harmony with the- popular will than anything that our Constitution now provides. </para>

                    <para>The debate so far has largely proceeded not so much on the principle of the referendum as on the subject which is to be referred to the people. That is quite natural, because, after all, the Bill itself is merely a machine to enable a decision to be arrived at upon the main question confronting us. T propose therefore to deal with the question covered by the Bill - the element of compulsion as applied to service for military purposes. I ask myself, and invite others to ask themselves, &#34; From whom does the opposition to compulsion come?&#34; It comes, in the first instance, from men who have claimed a very large measure of credit for placing upon our statute-book the compulsory principle in the Defence Act. They have, in season and out of season for many years, claimed that as one of the chief triumphs of the Labour party. I say nothing of the fact that that Act was actually passed through this Chamber by another party. I give them all the credit for their support of. the principle, but there is something inconsistent in those who, for years upon the platform, have sought to gain a measure of public approbation and praise because of their support of the compulsory principle, denouncing it now, when there is some need of applying it, as something too evil for words. I am surprised that men who have hitherto appeared on the public platform as the supporters of the compulsory principle in military service should now tell us that they never believed in it. We have had two instances within the last two days. Only last night <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Tudor,</inline> until lately a Minister of the Crown, speaking at a meeting of the Political Labour League Executive, at Richmond, said, if correctly reported in this morning&#39;s newspapers, &#34; that no Government had a right to force a man to fight, and, perhaps, to lose his life.&#34; What has <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Tudor</inline> been doing all these years? He has been a supporter of the principle, sharing the credit which he, in common with his political colleagues, has claimed because of their efforts to place it upon the statute-book. The question of whether the Government has the right to compel a man to fight is not affected by the particular acre on which he fights. Yet, for years, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Tudor</inline> has been getting a measure of public approbation and support because of his supposed belief in that principle. He now tells us that he does not believe a Government has the right to do that which he has been supporting the Government in doing for many years past. So, in this Chamber, the other night, we had a similar admission by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ferricks. Senator Lynch</inline> asked him by interjection, &#34; If the Germans landed here would you compel fit men to fight?&#34; That was bringing the argument right home to the Defence Act. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ferricks</inline> replied, &#34; No, I would not,&#34; and added, &#34; I do not think Australians would require any compulsion in such a case.&#34; </para>

                            <para>- But it is clear from <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ferricks&#39;</inline> own statement that, whether Australians would require compulsion or not - upon which he expresses a doubt, because he says &#34; I think they would not&#34; - there was no doubt about his attitude when he replied, &#34; No, I would not compel them to fight here.&#34; <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ferricks</inline> is a member of the party which has claimed to be the father and main supporter of the principle of compulsion. He has sat in this Chamber and voted money to give effect to that principle. He has raised no protest against spending money in training men in order that when the necessity arises the Government may be in a position to call them to do what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ferricks</inline> says he would not compel them to do. There is an absence of sincerity in this matter, the more remarkable in that it comes from those who say they are speaking for conscience sake. The gentlemen who speak in this way have been supporters all along - at any rate they have made no protest against it - of what we have been doing since 1910, to enforce the doctrine that citizenship of Australia implies not merely the right to an equal distribution of favours, so far as the State can insure it,- but also an equal distribution of the burdens. That is the basis of the compulsory principle of the Defence Act, and those gentlemen have for years supported it by voting the money necessary to give effect to it, and by supporting the Ministry, when  it came to the turn of the present Minister, as it came to mine, to put in force the penal sections of the Act against those who refused to obey the law. I never heard a protest raised by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ferricks,</inline> or any of the other gentlemen who to-day  view with horror the attempt to compel men to serve their country. </para>

                    <para>I think I am correctly quoting <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ferricks</inline> in attributing to him the statement that, no matter how big the majority might be in favour of the proposal at the referendum, he denied the right of the majority to bind, the minority in a matter where conscience was affected. But is there any conscience clause in the plank in the Labour party&#39;s platform about the initiative and referendum? Does it say, &#34; The initiative and referendum - but no minority having a conscientious objection to the decision of the majority to be bound by it&#34;? There is no conscience clause there, but a simple provision that the rule of the majority must prevail. Does the Queensland Act contain any provision to exempt conscientious objectors from any decision arrived at? If some of these gentlemen would try to get their colleagues to propose such a provision they would be laughed to scorn, even by their own political associates. It is only in this particular matter that this wonderful factory is set to work turning out these finely-spun consciences. Another phrase that is commonly used is &#34; the sacredness of human life.&#34; We can all assent to that general proposition. W&#169; can assent to it, not only thoroughly, but sincerely. But what is this objection as applied to the principle of compulsion ? Is not life just as sacred whether a man sheds it, or is asked to risk it, on the shores of Australia, or 3&#163; miles away, outside the territorial limit? Does life become sacred 3 miles from Australia&#39;s shore, but a thing of no account upon Australian soil ? The life of the individual or of the community is equally sacred wherever it may be. And yet these gentlemen who supported the application of the principle of compulsion to home defence were not at any time disturbed by this plea as to the sacredness of human life. They were willing then to risk human life when necessity demanded it. &#34;It is only now that they stand appalled at the prospect of life being shed or risked 3 miles beyond Australia&#39;s shores. I should like some of those who talk about the iniquity of compelling men to risk their lives, because of the sacredness of human life, to picture what would happen if, for instance, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ferricks,</inline> who referred particularly to this matter, were suddenly confronted while walking down the street by a lunatic aiming a revolver at him. If a policeman came along with another revolver, would <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ferricks</inline> say to him, &#34; Do not shoot the man ! Human life is too sacred. Don&#39;t fire!&#34; I can imagine him doing that, but no one else in this Chamber can. </para>

                            <para>- That section will apply now. If life is so sacred, do my honorable friends opposite, who are opposed to conscription, attempt to determine the degree of sacredness between the life of the conscript and that of the volunteer ? Is not the life of the volunteer as sacred as is that of the conscript? Yet <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Mullan,</inline> and others who think with him, have in this very Chamber helped the volunteer to risk his life. Not one volunteer could have left these shores unless <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Mullan</inline> and others had approved the action of the Government in providing the money to send him. To them apparently the life of the volunteer is not sacred. It is only when we come to conscript the unwilling, the shirker, that there is exhibited by them this tender regard for the sacredness of human life. If there were any degree in the element of sacredness between the life of the conscript and volunteer, I would give it to the man who has not waited to be compelled, but has volunteered, to risk his life on the altar of his country rather than to the man who. knowing he ought to go, hangs back. In dealing with this question of the sacredness of human life, I would like to point out to roy honorable friends that some of those who are fighting their cause are apparently not at all afraid of risking &#39; and losing human life. I am not saying that any one here will indorse the sentiments I am about to read; but they have been published and circulated by those who are fighting shoulder to shoulder with my honorable friends against conscription. A conference was held in the Trades Hall, Melbourne, some time ago, and each delegate was handed a circular - a copy of which was published in the Melbourne evening <inline font-style="italic">Herald</inline> - in which it was stated that - </para>

                    <para class="block"> During this debate there has been a plea - notably by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Mullan</inline> - for honest statement in the course of this discussion. I indorse that plea. When we are referring this or any other matter to the people, we, at least, owe it as much to them as to ourselves to see that we endeavour, as far as we can as human beings, to put the simple facts of the case for popular judgment. I am surprised when I hear those who advance this plea immediately showing how little they understand it by asserting that this proposition means something other than is set out in the plain terms of the Bill. We heard yesterday from those who plead for honesty of statement that this Bill means the conscription of industrial labour. That is one of the things we have had pictured here. We were told that men were not wanted for the army, but that there was some iniquitous conspiracy on foot by which, under the powers now sought, the Government, or some one else - the particular individual or machinery was not indicated - would be able to say to a man, &#34; Go. work here,&#34; and to another, &#34;Work there,&#34; and to pay whatever wages they pleased. That sort of talk is going on throughout the length and breadth of Australia to-day. It &#39;is simply not true, and those who make the statement know that it is not. Another statement made is that if we approve this proposition we shall fasten militarism on Australia for all time. The simple language used in the question submitted to the people gives to that statement the lie direct. I stand appalled, when I recollect the seriousness and the gravity of the business with which we are confronted, that any man in a responsible position would attempt even to suggest or to convey the idea that this proposition means the permanent riveting of the conscript system upon Australia. </para>

Government will be able to order men about for industrial purposes as they think fit. </para>

                            <para>- There are quite a number of people who are trying to obscure it. There is a third limitation in this question. It distinctly states that this power is to be exercised &#34; for the term of the war.&#34; Is there any ambiguity about that? Even <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Barnes</inline> will admit that he can understand that portion of the question. The military service is to be for a clear and definite period. And yet the opponents of this proposal say that if the people vote &#34; Yes &#34; to the proposition, they will rivet upon Australia for all time the fetters of a military system. If honorable senators feel that there is some ambiguity in this question, the correct course for them to follow is, not to say that it means what it does not mean, but to suggest an amended form of words that will meet the difficulty. If there is in this question something I am unable to discover which does open the flood-gates to the introduction of black labour, let them put in language, clear and unmistakable, something that will shut those flood-gates. If they think there is something in it which means that after the war this power will still prevail, let them submit a new form of words which will make it clear that the power is to come to an end with the termination of the war. </para>

                            <para>- He does not know, and for that reason there is greater reason for giving an affirmative answer to the question. Are we to wait until the enemy is at our gate - are we to wait until irretrievable disaster has overtaken us - and only then set to work to repair the damage ? What has been the great curse that has paralyzed the efforts of the Empire and the Allies throughout the war? It has been, until within the last few months, that, written over all their efforts, in spite of the dauntless heroism which has been shown, were yet the words &#34;Too late.&#34; We prepared for the war too late. Prior to the outbreak of hostilities there were men in England who would burst with indignation at the mere suggestion of military preparation. For months and years men were called alarmists because they pointed out what was going on. What sort of an audience did Blatchford get in England ? </para>

                            <para>- Only a few months before the war broke out, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, in presenting his Budget, said - I think my memory is sufficiently accurate - that, looking over the whole international position, there never was a time when with greater confidence they could proceed to revise their military and naval estimates downwards than then. In a few months&#39; time the Empire was looking defeat in the face. Are we to wait until the necessity actually arises, giving only such measure of authority as may appear necessary at the moment? In my opinion, the Government have not gone one step too far in the power they are asking. Whether they use the power, and to what extent, depends on the developments of. the next few months. </para>

                            <para>- Some honorable senators seem to think that we are arranging a picnic, or something of that sort. It does not rest with us to say what we can afford - it has nothing to do with us, but is a matter to be determined by the enemy. The amount of effort we have to put forth depends, not on ourselves, but on the enemy. </para>

Honorable senators, by inference at any rate, are opposing compulsion, and creating an impression that they are in favour of the voluntary system. Many of them are not in favour of the voluntary system. Look over the ranks of the opponents of the measure, and see what they have done to help voluntary effort. </para>

                            <para>- That is quite candid; and it is all the admission I want at present. But we have to believe in the war - it is here. What is the good of shutting our eyes and saying that we do not believe in the war - that we may sit down and wait for the war to pass over? A large number of those who are taking the platform in opposition to compulsion would, if they could, stop the slightest effort by Australia to assist the Empire and the Allies. </para>

                            <para>- Of course, there are several  factors  - brains amongst others. The honorable senator, in referring to this &#34;inconvenience,&#34; mentioned one or two essential industries. But how much is the industrial life of the country going to be jeopardized if we conscript those thousands of men who, night after night, go to the Sydney Stadium? The very underlying principle of the compulsory element is that it means organization. It gives the Government the right to say to one man that he can be more beneficial to the community by staying at home, and to another man that his right place is at the front. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Mullan</inline> last night referred to the fact - and curiously enough used it as an argument against the compulsory principle - that men who went into the trenches from France and England had to be sent back to their respective countries. </para>

                            <para>- For the reason that the organization was incomplete, no one in the early stages of the war ever dreaming of the tremendous demands that would be made on. the resources of the combatants. Had there been compulsion in Great Britain it would have been possible to satisfy the needs of the military authorities and to keep back those necessary at home. The wrong man was sent, because they had to take men of some sort, and the wrong man offered and they had to take him because- the right one was hanging back. The same thing has happened here. Under the compulsory system the Government can regulate that. Whether it regulates it or not, the first thing we have to do is to deal with the problem confronting us. That is, not to deal - at all events, not out of its due proportion - with the economic difficulty, but to consider what must be done to send the necessary succour to our boys in the trenches. Having beaten the common enemy, we can then afford to turn round and look after our material interests. </para>

                            <para>- I hope that we are going to do something more than feed them. I hope that we are going to reinforce them as well. The financial bogy was raised last night by a gentleman who has never, to my knowledge, stood out as a great economist in connexion with public finance. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley</inline> last night put certain figures before us. They were appalling. I do not wish in any way to <inline font-style="italic">discount the tremendous</inline> burden which those figures indicate will be laid upon the people of this country. But that is war, and the consequence of it. We cannot have omelets without breaking eggs. The answer is that, suppose it costs all that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley</inline> says it will cost, we have to ask ourselves : Is Australia worth it? Are we going to allow the expenditure of money to frighten people against sending forward the necessary forces to secure our national safety? <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley</inline> said that for our present army the cost would be &#163;200,000,000, assuming that the war is ended shortly. As a matter of fact, I believe the honorable senator brought the war to an end last night.  His  conclusion was that the war is costing us &#163;200,000,000, involving an interest charge upon the community of something like &#163;10,000,000 or &#163;12,000,000 per annum. </para>

                            <para>- That is to say, that the cost up to the end of the financial year would be &#163;205,000,000 for our volunteer army, and the honorable senator said that the conscript &#39; army proposed would involve an additional expenditure of &#163;75,000,000. If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley</inline> is appalled at these figures, the time when he should have protested was when he sanctioned the expenditure of the major sum of &#163;205,000,000. He should not now jib over the expenditure of the additional &#163;75,000,000 to prevent the &#163;205,000,000 being spent in vain. </para>

                            <para>- The honorable senator does not speak without a purpose, and if his quotation of these figures had any purpose at all, it was to create a public impression that the adoption of conscription would lay such a financial burden upon Australia that she must stagger under it. If the honorable senator can create that impression, he knows that it will induce in the minds of the over-cautious a desire to vote &#34; No &#34; on the proposition which the Government are putting before the people. The honorable senator did not use these figures in order to secure affirmative votes at the referendum, but in order to secure negative votes. </para>

                            <para>- I shall deal with that later, because it is very important, as showing exactly where <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley</inline> stands. Let me repeat that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley</inline> has already approved of the expenditure of &#163;200,000,000 on the conduct of the war under the voluntary system. &#34;We never heard any protest from him against the expenditure of a single penny of that amount. He would not care if it cost &#163;400,000,000, so long as the money was spent in that way. Now when it becomes necessary to expend an additional &#163;75,000,000, in order to insure that our past efforts, our expenditure of money and of what is more precious still, life, shall not be wasted, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley</inline> appears as a man who has painted Australia as being such an impoverished country that it is better that we should let the Germans have it than pay another &#163;75,000,000 to secure it. </para>

When he was asked to approve of the expenditure of &#163;200,000,000, the honorable senator did not protest, but now he attempts to raise the financial bogy, because the war, lasting longer than was expected, involves a further expenditure of &#163;75,000,000. These circumstances present to my mind the question: Is Australia worth it, supposing success in the war does cost another &#163;75,000,000? </para>

                            <para>- That point is too important for me to overlook it. Having raised this financial bogy to frighten other people, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley</inline> immediately proceeded to show that he was not frightened by it himself, because he would be prepared to spend the same money in building railways and other things in Australia. Instead of spending the money to assist our men who are fighting in the trenches in France, he would spend it upon aeroplanes, until we should have them, like a swarm of bees, flying about our harbors in Australia. The honorable senator has no objection to the expenditure of this money, only he says that we should not spend it in the way in which it will be effective. We should spend it here to make things right in the future, and let the present take care of itself. I reverse <inline font-weight="bold">Ms proposition.</inline> I say that we should spend men and money where that expenditure will be effective, and, having made ourselves secure and beaten for all time this enemy of Prussian militarism, and this twentieth century barbarism., we can then turn round and see to the future development and security of the country. Supposing that all these evils, inconvenience, and loss are absolutely as the honorable senator has stated, has he any right to question them now ? He had the opportunity to do so two years ago. With others the honorable senator went into the war cheering like a lot of boys chasing a rabbit; but finding that the rabbit became a bear, he now wants to pull out. We cannot do that. War is not that sort of game. As I reminded the Senate a few weeks ago, we cannot go into the war as a captain of a cricket team enters the field, and disapproving of the conduct of the opposing team, calls his men off the field. Having entered the war we can only get out of it in one of two ways, and that is by victory or defeat. If honorable senators think the expenditure too great, why did the&#34; not protest when they decided to go into the war two years ago? If they believe that the money should be spent here upon aeroplanes to fly around our coasts, and upon strategic railways, why did they not say so then? </para>

                            <para>- I think this is the first time I have used the phrase. I have been speaking of the expenditure, not of shillings, but of millions of pounds. When the expenditure of &#163;200,000,000 has been referred to in order to frighten people against the cost of going on with the war, I say that if the expenditure of an additional &#163;200,000,000, and not merely of another &#163;75,000,000 be involved, we must go on until our national salvation is absolutely secured. Unless we are criminally neglectful of the interests that are in our custody, we dare not cry a halt. But supposing that the arguments raised by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley</inline> were sound, do they not apply to the voluntary system as well as to the conscript system ? The conscript is to cost no more than the volunteer. Some persons have been endeavouring to create an impression abroad that the conscripts are going to get less than the volunteers. </para>

                            <para>- It is common sense. If my friends are appalled at the financial obligation which Australia is building up, let them say at once that they are opposed to the voluntary system as well as to conscription, because the volunteer soldier will cost as much as the conscript. If they propose that we should stop on the score of expense, and because we find that the expenditure is greater than we can bear, let them tell the people of Australia that they are opposed, not only to the raising of men compulsorily, but also to the volunteer system. The demand is for more men, and the men cost money. We must get the men, and we have tried to get them by the voluntary system. It gave us magnificent results up to within the last few months, but it is now failing to meet our increasing needs. The mere fact that it must add to our financial obligations will not restrain the people of Australia from doing all that is necessary. When people talk of inconvenience and cost, they speak as some persons often do about contributions to a philanthropic or charitable movement. It is too late in the day now to talk about standing aloof from this conflict. That ought to have been done two years ago, but at that time I do not remember hearing any honorable senator pleading with the people of Australia to take that course, and I have no doubt that if, at the last election, any honorable senator had invited Australia to adopt such an attitude he would never have retained his seat In this Parliament. </para>

I am merely trying now to bring home to honorable senators the fact that as we are at war, the only chance of winning is by making a still greater effort.

I venture to suggest that he enlighten the Kaiser on the subject ; that he tell the Kaiser that he is beaten, and cannot go on. I am reminded, however, that this was the complaint of an eminent military authority, in the person of Napoleon, who once complained of the English, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley</inline> is complaining now about Germany, that they were beaten a dozen times, and did not know it. They always fought on, and always pulled through. Now, what were the authorities quoted by the honorable senator? He quoted <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bonar</inline> Law, who said that the end was coming. Well, I know that my end is coming also, but I am not feeling very miserable about that. </para>

                            <para>- Nor have I, and the ground of my belief is the confidence I have that we are going to win this referendum, so that a greater effort will be made by this country. I believe that the resources of the Allies are infinitely superior to the resources of Germany, and. I believe, also, they are now so organized that by a supreme effort we can end this war within a reasonable time and make a permanent peace assured. The honorable senator referred to the brighter outlook of late. We are all glad to know that the position has so improved, but may I remind the honorable senator, when he declares that Germany is beaten, that she is still in occupation of Belgium, one-fifth of France, the whole of Servia, and a considerable portion of Russian territory? I am confident, however, that we are going to win, because I feel assured that the response of the people to the referendum will be emphatically in the affirmative, and that a greater effort will be made, not only by Australia, but by the whole of the Allies. If I may use a simile, I would say that if this war is regarded as a game, it must not be played in a slovenly manner. Every post - to use a sporting term - must be made a winning post if we are to come out victorious. When <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley</inline> was speaking last night, he quoted one authority telling us that France, twelve months ago, had been bled white. </para>

                            <para>- Well, what does that mean? Great Britain also will have more men in the field at the end of the war than she had at the beginning. Australia, too, will have infinitely more men at the end of the war than she had at the beginning. Obviously that must be the position, otherwise we would be overrun by the enemy. What point is there in a statement of that sort? Naturally, any nation having to fight for its life will organize its resources to its fullest capacity by calling to its standard every available man. There is every reason to assume, therefore, that the Allies will end this war with more men under arms than at the beginning. There is no getting away from the fact that recently the strain on France almost reached the breaking point, and that practically she had no further resources upon which she could draw. This fact surely lays an additional obligation upon those of the Allies who have not been drawing upon their resources to the same extent. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley</inline> affirms that Great Britain has ample men, and that Germany is in extreme difficulties. I do not know whether he has read anything except the authorities he quoted, but I noticed in a Sydney paper the other day a cable message to the effect that the Imperial Government were considering the question of &#34; combing out &#34; the munition works with the idea of obtaining more fit men for the British fighting forces. The <inline font-style="italic">Daily Mail</inline> went on to say that there was need for the most searching revision of all men in civil occupations, including those exempted. </para>

                            <para>- Yes; and it did so on the authority of General Haig, who said that this war was a young man&#39;s game, and that it was not wise to raise the age above forty-one years. This matter was only referred to by the <inline font-style="italic">Daily Mail</inline> because it had been suggested that the age should be raised in order to get more men to the front. Rather than do that, it suggested that they might review the exempted occupations and go through the munition works to see if they could call more fit men to the colours. So far from Great Britain having an ample &#34;supply of men, the opinion in the lobbies of the Imperial Parliament is that still further steps must be taken before the position is considered absolutely safe. </para>

                            <para>- So far as that is concerned, yes. Evidently, according to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley&#39;s</inline> view, Democracy has nothing to do with war. I do not know whether my honorable friends on the opposite side will father such a statement as that. England, as we know, did not want to go &#34;to war. Australia did not. I do not think France did, and Belgium certainly did not, -because Belgium had no inclination to come into this war and be made a martyr of. They were all forced into the war; and I want to put this proposition to those who declare that Democracy has nothing to do with war - What is a Democracy to do when it is attacked? Is it to sit down and allow the enemy to overrun its country? There is only one duty for a democratic community when attacked, and that is to fight for its national existence. Might I also put this question to my honorable friends who claim to be Democrats. If a Democracy has to fight for its national existence, who is it in that community that has to do the fighting? Is it to be the duty of all or only of some in the community? There can be only one answer. It is the duty of the whole of the community to rush to its defence. </para>

That is to say, those stalwart Democrats who are always denouncing privilege aud class say, when our national existence is threatened, &#34; For God&#39;s sake, let us create a privileged class to shirk at home while others volunteer to fight for us.&#34; If this be Democracy, the sooner it is dead the better; but I say that Democracy will repudiate this doctrine, and spew it out of its mouth at the polls. </para>

                            <para>- Australia has not. The men who have done their duty are those who volunteered, and are at the front or on their way there. Those who are shielding them in shirking are not entitled to any share in the glory of those who are fighting in the trenches. What is the honorable senator doing now, when by voice and action he is refusing to send succour to the men in the trenches? </para>

                            <para>- The last war loan does not affect the position with which we are now dealing. I tell honorable senators who denounce class, and demand the equalization of privileges, that by the methods they are adopting to-day, they are perpetuating the very system which they condemn. They may be shifting the burden from one class, making even, as it were, the social obligations, but if they are going to throw the burden on another class the evil will remain. They may transfer the burden from one set of shoulders to another set, but the fact that it is still borne by one class makes it equally unjust. If a Democracy will not fight - I do not mean the few loyal hearts - but if a democratic community as a whole will not fight for its country, its ideals, its freedom, and its women, that Democracy must give place to a nation&#39; that will. </para>

                            <para>- Yes, as regards the men who have gone to the front. I yield them every honour, and I speak of them with pride and gratitude; but I refuse to allow men who are hanging back, and those who are helping and  encouraging  them to do so, to share the glory won at Gallipoli. What is the first thing that happens to a citizen when he is attacked and molested in the street? He calls the State, in the person of a policeman, to his aid, and if the policeman is not strong enough to cope with the assailants, he summons a passing citizen. But if that citizen is a Democrat of the kind I have been referring to, he takes no notice, and passes on. In that  way  the State protects the individual. Shortly afterwards the State is attacked, and the State says to the citizen, &#34; Help to defend me.&#34; The citizen replies, &#34; Oh, no; my conscience is too tender. I have too .great a regard for the sacredness of human life. I deny the Government the right to call on me to bear arms.&#34; The position is illogical and inconsistent, and too ridiculous for serious  consideration  What is the nation ? It is the whole body of citizens of the country. In an autocratic country the citizen may have some reason for thinking of the State as something apart from him, but in a democratic country like Australia, the nation is every citizen, and I deny the right of any one of those citizens to shirk the obligations of citizenship when the nation is threatened. In conclusion, I should like to ask those who seem to think that it is ultra-democratic to denounce this proposition, if it is democratic to talk about ideals of liberty and justice, but antidemocratic to draw the sword to defend them ? la it democratic to hold up our hands with horror at news of the murder of Nurse Cavill and the shooting of Captain  Fryatt,  but anti-democratic to take such action as will render a repetition of the outrages impossible? Is it democratic to denounce the deportation of 20,000 women and children from their homes in France, the herding of them together in trucks, and carrying them into territories occupied by Germany, but anti-democratic to play a man&#39;s part and say, &#34; We will go out and not only punish those responsible for the outrage, but render the period of captivity of those unfortunate women and children as brief as possible?&#34; Is it democratic for us to talk, as we do, about our institutions and the glorious future of our country, and show so little faith in one or the other as to turn round and say that we shall rest content with the effort we have made? Those who say that we have done enough already remind me of people whose property is threatened with destruction by flood. They set to work to raise an embankment, and, working like Trojans, build the bank to the level of the water, and then say, &#34; We have done marvellously well, let us now sit down and rest.&#34; They have no thought of the possibility of the water rising higher. Another illustration that suggests itself is that of people who set to work to build a house, and, with splendid energy and resourcefulness, speedily erect the walls. Then they say, &#39; &#39; We have done marvellously well.&#34; When one suggests that they should put on the roof, they say, &#34; Oh, no, we have done so well that we will rest.&#34; I say that we have built the arch; for Heaven&#39;s sake let us not falter with the work of putting in the coping stone. Something has been said as to the obligations of the Empire. I do not wish to say one word in supplementing remarks of that kind, but I remind honorable senators of the fact that in doing what we are asked to do we are keeping faith, not merely with the Empire, but, most of all, we are keeping faith with our own boys. A great deal has been said in denunciation of the action of any Government which would regard a treaty as a scrap pf paper to be torn up. Is it recollected by honorable senators that when despatching our contingents we gave a definite promise that we would keep our units at fighting strength? What we are asked to do today arises directly out of the action which we took in November last. Unsolicited, the Government made a proposal to the Imperial authorities, with&#39; the approval of Senators Ferricks, Mullan, Findley, and every other member  of  the Senate. </para>

                            <para>- But when Parliament did meet no objection was raised. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Turley</inline> knows as well as any member of the Senate that when Supply is sought an opportunity is afforded for the ventilation of every opinion and every grievance. The Government cabled to the Imperial authorities that they would not merely supply a new Army of 50,000, but that they would undertake to maintain both the original Army and the new one at full fighting strength. That- was a definite proposition. We did not say to the Imperial authorities - and still less to our boys - &#34; We will send this additional force, and if there are enough volunteers we will keep the units up to fighting strength.&#34; There was no &#34; if &#34; in it then, and there ought to be none now. We said that we would do so much. The Government, representing the people of Australia, made that offer and gave that undertaking, and every member of Parliament who refrained from raising any protest must be taken as having, by his silence, indorsed the promise then given. </para>

                            <para>- The honorable senator knew that the offer had been made. To my mind the position &#34;was that we all indorsed the action of the Government, and gave an assurance to the Imperial authorities that we would keep those units up to strength. But we gave that assurance to our own boys also. Every man who enlisted as a result of the recruiting campaign undertaken at that time did so, knowing that at every Post-office and police station throughout the Commonwealth was posted the declaration of the Prime Minister that Australia would see to it that the unit he was asked to join would not be allowed to dwindle, but would be kept at full fighting strength. Members of this Chamber were a party to that undertaking. It was a personal obligation to every boy who joined the Forces as a result of the appeal for troops. The question is now asked as to whether we will honour the pledge we gave them, or, to our eternal disgrace, see Australia placed in the ranks of defaulters. Reference has been made to a statement made by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> in July last. I forget the full text of it - <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> will probably be the most-quoted man in this campaign - but I remember that he declared, in effect, that if the time arrived when citizens would not fight for their country, it would be because the country was not worth fighting for. Will any member of this Chamber say that Australia is not worth fighting for - this land, with its splendid political institutions, its vast material resources, its destiny beyond the imagination of man to picture, the fairest spot on God&#39;s earth from a material point of view? </para>

                    <para class="block">In regard to political liberties and national institutions, it would be hardly an exaggeration to say that this country is as far removed from all other parts of the world as daylight is from dark. It cannot be said, therefore, that Australia is not worth fighting for. That being so, why should our men not be asked to fight for it? If men are not prepared to fight for this country, it is not because the country is not worth fighting for, but because they are unworthy to fight for it. Those who, in the hour of danger, decline to assist their country have no right to call the country theirs, and that applies, not only to those who are shirking their obvious duty, but also to those who encourage them in doing so. </para>

                        <para>. - The statement of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> that no member of this Parliament spoke against the war at the last election is perfectly true. Every one of us thought then that Great Britain and the rest of the Empire had entered the war intending to do the best they could under the systems under which they were working. Had any one of us stated from the public platform two years ago that ho advocated compulsory military service abroad, he would never again have seen the inside of this chamber, and would never have had an opportunity to speak for or against the present proposal of the Government. We went into the war under the conditions that existed at its outbreak. I deprecate the making of wild statements against the integrity and honour of those who are taking part in this campaign. Some persons have called <inline font-weight="bold">Mr, Hughes</inline> names, but I have no intention of doing so, and an attitude like mine should be reciprocated. But <inline font-weight="bold">Mr, Hughes</inline> himself, according to the newspapers, is calling all who are opposing him names. I spent the recent long recess in Queensland. When the newspapers which contained long accounts of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> in the Old Country arrived, there was perturbation in the minds of many persons belonging to the industrial classes, who wondered whether <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> would honour the pledges which he had given to this country. The fear was expressed that, influenced by the honours that were being paid to him, he might change his opinions. I told such persons at the meetings that I attended that we had sent <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> to the Old Country to do certain things, and that if he did them he would accomplish a great work for Australia, but that I did not think that, on his return, he would advocate conscription for military service outside the Commonwealth. I knew that throughout his career he had definitely declared himself to be opposed to compulsory  service outside Australia, at any time and under any circumstances, though he was in favour of compulsion for home defence. I asked my friends, therefore, not to judge him too hastily, and not to condemn him before his return. I told them that, even if he had changed his views, he could not force conscription on to the people of this country; that the Labour party alone could do that. That is the position to-day. Whatever may be <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes&#39;</inline> personal opinions, they cannot be forced on the people of this continent without the aid of the Labour party. Just before leaving Brisbane I was asked by persons connected with the political and industrial organizations of the State what I thought about conscription, and I repeated what I had said before - that I did not believe that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> would advocate conscription for service outside Australia. A great deal has been said in disapproval of those who voted against the first reading of this Bill. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> has said that the Labour party have hitherto regarded the referendum as an instrument which would assist Democracy, and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ready</inline> said that he cannot understand the action of Labour members in voting against the referendum. It is true that the initiative and referendum are planks of the platform of the Labour party, and I have, on various occasions, signed that platform. I believe that the referendum will, and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> has admitted that it may, in the future be part of the legislative machinery of this country. I have not advocated the initiative and referendum be cause, like many others, I regard it as the panacea for all evils. My reading and experience lead me to think that the referendum will be rather conservative in its action. But I regard it as likely to be the most educative influence that could be created. It will induce people to take interest in political questions that cannot be dealt with at a general election, when the electors cast their votes for a candidate, some almost without regarding his principles, and simply because he is well and favorably known, others for certain views that he advocates, and others, again, for other views. Consequently, all that is gained by a general election is the knowledge that the country as a whole indorses the policy of the party which has been returned to Parliament by a majority. With the initiative and referendum, the people will have the right to demand that Parliament shall deal with certain matters, and will also have the right to demand that, before measures which have been considered by Parliament become law, they shall be referred to the electors for ratification. One of the first things that I learned when I joined the Labour party, some years ago, was that when a proposal hostile to the principles of the party was brought before Parliament, the attempt should be made to kill it as soon as possible. In Queensland., in 1894, when the west was not as well supplied with railways as it is now, an industrial war broke out, and the military was sent to quell disturbances. The Government of the day introduced a Bill empowering them to hold up persons met on the road, and to take them to places to be examined. It was, in fact, the first real coercion Bill ever introduced into an Australian Parliament. Until then the usual practice had been to regard the first-reading stage of a Bill as formal, to debate its principles on the second reading, and to consider its details in Committee. But, in regard to this Bill, the Labour party held a meeting, and determined that it was so dangerous that an attempt must be made to kill it at the moment of its introduction.  In my opinion similar action should have been taken with this Bill, which is an attempt to induce the people of Australia to consent to conscription. In opposing the measure, I am putting into effect the principles on which I was elected, and, had I been able to defeat the first reading, I should have been justified in doing so. The same spirit animated those who voted with me. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Beady</inline> objected to a division on the first reading, because the Labour party had hitherto been united. </para>

In fact, the whole of the Labour party opposed the Bill that authorized the referendum. I remember also the occasion on which we raised our salaries. We were immediately snowed under by all sorts of resolutions from local and other bodies, and the burden of those resolutions was that the members of this Parliament had no right to deal with such a matter until it had first been referred to the people. Was there any honorable senator who accepted the suggestion then made by some honorable members of the other House, that the matter should be dealt with by a referendum? Not one. I did not believe in referring the matter to the people, because I realized that had a referendum on the question been taken we would not have been able to do a fair thing for those connected with the Parliament of the Commonwealth. The Queensland Labour party has had the principle of the initiative and referendum on its platform for quite a number oi years. From Cape York to the Tweed River a large section of the people of Queensland has been agitating for a referendum in connexion with early closing, Almost every day during the Premier&#39;s absence from the State deputations waited on the Acting Premier, and since the Premier&#39;s return there have been huge deputations filling the room at the Treasury Building set apart for the purpose; but what has been the reply to those deputations? It has been, &#34; No. The Government are not going to take a referendum on this particular question in order to please you. We propose to pass legislation that will permit of a referendum being taken, if a section of the community think it wise that any matter should be referred to the people.&#34; If the Commonwealth Parliament had an Initiative and Referendum Act on the statute-book, no doubt long ago a section of the people would have exercised their right to initiate action in the direction of compulsory military service abroad, but I would not be a party to allow the Bill before us to-day to go an inch further than I can help. That is the stand I take upon it, and a stand which I propose to take outside in opposing the referendum. One would imagine from the remarks of some people that the Labour party had committed itself to compulsory service all round. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> says that the party claims credit for the compulsory service provisions that are in force in Australia. That is certainly true. We were quite right in placing them on the statute-book. I understand that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ferricks</inline> has stated his belief in compulsory service for the young manhood of Australia, and I believe in it for various reasons. In fact I supported it ou the platform, and afterwards, when it became the law of the land, I defended it. Its strongest opponents were those who today are conducting the agitation for compulsory service abroad. One thing that animated every member of the Labour party in passing the Act was the provision that no man should be sent out of Australia unless he volunteered to go. That is the stand I take to-day. There is bound to be misrepresentation during the campaign upon the referendum proposal of the Government. There is an instance of it in to-day&#39;s <inline font-style="italic">Argus</inline> in a portion of the journal which purports to set out what the compulsory scheme means. - It says that the additional reinforcements required to the 31st July, 1917, will be 100,000 men. The Minister for Defence, speaking in this chamber last week, said - </para>

With these misrepresentations the people will ask: &#34;Why all this trouble when only so many men are required ?&#34; It is this kind of misrepresentation that we shall have to combat on the platform, and by means of circulars and leaflets and through the columns of the press controlled by the Labour party in order to put the truth before the people.  </para>

                            <para>- I do not know that I read the speech <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> delivered in Sydney. I have taken the speech delivered in this chamber by the Minister for Defence as to the number of men who will be required by the- end of March, and I have added to  His  figures four mouths at the rate of 16,500 per month, which brings the total to 197,000. Already in Australia we have had an example of the exercise of power which has been intrusted to the authorities. I have always held that no body of men can be found to whom unlimited power can be intrusted. The man is rare who, when he has once started to put into operation a power which has been intrusted to him, does not use it again and again in order to brush aside, or, if necessary, crush, anything obnoxious to him_ which he has not previously anticipated. All through history we have had cases of individuals and bodies of men abusing the power which they have assumed or which has been reposed in them by the community. It may be asked, &#34; What are the Labour people in Australia afraid of ?&#34; One thing that I am afraid of is that we may run the risk of losing the system which the Labour party inaugurated for the purpose of defending Australia. I believe that if compulsory service abroad were forced on the people of Australia, there would be such a reaction that very few men would be returned to this Parliament in favour of the continuance of the present system. It is because I want to maintain that system, which was advocated and carried through by the Labour party, that I take up my present attitude. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> claimed that the compulsory provisions of the Defence Act were brought in by the party which we were supporting at the time, but that party numbered only seven or eight, and the support they received from the Labour party enabled them to carry their legislation into effect in spite of the opposition on some details of those with, whom <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> was at that time connected. I am afraid that the idea of compulsion will stink in the nostrils of the electors to such an extent that we shall practically lose our present system of defence, in the building up of which we have done such a great work. </para>

Had our system of compulsory service for Australian defence been in existence for a number of years longer there would have been no question of compulsion for outside service. It is association with one another that in many cases induces men to volunteer. Men scattered over large districts have in many cases not seen the necessity of offering their services for what is practically the defence of their country in Europe. </para>

                            <para>- I am not speaking of the metropolitan area. The idea of compulsion seems always to get into the minds of people who obtain authority. A few years ago, when Great Britain entered into the Boer War, the Labour party in Queensland, to which I belonged, strongly condemned the action of the Government in proposing to send contingents. We were a very small minority, and were beaten. After a year or two people recognised that that war was not altogether a credit to Great Britain, Australia, or the other Dominions, but had been carried out principally for the sake of people who wanted to exploit the country for certain industrial purposes. I am satisfied that some people in Queensland, who at that time wanted volunteers to go from Australia, if they had had in their hands the power of compulsion, would have used it then just the same as our Government would use it here to-day. Power, when intrusted to a few people, is very likely to be used in such a way that those who intrusted it to them will not be at all satisfied. Consequently, although we have a Labour Government in power, I, as one of their supporters, am not prepared to give them the right to compel people to go outside Australia, even to take part in this war. </para>

                            <para>- If the honorable senator means that the Government have not intrusted the members of this Parliament with all the information they possess I can say nothing; but we have been given to understand that they have taken us into their full confidence. The honorable senator was present at the secret session, where the Prime Minister laid the whole of his cards on the table. If the Government have any further information they have not disclosed it to us. I said that there would be a considerable amount of misrepresentation in this campaign. It has begun already. We see it in the columns of the press and in statements made by public men and others. Ministers were asked in this Chamber whether a fair opportunity would be given to those opposing the Bill to express their opinions, and whether the Labour press would be given a free hand to publish what they thought necessary, and the Minister for Defence replied that full liberty to meet and express opinions would be given, and that the press would have the right to publish everything bearing on the question, with the limitation that no one would be allowed to incite men to strike or to break the law. What does &#34;inciting to strike&#34; consist of? There are at this moment two strikes going on in Queensland. One of them is by the Ship-owners Association. As the wharfs on the Brisbane River extend for about 4 miles, the men pointed out that it was expensive and time-wasting to have to run here and there looking for employment, and that where twenty men were wanted sixty might go, and forty have to come back. They proposed that they should gather at a certain place from 8 o&#39;clock to 10 in the morning, and 2 o&#39;clock to 3 in the afternoon, and that the representatives of the employers, being comparatively few in number, should come there and select what labour they required. The mayor, after consulting the city council, granted them the use of a piece of ground at the foot of Charlotte-street; but the employers said, &#34;We do not like that piece of ground. There is a piece of ground on the opposite side of the street that is in the hands of a firm of auctioneers. You can use that if you observe certain conditions. If you go there, we are willing to come and engage you; but we will not go across the road to your piece of ground.&#34; The consequence is that the whole of the shipping trade of Brisbane is hung up because the men who have to do the engaging will not go from one side of the street to the other. The workers pointed out that they would be sure of possession of the piece of public ground lent to them by the mayor, but that if the land suggested by the employers were sold they would have to clear out, and would have lost the opportunity of obtaining the use of the other. The Liberal party in Queensland some years ago passed an Industrial Peace Act for the regulation of wages and conditions of labour, giving the men the right of appeal to a Court for an award by a Judge, after the hearing of evidence. The members of a certain union appealed to the Judge for a variation of an award previously given by another Judge. Lengthy evidence was taken, and the Judge, after going through thousands of folios of evidence gave an award. The mcn said, &#34; This is a splendid award, and we are perfectly satisfied with it.&#34; The employers, however, contend that the industry will not stand the strain of meeting it, and they have said, &#34; So far as we are concerned, there can be no work; we are going to sit down.&#34; In other words, the sugar-growers of Queensland went on strike. I do not say they have not as much right to strike as the cane-cutters have, but there is no power in the hands of the Minister for Defence, or any other authority, to prevent them from doing so. There is no power to require the employers to engage the labour when they require it. We are quite unable to secure a settlement of the difficulty at the present time, although it is causing great inconvenience, and eventually may cause enormous loss to the people of Australia. The Minister for Defence said that German influence might be going on in connexion with the opposition to thi3 proposal, but he does not insinuate that there is any German influence working in association with the ship-owners of Australia. Surely he does not say that there is German influence working in connexion with the sugar industry in Queensland? I do not think there is. But if the action to which I have referred had been taken by the men instead of by the employers, in all probability it would have been said from one end of Australia to the other that either German influence or gold was being used with the object of inducing these men to continue industrial troubles such as are now occurring. We have no means of getting rid of these troubles, although they may be detrimental to the best interests of the people. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen,</inline> in the course of his speech, said he did not know why the opponents of conscription should imagine that this proposal was likely to have any effect upon industrial conditions in Australia. He had no sooner given expression to that view, however, than he went on to say, &#34; Conscription means organization, and will enable the Government to say to one man, &#39;Your services are required here in Australia,&#39; and to another, &#39; Your services are required at the front.&#39; &#34; What does that mean ? He also said, &#34; This power is to be used for military purposes alone.&#39;* Is there anything in Australia to-day that could not be classed as necessary for military purposes? Are the employees in the Government Clothing Factory not working for military purposes? </para>

I regret that I have not at hand a copy of the constitution of that league, so that I might show honorable senators the sugar coating on the pill. The constitution of that league says, in effect, &#34;We want the public to understand that our advocacy of universal service does not mean that every man shall be sent to the front. It means that the industries of Australia will be organized, and that the men and women whose services may be required shall be controlled by the Government to that end.&#34; </para>

Continuing, he said the objects of the league were clear and definite, the one desire being that the Commonwealth Government should take such measures as would make available every male necessary to the successful prosecution of the war, and organize all the resources of material and manhood. He thought it must be admitted that national organization would insure the services of the best men for the post for which they were best fitted. </para>

                            <para>- I know it will be said that that is not the proposal of the Government in this case; but my experience through life has taught me that it is necessary to be very careful as to the measure of power one places in the hands of the military. The whole life of military men is given up to organization - to the task of seeing that the best can be got out of the material submitted to them. They have no concern for the question of cost, or anything else, as long as they can secure material organization. Take the case of men who have been brought up without any thought of military service - who have not considered military service worth bothering about in times of peace - but who enter it in a crisis like the present. How long is it before they realize that they are merely a small cog on the wheel, and that the sole consideration is the particular unit to which they belong. If some other unit comes along wearing a different style of uniform or a more ornamental belt, they are flying at each other&#39;s throats almost before there has been an opportunity for them to talk with one another. Has that not happened in Australia in connexion with units formed in the various capitals? We know that it has. The very system of military service induces all in it to work with the one object - the object of organizing. Everything that comes in the way of the use of the power intrusted to them must be removed, and it does not matter how. That has been the history of militarism all the world over, and that is the German system - Germany which we are fighting to-day. In order to meet it, must we implant such a system in Australia as that? I do not believe it is necessary to do so. Judging by what we have read in the newspapers, the volunteers who were organized in England and Australia have been able, after a certain amount of training, not only to equal, but, in most cases, to excel their opponents on the battle-field, who have so long been under this system of militarism. I do not think the people of Australia will agree to the establishment of such a system here. They know that if it were established, the time would eventually come when an attempt would be made to apply it to the industry of this country. Certain statements, which appeared last week in a newspaper published in this city, and which is a strong advocate of compulsory service abroad, occasioned me considerable surprise. I shall make two or three quotations from the article in question, which appeared in the <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> of 16th instant. I shall not tear them from their context, but I shall read sufficient to enable honorable senators to arrive at the true meaning of the writer. In the first place, he said - </para>

                        <para>It stands quite certain that we shall not serve the Empire wisely if we suffer our wheat fields to go untitled and our factories and workshops to fall into desuetude. But there need be no fear of that, even if we were to enlist 400,000 men in our Australian army. If a great and spirited people will adopt military conscription rather than see a foreign foe prevail against its liberties, such a people will be just as ready to  conscribe  the services of industrial workers who are above the war age, and equally prompt to levy a special monetary tax where no other form of sacrifice is available. An old bachelor who can render no other form of service may at least pay, if he have means to pay, something over and above what a family man pays. </para>

                        <para>In Europe women are taking the place of men in all ranks of industry, save those in which brawn and muscle are the chief requisites. In Australia they have done so only in a few of the lighter vocations in offices. They are quite as ready here as in the Old World to do their share in whatever is ready to their hands. Then, again, we have amongst us large numbers of men over the middle age in retired or semi-retired positions. The Government which is about to conscript the young to enlist has just as good a right to conscript all such citizens to help in our industries from which the military conscripts are to be taken. </para>

                        <para>So far from labour being scarce, it is a common complaint that in every application for workmen there are at least three men seeking one job. This is because boys and girls and women have hitherto taken the places of those who have volunteered for the war. There is still a fairly large body of men and women, some of them beyond middle age, who may be utilized as home conscripts, if necessary, to help domestic industry, on the farm and in the factory, during the period of the war. This is quite within the province of the Government should the need arise. </para>

                        <para>. - Without going into the question of conscription, I wish to refer . very briefly to a few aspects of the proposed referendum. After the very able speeches we have heard, and the figures quoted by those opposed to the Government&#39;s proposals - speeches and figures that show unmistakably that the supply of single men cannot possibly last more than three or four months, when the married men must be called upon - and after <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> &#39;s candid and honest admission that the proposals mean the inclusion of all males in the Commonwealth between the ages of eighteen and sixty, I think the matter has been sufficiently threshed out. One phase of the question, however, has not yet been referred to during this debate though it is one I brought under the notice of the Minister for Defence the other day. I asked whether the honorable gentleman was aware that the French soldiers who were at Gallipoli, and those who are now at Salonika, were volunteers or &#39; conscripts. My object was to show that Australia, through the Prime Minister&#39;s proposals, is going further than France has ever gone, notwithstanding the gallant work that the French nation has done. In reply to that question,  the Minister for Defence said that there was no information on the subject; and the Prime Minister on being questioned said he did not know. </para>

                            <para>- None in the world; but Alsace is not 12,000 miles oversea from France. So far as my information goes, the French soldiers who went to Gallipoli, and those who are now at Salonika, are volunteers; and I do not think the Minister for Defence was quite candid when he said there was no information on the subject. By virtue of his position, the Minister for Defence must know that conscription in France&#39; applies only within the French domain and to the French colonies, unless, of course, during battle the issue is carried over the border. For service anywhere else abroad the French soldiers are volunteers. If the Minister for Defence is aware of that he should have been honest and candid enough to state the facts. </para>

                            <para>- I am very pleased to accept the honorable gentleman&#39;s assurance; but, according to my reading and knowledge, the position is as I have described. The proposal is to conscript Australians for service 12,000 miles oversea; and if the Prime Minister, with all the knowledge he is supposed to have obtained at the front, does not know the conditions of French military service, I am inclined to believe that he has not been very candidly informed by the Army War Council. There is another phase which has a direct and complete bearing on the Bill, and the question embodied in clause 5. It might have been expected that in the drafting of the Bill, a direct question would have been drawn  up.  If I were to put a question to one of the Ministers, and I endeavoured, in putting it, to canvass support for the proposition in that question, I take it, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. President,</inline> that you would rule me out of order, and ask me to use plain and direct language. I do not think  this will have very great bearing on the issue, but it would appear that the Prime Minister could not resist the temptation, in framing the question, to include a bit of advocacy. Another question arises in regard to the Fifth Division. The Minister for Defence has not given us any information, though he ought to be in possession of it, as to whether the 20,000 men, who are part of the 32,000 men to be raised this month&#39;,  could  I not have been obtained under the voluntary system during the next four months, thus making the measure now before us unnecessary. </para>

                            <para>- Some honorable senators, who are opposing the Bill, have said that, if the voluntary system had been given a fair trial it would not have broken down; but I disagree with them in this, because I hold that the voluntary system has not broken down.  Further,  I think that, in view of the fact that winter is approaching on the other side of the world, we might have had more and stronger confirmation from the Minister for Defence that all these reinforcements will be required during the ensuing six months. It is reasonable to assume that the casualty lists will not be so heavy during the impending winter as they have been in the months which have elapsed since our troops began to take part in the grand offensive. If we may judge from the war news in the press from day to day our troops on the Continent have not been taking part in such formidable actions as previously, and over the part of the line held by them there is a comparative lull. Of course, I suppose that hostilities  are  intermittently carried on day and night ; but seeing that we have had no very lengthy references to our troops in the press during the past few months, we may take it that there has been a lull, and, consequently, that the need of reinforcements will not be so great as previously. </para>

                            <para>- The dates of the fatal casualties are nearly all in July, and this for the reason given leads me to the conclusion that the need for reinforcements may not be so heavy during the ensuing winter. There is another matter on which some stress has been laid during this debate. I refer to the democratic aspect of this referendum. Honorable senators who support the referendum, although they may oppose the principle of conscription, have asserted that a referendum on a question like this is democratic. I have already said that in my opinion - which is now, I think, pretty well known throughout Australia, owing to the publicity given to the proceedings of the Senate - war and Democracy cannot run together. I do not agree with the views expressed by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> to-day. </para>

                            <para>- I am only making passing reference to some remarks by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen.</inline> As I said, Democracy and war cannot run together. The very foundation of war is opposed to Democracy; and when it does come, and is forced upon us, the respective peoples concerned would be in a very sad way but for Democracy. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> asks whose duty it is to defend the interests of the nation. He asks whether it is not the duty of the Democracy. I say that, so far as Australia is concerned, the Democracy has done it, and- done it exceedingly well. Those who believed it to be their duty voluntarily to go and fight Australia&#39;s battles were bound to do that duty, and I agree that they have done it exceedingly well. But to refer, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> did this afternoon, to all who have not gone to the front as &#34; shirkers &#34; is not fair. It must be patent to any member of the Senate that there must be thousands of Australians of military age who have good reasons for not going to the front. </para>

                            <para>- I realize the seriousness of the situation. No one desires more earnestly than I do the conclusion of the war. Coming back to the question of the referendum, and the statement of those who support the Bill, whilst opposing the principle of conscription, I say that the vital objection to the application of the word &#34; democratic &#34; to a referendum on such a question is, that, while the vote will be shared in by every elector of the Commonwealth, all will not share the consequences of the decision. If we take a referendum on the question of the closing of hotels, all the electors will share in the right to express an opinion on the proposal, and also in the effects of the decision, but the closing of hotels is not a matter of life and death. Here is another important difference between a referendum on the question of conscription and a referendum, upon such a question as the closing of hotels. In each case all the electors have a say in the decision ; but whilst in the case of a referendum on the closing of hotels all the electors are affected by the decision arrived at - which, in my opinion, is democratic - in the case of the referendum we are now considering, whilst every elector will have the opportunity - I will not call it a right in this case - to express an opinion on the question of conscription, if the principle be carried, every elector will not share in the consequences of the decision. The consequences will apply only to those male persons in the community who are physically fit and are between the ages of twenty-one and forty-five years. I say that is anti-democratic. It is opposed to the democratic principle to say that the whole of the electors shall have a right to decide an issue which must affect only a comparatively small section of the community. </para>

Members of the Labour party who are prepared to support it place themselves in a very invidious position. Not so many months ago the party, following certain action taken by the Prime Minister, agreed to the dropping of the referenda for the amendment of the Constitution. Having done that, to support the referendum now proposed will be inconsistent. </para>

                            <para>- It was postponed because the taking of a referendum during the currency of the war would divide the people into two hostile sections, and bring about political unrest at a time when there should be a truce between political parties. For weeks the daily press howled in support of that contention, and I think that, consciously or unconsciously, members of the Labour party were influenced by that agitation. </para>

                            <para>- The statement that the subject of the war would have led to division amongst the people on the referendum for constitutional amendments will not stand examination for a moment. During the currency of the war Labour members agreed to drop the constitutional referendum, but many of them are now supporting a referendum which will not only divide the people into two sections, but into two very hostile sections. Unless full liberty is given to both sides - and to the anti-conscription side to a greater extent than it has been given in the past - the  differing sections of the community will be more hostile in their division than they could possibly have been in a referendum upon a constitutional issue. &#34;We are told by the Prime Minister and the Minister for Defence that the powers conferred on the Government by the decision of the referendum will not be used industrially. I am not going into that question, which has been very ably dealt with by Senators Mullan and Turley. I am endeavouring to deal only with aspects of the matter which have so far been untouched. I want to refer to the matter of trusting the Government not to go beyond the assurances of the Prime Minister. The humblest student of political life is aware that one Government cannot bind another. One Executive cannot lay down hard-and-fast rules to be followed by a succeeding Government. Rut, putting that aside, and assuming, for the sake of argument, that we could guarantee that the Labour party will be always in power in the Commonwealth, we would still have no guarantee that conscription will not be applied industrially. We know that the present Government have already applied conscription to industrial workers in Australia without the carrying of the proposed referendum at all. They have done it under the powers they already possess under the Defence Act. That being so, is it not reasonable to fear that the present or any succeeding Government, under the pretext of guarding the nation, might take action similar to that which was taken by the Navy Department recently in conscripting men for service on the transports? The Navy Department conscripted men for service abroad under the provisions of the Defence Act. I am not prepared to trust any Government or any military authority with these powers. </para>

When he makes these appeals for the trust of the people, he must surely be speaking with his tongue in his cheek, in view of the fact that a Department of his Government has already carried into effect that which he says will never come about. When the Prime Minister is making these very eloquent appeals in halls crowded with sympathetic audiences, he also speaks of war profits, and says that it must be understood that there shall be no war profits during the currency of the war. </para>

                            <para>- Does anybody take a statement like that seriously from our Prime Minister? I do not, seeing the way that prices of commodities have jumped up during the last two years. The Leader of the Opposition this afternoon quoted an extract from the Brisbane <inline font-style="italic">Daily Standard</inline> of 7th September, containing a report of some remarks which I made at the meeting of the Trades Hall Council in  Sydney  on the question of my attitude towards recruiting meetings. The report of that speech, so far as it went, fairly set out my remarks, but, as it was a telegraphic report, it did not give my views fully. I have not been able to get a copy of the paper referred to, but <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> allowed me to look at the statement, and I had a hurried glance through it. My attitude on the question of addressing recruiting meetings is well known to my friends throughout Queensland. I am within the military age, being just over forty years old. I do not intend to enlist, and I am not going on the public platform to urge others to do what I am not prepared to do myself. This was my attitude as stated by me at the meeting of the Trades Hall Council referred to, and the applause at that meeting, which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> remarked upon, referred to my attitude, and, .perhaps, not to the sentiment I expressed. </para>

                            <para>- The inference was that my remarks would have an influence in that direction. I submit that my attitude is a logical one. Anyhow, that is how it appears to me, and I am going to stand by it. I have not mentioned before that during the adjournment of Parliament I was for ten weeks in Queensland, and was in towns from Brisbane to Ayr, in the far north, while recruiting meetings were being held, but I was not asked to address one of those meetings. Other Labour members of Queensland were served in the same way, and in the metropolitan area I know they have been absolutely snubbed by the recruiting committees. If I had been asked, I should have answered in the terms of my statement to-night. It is a fact that the recruiting committees did not know what I would say; they never asked me to address a meeting during the whole of my ten weeks&#39; sojourn in Queensland. But after the report appeared in the <inline font-style="italic">Daily Standard</inline> on 7th September, I returned to Sydney, and received a telegram, which had been sent to Parliament House in the first instance, inviting me to address a meeting in Brisbane. The telegram intimated that they were holding a monster recruiting rally in the Exhibition Hall in Brisbane on Wednesday night, and if I could not attend would I send a message. On my return to Melbourne I inquired of my colleagues if they had received a similar invitation, and I found that the only other Queensland member in the Federal Parliament who had received an invitation was <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Finlayson.</inline> We had addressed an anti-conscription meeting together in Brisbane. I can give another instance of the designing, diabolical line of action taken by these local committees so far as the Queensland Labour members are concorned. </para>

                            <para>- It is part of their scheme to aim at the disruption of this party. It commenced about twelve months ago, and it. has been a well-defined plan of attack engineered by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Watt</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Sir William</inline> Irvine, in my opinion. But I blame the Government and the Defence Department for, unwittingly perhaps, but nevertheless truly, aiding them in their conspiracy. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Finlayson</inline> and I addressed an anti-conscription meeting in Brisbane on the 3rd August, and&#39; the following day was the second anniversary of the outbreak of the war. A big public meeting was held in the Central Square, Brisbane, at noon that day, and when I went down to the Federal members&#39; room in the morning I received an invitation from the Town  Clerk  to attend and take a seat on the platform. That was only an hour before the time fixed for the meeting, and the circular which invited me was dated 25th July, so evidently they did nob think of sending it between 25th July and 11 o&#39;clock on 4th August. I submit that these are the people who are responsible for the falling off in recruiting and the necessity for the Bill now before the Senate. In the Government&#39;s proposals as they have been outlined by the Prime Minister and the Minister for Defence, provision is made for  Courts of appeal for the purpose of adjudicating on claims of exemption. </para>

                            <para>- Yes , that is so. The first -Court , will, I understand, be presided over by a magistrate, and if the applicant for exemption is turned down there he may appeal to a Court presided over by a Judge of the Supreme Court. If unsuccessful there, he may then go to the High Court. I ask honorable senators what opportunity will a working man or his son have of going through all that procedure ? </para>

                            <para>- But the point is, if I were an applicant I might not have the ability to do justice to my claim, and, therefore would stand a chance of having it turned down, whereas a rich man, employing counsel, might be able to have his case stated in such a way as to be successful. I am entirely opposed to any discrimination of this kind under any scheme of militarism. This was forcibly impressed upon me by some remarks made by the Prime Minister in response to the toast of his health at the dinner given to him by the Government on his return from England, and at which honorable senators were present. During the course of his speech, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> paid a glowing and well-deserved tribute to the late <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. W.</inline> J. Johnson, formerly the member for Robertson in another place. He spoke of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Johnson&#39;s</inline> sterling qualities, and of the valuable work he was doing at the front in- France, where <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> met him. The Prime Minister&#39;s remarks were highly interesting, and to me were full of meaning, for he said that after chatting with <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Johnson</inline> he approached the Commanding Officer, and said, <inline font-weight="bold">&#34;Mr. Johnson</inline> is an erstwhile colleague of mine. He is a good farrier.&#34; I will not say any more, because I am not absolutely certain if <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> went any further in his remarks in reference to the incident. </para>

                            <para>- Yes, I think that is a correct statement of the remarks made by the Prime Minister, who told us that when the position was put before <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Johnson,</inline> to his credit he declined the offer to go back to his occupation as a farrier, but preferred to remain in the trenches. Now, in regard to a question of exemptions, or the selection and allotment of men. What would be the position of an influential person who might know some one of weight and backing ? I submit such discriminations are very likely to occur, and that is one reason why I will not admit that this system can be democratic. </para>

                            <para>- I am glad to hear that. The speeches made in and out of Parliament in support of the Government proposals seem to revolve round the belief that the manhood of Australia has the destinies of the war in its hands ; that it remains with Australia to win or lose the war. I wish I could believe that it depended on the handful of men the Commonwealth can send to the front to decide this great world-wide war. But if every man in Australia, married or single, were available for allotment to the fighting front to-morrow, they would constitute only a drop in the bucket. I do not believe that the Allies are, or ever have been, short of men, although they have been short of equipment and means of transport. Another very pertinent question relates to the production of wealth in Australia. Without traversing any of the ground previously covered, I would remind the Senate that about twelve months ago there was a concerted agitation in the press that the Government should organize the manufacture of shell cases in Australia. For months that agitation was continued, and, whilst I have said harsh things about the Minister for Defence, and, perhaps, thought harsher things than I said, I must admit that I had intense sympathy with him in the attacks to which he was then subjected. We knew that the Defence Department could not proceed with the manufacture of shell cases, because it had not the formula. We know that the Department had been cabling to the Imperial authorities for months to get the required particulars, and some of us believe that the authorities could not supply that formula, for the very good reason that they had not got it; it was in the hands of the private shell manufacturers. When Australia did try its hand at shell making, and the Imperial authorities realized that the transport of our comparatively small production over a distance of 12,000 miles was, at the least, not an expeditious proceeding, they cabled to the Minister for Defence that no more shells were required from Australia. To me it appeared that by that message the Home Government gave Australia to understand that the best service we could render to Great Britain was to go ahead in the production of those vital necessities which the Commonwealth is so capable of producing. I honestly believe that to be the position to-day. </para>

                            <para>- -Yes. We remember that at the time of the Dreadnought craze, when a wave of insanity swept over the Commonwealth, the Imperial authorities sent a similar message, which meant, in effect, that the best service Australia could render to the Motherland was to learn to defend itself. That was an indorsement of the Fisher policy for the creation of an Australian Navy, and if any confirmation of the wisdom of that hint from England were wanted - and I do not think any confirmation was required - it has been supplied by the achievement of our Navy during this war. Holding the belief, therefore, that the Imperial authorities do not require men from Australia, it devolves upon me to express my belief as to why the Government are introducing this proposal. I am of opinion that volunteers will suffice to provide all the men the Imperial Government requires from Australia. The main reason  why Great Britain desires the establishment of conscription in Australia is not for the sake of getting more men, but for the sake of the moral effect of the establishment of that system in the Commonwealth under the <inline font-style="italic">regime</inline> of a Labour Government. Once that is done, the system of conscription in Great Britain can be tightened up, and whatever latitude is now allowed industrially will cease. I believe that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> was overcome by influences in Great Britain with that object in view. </para>

                            <para>- Like every  other  man he is amenable to influence, and most honorable senators will, admit that when he went to England he departed from the recognised tenets of Australian  Labourism.  Once conscription is established in Australia by a Labour Government, is it not apparent what a fine lever the Imperial Government will have with which to give the screw of conscription an extra turn, and if there be any objection to the tightening up of the system, they will reply that Australia, under a Labour Government, has gone further? Another aspect of this question is the danger of precedent. It has been said that the operation of this measure will be for the duration of this war only. On this point I am in agreement with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley.</inline> Taking the Government at their word, I fear that once conscription is introduced it will remain. But disagreeing, for the sake of argument, from the sentiments expressed by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley,</inline> I ask, if another Government came into office and another war broke out, who could defend the non-imposition of compulsion on a second occasion? If a Liberal or Conservative Government proposed conscription, and the Democracy of Australia objected; the Government could retort, &#39; &#39; Your own representatives established a precedent in </para>

                            <para>- Governments follow precedents when it suits .them, as the actions of the present Government have shown. I stated in connexion with the monstrous terms offered in connexion with the war loan that if those proposals had been advanced by a Fusion Government every Labour member in both Houses, and every Labour paper in Australia, would have been up in arms against them. Some reference has been made in the course of the debate to those of us who have dared to criticise <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes.</inline> It will be within the recollection of honorable senators that when <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> contemplated his visit to England I was one of those who opposed what I have described as &#34; his self-invited visit.&#34; On a motion for the adjournment of the Senate towards the end of last year, I raised a protest against adjourning Parliament for so many months while the nation was at war. At the first subsequent opportunity after Parliament re-assembled. I did criticise <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes&#39;</inline> utterances in Great Britain. I said then, and I say now, that in his speeches in England he did not represent Australian Labourism  And honorable senators who were present on that occasion will remember the wrathful indignation with which the Minister for Defence received my comment. In view of the reception that has been given to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> and his proposals by the recognised Labour authorities of Australia since his return, it will be agreed that my statement was not very wide of the mark. In conclusion, let me say that my position on this question is clear. I have spoken on the subject several times, and I am satisfied that the people of Queensland know my attitude. What makes me more satisfied on that point is the number of letters I have received from all over Queensland, many of them in commendation, and also many in condemnation, of my attitude. The position I adopted in May is my position to-night. I am against conscription. I will not support it by voice or vote. I said that much last year long before the question was raised. In September, 1915, I expressed those views in the Sydney <inline font-style="italic">Worker</inline> at the request of its Melbourne representative. Here let me allude to a remark by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> that had any of us dared to speak on the election platform in opposition to Australia&#39;s participation in the war we would not have been returned to Parliament. I will tell the Senate what I told the electors of Queensland from nearly all the platforms I occupied in Queensland during the last Senate election. I used to open my speeches with a statement to this effect, &#39; &#39; We all deplore the war ; we would all like to see it finished. The people who do the fighting are not responsible for the war : it was arranged by coteries and cliques under the disguise of the diplomatic service. If I had my way I would put those who caused the war in the front firing line, and I would see the workers standing back on the hills, waving flags, and singing &#34;Rule Britannia!&#34; That is my attitude to-day. </para>

They have allowed the opponents of Democracy - those who &#34; sool &#34; others on to fight - not only liberty to express opinion, but absolute licence. That is the genesis of this Bill. In the guise of recruiting agents, these persons were allowed to go throughout the length and breadth of Australia, condemning voluntarism and advocating conscription. These representatives of Democracy have failed in their duty, and are about to reap the whirl-wind which, by their negligence, they have sown.

I shall oppose the Bill, and, if it passes, I shall, in company with my colleagues, travel over Queensland as extensively as I can, opposing conscription, and advising the electors to vote &#34; No &#34; on the referendum question. If the referendum be answered in the affirmative, and the people decide on conscription, I shall come here, if I am alive and still a representative of the people, and record my vote against the introduction of compulsion into Australia, because I do not think that the people have the right to decide this matter. </para>

                        has professed to speak in the name of Democracy, but his concluding remarks show how far he is from the sentiments of an honorable Democrat. Does he not know what Democracy means ; that it is the government of the people by the people? Does he not recognise that the people have the right to express their opinions on any great question, and to have those opinions put into effect? Parliament is not an institution created for the benefit of the few individuals who happen to be its members. Those who sit in Parliament are returned as representing the views of a majority of the electors. The people cannot attend Parliament in person, and, therefore, choose members to represent them in the councils of the nation. Thus the whole community expresses its voice on the great questions of the day. I have never been a supporter of the principle of the referendum, but I cannot understand how a member of the Labour party, in whose platform the referendum is a plank, and who believes that it expresses a great democratic principle, can oppose the submission of a question like conscription to the electors. The Government say now, &#34;We do not ask you to determine this question ; we merely ask you to refer it to our masters - the people - to determine.&#34; But
                        <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ferricks</inline>
                        replies, &#34;No. I shall not allow the Democracy to have a voice regarding conscription. I would sooner choke their opinions in their throats than permit them to express their views regarding this proposal.&#34;

                            <para>- I am not now discussing that question. The body referred to has done good, loyal, and honest work in the interests of the people generally. Although the members of the Labour party support the referendum as a great democratic instrument, some of them, fearing that, on the question of conscription, the vote of the people will go against them, say now, &#34; We will not let conscription be referred to the people. It is too important and too vital a question for them to vote on.&#34; Why do they not themselves take a vote in Parliament on the question? They are divided both on the question of conscription itself and on the method of dealing with the present difficulty. Personally, I would have preferred to have this matter dealt with directly by Parliament. However, Ministers, having met their friends and supporters, and having found that these cannot agree among themselves, ask the Parliament to refer the matter to the people. But <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ferricks</inline> declares that even if the people decide for conscription he will make it his duty to attend in this chamber, and will do all that he can to prevent effect being given to the popular will. Yet, notwithstanding that statement, he professes to be a representative of Democracy. God help a Democracy that is represented in that way ! </para>

                            <para>- Neither for Autocracy nor for the Industrial Workers of the World. A great deal of what has been said during this debate has had little to do with the subject under consideration. The Prime Minister, during his visit to the Old World, entered the inner councils, not only of the Imperial Government, but, I believe, of the military authorities in the field in France, and knows the exact position of affairs. The speeches that he delivered while away showed that he would support compulsion should its adoption be necessary to save the Empire. In the early stages of the war this Parliament declared that Australia would play her part to the bitter end, no matter what that might cost in men or in money. Now there are some who would have us hedge or draw back. </para>

                            <para>- Every man that is needed to protect her liberty and her rights. Would the honorable senator say &#39; &#39; &#39; No &#39; &#39; to conscription if he were absolutely certain that it was necessary to conscript every man in the country to prevent it from falling into the hands of a foreign Power ? I do not believe that he would. Even those who are not opposing conscription would surely not allow the nation to be ruined rather than adopt the course now proposed. I hold no brief for <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes,</inline> but I recognise that the logic of circumstances has forced him to take the present step. He sees that it is necessary that the people should realize where they stand, and he wishes them to express their views in a clear and unmistakable voice. Who, when the war began, would have imagined that Great Britain&#39;s small army would within two years swell to a force of 5,000,000 men, and who would have imagined a little over two years ago that the strongest opponents of conscription in Great Britain would be advocating it now. </para>

                                GOULD. - Yes, but until of late the feeling of the British nation has been, wholly against conscription. Hitherto they have felt that their Navy kept them perfectly safe. This war, however, is not like the wars of the past, in which comparatively few men were engaged, and the interests at stake were not as great as they are to-day. This is war to the death. We must choose between utter defeat and victory. Great Britain and Germany are the two great Powers who have had most influence in the world&#39;s affairs, and Germany determined to make herself the first world Power, and to put all other nations at her feet. That intention would be carried out were she to succeed. Apparently the fortunes of the war are now favouring the Allies&#39; cause, and the predictions cited last night by
                                <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley</inline>
                                as to its early close seem likely to be fulfilled. It must be remembered, however, that those predictions were based on a consideration of the material and resources apparently available to the Empire at the time that they were made.

                                GOULD. - He believed that Australia intended to continue on the course she was following, that she was determined to play her part to the last man and to the last shilling, and that she would not withdraw until victory not merely smiled in the distance, but was actually won. We do not support the Bill because we think that Great Britain and her Allies are going to be defeated, bub because we think that, although we are 12,000 miles away from the scene of conflict, Australians are actuated by the same spirit of determination to triumphantly end the war at all hazards - even at the expense of conscripting every man capable of carrying arms, and sending him to the front - as actuates the men of Great Britain. Australians recognise that the Commonwealth is but a portion of a great Empire, that the success or failure of Great Britain means the success or failure of Australia, and, therefore, that Australia is necessarily a participant in the war equally with Great Britain. Honorable senators claim that war and Democracy cannot go together. Why not? When war is forced on us, and we are compelled to defend our most cherished possessions and rights, we must fight or let the enemy march straight over us. The Bill we have before us is justified by circumstances. It will provide the opportunity of ascertaining whether the people of Australia are still determined to carry on the war to the end. They entered the conflict and gave their promise that their forces in the field would be maintained at their full strength; and I do not think that they will belittle that promise or treat it as we know the Germans have treated their treaties with regard to Belgium. Any one who has read of the in humanities that Germany has practised in this war must realize that the nation which seeks to win by methods of frightfulness is not going to deal very tenderly with a vanquished enemy. So it is in our own interests to fight to the very last, and it is about time opportunity was given to force some of the thousands of young men one sees who ought to be at the front, to take their part in the fighting that more patriotic men have taken voluntarily. I can understand the feelings of the man who says, &#34; Why should I go to the war when my neighbour, who is just as qualified and just as fit as I am, stands quietly by and enjoys himself as well as he can, leaving me to risk my life?&#34; A duty rests on every man in the Commonwealth to defend it. No sacredness of life can justify any man in refusing to give his services for the protection of the country to which he owes allegiance.

So far as I am aware, not one word has been raised by any individual in Australia against the right of the Government to impose extra taxation, or against the amount of taxation that has already been levied. We cannot raise another 100,000 troops without the imposition of additional taxation, and it must be obtained from the men who have the means to pay it. They could not have those means if the country were not protected; and, as the destruction of the country would mean the loss of their means to the enemy, it becomes simply a question of self-preservation </para>

                            <para>- The honorable senator has not done anything to obviate the rise in the price of foodstuffs in his State. Conditions are exactly the same in States controlled by Labour Governments as they are here. According to statistics, the cost of living is greater in New South Wales, where there has been a Labour Government in power for years, than it is in  any  other State. As honorable senators who sit in opposition to the Government believe that the right action has been taken in this matter, they do not propose to assist any body of malcontents who may seek to prevent Australia from continuing to take its proper part in this great war. They feel that it is their patriotic duty to follow the Government, who are charged with the administration of affairs during the war, and assist them in carrying out their policy. Some of the speeches we have heard to-day could very well have been delivered on a motion of censure upon the general administration of the Government, because Ministers have been attacked from every point. However, I simply rose to express my approval of, and satisfaction with, the efforts that the Government are making for dealing with this matter, which is so grave and so vital to the interests of Australia. </para>

                        <para>.- The issue raised by the Bill is of grave and serious importance, and, for that reason, I wish to state my position as clearly, briefly, and concisely as possible. I am pleased at the manner in which the debate has proceeded so far. I would not have been surprised had a great deal of acrimony been displayed during the debate. Instead of this, we find that honorable members on either side have expressed themselves sufficiently forcibly without committing themselves to anything that might be questioned. At the outset I make the declaration that I am a pronounced anti-conscriptionist. I have come to that decision after giving the matter months of sincere and conscientious consideration. I believe that compulsory military service abroad is a bad principle, which should not be fastened on a free country like Australia. The issue raised by the Bill is twofold. On the one hand, we are engaged in the greatest and most serious war that the world has ever seen. On the other hand, Australia is threatened with having fastened on it the mo3t iniquitous, oppressive, hateful, and repulsive thing that I can think of. In Great Britain itself, and throughout the British Dominions, we have for years boasted of our voluntarism. It is a common saying that one volunteer is worth ten pressed men. That is, doubtless, an exaggeration, but it expresses the view of the British people that the volunteer is much more useful in any service than the man who is pressed into it. A man pressed into any activity wholly against his will will not succeed like one who goes into it voluntarily. </para>

                            <para>- If I had gone through Tasmania, and said I was prepared to support the conscription of human life, I should not have had the ghost of a chance of getting in, nor would any one of us. To me the statement is so much moonshine. The war is not of our making, although, so far as the evidence goes, it is a just war. Australia has done nobly. Almost every public man who has spoken on the subject in the Home Land has commended this country in the most laudatory terms for what it has done. I have never heard a remark from any one outside Australia so disparaging as some I have heard in Australia about our own people. No country has done more. When <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bakhap</inline> spoke of conscription, and paying men at the rate of about ls. 2d. a day, being necessary, I interjected that no country of the same size had done as much. If to beat all records is to fail, goodness knows what success would be, and Australia has beaten every record. </para>

                            <para>- Australia is doing its duty nobly. We have enlisted about 6 per cent. of our population. We have put the best equipped soldiers in the field, transported them 12,000 miles, and paid them better than any other soldiers, although still not as much as they deserve. We have undertaken an enormous financial burden. </para>

                            <para>- It would have more. I do not want to draw invidious comparisons, but it has been said, in the debate, that Russia has a less percentage of its population in the field than Australia has, and it is Russia&#39;s fight quite as much as it is ours. It was Russia that Germany was at the outset more incensed against than Great Britain. I saw in one periodical that the Germans said, &#34; We have nothing to fear from Great Britain, but we have from Russia.&#34; </para>

                            <para>- Both political leaders in Canada have made strong pronouncements against fastening that insidious thing upon the people. Australia is a young country, with practically no developed resources. We require every man we have, and could do with two or three times as many. It is quite different from an old-established country. </para>

                            <para>- If the honorable senator chooses to use that statement as an argument against voluntarism, he can do so. I do not. I am trying to show that we have a country different in many respects from an old-established country. Great Britain has to get rid of about 1,000,000 men every year. Carlyle once said that there must be something wrong in a community where a full-grown horse was of more value than a full-grown man. He also said that there were times when it would pay the Government to give a number of men &#163;1 apiece to go and drown themselves. Old-established countries have a big surplus population; we have not. We have no large luxury industries and no great leisured class. A young country like this cannot by any stretch of imagination, or on any consideration, be expected to put the same number in the field as an old country with a big surplus population and numbers of luxury industries. If we start to deplete our manhood, as we promised to do, what will become of our industries? </para>

                            <para>- The war can be brought to an end without an additional 100,000 men from Australia. They would make no appreciable difference among 15,000,000. They would be like a drop in the bucket. If we deplete our manhood completely our industries will totally cease. If we send every man out of the country, and, according to some of the figures adduced, there will not be many eligible men under forty-five left by next June, either married or single, what will happen to our industries? We cannot exempt all the men employed in them. The Mount Lyell Company, in Tasmania, employs thousands of men, and it would be utterly impossible for women to do any portion of that work. We must exempt those men, or run short of copper. And what about zinc, tin, and various other metals required ? We must not completely deplete our manhood, and bring our industries to a standstill. If we cripple our industries, Low are we going to provide the funds necessary for the war. </para>

                            <para>- I do not know that all would be sent. Returning to the subject which I was discussing when the honorable senator interjected, let me say that I think some difficulty will be experienced in providing the funds necessary for the war if out industries be crippled. We are raising these funds to-day by means of war loans. </para>

                            <para>- It has. I supported the War Loan Bill, and ever since have had some serious qualms of conscience. I am doubtful whether I did right. By means of local war loans we are raising the necessary funds, and the money so raised is kept in the country. It is circulated, and is returned to the banks again, and those who are receiving it through the channels of trade are enabled to put more into the war loan again and again. The same money is moving round in a circle. </para>

                            <para>- I know many people who make it a rule to invest a certain amount in the war loan every time that subscriptions are invited. I do not wish to boast, but I make an effort each time to put what I can into the war loan. If we stop industry, and, consequently, the production of wealth, we shall then have to send out of the country for what we require for our men at- the front, as well as for munitions and other requisites. In that event the money will be sent out of the country, and will not be available to be put into the war loan a second time. Thus our funds will be depleted. If we deplete the production of wealth, then we shall render it impossible to raise the funds we require here for the upkeep of our men. </para>

                            <para>- Quite so. If Australia be depleted of its men, then it will be depleted of its source of wealth production. It would be suicidal to send our cash out of the country. I think it was <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lloyd</inline> George who said some time ago that the biggest factor in continuing this war was money, and that the nation which had the last million was the nation that would win. We are told that Australia has failed. That I regard as a stigma on the fair name of the Commonwealth. No country has done more than Australia to assist in winning the war for the Empire. I do not think any other country has done so much. But even if every man of military age in Australia - married or single - were transported to the front, I do not think it would make any appreciable difference in this war. </para>

                            <para>- The honorable senator is at liberty to express the opposite view. The number of men so far recruited during September is at the rate of 8,300 a month. It seems to me that if we continue to enlist volunteers at the same rate up to the end of next July, we shall have provided practically as many men as <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> says are required. It has been well said by a number of honorable senators that if we had had more men going about sincere and earnest in the desire to recruit volunteers, instead of trying to kill voluntarism and to &#34;boost&#34; up conscription, the number &#34;of volunteers enrolled would probably have been doubled. About two months ago I saw in the newspapers a cable message in which it was definitely stated that all the Army experts agreed that the issue of the war was beyond doubt. Almost every day of the week one sees in the newspapers something confirmatory of that statement. In to-day&#39;s paper, for instance, we have the statement of Lord Derby that he is confident that we shall win. He was sure before, but he is now more certain than ever of the issue. If nine months ago we had had some fears there might have been more reason for them; but, with the exception of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bakhap,</inline> no one in the Senate spoke of conscription. At that time the chances did not seem in our favour. The Russians were being rolled back a score of miles at a time; the French were being driven back on the western frontier, while the Serbians had been driven out of their country. On every hand there were signs of disaster. Notwithstanding  this, I heard no one, save <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bakhap,</inline> say in this Chamber that conscription was necessary. </para>

                            <para>- The chances to-day are forty-nine to one in our favour, and all who are able to speak with authority from the front say the issue is beyond doubt. Everywhere we hear that Germany is beaten. I oppose conscription for a number of reasons. In the first place, I am very doubtful as to the right of any man to send another, perhaps, to his death while he stops at home. I do not know that it is altogether creditable to a number of people, who know that they are quite safe, to vote for the other fellow to go to the front while they remain in comfort at home. I believe, too, that we shall do as well under voluntarism as we should under conscription. I also think that if this effort to secure conscription be successful, it will bring about fierce and bitter strife throughout Australia. </para>

                    <para class="block">God forbid that it should lead to bloodshed. But I do not know that it may not. I think it is hardly worth while setting the people of Australia at each other&#39;3 throats and creating strife and turmoil, fierce and bitter, throughout the country, for the sake of getting 100,000 men by conscription by the end of next July. Instead of uniting the country at a time like the present, conscription, I believe, is going to hopelessly divide us. Then, again, the man who is forced against his will into any activity is not nearly so useful as the man who voluntarily enters upon it. That is my experience in the workshop. I found that where a boy came into a trade against his own will he <inline font-style="italic">whs</inline> absolutely of no use. I also know of young men who have been called upon against their will to follow a profession because of the desire of their fathers that they should become doctors or lawyers, and they have failed absolutely. The volunteer must be far more useful than the man who is forced into any activity. I may not find an honorable senator to agree with me in my further objection to conscription, which is that I look upon it as a violation of the Divine law. For that reason, and the others I have mentioned, I am opposed to conscription. </para>

                            <para>- As to the referendum I do not agree with those who voted against the measure on the first reading, but I have a good deal of sympathy with them, because it will be admitted that every question cannot be settled by means of compulsion. Minorities have their rights; and it would be impossible to force on the people any measure a majority might favour. For instance, some might -think that vegetarianism would be to the benefit of the country, and, from a certain point of view, that &#39;could be regarded as a national question, but I fancy it would be very difficult and inexpedient to have a question of the kind settled by referendum. &#39; Then, there are some people, possibly misguided people, who would like a referendum on the question of what religion should be followed. </para>

                            <para>- But life is not involved in changes of that kind. However, I wish to say that, in my opinion, a statement of the financial proposals of the Government ought to be considered in connexion with this Bill; and my strong belief is that the question put to the people should, in effect, be, &#34; Are you in favour of the conscription of life and wealth &#34; ? The Prime Minister, in his first statement in another place, said that, so far as it was &#34;humanly possible,&#34; there would be equality of sacrifice; but I cannot see how that promise is to be carried out. How can there be equality of sacrifice if men&#39;s lives are taken, on the one hand, and an income tax or war tax levied on the other? There is another question on which I should like some information. When .the Minister for Defence was speaking on the second reading, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ready</inline> interjected in reference to some figures in regard to which there is a great discrepancy, which has never yet been cleared up. A while ago it was stated that there are 43,000 odd recruits in Australia, and that the limit of our transport is 13,000 a month. As a matter of fact, we have lately not been able to send away 13,000 a month. </para>

                            <para>- And that apparently is owing to lack of transports. The facilities may be increased, or they may be decreased, but even if we were able to send 13,000 each month, the proposal of the Government is to call up 16,500 men per month. We have now 43,000 odd recruits in Australia, and this month there are to be called up 32,000, making a total of 75,000. Of these, we shall in the first month send away 13,000. Now, the next month there &#34;will be called up another 16,500, and 13,000 sent away, leaving 65,000 at the end of October. In November, again, 16,500 are to&#39; be called up, and another 13,000 sent away, leaving 69,000. So we shall go on until at the end of March we shall have 83,000 recruits left in Australia. </para>

                            <para>- Not by a long way, as is shown by the fact that there were 43,000 odd in. Australia a while ago. We are told that there are 152,000 single men between the ages of eighteen and forty-five in Australia, and somebody has estimated that of these about 40,000 represent those between eighteen and twenty-one. I have made a calculation myself in this regard, and I put down the number of these younger men at 35,000; so that, if we subtract my figures from the 152,000. we have 117,000 left. Further, according to the average, at least one-third of the volunteer recruits are discarded. </para>

                            <para>- Then we have evidently come to about the same conclusion; and I calculate that the whole of the available single men will be gone by the end of November. As to the married men, my figures may not be absolutely correct, but they are &#34;as I found them in two or three different newspapers. There are said to be 294,000 married men between the ages of eighteen and forty-five; and, if we make the same deductions as in the case of the single men, we have 98,000 men available. It will be seen, therefore, that the whole of the available married and single men will be gone before next June or July. As to equality of sacrifice, I interjected the other day, when an honorable senator was speaking, that that was absolutely impossible. What sacrifice can the man who stops at home make to equal that of the man who loses his life at the front? If a mau gave every farthing he possessed it would not equal the life sacrifice, because he would still have opportunities to provide for his needs and to enjoy himself. If a man possessed of &#163;100,000 were to give &#163;90,000 he would still have &#163;10,000 on which to live; and I make bold to say that no honorable senator would even suggest that 90 per cent, of any man&#39;s wealth should be taken. Even if that were done, it would  not  make equality of sacrifice. </para>

A serious position will arise owing to the fact that it will be impossible to call all the available men up at once, and some discrimination must be used. If two men are living next door to one another, and one of them is taken and the other left, there will be created in the mind of the former, justly or unjustly, an idea that there has been some partiality. </para>

                            <para>- At any rate, favoritism will be suspected here, as in every other country in the world where conscription has been the law. I have read strong statements about conscription in Continental countries. I have read in historical works that the French lost the war with Prussia in 1870 because the army of France was honeycombed with corruption due to conscription. French officers pocketed money obtained for indemnities, exemptions, and substitutes. That kind of thing must lead to suspicious feelings in those who are called up. Strong suspicion of unfair discrimination must arise under a system of conscription, and I do not know how it is to be prevented. I notice that under the New Zealand Act introduced to establish conscription, and which by the way has not yet, I think, been put into operation, the method proposed to decide who shall go and who shall stay is the drawing of lots. Even that will not satisfy men who are called up. They will believe that the lottery is rigged. Where a man enlists of his own accord, none of that trouble can arise. I know of the case of a young man who, after striving for years, living most frugally, and denying himself everything in the nature of a luxury, and sometimes even necessaries, has just about managed to build up a little business. If he is conscripted, what is to become of his business? I know another young man who went out on his own into the country upon a farm which cost &#163;1,000, and spent another &#163;1,000 in stocking it. He has lived like a hermit in order that he might get fairly started before undertaking the responsibilities of life, and if he is conscripted all his hopes in life will be blasted, and  what will become of his farm and stock? Such men will naturally feel that they have been hardly treated when others are permitted to stay at home. There was a case in Great Britain of two brothers carrying on a tailoring business. One died, and the other continued to carry on the business for the benefit of the two families. The second brother died, and there was a son left who was striving as best he could to carry on the  business  to maintain his mother and his aunt. That young man was dragged away to the war, and the business was allowed to go. Those people must feel that they have been dealt with very harshly. Scores of such cases might be cited, and it is inevitable that they should create great dissatisfaction and the suspicion of unfair discrimination. Let us now see what happens to men of wealth. I take three cases for illustration. A is a young man who by his skill and intelligence is capable of earning ?1,000 a year. He enlists. He may lose an arm or a leg, or he may be killed; but, unless he returns unscathed, his capacity to earn ?1,000 a year has gone. B is a wealthy man who invests a sum in the war loan sufficient to return him an income of ?1,000 a year, which is exempt from income tax. He continues- his investment, and it continues to return ?1,000 a year to himself and to his children after him. C possesses wealth in the form of houses and land which return him a yearly income of ?1,000. He is not satisfied with that income, and increases his rents, and thus secures a greater income. Can there be any equality of sacrifice in these circumstances ? The man with the wealth in houses and land is made secure, and his position is improved by the action of the man who has invested his money in the war loan, and of the other who has gone to fight for him while he remains at home. I wish to refer now to a matter which, so far, has not been touched upon during the debate. I asked a question the other day about the basis on which it is proposed to make the levy. I wished to know whether it was to be the total population of each State or military district, or the manhood of military age in each district, or State. The Minister was good enough to tell me that the matter was under consideration. I took the last <inline font-style="italic">Year-Book</inline> giving actual figures - those of the 1911 census - and made a comparison between the two smallest military districts - the States of Western Australia and Tasmania. This is how the comparison worked out. The total population of Western Australia then was 282,114, and the total population of Tasmania 191,211, the relative proportions being, within an infinitesimal fraction, 60 and 40. The total males in Western Australia numbered 165,201, and in Tasmania 100,026, the relative proportions being 62 and 38. Coming to males between the ages of twenty-one and forty-five, the section to whom we must particularly direct our attention, the number in Western Australia was 72,569, and in Tasmania 32,779, the relative proportions being 69 and 31. Putting these figures in another way, I find that if Tasmania had the same proportion of males of military age of her total population as Western Australia had at that time, instead of their number being 32,779, it would have been 42,13S, or an increase of 9,350. It must be obvious, in view of these figures, that if we are going to make a demand upon any State for men it should not be on the basis of total population, but on the basis of males of military age. It has been said that more is intended by the Government proposal than the conscription of men for military service during the term of the war. It is suggested that there is reason to fear that we shall have something in the nature of industrial conscription. Some honorable senators have made quotations from various sources which seem to justify that fear. I have picked out one or two promiscuously. I find that Benjamin Kidd, the famous author, says - </para>

There are many of the advocates of conscription who press it for purely military reasons, but there are others - some of the chief of them have frankly admitted as much to me - who desire it as the only weapon against the growing power of the trade unions. And it is in that direction that conscription must inevitably tend. </para>

                        <para>The introduction of female labour might be used so as to lead to a lowering of the rates of payments for services. The fact of the matter is not that women are paid too little, but that men are paid too much for work which can bo done without previous training, lt is only the trade unions which, after the war, will stand in the way of our realizing the anticipation that we might be able to reduce our workshop costs by the employment of women. Much  depends  on the attitude of the women themselves. If they can be brought to see the economic advantages to the country, to recognise the facts that we have put forward, and agree to accept a lower scale of wages than skilled men, they may, by their preponderance of numbers, be in a position to defy the unions. </para>

Now, the Government appeals very strongly to the people&#39;s patriotism that we may be saved from Prussian oppression. But what sort of patriotism does the Government itself show in this heartless exploitation of helpless women who have no trade union to protect them, and lack even votes, to make oppression better? The <inline font-style="italic">Clarion</inline> has braved loss of friends and bitter calumny in its efforts to rally and unite the disaffected elements of the nation in resistance to the great national peril; but these instances of Government callousness or imbecility constantly mock our efforts and turn them to weapons of  offence  against us. The scandalous licence still accorded to the shipping buccaneers, to the ravenous  devourers  of the people&#39;s food, and all the scurvy gang of bloodsuckers who are battening their vile carcasses on the nation&#39;s need, is bad enough to bear. But when the State itself takes a hand in robbing the poor, we have no answer left to fling at the factious, peevish, and perverse renegades spitefully buzzing above our heads, but to bid them join forces with the Government, go over to the enemy together as common traitors to their kith and kin, and be damned. </para>

                            <para>- The point is that this man and his three sons are violently opposed to conscription. Another friend of mine in my native State came to me a little time ago and told me practically the same thing, though he has sons at the front too. It was a kind of threat that he would never vote for a Labour candidate again if the Labour party brought in conscription. One cannot help being struck by the fact that those opposed to the Labour party in politics - I dp not mean in this Chamber only.,  but  throughout Australia - are now posing as Democrats, and are supporting this referendum. But why did they not support a referendum to give these very men a voice in the making of the laws under which their lives and liberties are at stake ? We have it in the Commonwealth Electoral Act, but this privilege is not enjoyed in any of the States. The people to whom I refer support this referendum, because it pleases them, but they will not support another referendum if it makes any demand upon the privileges of those they represent in this Chamber. </para>

                            <para>- I know all about the honorable senator. The people of his State had to vote for him under compulsion, otherwise he would not have been seen in this chamber. I hope  that  between now and the 28th of next month there will be no repression of free speech, but that both sides will be able to put their case freely and fairly. I do not blame anybody who holds an opposite opinion to mine, and, so far as I am concerned, I will do nothing to obstruct him in expressing his views. Surely it is only reasonable to ask that those who take opposite views shall be treated with equal consideration ! It will be judged from what I have said that I am going to vote for the Bill. I considered the matter carefully. At first I was inclined to think this was not a question to submit to the people, but it involves life, it is a big national issue, and I do not know who is better qualified to decide it than the people. It seems to me that, as I am exempt and must be left at home, it would be cruel for me to vote to send another man, perhaps, to his death. The people should be told definitely that the real question to be submitted for their opinion is whether the Government shall have the right to call up every male in Australia from eighteen to sixty years of age. This has been mentioned before, but it is just as well that it should be plainly stated, because 9&#39;9 persons out of every 100 will not know this unless  they  are told. </para>

                        <para>. - When the Government announced their intention of submitting this question to a referendum, the Leader of the Opposition expressed some disappointment, which was re-echoed the following morning in the daily press of the Commonwealth from one end of its boundaries to the other. At the time I did not believe this disappointment was genuine, and we had only to wait a day or two to find that the whole of the press of Australia had swung round in support of the Government. That fact of itself ought to be more than sufficient to compel all Labourites to consider seriously where they stand. I am not referring, of course, to the Labour press, because that section of the press has consistently opposed conscription at every point, and at all stages. </para>

                    <para>It has been the invariable experience of Labour, ever since it came into political existence in the Commonwealth, to find the powerful daily press consistently opposed to every object it had in view, and if one looks backward&#39;s for twenty-five years it is impossible to find amongst the planks on the Labour platform a single one that was supported by the daily press. I do not expect that the anti-conscriptionist will have a fair field in the coming fight. We have only to look at the reports already published in the press to know that they will continue their past mode of campaign until October next. </para>

                            <para>- I understand that the ordinary citizen could not get admission to the Town Hall, and that there were foot and mounted police about the building to see that law and order were faithfully maintained. To-day is published the speech by the Prime Minister, and that, no doubt, has been circulated throughout the Commonwealth. I expect nothing else from the daily press. There is no doubt that the views of the anti-conscriptionists have been most unfairly suppressed by both the daily press and the censors, acting on instructions from the Commonwealth Government. I am glad to note, however, that the censorship, apparently, has been relaxed to a considerable extent, and, possibly, when it is realized that Labour will win this fight, at least a few of the powerful morning papers will cross over to the right side before the day of reckoning comes. That already appears to be the case with one paper which has a great number of readers. I should like to refer to what I consider a most unfair action on the part of the <inline font-style="italic">Sydney Morning Herald.</inline> I may be excused for quoting a New South Wales paper occasionally, for it is positively nauseating to hear the <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> and <inline font-style="italic">Argus</inline> quoted in this chamber on every occasion. This is a short extract from a letter I received in regard to the censorship to which the anti-conscriptionists have been subjected - </para>

To show the awful misrepresentation which is going on with regard to this question, I would direct you to the <inline font-style="italic">Sydney Morning Herald</inline> of the 20th September.

                    <para class="block">Those men want conscription, of course, but they are not prepared to give the young men of the country any rights whatever in local government. The views of men of that character, who will pass a resolution in favour of conscription, ought to carry no weight; but we can read in the <inline font-style="italic">Sydney Morning Herald</inline> day after day resolutions of this kind by men who, by their subsequent actions, show themselves to be diametrically opposed to the best interests of Labour. There is another source of opposition which ought not to be overlooked. The whole of the Liberal politicians, with few exceptions, are not only supporting the proposal of the Commonwealth Government to refer this issue by referendum to the people; but also urging the people to register an affirmative vote. Along with them is a number of men who have taken a prominent part in the Labour movement for many years, and, although I do not deny to them the right to express their own opinions, I think they are greatly mistaken in the company in which they are found to-day. </para>

It is a striking fact that the Liberals, apparently buoyed up by reports in the press, are confident of victory at the polls, whilst Labourites, on the _ other hand, are even more confident of victory. In Queensland, so far as the Labour organizations have given expression to their views, the whole of the workers are determined to leave nothing undone to secure the defeat of the referendum. </para>

                            <para>- They do, both in this Parliament and in the State Parliament. So far as New South Wales is concerned, it is undeniable, whether one looks to the local executive of the Labour movement, to the industrial movement, or to the meetings of the various trade societies, that there is a unanimous expression of opinion hostile to the proposal to conscript men for service abroad. When this Bill is stripped of the verbiage surrounding its clauses, what does it mean ? That a Labour Government, supported by the Liberals, are to set out next month for the purpose of capturing 32,500 of the young men of Australia, and possibly putting them into a compound for training; and, further, that, on the 28th October, persons who have no intention of going to the war are to be allowed to vote to decide whether the young men shall be sent to the war. That is a proposal I will not support. I am told that the Government have received some information about Canada and New Zealand, but, for reasons best known to themselves, they have not disclosed that information to Parliament.&#39; Possibly at a later date, when the Senate is not sitting, the information will be published in the press, showing that the British Government has made on Canada and New Zealand practically the same demand as has been made on the Commonwealth. I do not say whether the Government are justified or not in withholding that information, but we ought to have it as soon as possible, and all available facts ought to be placed before the people. That has not been done, and it is almost impossible to ascertain what the position is, but the great fact stands out that there are about 150,000 able-bodied, eligible men in the Commonwealth, and, if the proposal of the Government is given effect to, the whole of those men will be called up for military service within a few months. </para>

                            <para>- The number of young men who are fit is so limited that it must be exhausted within a few months, and the married men will quickly follow. It is true that the Parliament of the Commonwealth raised no objection when <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Fisher</inline> said that Australia waa prepared to sacrifice the last man and the last shilling. Nor was objection taken to the despatch of any of the contingents, until <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> offered an additional 50,000, to which some objection was taken. But had the electors known that the offers that were being made would involve the obligation of sending 16,500 men a month, the strongest objections would have been taken to them. The present position has been brought about gradually by a concerted conspiracy of the Liberals. The voluntary system has not had a fair chance. Yet already in this month, in which no special effort has been made, 5,000 men have voluntarily enlisted, and I am confident that with very little effort we could get at least 16,000. I do not believe that that number is needed to maintain our troops at the front at their present strength,  but- if the voluntary system had a fair chance, there would be no need for compulsory service, which is probably the most hateful thing that could be proposed, and to me very distasteful. There is another matter to which I invite attention, and that is the number of persons exempted from military service under section 61 of the Defence Act. The members and officers of the Commonwealth and State Parliaments are exempt. Why should they not be called upon to fight if needed ? Why should the Judges of one Federal and State Courts be exempt? Then the police, a fine body of men, and the magistrates, are exempt. Ministers of religion, of whatever age, cannot be compelled to serve. Nor can those employed in the police and prison services. There may be some excuse for exempting lighthouse-keepers. Medical practitioners and nurses in public hospitals, persons who satisfy the &#34; prescribed authority &#34; - a most convenient term - that their conscientious beliefs do not allow them to bear arms, and, finally, all engaged in employments specified by the regulations, or by proclamation, are exempt. Do you wonder that the working people are opposed to conscription? It must be remembered that under regulations issued when Parliament is not in session, the Government can exempt railway employees, munition workers, and many others. So that finally it will be the unskilled labourer who will be called up to go into the fighting line. I am not surprised that the organized workers of the country express hostility to conscription,  and will continue to do so until the referendum proposal meets its fate on the 28th October next. I support the Bill because I think that this Parliament should not take upon itself to come to  a  final determination upon a question on which the public has never been consulted. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Fisher, Mr. Hughes,</inline> and other leaders have proclaimed from time to time that under no circumstances would they send men abroad to fight against their will. No doubt the Prime Minister regards the existing circumstances as pressing and vital. I appreciate the continuous and valuable services that he has rendered to the Labour movement. </para>

                            <para>- The referendum being a plank of the Labour party, an important question like conscription should be referred to the people. The objection has been raised that men beyond the fighting age, women, and others who will not be called upon to fight, are to vote at the proposed referendum. But, notwithstanding this, I am prepared to refer this matter to the electors as a whole. I am glad that the Government have discovered that it will be easy to provide for the voting of our soldiers. Some think that they will give a block vote for &#34; Yes,&#34; and others hold a contrary opinion ; but in either case, they should have their &#34; say.&#34; It has been suggested that, while the workers are opposed to compulsory service, they themselves have not gone to the front, yet nothing could be more untrue.  The bulk of those under arms are unionists. We have it on good authority that 30,000 members of the Australian Workers Union, 1,500 members of the Sydney Wharf Labourers </para>

                            <para>- What a silly thing it would have been to pay a man 4$ per cent, on a loan to the Government, and then to impose a tax on the interest! If the rate of interest is too high, why not pay less ? But I regard as foolish the proposal to pay a man to collect \ per cent, from the bondholders by way of income tax. The circumlocution is unbusiness-like. The suggestion made in this chamber some time ago that no interest should be paid on our war loans did not meet with my approval. Even in war time I do not think that we can get men to give their money voluntarily free of interest. We have sufficient from the last war loan to meet our requirements for three or four months; but we must look ahead to see how the balance of the expenditure on the war can be met. Unfortunately, the Government cannot propose land values taxation without exemption without violating the platform of the Labour party, which contains the provision that a man who owns &#163;5,000 worth of land shall not contribute to the Commonwealth land tax. Some people would strike a level in every person&#39;s salary and sweep the balance of his earnings into the war pool; but it would be most unfair to fix that level at &#163;300 per annum, and take &#163;700 from the man who earned &#163;1,000 per annum, and allow the man owning &#163;5,000 worth of land to escape without any payment. That method of taxation does not appeal to me. I hope that the Government will bring down a proposal to deal with the matter in an up-to-date way. I have a suggestion which would get over the difficulty of violating the platform of the Labour party. It  may be heresy on my part, and a departure from my previously expressed views in regard to land values taxation; but these are war times, and we require an immense amount of money. We need approximately &#163;2,000,000 a week under present circumstances, and if the opponents of Labour succeed in conscripting another 200,000 men before July next, we shall need about &#163;3,000,000 a week. How are we to get the money ? I do not think that this Chamber will consider any proposal to borrow more money at 4&#163; per cent. The only people from whom we can get money are those who have it. Many persons favour the imposition of the wealth tax. I believe as a means of taxation that it is economically quite unsound; but, as I have said before, these are war times. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Knibbs</inline> has assured us that the privately-owned wealth of the Commonwealth is about &#163;1,000,000,000. An annual lew of 10 per cent, on that wealth would produce a revenue of &#163;100,000,000, which would pay the expenses of the war week by week without placing any responsibility on posterity. Some talk of equality of sacrifice, but the risk of losing one&#39;s life is not equalled by the sacrifice of some of the wealth one possesses, and Parliament should have the courage to impose a straight out levy of 10 per cent, on the wealth of the community, enabling the Government to pay handsomely those who go to the front, and those who suffer through the absence of their breadwinners. </para>

                            <para>- To ships, buildings,  script  land values, cash, and all similar commodities. If we call it a wealth tax, and allow no exemptions, land values will be called upon to pay 2s. in the &#163;1. I admit that it would be an extraordinary tax, but at a time when we ask the most robust men in the country to sacrifice their lives, the owners of wealth would willingly pay up. I do not know what the proposals of the Government are with regard to the taxation which they consider necessary to meet the requirements of the Commonwealth, but I put forward that suggestion. It is not quite in my line, because I do not like to stray from the straight path of land values taxation. If the Government increase the income tax or bring forward a wealth tax we shall probably support them, but as no person should be exempt from taxation in war time, I hope that they will have the courage to tax all land values without exemption. If they do so they will do more to keep open the avenues of employment than any other scheme they can propose. I realize that no matter what taxation is imposed it will have to be paid by the workers. Only those who can produce can pay. Therefore, I fail to understand the strong opposition that is always offered to the most equitable scheme of land values taxation on which I have spoken so often. I conclude by saying that I regard the question that has been engaging our attention this evening as the most important that has ever been before the Commonwealth Parliament. We want more men and more money. I do not want to get the men by conscription, and I shall fight against it for all I am worth, because I believe that we can get them by voluntary effort. The proper amount of attention has not been given to the matter of recruiting by voluntary effort. It is absolutely wrong to .call any man a shirker. The war has been in progress for over two years, and the work of recruiting had scarcely begun before some people were abusing those who stood back, and calling them shirkers. These men who stood back are now in the firing line, and those who are now standing back will be in the firing line to-morrow. That there are very few shirkers in Australia is proved by the enormous number who have gone freely. I am satisfied that we can get all the men we require by the voluntary system, and all the men we should send to the front. </para>

                        <para>. - We cannot emphasize too much the fact that this is a grave issue, because the more we realize its gravity, the more need we shall see for clearing away the mists of prejudice and applying to its solution all our mental powers and faculties. It is the gravest  question  that has been dealt with in this country since the time the native race was in undisturbed possession of this spot; and in this country&#39;s future history it is doubtful whether any turning point will equal in importance that which we have now arrived at. Certainly none will ever surpass it. The question being so momentous, I would impress upon every honorable senator the indispensable necessity of casting from his mind every possible trace of prejudice or prepossession, because if he proceeds to discuss the question with an unprepared mind, he is simply trifling with himself and with the future destiny of his country. It is necessary that we should have the utmost freedom of thought and speech in dealing with the question. I believe we shall have it. If we do not get it in this freedom loving Commonwealth, there is no chance of having it in any part of the world. But a strong element of those who clamour so loudly for freedom of speech and thought, that priceless possession which every individual enjoys in an advanced community like ours, is made up, of the very ones who are not conceding it to others. Those who demand freedom of speech should at least set the example by conceding to the members of this Parliament in settling this question the same precious possession that they are claiming for themselves. </para>

                    <para>I need not tell you, sir, as an old campaigner, what it means to have the right to express your thoughts. You have come through a long, sinuous, and difficult way. You can recall the time when you sacrificed much to obtain for yourself freedom of speech, thought, and action. Many a time men belonging to this party sacrificed a great deal for the sake of being able to speak their thoughts ; and when a tyrannical employer sent some of us on the track towards the western sun, with our bluey on our back, we went because we wanted what all free men want - the precious right to say what we thought. As the result of the efforts made by you and other veterans in the party, we reached a time when freedom of speech was possible; but now, strange to say, a section of the very party, one of whose main credentials to popular favour is the fact that it made real in this country freedom of speech and freedom of thought, is seeking to stifle it. It is indeed strange that a party such as ours, which has risen for the purpose of giving every individual liberty of thought, speech, and action, now that it has come to the zenith of its glory and power, should produce men who are ambitious to usurp the place of the tyrannical employer who sacked you and me and hundreds of other veterans. Is it thinkable? </para>
                    <para class="block">Is it possible? It has come to this. It is believable. </para>
                    <para>In the first year of his popularity the pathway of the patriot is &#34; roses, roses all the way,&#34; as Browning has it; but as the years go on, it becomes more and more difficult, until he meets at length the thorns, the shambles, and the gallows. So it is with those of us who have helped to build up this movement, whose ambition was to gain freedom of thought and speech, and who now find an attempt made to &#34;gag&#34; us, to seal our lips, to stifle our reason, to choke the well springs of thought, and deny us the right in this Parliament to say what we think should be done in order to steer this young nation of ours through the troubled waters she is in to-day. I cannot believe even now that the attempt will succeed. I believe there is still a balance of common sense in the world, that there still exists sufficient sense of fair play and fair dealing to insure that no such attempt to snatch from the individual that precious weapon which the Labour party has been instrumental in obtaining will be tolerated. I hope these words of mine, feeble though they may be, will reach corners that badly need reaching, and that those who have done this thing will see that their position can only be judged rightly by comparison. You can judge the action of any man only by juxtaposition, as the diamond shows its lustre best when the counterfeit is placed alongside it. These patriots think they have expressed the last word. They can be made to feel the  untenableness  of their position only &#39;by reminding them that their true friends are candid men, if I may include myself. That reminder should bring them to a sense of reason. It is a hard, cruel path that they must tread. But when some persons take up a false position they can be made to see their error only by sundering friendships, even if they have lasted for a life-time. Better let friendship perish forever than that truth and wisdom should be submerged. The suppression of what is right is no less heinous when done by a majority than when done by the most besotted tyrant. These men who have so sadly strayed from the correct course of action must be brought back to it, or my friendship with them will be sundered Those of us who have struggled and slaved throughout the country, when we could have enjoyed ourselves if we had taken a more selfish view of life, are not the men to be told, at the instance of a section of our party, that we must get down to the level of poor dog Tray on an issue that has never been definitely before the electors. I am not going to become poor dog Tray yet. I have done some stone-breaking in my time in the Northern State, and would go back and break stones there to the end of my life before I would stoop to obey the orders of this irresponsible body on this greatest of issues. In this debate I shall, I am afraid, have to take up my wonted <inline font-style="italic">role</inline> of turning the other cheek to the  smiter,  although it is possible that on occasions, if I am tried too hard, I shall smite back. </para>
                    <para>I support the measure for the referendum and shall support the carrying of the question in the affirmative, as a true, staunch, and convinced Labourite of 26 years standing, believing that by its passage by an overwhelming majority the best and most permanent interests of the party will- be served. I support it also, because I am an Irish rr an. It is necessary to speak on this point, because I have been criticised by some in a contentious spirit, occasionally bordering on the bitter. They ask why I support this measure of conscription, seeing that, as an Irishman, I should be opposed to it. Some people think the mere mention of conscription to an Irishman should be like a red rag to a bull. I am supporting it because I am an Irishman, in addition to supporting it because I am a firm believer in that political party which has come into existence to work out the social regeneration of the toilers of this country. </para>
                    <para>A few facts bearing upon my reason for supporting it as an Irishman may be of interest. I support it because the policy now in operation in Australia has been in operation in the Old Country down the weary years. Because of its iniquitous operation in the island of my nativity, I am against it, so long as I have breath left in me. I do not care what my grandfather, or my father, thought about it, much as I cherish their memory. I am not here to glorify the system of voluntarism as it is sought to be perpetuated in this country. . I do -not regard it as a law written in the sky, which I must bow down to and adore. It is no true deity to me. To me it is a false god, and never shall I stoop down and burn incense before this false god. &#34; Tablet of the old law,&#34; they call it. It is no tablet of the old law to me. If it is, I am here to smash it into atoms with all the force I can command. I shall do so because, wherever it has been tried, with but one or two exceptions, it has proved iniquitous, barbarous, and unsuccessful. </para>
                    <para>I have said that I support conscription because I am an Irishman. I support it from that point of view because the operation of voluntarism, where I was&#171; born, bred, and reared, was the means of &#34;drawing off the best blood of that country - just as it is doing here to-day - -t; be spilt on foreign battle-fields. While Irish blood has thus been drawn off and spilt by the gallon on foreign battle-fields, the blood of other component parts of the Empire, especially the predominant partner, has been spilt only by the thimbleful. It is because I believe that it is not right to spill the blood of one section of the Empire by the gallon, and to allow the blood of other sections of it to be spilt sparingly, that I, as&#34; an Irishman, support conscription. I support it because I believe that any one who has a regard for the future prosperity of this glorious country in which we live - the best, the brightest, and the freest on God&#39;s earth - must do so if he truly desires to serve it. I object to voluntarism in Australia on the same ground that I object to its application to Ireland. Believing, as I do, that the best blood of Ireland has been drawn off by voluntarism, and made to fertilize the fields of Europe, imparting to the green corn of spring a still greener hue by reason of the sacred element it fed upon, shall I stand idly by and see the  best blood of this country taken out of it in the same way? Never ! Never ! To do so would be contrary to all reason. It would be to follow the reasoning of a school girl of the meanest intelligence to assert that the best blood of Australia remains in the country to-day. No one can say that the blood of those who were the first to take their place in the fighting line is not the best that Australia has produced. It is because of the iniquitous draft that it has made on the blood of my native land that I, as an Irishman, object to voluntarism, and it is because I am here as an adopted Australian, prepared to let my bones rest in this, the brightest, the freest, and the best country in the world, that I object to such a system having any further ravaging effect upon the manhood of the Commonwealth. </para>
                    <para>Let me come now to a few figures showing what Ireland has done in the way of supplying the fighting forces of the Empire. They may open the eyes of a lot of people, for the first time, on the subject. I have gone back to the figures relating to the British Army ii&#39; the last century, in order to find out in what proportion the component parts of the United Kingdom - England, Ireland, Scotland, and Wales - have contributed to the Army. The figures oscillate, so to speak, but it will be found upon examination that they substantially bear out my contention. Unfortunately, the authorities that I have been able to consult are not complete in the information they supply. I begin with the figures of 1804, when the Peninsular war was going on. We find that in that year the population of England and Wales, according to  Clode&#39;s <inline font-style="italic">Military Forces of the Crown,</inline> page 384, was in round numbers 8.892,536; that of Scotland, 1,608,420; and that of Ireland, 5,395,456, and that the recruits obtained under the operation of the Army Reserves Act were 5,7S2 in England and Wales, 1,183 in Scotland, and 4,078 in Ireland. On a population &#34;basis the number of recruits from Ireland was 16 per cent, more than in the case of England and Wales, and 3 per cent, more than in the case of Scotland. I have not been able to ascertain the composition of the British Army at that time. I endeavoured to do so, because it was my desire to have absolute facts to go upon, and to be standing on solid granite in submitting this contention. The next period to which I come is 1830, and in respect of that year I have the figures for the total Army. The population of England and Wales at that time was 13,896,797, Scotland 2,364,386, and Ireland 7,767,401. The contribution of England and &#34;Wales to the infantry section - the main portion - of the British Army -was 40,649, Scotland 11,744, and Ireland 40,979. In other words, Ireland, with a population of 6,000,000 less than that of England and Wales, supplied 300 more soldiers to the infantry section of the British Army. And yet there are honorable senators of my party who tell me that because I am an Irishman I should be opposed to conscription. Taking the figures for the whole of the Forces, we find that in 1830, under voluntarism, Ireland contributed 71 per cent, more than did England and Wales to the infantry of the British Army. I have not had time to work out the percentage in the case of Scotland, but it was very slight. My last reference is to the figures for 1904. In that year the fighting men contributed by England and Wales to the British Army was .6 per cent, of the population. The. percentage in the case of Scotland was .47 per cent., and in the case of Ireland .7 per cent. There is again an increase in the percentage quota, Ireland supplying 16 per aGent. more than England and Wales, and 49 per cent, more than Scotland. So that at those three separate periods of the last century Ireland was far in the van in supplying the fighting men of the Empire. Ireland has always been to the front in fighting for the Empire, but not in the front, unfortunately, so far, in obtaining justice from that Empire. It is because I am here, and because of my name, that I am opposed to this rotten system of voluntarism. The best recruiting authorities always sent the recruiting sergeant to Ireland to fill the ranks of the British Army. Henry Grattan, the Irish patriot, said that of Nelson&#39;s fighting forces, numbering 75,000, one-half were Irishmen, while the Duke of Wellington, when the Catholic Emancipation Bill was being debated in the House of Commons, said that one-half of the army that followed him from Portugal to Waterloo were Roman Catholics. That may not be considered quite conclusive as to the number of Irishmen who followed him, but it substantiates in the main my contention that Ireland, as an integral part of the Empire, has in the past willingly spilt more than a fair share of her blood in winning those battles that have brought fame and power and wealth to the Empire. </para>
                    <para>Having said so much on this phase of the subject, I leave it with the statement that it is because I am an Irishman that I am opposed to a system that has worked so barbarously in the Old Country, and is working so iniquitously here. I shall deal now with a few favorite illusions. We do not know exactly where we stand in regard to these things. Men hold opinions which they believe to be solid, but which are really illusions masquerading as sound ideas, when they have in reality naught but a substratum of ether for their foundation. If we want to do justice to ourselves, we must stand in this .chamber as thinking men, having knowledge, reason, and experience as our guides, and not as schoolgirls of the meanest intelligence in dealing with questions of this kind. We must have chapter and verse for our beliefs; we must have reasons for the faith that is in us if we have any pretence to sanity or mentality. The first illusion to which I want to refer is the opinion amongst Labourites that voluntarism is right and that conscription is wrong. That is really a delusion and an illusion, based on nothing more substantial than thin air, and it ought not to stand as an unchanged and unchangeable opinion. We are asked, however, to accept it as gospel truth, and those who have the temerity to oppose it in any form, we are told, should be anathema to the Labour party. That is what we shall come to. You, sir, having regard to what has been done in one State, should not be in the chair to-night. That is the pass to which we have come. So eternal has the rightness of this opinion on the question of voluntarism come to be regarded that it dare not be looked at. We must approach it with bowed head and bared feet. But the opinions of the Labour party to-day, like nature itself, are undergoing constant change. There is no phenomena in the physical world, no verity so well marked, as the fact that there is nothing so unchangeable as change. Voluntarism, with its doubtful origin, its bad pedigree, its evil associations and evil work, in this free Democracy, will not stand examination. Let me tell those of our party who say, &#34;Do not dare to differ from is on this question,&#34; that we have been changing our opinions repeatedly and for excellent reasons. I shall give them, a few homely illustrations, proving that it re- &#39; quires only the test of time to show up the ridiculousness, the hollowness, and the utter falsity of a position that we may once have occupied. </para>
                    <para>The Labour party in this chamber once thought, in its wisdom, that to secure for it the best prospects and to insure for it the highest destiny, they should vote for the system of plumping. The present Minister for Defence took a leading part amongst those who believed that nothing could save this party unless the electors were given the power to plump. The battle was fought in this Parliament in a way that we all well remember. What has since happened? The position to-day is that instead of our party standing for the principle of plumping, the Opposition, who were once against it, and who struck at its very vitals, are clamouring for its adoption. Time proved that plumping was not to our advantage, although we held some years ago that it was. We believed in it then just as firmly as many in our party to-day hold that voluntarism is the proper system to adopt in raising our forces. Although the Labour movement had not then assumed its regular outlines of to-day, although it was not then the thoroughly highly-organized party that it is to-day, with various methods and devices for ruling itself, it did exist before its formal inauguration. It existed m various ways and forms throughout this continent. There was a time when this party lived, so to speak, in a fledgling state, or, to go still further back, in a germinal state. At a time when the party was advancing from the germ to the fledgling, and gradually to the fully-fledged noble eagle it now is in the aviary of the world&#39;s politics, its members were radically opposed to the opinion which Labour holds to-day on one most vital point. Trade unionism, before the party assumed power in the political history of this country, held the fixed belief that to introduce politics into its ranks would be to destroy it. I remember hearing <inline font-weight="bold">Mr.</inline> Twomey, <inline font-weight="bold">President</inline> of the Seamen&#39;s Union, make the statement in the Protestant Hall, Sydney, shortly before the 1890 strike, that &#34; The moment you introduced politics into trades unionism you would burst it up. To introduce politics would be worse than to introduce religion into it.&#34; That was the all-pervading opinion on that point then. So that this movement, when it comprised better spirits than exist in its ranks to-day, had the fixed view that politics should be tabooed from all trade unions. We have changed right round from that opinion to-day. We are standing now at the other pole; and the reason we are here, thirty-one out of thirty-five senators, is that we have cast aside the old opinions as no good. </para>
                    <para>And what was the case in regard to Federation in New South Wales, when the death-warrant to Labour members was signed? They were told that they must not vote for Federation, and even Sleath and Ferguson were expelled, or threatened to be expelled, because of a false belief as to what was in the interests of the Labour movement. Time has proved that Sleath and Ferguson were right, and the Labour movement, good and sound as it was in every way else, absolutely wrong and mistaken, as our presence here to-night testifies. In minor matters what has happened? Let us remember the former attitude of Labour in regard to the borrowing policy. How often have we paraded up and down the country, and declared for no borrowing, except on the most economical and stingy scale? Have we adhered to the policy we then advocated? Have we adhered to our former policy in regard to land nationalization? Do we still believe in the un alienation of Crown lands? There have been Labour Governments in power time and again which have not brought that reform about, simply because their reasoning has been brought to bear on this article of faith. These incidents prove that the Labour movement, in its central, germinal ideas, has suffered change; that the grand old touchstone of time has made change inevitable, aye, inescapable. Because we dare to throw doubts on a supposed unalterable principle we are anathema - branded as were the slaves in South Carolina. No advance has ever been made without some sacrifice, and the men who will not make that sacrifice fail to recognise that sense of solemn duty that would right the situation. </para>
                    <para>But the time is coming when the voice of Labour will again ring true, just as the voice of Labour is ringing in Western Australia to-day. It is recognised there that in the social sphere of action we cannot be governed except by our head. In times like these that head is like the captain of a ship - from the skin-covered craft of median, al times to the modern ship of to-day - who sees the movements of the vessel better than can the man on the quarter-deck or in the stokehold. Both <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie</inline> and myself have had some experience of sea, and when I was in the stokehold I did not take upon myself to advise the man on top, because 1 trusted him as the one on whose judgment my safety rested. In the opinion of Labour men in Western Australia the leaders have a better chance of sizing up the position from every stand-point, with their wider powers of observation, and, above all, with that absolute confidence we have in them that they will not play false to their trust. They have trusted their leaders in the past, and in this crucial hour they are prepared to trust them still. The people of Western Australia know that the information that is in the mind of the Prime Minister cannot be divulged, any more than can the information that is in the mind of every leading power of the earth to-day - that years must pass before these secrets can be revealed for the sake of the nation&#39;s safety. I am sorry beyond the power of speech to think that members of this&#39; Chamber should take advantage of the fact that the Prime Minister cannot give the public all the information that has been placed at his disposal. Every sane man knows that, in the interests of safety, there are things that must be left unsaid in the present situation. </para>
                    <para>Our history shows that the laws of the Labour party have not been those of the Medes and Persians, but have been in keeping with human progress. Newman said that life was change - that to approach perfection was to change often; but now those who dare to support the present Government are told to sign or resign on an issue that was never before the people, and one that, transcends any issue that ever was or could be before them. Never was an issue so grave presented to us : and yet we have all this fiddling and juggling with figures in order to sustain a position that is in mid-air. </para>
                    <para>I think I have dealt sufficiently with the illusion as to the unalterability of the policy of the Labour party. I deny that the opinion expressed outside on conscription is the opinion of Labour to-day; it is the opinion of  a section of Labour that is usurping functions in the most unwarrantable way, and paving the road to the disruption of a glorious movement with a bright future and great potentialities - wrecking the movement in the most suicidal way. It would seem that we have to go through much trouble before we reach a safe haven. It would be well if men could be brought to a sense of responsibility, and made to regard matters in perspective; but some of those concerned have not as much imagination as a slug or the outlook of a sand-fly on the question before the country. It is sad to think that men in responsible positions should use such arguments, or rather make such statements, in the treatment of this mighty question. The next illusion is that conscription means wage slavery. That is to say, it is urged that if this Bill is passed and conscription adopted, the Commonwealth will be reduced to a state of white slavery. If there are any honorable senators who really think that conscription will mean the breaking up of the unions, let them have the courage to stand up and say so. Is not the first argument of the opponents of conscription that it means disruption of unionism, and the bringing of the wage earner to the position of the serf? If that is so, why do they not stand to the charge they make? It makes me sick to think that we have reached a time when we cannot come to close quarters on a question; and my desire is to get those men into a consistent frame of mind. </para>

If it is true that conscription for foreign service means wage slavery, must it not be equally true of conscription for home service. Conscription for either service should produce the same results. Compulsory training for home service is on our platform, and, that being so, those Labour men who are now opposing conscription on the ground I have mentioned, must admit that in the past they have never sought, as they allege, to remove a potential cause of wage slavery. </para>

                            <para>- Yes ; they have boasted of it from a thousand platforms. They stand condemned as hypocrites if they say that conscription for foreign service means wage slavery, the breaking up of unionism, and the conscription -of workers, while at the same time they have allowed this positive agency to bring about the same result - to remain on their platform for the last fourteen or fifteen years. They must admit that, to  give  the power to conscript men for home service, will not produce wage slavery, or that they have been face to face with an evil instrument all these years, holding over the toilers of Australia the power to menace and destroy their freedom, and have made no attempt to remove it. My friends express their dissent, but I have them in the vice, and they must stop there and squeal as they please. They have to admit that the power to conscript has not this evil influence as applied to home service, or that they have been grossly recreant to their trust in not removing it from their platform, and have been posing as hypocrites for the last fourteen years. I leave them to their choice of these alternatives. </para>

                    <para>I come now to deal with a further grand illusion. I have been linked up with <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Joseph</inline> Cook and <inline font-weight="bold">Sir William</inline> Irvine, and others like them. I was on the platform last night with a few of them. Because I was there doubts have been cast upon my genuineness as a Labour man. According to the reasoning of some of these people, no matter what <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Joseph</inline> Cook and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> say, there must be something evil and malign in it. They forget entirely that these men have supported measures for which we have ourselves voted, and that they never then objected to their company. During the last fifteen years in this Parliament members of our party in the Senate have from time to time been found in company with men of the other  side; but some of our friends have discovered only now, when honorable senators opposite support this Bill, and are in favour of conscription, that we who are in agreement with them are in the company of something that means red ruin. My honorable friends cannot have the thing both ways. They cannot discover evil design now in association with honorable senators opposite, when on former occasions when it suited their purpose they gladly went wholly into their embrace on many an issue, minor or major though it may have been in character. According to the logic of these men, if <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Joseph</inline> Cook sent forward a message to the people of Australia that men should love their wives, that would be a reason why every Labourite in the country should turn wife-beater. I do not subscribe to that kind of doctrine. I can conceive circumstances when it may be not only possible, but absolutely necessary, in the interests of the common safety, for men of all shades of differences of opinion, political, religious, or otherwise, to cone together. </para>
                    <para>I do not know whether any honorable senator present has been shipwrecked. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie,</inline> my old seaman colleague, may have escaped, but , I was shipwrecked once, and on another occasion was so close to it as to realize the stern reality of imminent danger to life as a terrible thing. &#34;When the call to clear the life-boat came at 2 o&#39;clock in the morning, in the midst of a terrific South Sea Island hurricane, when I was on the old <inline font-style="italic">Birksgate,</inline> and the rudder head was broken, I realized what it meant to be face to face with death. I realized, also, that there was no room for differences of opinion when it was a question of the safety of the whole. The imminent prospect was that the tyrannical skipper might be Joseph Cook, but he must pull on the same oar with Lynch, the A..B. There was no room for differences of opinion there. </para>

                    <para class="block">I come now to the illusion about the conscription of married men. We have men in this chamber so tenderly solicitous for the married people of the Commonwealth that they fear for the poor married man who may be conscripted as a result of the passage of this Bill and the carrying of the referendum in the affirmative. Let me remind these men, who would like to safeguard the married men of Australia, that they have not been safeguarded under the voluntary system. There are at least 30,000 fatherless homes in Australia to-day because of our cowardice in hesitating to bring into operation a system of conscription. If it had been adopted those lost fathers would be with their wives and families in Australia to-night. We have honorable senators keenly solicitous because married men are going to be drawn upon under conscription when the available single men have been exhausted. Certainly, married men will be drawn upon, as in every country in the world that means to be free, but they are less likely to be drawn upon here if the 150,000 robust single men who could fight, but up to the present have not toed the scratch, had gone to the front. Rather than allow this country to go down, rather than desert our glorious flag, with its Southern Cross of stars, typical of man&#39;s spiritual redemption, and typical alike of man&#39;s social redemption in this land; rather than suffer it to be replaced by the two-headed eagle, with cruel beak and claws, the fitting symbol of the soulless, relentless, fiendish spirit of the enemies of our country, the married men of the Commonwealth will rush to our colours for the defence of Australia. We who are supporting the Government proposal are defending the married section of the community more effectively than are those who will vote against this Bill, and will vote &#34;No&#34; to the question to be submitted to the people at the referendum. I will tell honorable senators why I say that. </para>
                    <para>This Bill is introduced and the referendum is proposed for the purpose of making good the &#39;shortages due to the inadequacy of the volunteer system to supply the men we require. If we do not fill the gaps in our ranks and supply the 16,500 men required per month, if this Bill is not passed, and, unfortunately, this country should haul down its fla.&#60;r, the married men will be called upon still. By the passage of this Bill, and the carrying of the referendum in the affirmative, we shall draw upon the single men section of the community, and when they fill the gaps in our ranks to the required number, the married men will be safe. This is a safer policy for the married men of Australia than is the policy of those who are opposed to this Bill. Honorable senators cannot deny that by the passage of this Bill, and the carrying of the referendum in the affirmative, we will do more to safeguard the married men of Australia than will those who oppose the Bill, who vote &#34; No &#34; at the referendum. So much for that illusion. It is high and dry on the rocks with its ribs stove. in. I am sorry that it should have been submitted amongst intelligent men in this Chamber as an argument against the Government proposal. This Bill, and an affirmative decision at the referendum, will save the married men of Australia as long as they can be saved. Without the Bill and without an  affirmative  vote they will be drawn upon still. Do the anti-conscriptionists want that? If they don&#39;t, then they should drop their hollow pretence of sympathy for married men. </para>
                    <para>I come now to examine the voluntary system. I said that I would have something to say about it. We have to decide whether we will continue the voluntary system or turn over a new leaf and replace it by another system. I can refer honorable senators to the history of the voluntary system in the Old Country. Let me tell them that the voluntary system, a? such, was never yet responsible for the winning of a war worth remembering by the British Empire. However strange that may appear to honorable senators, it is true. Let that soak into their minds.

It is confirmed in brief fashion by a quotation from  Clode&#39;s <inline font-style="italic">Military Forces of the Crown,</inline> vol. 2, page 435, which I find at page 163 of <inline font-style="italic">Britain&#39;s First Duty,</inline> by George F.

                            <para>- There is an imposing list of current illusions concerning this subject; but I am only referring to those which are more apparent. I do not intend to occupy the time of the Senate unnecessarily in the examination of the whole of them, and so have selected only some of the more glaring illusions, those mental phantoms that are at present abroad in the public mind, and are being used soberly by members of the Senate. Another false position taken up by some people - and among them are members of this Senate - is that we have no right to conscript human life, because they hold to the belief that nothing is more sacred in human affairs than human life. I totally and absolutely disagree with that proposition. There is  something dearer than human life - terrible though it may seem to say so - and the thing dearer than human life is life worth living. Our forefathers, at all events, those of them who are worthy to be called to mind, recognised this truth, for they did not hesitate to lay down their lives either on the battlefield or in other stern fields of action to win for us the privileges we are enjoying to-day. May I remind those who subscribe to the belief that nothing is dearer than human life that we cannot create our own environment? There is a foolish notion abroad in the world that as a people we can create a set of conditions which, by their arrangement and interaction, can insure the safety of this country. The freedom we enjoy to-day is not the product of our effort or time in this country so much as it is the result of sacrifice on the part of &#39; our forefathers in the earlier phases of the history of our race. Human freedom to-day, I repeat, is the product of sacrifice. </para>

What did the late Lord Northcote and others tell us ? &#34; The lesson learned in the American war of rebellion,&#34; he said, &#34; has never been forgotten by Britain.&#34; A handful of American colonists revolted, and rightly so, against the gross misuse of British power, with the result, as Lord Northcote said, that the lesson had never been forgotten. What did he mean? He meant that the freedom we enjoy now has been paid for in some measure by American soldiers&#39; lives, showing again that we may owe our environment and freedom to causes so far removed from us both as to time and distance. And yet we are told in these days that we can do everything within our own borders. But, as I have shown, we did not obtain our freedom by our own action. It is the produce of sacrifice, by the conscription of men in other times, to advance the cause of liberty. What happened to France? The Revolution, that earthshaking epoch in history, contributed in large measure to the freedom of the world. The rebel blood shed at the barricades blossomed in the world&#39;s greater freedom. Those patriots who laid down their lives in that troublesome time - among them Robespierre and Danton - were offered up to the blind fury of the mob. </para>
                    <para>In much the same way the Prime Minister of this country is paying the price of his patriotism. This is the lot of every patriot, from the Gracchi Brothers, of ancient Rome, and the founders of the land reform, down to our present time. Of the Gracchi Brothers, me was sent to his grave by the dagger of a member of the mob in the Roman Forum, and the other had to flee the country to escape the fury of the people. Washington, that man of stainless and immortal honour in the sphere of martial and political action, was described by the pen of Ordell as a perjurer and a liar, just as <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> has been described to-day. Washington lives. Where is Ordell? The Gracchi Brothers live in grateful memory. Where is the mob? My countrymen&#39;s patriot, Henry Grattan, was once pursued by the. mob in Dublin, and grossly assaulted there. But how did he regard the temper of the Irish people towards his attitude and his supposed traitorship? </para>
                    <para class="block">What did he say? &#34; I take no notice of them. I keep pegging away.&#34; <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> is distrusted by the ungrateful mob outside; but if he sought to sell his talents in the markets of the world, if he showed the instincts of the mercenary, where would he be to-day? </para>

                            <para>- It is difficult for tae to be calm, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. President,</inline> when I think of what is being said of the man who has been a giant amongst men, and who, in season and out of season for the last twenty-five years, has done so much for the Labour movement in Australia. It <inline font-style="italic">is</inline> difficult for me to restrain myself when I know he has been called an arch traitor, a liar, and a humbug, and when such foul suspicion rests upon him - a man who, as I have said, if he were to do as his vile accusers would do, auction his ability in the open mart, would not need to be in the Labour movement to-day. Did he, during the last twenty-five years, ever falter when the movement wanted brains to direct it? And yet we find that these young men - these &#34; Johnny -  Come-Latelies,&#34;  as I shall call them - these men who have sacrificed nothing themselves, are carrying the movement towards its dissolution. I am sorry and sad to think that our movement is going the same road as other political movements, but I was. pleased to hear <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Long&#39;s</inline> manly speech this afternoon in defence of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes.</inline> . I was pleased to think there still survived some men strong enough to set their faces against this campaign of calumny, suspicion, and distrust in our Leader. The essence of our movement is comradeship and trust in each other, and up till recently the foul breath of suspicion, ingratitude, and jealousy never rested upon a leader unless he deserved it. </para>

                            <para>- I accept that assurance absolutely. I turn now to the point that we should not submit this issue to the judgment of the people, because men should not be compelled to surrender their lives at the mere behest of a majority of the nation. That is a typical example of the kind of argument used in this chamber and elsewhere by those opposed to conscription. 1 ask those who put forward that case whether there is no other type of conscript than the man who by physical force is made to do his duty ? I say there is another type of conscript created by the action of those very men who to-day hold up their hands in outraged virtue at the proposal that men should be physically conscripted. When a state of war. was created in Australia, every member of this Chamber, in voting the first pound of Supply for the equipment of the Expeditionary Forces, took a step the responsibility of  which  he must shoulder. When that declaration of war was made, not one discordant voice was raised in Australia. The Commonwealth leaped instinctively to the position it should occupy alongside the allied nations in this fight for freedom, and by voting the first war Supply every honorable senator actually took part in creating a state of war. What, then, was necessary? War cannot be made without regiments, and regiments cannot be made without men. Immediately there was a resort to the old voluntary system. How did it work out? We have in Australia to-day men possessed of the true spirit of Eureka, or more modernly of Anzac, men who at the first call jumped incontinently to their country&#39;s side in true Spartan fashion. In the glorious days of Sparta the citizen regarded his country as a larger embodiment of himself, and when the State was considered in danger, he sprang with Spartan pride to his post of duty. That correctly describes the spirit of a number of Australian volunteers, but it is not by any means applicable to all of them. In saying that .t do not intend to cast the least breath of reflection or suspicion upon the less glorious motives of those other men who have gone to the front. There were varying motives in the minds of those 260,000 men whom Australia was able to put into the firing line. The purer and nobler Spartan and Eureka spirit animated a large number of them. But how many enlisted after intense mental tribulation ? </para>

                    <para class="block">On the one hand they saw their country in jeopardy. On the other hand they heard the most sacred calls of domestic duty from father, mother, wife, and child. Their life was in the balance. Into one scale they put their most sacred obligations, dictated by God and Nature. Into that same scale they put their life, sweet and precious as life is to every man. In the other scale they put one thing alone - their country&#39;s imperious demand for help, and that bore the balance down. Will any honorable senator tell me that a man labouring under those fearful emotions is a free man ?  His  position is vastly different from that of that other noble type of volunteer who, recklessly flinging e&#39;very other consideration to the winds, rushes irresistibly  to his country&#39;s call. In the theatre of the other man&#39;s mind there is- a. conflict of duty.- On the one hand he is not free to go, because of the claims of sweetheart, wife, or child,, and, on the other hand, he cannot be indifferent to his country&#39;s call. He spends days and weeks in anxious worry, and when finally patriotism prevails, he offers a life which is as precious to him as life is to those men who do not go, and stop their ears to all pleading. That man is a moral conscript, but, according to the arguments of some honorable senators, it is the physical conscript who must be shielded; he is the most glorious example of humanity. I say that the physical conscript, weighed in the balance of human worth, is not as good a type of citizen by parallels of latitude as the man whom I have described, and who, as the result of the surging of unspeakable agony in his heart, went to his country&#39;s aid under the most powerful pressure ever exercised on man. I cannot regard him as a free being. Those honorable senators who by their votes in this Chamber created a state of war have made him a moral conscript, and as such he is more entitled- to&#39; consideration than the physical conscript. The latter, although fit for active service, still hugs his life, and has been to-night the subject of lavish commiseration and pity, and almost of glorification. I tell <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ferricks</inline> that he has made moral conscripts, and every man who has voted a penny towards defraying the cost of Australia&#39;s participation in the War has bound those men in mental irons more cruel and galling, and put a heavier hand on them than can be put on the men who, by the operation of this Bill, will be told to come forward and do their duty. No matter how honorable senators may juggle with facts, the logic of that argument is inescapable. Can it be said that those men who have gone to the front as the result of moral pressure are volunteers ? In the every day sense of the word they are not. Therefore, the men who say that we who are in favour of conscription are acting in a foul, brutal, and relentless way - those Puritans of society, who say they will not conscript human life - are, in reality, more deadly types of conscriptionists than we ever knew how to be, because they are shielding men of a lower grade of character than those of whom they themselves have made moral conscripts. </para>

We propose to make the physical conscript toe the line with the other man, the moral conscript, whom they term a volunteer. That I feel to be in perfect keeping with the principles of natural justice. Their spurious reasoning will not disprove the statement that by the most cruel means, by creating martyrs of the mind, they have made a certain class of voluntary soldiers moral conscripts.

                    <para>Another interesting phase of the question is the opposition which has come from that extreme section of the Labour party called Socialists. The policy of this Bill is perfectly compatible with Socialism. Its principle, indeed, is ideal Socialism. Voluntarism is opposed to Socialism, repugnant to its very essence and seminal purpose; conscription, on the other hand, is ideal Socialism. Socialism, if it means anything, means that the will of the individual must be subordinated to the common will and to the common weal. To put an individual above society is, accord ing to the doctrines of Socialism, preposterous. In the ideal social state - and I have read as many pictures of it as I could find in works of all kinds, from Plutarch&#39;s <inline font-style="italic">Lives</inline> and St. Augustine&#39;s <inline font-style="italic">City of God</inline> to More&#39;s <inline font-style="italic">Utopia</inline> - even the minor activities of life are governed according to the will of the majority. But it is the roof that covers and protects the building ; it is the roof that gives it security. When a society becomes insecure, it is in danger of perishing. Yet we are told that when the all-important issue of existence is to be settled, society can no longer subordinate the individual will to the common weal. The individual is then to put himself above the society, and it is to be saved, not by those who can and ought to fight for it, but by those who may. That, in truth, is not Socialism, but individualism - individualism rampant and carried to an extreme of dizzy absurdity. According to the canons of Socialism, in society&#39;s minor activities, the individual has no choice, but when the very life of society itself is threatened the individual is told by Socialists that he can please himself about defending it. Voluntarism places the individual above society, and yet some honorable senators hold up their hands and call it Socialism. God help Socialism if theirs is a sample of the reasoning of&#34; Socialists, and if it is on wisdom like theirs that the Socialists appeal to the people to elect them to positions of responsibility. </para>
                    <para>Then, again, Socialists say, &#34; The world is my country&#34; - tra-la ! &#34;Mankind are my brethren &#39; &#39; - tra-la ! Frontier lines ! What are they? Where are&#62; they? Kick them aside, or rub them out as though they were marked with chalk. Those are the glorious doctrines which these gentlemen preach. I only hope that we shall&#39; so shape our policy in our small sphere action that there will shortly be brought about that consummation of which Tennyson sang - &#34;When the war drums beat no longer.&#34; But what are Australian Socialists doing to achieve this much-to-be-desired end? How is their vanguard acting to-day? Are they doing anything? No. On the contrary, they are preventing action from being taken by Australia. But. whose interests are at stake? Look at the situation of Europe to-day. Who is  suffering there ? Is it not our brothers, our &#34;comrades,&#34; as they call them? Inside the German lines we have them fighting under that gallant soul, <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Liebknecht.</inline> He and his band are fighting our common enemy. The very fact that he is in gaol is a manifestation of the fight. He and his followers stand by the principle of Socialism, and contend against the power that must be humbled in the dust. Who are attacking that power from the front? The Socialists of France, Belgium, Italy, and Great Britain. There is a common effort by these &#34; comrades &#34; - to use the word we hear so often on the Yarra-bank - an effort made from within by <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Liebknecht,</inline> and from outside by the armies of the Allies, to crush, as between the hammer and the anvil, the might of German tyranny. But what are the Australian Socialists doing to help? They are not even decently neutral. As I told my fellow-Labourites at Kalgoorlie, on May Day they send their greetings to the &#34; comrades &#34; in France and in Germany, but if I were one of <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Liebknecht&#39;s</inline> supporters, or one of their so-called &#34; comrades &#34; in France, I would say, when these hypocritical messages came to hand, &#34;Damn your greetings; it is men we need to help us in this fight against our enemy and yours. . You are not assisting us in this war, and yet you call us  comrades.&#39; Hypocritical hogwash ! Damn comradeship, if this is a sample of it.&#34; &#34; Comrades !&#34; Is it not enough to make one&#39;s blood boil to see men content with words when there is this great struggle going on in the world to-day? Why is there not in the breasts of these persons some sleeping instinct that can be aroused, so that there may be a revolt, and an end put to these hollow pretences, these tricks that are being played under high heaven by those who masquerade as Labourites and Socialists, but are neither. They should spring instinctively to arms, as the tiger springs to protect her cubs, and show themselves true comrades, instead of professing to be comrades, and proving themselves real enemies by keeping help from those who need it. What would <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Liebknecht,</inline> or any French, British, or Italian Socialist say to them? They would say, &#34;We have by our sides gallant men from Australia. They were honest enough not to call us &#39; comrades &#39; in the past, but in the hour of peril they have come to us, and have proved themselves true comrades, while you, cowards, slink in safety - like a dog with his tail between his legs in his hiding-place - 16,000 miles away. Yet you dare to call us comrades! Remember, as you have not made this war of ours your war, when we are fighting as much for your freedom as for our own, do not expect us to make your war, when it comes, any concern of ours. But we will . promise when your war comes to call you &#39; comrades,&#39; and send &#39; greetings &#39; to help you through.&#34; Language fails me. I cannot adequately express my indignation at the extraordinary hypocrisy manifested by these so-called Socialists, these alleged Australians ! The real Socialists, who are fighting for their lives, and for their liberties and ours, are entitled to say to the Australian Socialists, &#34; You call us comrades, but you keep help from us!&#34; Jaures and Bebel, if alive today, would say things like those. When, in the present state of affairs, they talk of the world being their country and mankind their brethren, these Australian Socialists are, to use the words of Sydney Smith, &#34;indecently exposing their intellects.&#34; They impugn their manhood by the attitude they are assuming to-day. Plain speaking is a tonic at times, and it is well that it should be indulged in now, so that the true position may be shown. You cannot support yourself in time of trouble, and you will never triumph when you rely on principles that lean this way and that, but are never perpendicular. Although we are at the antipodes, our principles must not be upside down, must not work backwards. True principles are eternal things, and changeless; only such will pull a party through, and when it has gone astray and lost its true guiding star, will help it to recover the right road. I have said these things in the hope that by drawing attention to the unsoundness of their position many of these persons will feel that they have made a mistake. </para>
                    <para>Let me come now to another matter. It has been said in this chamber that the unionists of Australia have done more than&#39; their fair share in this war. My impression is that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Doyle,</inline> the  President  of the Sydney Labour party, has stated that 90 per cent. of the men of our </para>
                    <para class="block">Expeditionary Forces were recruited from the ranks of unionism. I do not wish to do <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Doyle</inline> injustice by quoting him incorrectly, but those are the figures that remain in my mind. If the facts are as stated, if 90 per cent, of the men who have taken arms were recruited from the ranks of unionism, and Labour is doing more than its fair share, is it not time that we had a change, and asked the capitalists and their sons - who, if these statements are correct, must be shirking - to take up their responsibilities? The Government propose a change in Australia&#39;s course of action. There are three ways in which we can perform our part in the present struggle. Even the most lethargic mind among us must by now have awakened to the fact that the Empire is at war, and that we have over a quarter of a million of our best men in the field. This legislation may be taken as a formal declaration of war on the part of Australia. It has been said by some that Australia has already done too much. What do they mean? Do they suggest that we should not do anything more, or that our efforts should be on a  smaller scale - in other words, that we should make a pretence of doing something? There are some who would have us stand still altogether, on the plea that we have done enough, while others would say, &#34; Let what we have to do be done leisurely, in a half-hearted manner.&#34; We have our choice between three methods: We can make a pretence of doing something; we can act half-heartedly; or we can make the full-hearted, whole-souled effort that is proposed by the Government. We cannot entertain the idea of making our effort a form or pretence. Whatever faults Australians may have, they cannot pretend. We. all have our faults, and it is well to recognise thiem. I have mine - more than enough, God knows ! And I would wish that every individual, or every section of society, in turn would recognise that he or it has faults. But &#39;we have arrived at a stage when some men in the Labour movement think that once they have spoken the last word of wisdom has been uttered, and nothing can be said contrariwise. If a half pretence is to be our aim, it must be ruled out, because Australians by nature cannot be pretenders or pOSturers. Then, is it to be a half-hearted effort? If we jog along leisurely, sending away 5,000 men a month, it will be a halfhearted effort, like calling out a fire-brigade one at a time. But has Australia made half-hearted efforts in its past history&#39; We brought this vast continent of ours under subjugation in a short space of time, and in that pioneering effort we have not proved ourselves half-hearted. Have we done so in the industrial sphere ? No. In that field we have done marvels; we have proved ourselves whole-hearted en-&#39; deavourers.  What have we done in sociology? What are the laws that we have made here and in the State Parliaments? In our endeavours to strike a correct social balance between the various sections of society, and to advance Australia, we have set an example to the world. In any action which is of a national character, where have our efforts been half-hearted? When Miss Shaw came to Australia and, from an imperfect knowledge gained on skirting our coasts, pictured the Australian as leaning against a post, did we not all resent it? Yet today we are told by certain gentlemen that we should lean against a post and conduct the war in that leisurely way. But since the first white settlers landed in Australia until now, we have not proved ourselves half-hearted or faint-hearted in what we have done. The pioneering spirit is in our blood, and the fizz is in that blood still. Then why are we told to be halfhearted in this war, or to lean against a post? At the most critical period of our lives we are told that we should call a halt, or slow down, or shorten the line. We cannot be half-hearted. The wholehearted method remains as our standard, and the Bill is in keeping with it. It is in keeping with our purpose, with our history, and with the genius of our race, to make a whole-hearted effort on every occasion. In this war we are fighting in order to maintain our liberty. What liberty do we possess? The greatest measure of liberty enjoyed by any civilized people, past or present, to-day. </para>

He is now down among the people, getting them to frame and forge the national will. The difference between what is happening in Germany to-day and what is happening in Australia is clearly shown by BethmannHollweg remaining away from the people while moulding a policy that affects millions and by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> putting the case to the people by way of a referendum, and getting them to fashion their own policy. Does Bethmann-Hollweg go to the Trades Halls of Germany, as Hughes does in Australia? </para>
                    <para>I am a peaceful man. I am anxious that the time should come when there will be no such thing as war. To those who are so fond of talking peace, &#163; say, If we have- never had the chance in our lives before, we have at least on this occasion the chance of setting a bright, glorious, and golden example to the nations of the world. For the first time i l the history of the human family we have the spectacle of a nation about to make a formal declaration of war. And who is going to do it? The people themselves, uninfluenced by any consideration, at the ballot-box. If we would set an example to the world, the opportunity is right here. The ball is at our feet to show other nations  encrusted  with old-time usages and hoary traditions how wai should be declared, if that fearful arbiter has to be invoked. Has any other nation done this ? Let them copy Australia. In the future the nations will ask, &#34; What did Australia do?&#34; And the answer will be, &#34; It declared war formally by the will of the people.&#34; Have other nations done so ? No. Here is the opportunity to set a glorious example to civilized men as to how war should be declared&#39;, while at the same time we should be going to the rescue of our comrades in the trenches. </para>

                            <para>- Yes. I think that I have said enough. We have a country that is worth* living for, fighting for, dying for, and we have in front of us the task of deciding what we are going to do. The method by which we are to proceed is embodied in the Bill. We want to ask the people of this country to say that they are going to continue fighting to the bitter end, and beyond that, if possible. If they do not, it will mean that all the blood, treasure, and labour spent up to the present will have been lost. In Australia we have the freest country in the world to&#39; live in. In the land in which I was born I had not that freedom that I desired and sought for. I have lived under other flags, and I have come to the conclusion that Australia is possessed of a glorious freedom that is not to be found in any other part of he globe to-day. That freedom is responsible for the presence in this chamber of honorable senators. Take yourself, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. President,</inline> a miner; take <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie,</inline> a &#39;seaman, like myself; <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Barnes,</inline> a miner or a shearer. By reason of the freedom we enjoy here in Australia - and to be found nowhere else on earth - we have placed at the disposal of the people the opportunity to raise themselves for what they are worth to the highest positions in the country, where they may shape our destiny as a nation. Here indeed, in dear Australia alone, can the meanest unit, like atoms in the mighty ocean, rise to the surface and glisten in the sun. Where on earth has a chance like that occurred before ? Having that priceless, precious freedom given to * us by sacrifices in other lands at other times and in other ages, and responsible for our presence in this chamber, it is up to us now to see, unless we are craven hearted and devitalized, that we preserve and defend it at all costs, having always before us for consideration those comrades in the trenches who are calling across the sea to us. We shall be unworthy of the heritage we have, unworthy of our ancestry, unworthy of the traditions of our martyred forefathers, and of the good name our soldiers have earned throughout the world by their conduct on the battlefield, if we do not now send more men to their aid. </para>

                    <para>I am hopeful that my friends who oppose me will even now realize that there are spots on the sun and that their position is unsound. If their action should lead to a majority for the &#34;Noes,&#34; this country will cover itself with immortal and indelible shame. If we do not maintain our good name, help our good friends at the front, and preserve our freedom by fighting for it, Australia will cut a very poor figure in the world ; and if ever the time should come for us to fight our own battle, we shall fare badly. If we measure our effort with a stingy hand we shall be guilty of self-enacting a warrant to others that we be left to stand alone when our hour of peril strikes. When these comrade nations are little less than wrecks of their former selves, we could not expect them to come to our aid in that hour. If I were a Britisher, a Frenchman, or an Italian, and saw my country subject to decimation, while Australia preserved her manhood that ought to be at the front in the common fight, I would think nothing of her when her war came. </para>
                    <para>As comrades we should pay the current prices and not sweating prices in the hour of struggle. We have declared against sweating rates in Australia; but the men who say that in this war we have done enough already and ought to shorten our line are in effect advocating the payment of sweating prices for our share of the struggle; and should Australia step forward to garner the fruits of victory whilst still having here a reserve of able-bodied manhood that ought to have been in the firing line, she will cover herself with immortal infamy - a shame that will never be wiped out, no matter what our boys may have done. I hope that the blood of cur country that spurted like a fountain on Gallipoli in freedom&#39;s cause has not grown stale or been watered down. We have proved it. But if we do not <inline font-style="italic">go</inline> on, are we as a nation not growing prematurely old? Have the seeds of senile decay entered our young bones? </para>
                    <para>We have before us that sorry example of degeneracy - a nation which was the pride of nations in the past, and gave to the world examples of brotherhood and heroism, and led in the advancement of every art and science. I need not name it, but it has been described by Byron as a &#34; Sad relic of departed worth.&#34; If we are going to leave our comrades unhelped and ask them to do the fighting for us, we shall sink to the level which that nation occupies today. </para>
                    <para>Shall it be said of Australia, &#34; Australia, but living Australia no more&#34;? Never! Our men are there shouting &#34;Coo-ee!&#34; from across the sea. My advice is to Coo-ee in return. Let us cry, &#34; Coo-ee ! we are coming.&#34; Never in our short, but glorious, history has that cry for help been made in vain. Shall it be in vain this time? No. Never! &#34; Australia will be there!&#34; </para>

                        <para>. - After the impassioned address to which we have just listened, any one may be pardoned for feeling somewhat nervous, especially if he desires to advance arguments in opposition to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch&#39;s</inline> views.  His  speech would almost lead one to believe that amongst those who differ from him on this question there is no patriotism or consideration for the welfare of Australia or the Empire, but that they are simply laggards and unworthy of the name of Britishers, although they may be as zealous and earnest for the cause of righteousness and truth, and the protection of the Empire, as those who agree with him. The men he has been traducing to-night are those who for the last two years have been in the vanguard of the propaganda for supplying troops to maintain our position at the front. From no other body can it be said that there has been the same ready response or the same activity displayed as by those who to-day see fit to oppose the policy promulgated by the Government. We are gradually getting into closer grips with our enemy, and there is cause for the utmost vigilance and determination on the part of the British Empire and its Allies : but to insinuate that those who differ from the honorable senator&#39;s policy are less interested or less earnest in the fight than are the advocates of conscription, is unworthy of any one who knows the history and spirit of the men about whom he speaks. The unions of Australia are the main force opposing conscription. </para>

                            <para>- The unions almost to a man in many of the States have shown their antipathy to the principle of conscription, and if any section of the people has the right to object to it, it is the organizations which have shown the utmost diligence and watchfulness in the prosecution of the war. They certainly have the right to speak, if any voice is to be heard in opposition to this new method of prosecuting the war. That the unions are opposed to the principle of conscription is well known. They are seeking in their own way to safeguard the cause which they have all along been fighting to maintain. The preservation of their liberty and freedom of action is the guiding principle actuating them in the contest, and I am sure that if the same earnestness and interest had been displayed in the recruiting system as has been engendered in this debate, the. cry for more men would not have been heard as it is to-day. The gradual falling off in the numbers offering is due to the fact that we have lost interest in the propaganda instituted at the commencement of the war. Because there has not been the same continuous and ready response to our appeal, we are asked to class those who have failed to come forward as undesirous of. carrying on the war or unwilling to serve their country. There are many contributing causes why our youth have not come forward in as large numbers as we might have expected. In a large measure the reports now filtering through the press are one continued cry of victory and success to our arms. We are assured that the war is virtually over, or that the supply of men at the front is so great that there is hardly any need to send men so many miles across the sea from such a country as ours, when millions of others are available so much nearer. It is pointed out that we have a continent to protect and maintain fourteen times as lar,ge as Germany, and isolated by so many thousands of miles of distance that it is unwise and unnecessary to gather from the four corners of our continent the few men we have at our disposal. It is said that they are more needed here in their own country. Those statements have influenced many, and no doubt led to the relaxation of interest in propaganda work. If the same interest had been manifested in the recruiting campaign since the beginning of the conscription cry, we should have had no room to complain of the results. Since the inception of this agitation a spirit of bitterness and hostility between man and man, and particularly between the parties affected, has been engendered. It is apparent to the workers, who arc keenly watching events, that the agitation has not sprung from their own ranks. They were doing all that could be expected of them, and their efforts have met wi&#39;-li the approbation and admiration, not only of the British people, but of the whole of our Allies. The part we have played as the result of the voluntary effort lias astounded the world, for never before have such deeds been seen as those performed by our gallant Australians. That has not been done by the spirit of conscription. The results achieved are due to the spirit of Eureka - the spirit that animated the Spartans of old to jump into the breach and fight for the cause they held so dear. In the earlier days of the war men appealed from every platform to our people to take up arms to defend their King and country. To send out men as if they were convicts, to seize them by the scruff of the neck and force them into the ranks, is not the way to produce the best results. The proper way is to appeal to that inner spirit which prompts men to fight for their country&#39;s cause, and maintain its honour. If you appeal to that, you appeal to the spirit of the race from which our people have sprung. </para>

                            <para>- But not by all who could have made it. I admit that the honorable senator, with myself and others, has nothing to be ashamed of in that regard. Many have sacrificed themselves, and felt it a glorious privilege to do so, in their efforts to awaken the manhood of this country to a sense of their danger, and the need to serve in the Empire&#39;s cause. But, whilst that is true of a number of individual members, who have felt a sense of responsibility in regard to the war, it has certainly not bee&#93;true of the Federal Government and those who sit on the Ministerial and Opposition benches as a whole. There has been simply a lackadaisical effort confined 50 individual members, who were left to their ow resources. They could work if they liked, and do the other thing if they liked. It has become utterly impossible for those anxious to help in the matter to do anything. It seemed as though no one was interested, and no one prepared to organize except a few enthusiasts. Wu have, therefore, ourselves largely to blame for any unresponsive feeling that prevails in the community. We cannot condemn the Australian people for their response. They have already done a great deal. I do not suppose it was thought as the commencement of the war that Australia would ever be able to organize an army of 300,000 men, or even to raise them so readily in so short a time. I am sure the British Government never expected Australia, with its vast area and scattered population, to gather together a formidable army twice as great as the standing Army of Great Britain when hostilities began, or that we would play such a noble part as we have done. 1 am not going to make that an excuse so far as the future is concerned. I would rather walk out of this chamber than cease my efforts to prosecute the war to the last man and the last shilling. If, in the coming campaign, we urge conscription upon the people, we shall not create among them harmony or union or a spirit of solidarity. I fear the worst results, if I judge aright the present attitude of organized Labour, and that is something to be reckoned with. We cannot afford, even in this august chamber, to defy the forces of organized Labour outside, not&#34; have we the right to disregard its will in discussing this issue. But if I thought organized Labour was opposed to the prosecution of the war, much as I love the cause of Labour, much as I owe to it, I would scout the idea that I should pay any regard to its wishes. I would pay no heed to it if I thought it  indifferent  or apathetic, or regardless of the consequences likely to follow from the present world-struggle. But the men in the Labour organizations who protest&#39; against being forced to do that which is now being voluntarily done, who are not prepared to be taken as convicts or as conscripts, will respond, when they are wanted, according to their ability and their strength. Many of them have already nobly responded. The organization to which I have belonged for over thirty years has. sent from 23 per cent, to 24 per cent, of its members to the front. They are daily recruiting, and will continue to do so while the war lasts, and the same is true of other industrial organizations. I take it as a libel upon the Labour movement to say it has lost its zeal in- the prosecution of the war. It seeks only to maintain the freedom and liberty of its members within our own country and under our own laws. Given that free right, and given an awakened spirit of interest and zeal, I am quite sure that we shall be able to do all that we can reasonably be expected to do. I do not see that we can continue to send reinforcements to the extent that has been desired of us. I think that the demand for 32,500 for the present month, with an additional 16,500 per month thereafter, is really exacting too great a toll from our sparse population. While it may be necessary to maintain our reinforcements, I cannot dissociate the Australian soldier from the British Tommy or the brave French, the Russians, and others who are allied with us in the prosecution of this war. We stand as brothers side by side. It may be that there has been given us a place of honour ; but if, through lack of numbers, we are unable to maintain those reinforcements, our boys will never surely have to stand and do the work of three, as has been alleged. They can only do that which they are capable of doing - no more and no less. The position is clearly before us that we are not asked to do more than we can, and I am perfectly sure that the spirit of gallantry will be best maintained By appealing to the best instincts of our humanity, and by awakening our men to a sense of the glory of duty. If there is to be any further impetus given to the cause of recruiting, I think that the conditions laid down might be considerably relaxed. There are many not engaged in service to-day who, if the regulations were not so strict, could render good service. There are men who, perhaps, are above the military age fixed by the regulations, but who are equally as active as many under the age. Yet the capacity, the ability, and the desire of these men are to be set aside, and Australia is to bear the odium of being conscripted and forced into action. That position will not make for the progress and full development of a young country such as ours. </para>

                            <para>- Undoubtedly. Whatever may be the demands made upon us, right up to the conclusion of this war, I make bold to say that, as the need is felt, so will be the results achieved. A great deal of the lacking that has been displayed has been due to the fact that the. call has not been of that urgency which was manifested at the commencement of the war, and which was seen while we were conducting our campaigns throughput the country. It must be acknowledged that in the prosecution of this war the Federal Government, as a Government, has relegated its responsibilities and its duties to the States. It has not taken the lead as it ought to have done. I am free to admit that on the War Council we have had our representative, but we have heard no more. We have been utterly oblivious of what has been taking place in council. It has never been made a burning question in this Chamber. It has never come up as a subject for consultation and consideration. We have simply been asked what we are prepared to do, and there the matter has been allowed .to drop. There has been no unique organization in the prosecution of this war, so far as the Federal Parliament  is  concerned. Before we dare ask the people to submit themselves to compulsion when we have not organized for service, and have not put forward inducements that would have awakened their interest and called for a ready response, that course is incumbent upon us. We find that even under the present system the dislocation of the wheels of industry is something that we cannot afford to neglect. I am quite cognisant of the fact that in the case for the Government, as stated by the Prime Minister and those who are associated with him in Cabinet, it has been said that due consideration will be given to the continuity of industry and to the affairs of State. That undoubtedly is a principle that we have to admire. But we find that often, since our boys have been called upon to leave their work and to go into camp to undergo training as members of the ordinary Citizen Forces, appeal after appeal has come from employers asking the Government to make the conditions such that more than a certain number would not be called into camp at once, since the system was dislocating the wheels of industry, and making it impossible for them to carry on their work. In the course of the ordinary manoeuvres and training connected with the preparation of our citizen army during the progress of this war, time and again consideration has had to be given to the position in which industry is placed as the result of such a call on the Citizen Forces. Most of the lads in our Citizen Forces are fit for ser vice, yet they have not responded to the call for active service, and they have not been appealed to as they might have been. Many of them are prosecuting tasks in industrial life which are necessary for the welfare and well-being of others. We cannot afford to dispense with every man. Some men are as much required here as at the front. I think that a great deal of innuendo and many slurs have been hurled at men who are quite as worthy in the positions they occupy at present as are the men who are in khaki. </para>

                            <para>- This is certainly a time for calm deliberation. Whatever may be our native temperament, we have at all times to remember the claims of others. We are not likely to help on the cause by throwing out unnecessary insults. I address these remarks not only to those who feel these things because they happen to be in civilian life, but to those who may differ from us in their political views. I yield to no man in my admiration for the Prime Minister, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes.</inline> There is no man who has been my delight in political life more than that right honorable gentleman has been. I still esteem him highly. I know of no man who is spending himself more than he is doing at the present time. There is no man whom I believe to be more sincere and more desperately in earnest than he is in the prosecution of this war. I cannot believe that those who speak disparagingly of him can in their very heart of hearts believe what they say of him. I think that their words must recoil on their own heads, whether they differ from him politically or not. The name of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> will stand in history after this war has passed and gone, and he will appear as one of the greatest luminaries of the British Empire during the period of the war. While I hold these views, I want at the same time to have regard  for the humblest men in every walk of life. I want to pay them the regard to which they are entitled. We shall indeed be in sore straits when we take by the scruff of the neck a man with full responsibilities, having the custody of his own life, and force him into camp, and compel him to live the life of a conscript. What a degradation it would be for him to go oversea. He could not boast of chivalry and gallantry as can the men who have gone voluntarily to the front. You have to prove right up to the hilt your case that you cannot get nien, and I charge this Government with not having done all that it might have done to secure . the desired result. By reason of the daily appearance in the newspapers of glowing accounts of the prosecution of the war, concealing adversities that have met us, our people have been allowed to go to sleep in the belief that all is going well. Our people have been called shirkers, and other hard names have been applied to them, when, if the true position had been known, the response to the call for volunteers would have been much different from what it is to-day. </para>

                            <para>- That may be so, but, nevertheless, the position was never presented to them as accurately as it stands to-day. This mighty awakening, had it been concentrated in an effort to obtain voluntary enlistment, would, perhaps, have proved quite different in its result. I am satisfied that many of the men who refused to say &#34;Yes&#34; to the appeal, if talked to in a casual and quiet way, would alter their opinion, and be quite ready to respond to the utmost of their capacity. Having regard for the men outside who have the right to be heard, whose opinions must be respected, who stand at the head of great organizations of labour, who have the confidence and support of the men whom they are leading, upon whom so much depends for influencing and for winning those men into activity, we are not likely to further the cause of service for the Empire by threats and by compulsory measures. Having seen what has taken place in the ranks of Labour, I and others hesitate as to what should be done; and I am thankful for the action taken by the present Government with a view to securing the very best result. It has been decided to place the case before the people for their opinion, and the Government have declared that by that opinion they will abide. This has given confidence, and will be appreciated by the great mass of the people who have shown definitely and deliberately that they believe in the referendum - a method of appeal which, I think, will meet with ready acceptance, even by those who differ as to the need for conscription. I am pledged to the uttermost to the thorough prosecution of this war, and to that end I am prepared to go beyond any individual or individuals, and any party or organization. The fact that all who can go from my household have gone to the war ought to be sufficient, if it be necessary, to convince the most sceptical that, so far a,r I am concerned, I can do no more. The only thing remaining is for me to go myself, and I am only tpo ready at any time to do that, though I do not wish to insult the authorities by presenting myself in such a capacity. I intend to appeal to the virility of the manhood of the country as I have done in the past; but until it is made absolutely clear that the exigencies of the case demand it - that there has been a failure on the part of the people to respond to the most earnest appeals - I am not prepared to take a step that will create hostility and engender strife, cause disorganization, and disrupt the very foundations of society. Conscription, in my opinion, will cause men to feel that there is no virtue attached to taking their part in the war, and dissipate all the glory that has been achieved by Australians. It is true that there is conscription in Great Britain, but there the conditions completely differ from those of a young country like this. Furthermore, we have to remember that before that step was taken at Home it was conclusively proved that all the efforts at enlistment in the great congested centres of population were utterly inadequate, and that only compulsion would prove equal to the .occasion. I may be told that the action taken by England ought to be a lesson to us; and it would be if our circumstances were similar; but the vastness of our territory and our position industrially, undermanned as we are in many avenues of labour, make that impossible. I shall have very much pleasure in voting that this question be referred to the people, whom I am at all times prepared to trust. </para>

                    <para class="block">If we are not prepared to trust the people we must have a very bad case. If I thought that my being an anti-conscriptionist would lessen the energy and activity of the people in the prosecution of the war I should be sorry to give such a vote; but I do not anticipate any such result. If the referendum should be defeated, I believe there would follow a great campaign throughout the Commonwealth, and that, so far as we could yield our strength, it would be given freely. The question is to be left to the people; and I am positive, from the spirit shown in the past, that they will be equal to any emergency. The people are awake to their responsibility, and, in my opinion, the war will be prosecuted on lines that will not break in on the solidarity and organization of the labour classes, a solidarity which is being threatened so viciously at this hour. I believe we shall be able to maintain that solidarity and our independence, and yet show our willingness to participate in a war that has already covered us with glory and made the name of Australia memorable for all time to come. </para>

                        <para>. - This is an occasion on which every member of the Federal Parliament owes it to the country, to his party, his electors, and to himself to briefly give his reasons for the vote he intends to give. I should not, even if my severe cold would allow, go into such heroics as were indulged in this evening by a very ardent and genuine supporter of conscription. I do not think that it &#34;cuts any ice&#34; to find honorable senators, especially members of the same party, abusing their political colleagues on a question like this, which it is admitted leaves room for two opinions. Surely we have arrived at a stage now, at ail events we who belong to the great Labour party, when we may be content to give each other credit for the sincerity of our convictions. We should not have to put up with the taunt that we are hypocrites because we do not believe quite as others do, whose enthusiasm has run away with their discretion and common-sense for the time being. In my innocence this evening I made a mild interjection when <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> was speaking. I stated what is- an undeniable fact, when I said that the honorable senator&#39;s countrymen do not believe in conscription; but I brought down on my devoted head the wrath of that gentleman, who expressed an opinion to the effect that those who do not believe as he does are hypocrites. I regret that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> is not in his place when I am making these remarks. The honorable senator also said something about a shirker, but to what he referred I do. not know ; all I know is that during my thirteen years&#39; experience as a member of this House I have never shirked any issue here or in. the country. Perhaps I ought to have been in the chamber when <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> made some reference to the Irish question, but I was outside on other business; and I am not going to apologize to him for my absence, because I think that I can show quite as good a record as he can for attendance here. I propose to vote for the submission of this, perhaps the greatest of questions, to the people. I have ever been a believer in trusting the people; and I quite agree with the words of rather a favorite novelist of mine, who said that it is safe at all times and in all countries to trust the great heart of the people to reject the unworthy and accept the true. The great heart of the people may be, I think, trusted on this as on other questions. But I am met with the objection that this is not a true referendum. This objection has been voiced by some of my friends here, and I have nothing to say against their voicing it; but my reply is that if it is not a true referendum, it is an alternative. The ground of my friends&#39; objection is that the whole of the people are asked to vote on a question which affects only a small section of the people. There is a great deal in the argument; but what alternative is there? The question would have to go to the people sooner or later; and, in my honest opinion, the only alternative was the foisting of conscription on the country without any reference to them. There are men in this Parliament who have expressed the opinion that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes,</inline> immediately, he came back, should have introduced the compulsory system without submitting it to either Parliament or the people; and that was the only alternative to the referendum. The people could be consulted only by referendum or by an election, which might have taken a little longer, though not more than a few weeks or a couple of months; the main point is that the question must have gone to the people sooner or later. Although the proposed referendum may not be the democratic ideal, I would rather have it than have the people called upon to submit to a policy without any opportunity of expressing their opinions. The statements made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> and the Leader of the Liberal party in another place have led me to believe that they would have preferred the Government to have introduced a measure for compulsory military service without the taking of a referendum. </para>

                            <para>- Quite so. If the Government had decided not to take a referendum they would probably have had to resign, and the succeeding Government might have been formed with a majority in favour of conscription, because from the speeches which they have delivered I judged that there are some members of the Labour party who would be prepared to vote straight out for conscription. Such a measure would very likely have been rejected by the Senate, and this would have meant the coming into power of another Government, and the bringing into force of compulsory military service, without the submission of the question to the people. I believe that even those members of the Labour party who, with considerable force, contend that this is not a democratic referendum would prefer it to the forcing of compulsory military service upon the people without consulting them upon the matter at all. </para>

                            <para>- Their indorsement of the policy of participation in the war was confirmed by the people when they told them that they were prepared to do their best to continue the war to a successful issue. It is to me unthinkable that so violent a departure from the recognised policy of this country should be forced upon the people of Australia without asking them whether they approved of it or not. We stand to-day in danger of that departure, because if another Government were in power the leaders on the other side have told us that they favour the passing of a measure establishing compulsory military service without consultation with the people. Though my honorable friends opposite may consider that the right course to adopt, I do not on that account feel called upon to abuse them, because if there ever was a question before the country upon which every man should be permitted the free expression of his opinions without rendering himself liable to taunts and abuse, it is the question which we now have under consideration. Some very rash statements are being made on both sides. I add my meed of commendation to the great man who, in my view, is still the Leader of the Labour party. I grant to honorable members who disagree with <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> the right to express their opinion, but I still hold that he is a big man, and one of the biggest that Australia has ever produced. I do not see eye to eye with him on this question of conscription, but that does not detract from my estimate of his greatness and appreciation of the splendid services he has rendered to Australia. It distresses me, as one who has been associated with the Labour movement for many years, to find other good men who have done good work and made big sacrifices in the interests of the movement so ready to point the finger of scorn at <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> and to denounce him as a traitor. I am sorry that he should see the light as he does see it, because I think he is wrong, and I do not think that Australia will consent to conscription. I believe that we shall be able to do all that we can be expected to do without conscription. But if the Australian people decide at the referendum in favour of conscription, I shall bow to the expression of their will. </para>

                            <para>- I do. I have said that rash statements have been made by advocates of both sides of this question. Things have been said which had been better left unsaid in the interests of the great movement which has done so much for Australia in the past, and which, I am optimistic enough to believe, is destined to do even greater things in the future, in spite of the palpable split in the Labour party at the present time. When the people have given their verdict at the referendum, this split will soon be healed, and the great Labour movement will rise  Phoenix-like  from its ashes, and be stronger than ever. It will take more than such a breach as is now evident to prevent the growth of the Labour movement in Australia, though some men, who have been fighting during the whole of their lives for the movement, may bp. dropped out because of the breach. Only a few moments ago I read with considerable pain, that a great Labour organization, for which I have sincere respect, has suspended that grand old man of the Labour movement, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Spence,</inline> because he does not happen to agree with the majority of the executive of that organization. I do not know whether it is intended that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Spence</inline> shall be suspended temporarily, and that some wider tribunal shall be given an opportunity to consider his case, or that his services are to be finally dispensed with. Whatever the announcement may mean, let me say that, although the organization may dispense with the services of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Spence,</inline> they cannot efface the magnificent record he has left for Labour in Australia. The feeling of members of the organization on this question is intense, and I am satisfied that they believe that they are doing right i:i the action they have taken. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> feels intensely on the question also, and that, no doubt, explains why, when I made a perfectly innocent interjection during his speech, he poured out the vials of his wrath upon my head. </para>

I am going now to the other side, and I say that much as I admire that little bundle of nerves and energy, the Prime Minister, and the splendid work he has done, and though I still insist upon regarding him as the Leader of the Labour party in Australia, I assert that even he makes mistakes at times. Perhaps it is because he is carried away by his enthusiasm. </para>

We are all liable to make mistakes. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes,</inline> in speaking last night, made some rather strong allegations against those opposed to him, and he did the same when speaking in Sydney. We have also heard from the Minister for Defence, both in this Chamber and outside, allusions to German money in this country. It is only so much nonsense to talk about German money in this country as having anything to do with the formation of public opinion on the question of conscription. No doubt there is any amount of German. money which would be used, if it were possible to so use it, to win away the allegiance of Australians from their country. But will <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> or <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> contend for a moment that tha great body of objectors to conscription are being influenced by German money? Will they not candidly admit, on the contrary, that their objection to conscription arises from a sincere conviction that Australia has done well under voluntarism, and n desire to prevent the adoption of such a system as conscription in this young country? It would be a bad thing for Australia if we did not give to objectors to conscription the credit of being sincere in their convictions. What nonsense it is to talk about German  money and about foreign influence being at work. I am not speaking about a few Industrial Workers of the World, men who have no time for any party, and do not care much for any country. I believe they have said at </para>

                    <para class="block">Broken Hill that some men there are afraid to meet them in the dark chambers of the mines. When we remember that hundreds of men who have borne a great share of the work of the Labour movement in Australia are honestly opposed to conscription, it does not lay well in the mouths of our leaders to make these innuendoes against them. I believe that when they think calmly on this subject they will be rather sorry for the statements they have made. These innuendoes will not make converts for conscription, nor will some of the statements concerning the Prime Minister, made by those who are opposed to conscription, help the cause on the other side. Are we to suppose that there are no honest, patriotic, anti-conscriptionists in Australia? Surely a man may declare himself against conscription without being charged with a want of loyalty to his country. Surely there are patriots and honest men among the anti-conscriptionists as well as .among the conscriptionists. I think there are, and when the vote is taken on the 28th October. I feel sure that the majority in Australia, will prove themselves anti-conscriptionists. Nevertheless, they will be patriotic. I believe that the majority will vote in the negative, not because they are lacking in patriotism, and are not as anxious as any conscriptionist is to see this war brought to a successful termination, but because they think conscription is not the right way to do it. If Australia turns down this question, I anticipate &#39; that the question will be asked, &#34; What is Australia going to do?&#34; We shall also hear that she has been disgraced because she has refused to succour the men who have gone to the front. Altogether too much nonsense has been talked on that score. One gentleman on the public platform said he dreaded to think how Australia would be regarded by the world if the people of this country did not vote for conscription. I think that probably that gentleman will be sorry he made that remark, because Australia will not be so disgraced. Only statements of that kind can bring any discredit on Australia. If the question is turned down the people will continue to fight this war successfully under voluntarism, and Australia will stand as high, if not higher, in the opinion of the world than she does to-day. Surely there is room for two opinions on this matter of conscription. Let every man give every other man credit for the sincerity and honesty of his convictions. At a time like this, when the country is being torn asunder by the greatest question that ever faced the people, we have a right to expect that the great organs influencing public opinion - the daily newspapers of this country - will tell the truth and put the question fairly before the public, instead of trying to mislead them. If ever there was a time in our history when our newspapers should endeavour to be newspapers in fact as well as in name, that time is now. But are they? Let honorable senators look at the headlines in the <inline font-style="italic">Age,</inline> referring to the debate in another place on this Bill. &#34;Anticonscriptionists Routed,&#34; or something like that, appeared among the headlines, and then came the division in the House of Representatives, not on the question of conscription, but on the question of referring this issue to the people. I do not know whether it was done deliberately or not, but the effect of the <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> headlines was to make the people who do not have time to read the whole of the report believe that the principle of conscription had been agreed to by a large majority in the House of Representatives, when, as a matter of fact, the large majority shown on the division-list was in relation merely to the question of submitting the question to the people. Those who had time to read the report found that honorable member after honorable member was opposed to the principle of conscription, but as a Democrat could not go against his convictions by opposing the Referendum Bill. </para>

                            <para>- I do not know; but I do know that honorable members who spoke made their attitude perfectly clear. During this great crisis in our history the public have a right to expect the newspapers to serve up to them pure and undiluted news. Day after day garbled reports of the discussion on this subject are being published, and it seems to me that a deliberate attempt is being made to persuade the readers of the newspapers to believe that, because there is a big majority in favour of submitting the question to the people, there is a big majority of honorable members in favour of conscription. Of course, those who represent the newspapers in this Parliament know that the contrary is the case. </para>

                    <para class="block">It would be something gained, and the big newspapers :of this country would render a great service to the people, if they would furnish news in an impartial manner, because, after all, they can only mislead the people for a time. The public of Australia want to know what is being done,, and they want to know now, if never before, what every member of this Parliament thinks on this important subject. </para>

                            <para>- Well, I never expected anything from newspapers that are opposed to me in politics, because the proprietors run their businesses on party lines generally, and we have to take what we can get. But in relation to the matter now under discussion, I am speaking for the public of Australia, and I repeat that they are entitled to know what is being said in this Parliament. In justice to myself, and in justice to the people who sent me here, I could not allow this occasion to pass without giving my reason for voting as I intend to vote. I am going to support this Bill at every stage, because I believe in trusting the people, and unless something unforeseen at present looms on the horizon, I shall be found opposing conscription on the platform. I am quite prepared to take the consequences of my attitude. At all events, I will do what I think to be right in this great crisis. I am not going to be hypocritical, and I do not intend to say that any other man who disagrees with me is a hypocrite. Every man must be prepared to do what he believes to be right, and it is a pity that he cannot express his views without having- charges hurled at him by opponents on this momentous issue in the greatest crisis that has ever confronted the people of Australia. </para>

                        <para>- In the first place, I desire to extend my deepest sympathy to, and condolence with, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Story</inline> and his good wife and -family in the irreparable loss they have suffered by the death of their son, who recently paid the extreme penalty of his loyalty to King and country. It is incidents such as that which bring the stern realities of war home to the minds of every individual. I desire, also, to congratulate <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> on the lucid exposition of the true bearing of the measure which we are now considering. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch,</inline> too, made a very impassioned, clear, and logical speech, and his conclusions were difficult to escape from. I agree with the last  speaker  that a measure of such magnitude and of such moment, not only to the people of Australia, but to the Empire to which we are so justly proud to belong, ought to be debated without heat on either side. The question is too large for party recriminations or dissension at the present juncture. In the course of the debate the charge was made that I do not represent the people. I challenge the honorable senator who made that statement to find in the records of the Parliaments of which I have had the honour to be a member any vote of mine that has been cast against the interests of any section of the people of Australia. </para>

It only asks the sanction of the Senate to obtain an expression of opinion from the people of Australia as to what action Parliament shall take in the present crisis. I candidly admit that I would have preferred that the Government had taken the direct course of placing conscription on the statute-book. </para>

At the same time, I tell the Minister for Defence that the adoption of this policy of the referendum has given a greater impetus to anti-conscription than anything else that could have been done. Prior to that policy being announced by the Government, it was not possible to hold an anti-conscription meeting anywhere in Australia. </para>

                            <para>- That is not the position. When the Prime Minister returned to these shores after his visit to the Old Country, he brought with him the conviction that some measure must be adopted in Australia to get fresh forces to support the men who had gone forth to fight the battle of Australia on the plains of France. He told the people that he could see the light, and whither the light led he would follow. The people of Australia were behind him, and, had a popular vote been taken on that question immediately, 70 per cent, of the electors would have voted for conscription. What has altered the position ? The people are being told that the position at the front is not so urgent as they were led to believe when the Prime Minister returned. I ask those honorable senators, who know the facts as clearly as I dp, to admit that the position is not one whit the less serious to-day that when <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> landed from England. </para>

                            <para>- I do not care about the leading British statesmen. The honorable senator must know that not only is the position more intense, but the need for reinforcements is vital. We do not require the opinion of Lloyd George or anybody else when we have before us the long lists of casualties which are reaching Australia every day. There is no need to refer to any book or any statesman across the border. If the honorable senator will open his eyes to the meaning of those casualty lists he will realize that the men who are fighting his battle on, the plains .of Flanders are in urgent need of help. Does the honorable senator think that the Government introduced this proposal simply for the pleasure of sending men to Europe to fight? If I thought they were treating this matter so lightly that they would ask men to risk their lives unnecessarily, I should turn down this proposal at once. </para>

                            <para>- The Ministry have told us in unmistakable terms that the voluntary system has failed and that the crucial moment has arrived when some other steps must be taken, so that other men may be sent to the front. And though the taking of a referendum may be a little longer way round, it is the shortest way home, because it is the only means of getting the compulsory system introduced. I repeat that I would have preferred that a Conscription Bill had been placed on the statute-book straight away. </para>

                            <para>- Yes. I am prepared to sacrifice anything of which I am possessed if that step is necessary to win this war. And in any capacity in which I can serve personally I will readily go to the front. I am forced to these conclusions, not by the views of statesmen outside this Parliament, but by the statements of the men who are leading the Government. They are in a better position to know the exigencies of the situation than any private member of Parliament can possibly be, and I believe that they are perfectly sincere in what they are asking the Commonwealth to do. Therefore, I am supporting the Government in any measure they may choose to bring forward to prosecute this war, and to bring the Hun to his bearings at the earliest possible moment. </para>

                        <para>. - The situation is serious enough to make every man in .the Senate and every unit in the community give their best attention to the proposition which the Government propose to place before the people. Very many financial statements have been put forward during this debate, and honorable senators appear to be in the unfortunate position that they cannot get a definite statement on the real position. I, too, have been amongst the financiers, and I have some figures which, so far as I know, are accurate. The financial side of the question must be considered. Australia&#39;s effort cannot win this war, and the figures show that Australia has no need to worry on that score. But she has reason for worrying about something else. This is a young country, with a small population, and we have something to worry about besides the sending away of our manhood. I am not one of those who believe that all the fighting element has gone from the country yet. I believe that if every man was sent to the front the women would be in the fighting-line in the defence of the country. A week or so ago I tried to gel; from the Minister for Defence a statement of the actual cost of sending a soldier to the front, the best paid and best equipped mau in the fighting-line. My answer was that the honorable gentleman had not the information, but that the Treasurer was preparing a statement. I have read in the newspapers - and I think that the Prime Minister is the authority for the statement - that it costs this country 25s. a day to keep a man in the firing-line. We have now some 200,000 men at the front, and 72,000 in camp or on the water. Under the Prime Minister&#39;s scheme, we shall have 331,000 men to support at the end of March. Reducing the right honorable gentleman&#39;s estimate of cost by 5s., that means a prodigious expenditure. No one can say when the war will end. Should it end twelve months hence, we shall have our men on the pay-list for another twelve months at least. That will mean an expenditure of &#163;241,000,000, in addition to which we have already spent &#163;100,000,000. A debt of &#163;341,000,000 is a big one for a population of 5,000,000 to shoulder. We aTe paying 4i per cent, for money borrowed from persons who did not respond too well to the appeal, but if the Government paid only 4 per cent, on the sum that I have just mentioned, the country would have an interest debt of &#163;13,600,000 a year, a sum more than half the amount of its re- venue. It has yet to be shown to me that those who are working so assiduously to enforce conscription on this country are prepared to shoulder their share of the burden. We have given them the opportunity. The Treasurer said to those who own the wealth of the country, &#34; We need &#163;50,000,000 to finance the war,&#34; to feed the boys in the trenches for whom these persons shed so many crocodile tears ! The response to the appeal was &#163;23,000,000, or &#163;27,000,000 less than he asked for. What does talking avail in the face of this fact? When the proposal to conscript the manhood of the country is put before the people they will say, &#34; At the invitation of the last Government we sent away 20,000 men, who came forward within a few days. Then 50,000 were asked for,  sand  we sent them. Then the daily newspapers spoke of sending 100,000, never dreaming that such a force would be raised, and double that number was sent. A contract was made with those men.&#34; We have heard a great deal about regarding treaties as scraps of paper, and we must observe our contract. Some men were starved into enlisting. I know men who would not have dreamt of enlisting could they have got a job at home. It is not that they were not patriots, but they had responsibilities here. Australia said, &#34; We will pay these men decently, and those whom they leave, their wives and children, shall not want while the country has a shilling.&#34; But what has happened? </para>

                            <para>- Australia&#39;s men are sacrificing their lives without compensation. Why, then, should those who remain here in safety ask 4&#163; per cent, for money that is needed to finance the war? Australia said to the adventurous spirits who jumped into the firing line, &#34; We are making an agreement with you, which we expect to be kept to the letter.&#34; The men expect the country to do what we said she would do. My figures may be at fault, but I believe that I have under-estimated, rather than over-estimated, what the country will have to pay for this war, and it rests with those who are now agitating for the conscription of life to say what sacrifices they are prepared to make. I am not satisfied as to what they are prepared to do. So long as the printing presses of the country are permitted to circulate the views of its representatives, I shall have no complaint to make about the referendum, because I am satisfied, knowing the history of militarism and conscription, that the people will not vote in the affirmative. Australia has sent 300,000 men to a place 12,000 miles away from their own soil. Nothing like that has ever been attempted in history before. I have great regard for some of the institutions of Great Britain, and for the valour of the race from which we have sprung. But Great Britain, with a population of 45,000,000, never before&#34; this war sent abroad anything like so large an army as that which Australia is now sending. The other night, at the Town Hall, the Prime Minister said that we have placed a White Australia on the highest minaret of our ideals, and he asked, &#34;What happens?&#34; He said, &#34; Here are we, a white speck in a coloured ocean.&#34; That being so, Australia has certain responsibilities to consider before sending abroad the number for which the Government asks. She has to consider the position that she has maintained for the last twenty-five years. We cannot afford to let all our men leave the country, because we need some of them here. I believe that there are as many volunteering for military service abroad as  Ave  may reasonably be expected to send away, and as many as the people of Great Britain expect us to send. It is nonsense to say that we are leaving our men to die in the trenches unsupported. </para>

                            <para>- It is a strange thing that they have not been asked - that the request for more men has come to us only. Why has it come? Did someone ask that it might be sent? We are asked to send 32,500 men away this month, and 16,500 away every succeeding month for an indefinite period. We are told that this must continue until next March, but we have no guarantee that the war will end then. Thus the contribution of men is to continue indefinitely. No citizen of Australia would consent to leaving our soldiers to die in the trenches, but at some time or another Australia must cry &#34; enough.&#34; It is not that there are not sufficient men in the Allied armies to win the war. The populations of the countries with which we are at war are these : Germany, 65,000,000 ; Austria, 52,000,000 ; Bulgaria, 4,250,000; and Turkey, 21,000,000; and their armies number.: Germany, 11,000,000 ; Austria, 6,000,000 ; Bulgaria, 1,000,000; and Turkey, 3,000,000. Thus a combined population of 142,500,000 supports an army of 21,000,000. The population of Great Britain is 46,000,000; that of France, 40,000,000; of Russia, 170,000,000; of Italy, 35,000,000 ; of Roumania, 7,500,000 ; of Servia, 4,500,000; and of Belgium, 7,500,000, the strength of their respective armies being: Great Britain 5,000,000; France, 5,000,000; Russia, 17,000,000; Italy, 3,000,000; Roumania, 500,000; Servia, 500,000 ; and Belgium, 1,000,000 ; or 32,000,000 altogether. These people are fighting on their own soil, yet we are expected to send 12,000 miles across the sea the few men that we can muster from our small population. </para>

                            <para>- Every man there is fighting on his own doorstep. A man who would not put up the fight of his life, and be found dead there before he would permit any violation of his home, would not be of much account. I do not care what opinion may be held by any person who is an opponent of mine on the question, I shall never charge him with being a traitor, or impugn the honesty of his motives, because I know the effect of such language, I know how intensely many people feel on a question such as this, I know how easy it would be to play on their feelings, and how easy it would be for  them  in turn to play on the feelings of the audiences they happened to be addressing. I am an Australian, and I have very high ideals as to Australia&#39;s future. Because of the class of people who have pioneered this continent we have advantages which no other country has had, and possibilities not possessed by any other country. I want to see them realized. When a country is at war under conditions such as I pictured a few moments &#34;ago - where homes are violated - every man should be in the firing line, but Australia is in a different position from that of other countries engaged in this war. They can do things that we cannot do. We have a young country that needs development, and has higher ideals than any other land. It has done quite a lot towards the realization of them, but we cannot burden it with a debt such as I have mentioned, or send our men out of the country if we seek to further realize them. So far as I can gather, military experts say that no nation can put into the firing line on their own soil more than 10 per cent, of its population. By supplying 331,000 soldiers Australia is putting 6^ per cent, of her population into a firing line which is 12,000 miles from her own soil, and yet we are told that she has not done enough, and that we are not patriotic. According to experts, Great Britain cannot send anything like 10 per cent, of her population to fight in another country. </para>

                            <para>- Lincoln had to deal with a new country that was populated by the single men of Europe, who had to cross the ocean in order to get the crust that they could not get in the older world. There were ten men for every woman, so that it was no great trouble to put into the firing line a greater proportion than would be possible in normal times in any country. Feeling runs high on an occasion of this kind, but I resent the imputation that any man in Australia is desirous of becoming a slave. I believe that there is nothing crawling or living in the shape of humanity in this country but would fight to the death for it. It is because of that sentiment, and because of the breed of our people, that our troops have been able to put up so splendid a fight on the fields of battle. I have read that men of Kitchener&#39;s army had to be taken from the slums of London, and various other places where they were recruited, put into military camps and fed for six months before they were fit to fight. They were not lacking in spirit, but they were in stamina and physique. That cannot be said of Australians. It is easy to understand how our men have done so well on the battlefields of Gallipoli and France, so well, in fact, that every soldier is prepared to salute an Australian in recognition of the fine service they have rendered. It is because they are the progeny of the bolder spirits who left the older countries, where the conditions of living were so bad that they could not get a decent living, and, like <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch,</inline> came to a land where the opportunities were greater. Such men and women have raised a race of people equal to any on earth. Many honorable senators stand by the Bill because the referendum has been in the platform of the Labour party for quite a number of years. Their position is not sound. Let us examine the matter for a moment, and consider some of the objections that can be offered to this proposal. The people of Australia are to be asked whether they are prepared to give the Government the power to call up the men of this country and send them where they choose. Who are to have the votes? I shall have a vote, but I shall not be going to the front, as I am oyer the age. There are thousands of people in Australia who have not a million to one chance of going to the front, yet they will have a vote as to whether some one else shall go. A referendum affecting a matter on which every one has the same chance may be a fair proposition, but I do not believe in a referendum where some who will vote will not have a million to one chance of being affected by it. I am not concerned about the question going to the people, because I do not believe that the people will tolerate it for a moment. </para>

At the same time, I believe it is safer in the hands of the people than anywhere else. I have no fear as to what the people are going to say, because, when the patriots among the ranks of those who have been politically opposed to me find out the bill they will be called upon to pay if the referendum is carried, there will be an end to their patriotism, and they will not give their vote to send any one to the other end of the world.

                    <para class="block">That statement should give comfort to the hearts of many people. Yet we have men hysterically in favour of sending 32,500 nien this month, and quite a number of thousands every succeeding month. I do not like to speak bitterly on occasions of this sort, because I know that the hearts of most men and women are stirred upon this question; but I suspect a conspiracy under the whole thing. Otherwise, what would have happened? We have already sent 300,000 men out of a population of 5,000,000, and men are still going. Possibly by the time the war is finished we shall have our full tenth, or 500,000, in the firing line. In the face of that fact it is absurd to tell us that we are not doing our share. Our men are putting up their fight all the time, and doing all that can be expected of them; but that cannot be said of the patriotic people who hold the cash-bags of this country. When we asked them for &#163;50,000,000 we got &#163;23,000,000. So far the  country  has carried out the agreement to pay the soldiers&#39; wages, and separation and other allowances, but the Government have not shown the Senate how they are going to continue doing it. The responsibility rests on this Parliament of standing by the men to whom the pledges have been made. In older countries, it is possible to supplant the ordinary male worker or mechanic with woman or child labour, or perhaps with old men. Australia, being a young country, does not lend itself to that. Its industries are vast and, in many cases, primary and unfit for women. Capitalists have shown us in the past some places where work can be carried on by woman labour. Mildura is an instance. There, as in France, the women and children in years gone by did the work of gathering the harvest, but organized labour said that was not a job that women ought to do, and now men are doing it, and when women are employed they get the same rate of pay as men. This is a country of tremendous possibilities, and may be able to take on tremendous financial burdens, but only while the men are here to do the work. We have three or four outstanding activities from which we expect to get our money - the pastoral industry, which cannot be carried on by women or children, wheat farming, butter producing, and mining. These cannot possibly be carried on by women, nor has Australia any desire for it. Women cannot do the work in the meat industry, in which large financial interests are involved. Up to March next, under the Government proposal, we shall have sent away 330,000 men. If the war is not over by then the Government cannot possibly stop recruiting. If they go on sending 16,500 per month they will have recruited by the end of next year just on 500,000, including the men who have already gone. Australia cannot afford to lose so many men. There is, and ought to be, no need for it. Of course, if I were General Haig, I would want as much as I could get of the fine fighting material sent from Australia, but the British and their Allies can hold their own, man for man, with the enemy, and as they have three men for every two on the other side, there is no necessity to get more men from Australia. No one who knows anything of the history of the war would charge Australia with not doing its duty. If the British Government were told to-morrow that Australia was going to send no more men I do not believe they would .cavil at it, nor should they. When the war began, the British Government never dreamt they were going to get so many men from us, or men of such quality, but they got them, and we have done our part. I have no fear that Germany will win the war or overrun Australia. I am as confident the Allies will win the war as I am that the people of Australia will turn down the referendum. They will be wise to do so. The reasons I have given are ample, and if the people can get to know them there will be no doubt as to the result of the vote. The Labour party, which it has taken a quarter of a century to build up, consists of the important people of this country - the men who do the hard work and make its wealth. They are the most patriotic of our citizens, and value Australia because they enjoy a freedom which no other people have. Organization has brought that about. Our people were, perhaps, ignorant, but some of them desired something better, believing that in a new and rich country it should be possible for a young community to blaze a track that the rest of the world could follow. They set about organizing for it, and did it. They built up certain machinery that is irksome to some people to-day. I am speaking for the movement to-night, in the only way in which it can be heard, because it does not monopolize the press of Australia, and can speak only through its conferences. It has spoken there unmistakably on this question continuously and consistently during the last eighteen months. Possibly it has not been told everything. Of course, nothing should be made known that would be of value to the enemy, but my experience as an organizer of labour is that the greatest safeguard a man can possibly have if he is handling men is to have them absolutely in his confidence all the time. That has not been done. The Government have not used their opportunities to put before organized labour facts that they should have put before it, but I make allowances for them ; in fact, I have been continuously defending the Government outside for the things they have not done that they ought to have done, because I knew they had a lot of trouble. After a quarter of a century&#39;s work, it seems to me that something serious is going to happen to the Labour movement, from which it will take many years to recover. The only class who have proved their patriotism are the working people, the real patriots. Those who control the great newspapers, and almost every other avenue of articulation, who own the wealth and prate about their patriotism, when it comes to financing the fight do the same as that class have always done. They have always expected the workers to do the fighting and come back with wooden legs, and after the fight was won to pay the debt incurred. People who ought to be ashamed of themselves are doing the same thing in Australia now. Our people have done their share of the fighting. They have gone to the front unhesitatingly; but the people who prate about putting up the money to pay the piper have not done so when it has come to the pinch. These things are obvious. You may fool older or more ignorant people, but you cannot fool the people of Australia, because they  are at least decently educated, and can run up a column of figures or figure out a balance-sheet. By referring to the Commonwealth <inline font-style="italic">Year-Book</inline> they can readily ascertain what is the production of Australia from year to year, and where it goes, and they know that they are not getting what they ought to get out of it. They are expected to go 12,000 miles away from home to do the fighting, and on their return to pay the cost of the war. The element that has exploited the working classes of every country is out to do the same in Australia. The people who comprise it are not fools. They know how to play the game of getting all they can out of the people. I read not long ago of a member of the British nobility who, on returning from a visit to America, said to some of his friends, &#34; America is the place in Which to invest your money. The people work like beavers. They create tremendous wealth, and you can easily invest your money there.&#34; The people who have done that in Australia have played a game with the Labour party. Knowing that our party had come into office after the outbreak of war, that it had the confidence of the people, and that it would retain it for years unless something were done to destroy it, they cast about for a means of <inline font-style="italic">doing so.</inline> They commenced by praising some of our people to such an extend that at last they lost their heads. They knew how to play the game, and they played it successfully. The only salvation for the Labour movement rests not with the people inside this Parliament, but with those who belong to our party outside. Our people outside know what is going on. We who are the privileged ones, and who occupy what are considered some of the great positions in this country, secured those positions only because we had done some of the work necessary to -create an organization capable of returning men to Parliament. And we ought to be here to speak for the people who put us here. We cannot claim that we alone know how to legislate for this country, and that those who belong to the </para>
                    <para class="block">Trades Hall and other Labour movements outside do not. There are many people in the Labour movement outside this Parliament who are just as well qualified as we are to legislate for, and to look after, the interests of this country. Our political opponents believed that it was impossible to cause a split in the Labour party until this thing came along. They had to make the best possible use of the opportunity, for they had no other hope of getting into power again. There now seems to be a chance of their coming into power. They have played their game so well that such a possibility is within striking distance. It therefore devolves upon the Labour party of this Parliament to join the Labour units outside in defeating our political opponents in the object they have in view. There are tremendous possibilities. It is now some two years ago since I said to some eminent men in our party, &#34; The people of Australia can never be safe until the Constitution clearly and distinctly declares what shall be the franchise of Australia.&#34; The Constitution does not do so at the present time, and so long as it is possible to shift our party and to return another to power, there is always the possibility of gerrymandering in the Federal electorates. Gerrymandering is going on in connexion with the Victorian State electorates, so that the Progressive party can be kept out of power in the State Legislature for practically all time. I have warned my people of this danger, and we ought to be in a position to give some attention to it. Whatever comes of this apparent rupture in the Labour movement, our organizations outside will be more strongly cemented together as the result of it than perhaps many people imagine. There is one other point to which I should like to refer. The Leader of the Opposition to-day taunted some honorable senators with not having done as much as they ought to have done to help the recruiting movement. The position is a most peculiar one in which to place any man. I have never said one word, good, bad, or indifferent, to influence any man to go to the front. I have never taken the platform for that purpose, nor do I intend to do so. I have been asked to address recruiting meetings, but have declined, and when asked for my reasons have said, &#34; I have never been any good at offering to hold another man&#39;s coat while he goes into the fight. </para>
                    <para class="block">I am not going to the front, and I have no sons who can go. That being so, I will not go on any platform to ask another man to enlist or to send his sons to the front.&#34; That is a fair position to take up. A man who takes up that attitude is not open to the gibe that because he will not go on a public platform to urge others to go where he is not going, and where he has no one to send, he is not helping his country as he should do. The man or woman who has a son who has gone to the front has a legitimate right to advise others to go; but I do not, and will not believe that I, who have not been to the front, who do not intend to go, and who have no sons there, have any right to ask any man or woman to send their boys. The daily papers of Australia convey to the people day after day news of all that is happening at the front. Our people outside are able to read of what is going on, and so can consider the position just as well as we can. I therefore am not going to take the responsibility of advising them in the circumstances I have just indicated. These, then, are the reasons why I have never been on a recruiting platform. During this campaign, I am giving my wholehearted support to the anti-conscription movement. I have already said that I do not think it is fair to ask the people to vote at a. referendum on a question of this character. I shall be out in the country, and shall be pretty busy working against the conscription of the manhood, of Australia. We have had experience even in Australia, with a Labour Government in power, of what the military authorities will do. Even under the most Democratic Government that has ever controlled the affairs of this country we have had experience of what may be done by the military. We members of Parliament know that there are a thousand and one things that may happen without the knowledge of the Minister for Defence. I have had brought under my notice cases of oppression and of actions on the part of the military authorities that are far removed from what I would call &#34; a square deal.&#34; Generally speaking, military men, like the rest of us, are not bad fellows; but it is very dangerous to put unlimited power into the hands of a Government, and particularly into the hands of the military class. We have been told during this debate that the meaning of this proposal is as the Prime Minister has said, that conscription shall be . for the duration of the war, and shall relate only to military service. That sounds pretty good. It is all very well for the Prime Minister to say that it will apply only to single men; but he cannot truthfully make that statement. It conflicts with the statement of the Minister for Defence that, according to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Knibbs,</inline> there are in Australia 1,520,000 single men .who can be called up for military service. We have not been told when that estimate was compiled by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Knibbs.</inline> I am assuming that it was compiled as the result of the war census cards which went out twelve months ago. It must not be forgotten that since then thousands of these men have volunteered, that some are already at the front, and that others are in camp. Notwithstanding this, we are led to believe that although by March next we are to recruit 160,000 men, only single men will be called up. It has been said, and said truly, I believe, that before the end of the year the supply of single men under conscription would be exhausted, and that it would then be necessary to call up the married men. I wish to push that point a bit further by showing that if this referendum proposal be carried it will put into the hands of the Government all the powers with respect to service abroad that they now have under the Defence Act to call up men for home defence. The proposal applies not only to men between twenty-one and forty-four years of age, but to all men between eighteen and sixty years of age. If the Government are truthful, they should tell the people, when we are fighting this referendum question, that not only will the single men be called up, but that it will be open to the authorities to call up all men between eighteen and sixty years of age. They should say, as an honorable senator on the Opposition bench has admitted, that &#34; every man from eighteen to sixty years of age will be liable to be called up if this Bill be carried.&#34; The honorable senator in question went further, I believe, and said that men up to eighty years of age should, if necessary, be called up. That was a fair and square statement to make. It enables the people to understand what they are being asked to do. If the war lasts another twelve months where shall we be? We shall have the authorities calling up 16,500 men a month until we have exhausted not only the supply of eligible men between twenty-one years and forty-four years of age, but all men from eighteen to sixty years of age, whether married or single. Is it not fair that that fact should be conveyed to the people ? The Government, however, despite the joke that they are trying to put up on the people by asserting that this power will be used only to call up single men between twenty-one and forty-four years of age, have not a dog&#39;s chance of carrying the referendum. People will not tolerate conscription. Like other honorable senators, I travel around the country a good deal, and in doing so meet quite a number of people who do not necessarily belong to the political party of which I am a member. I hear so many statements made about this proposal that I am satisfied that the Government might as well give it up at once, instead of wasting their time and their energy in trying to carry it. The question involved is so important and so serious that I sincerely hope that it will not give rise to any particularly bitter feeling. The people of Australia desire to know the facts, and, so far as I am capable, I shall lay the facts before them as clearly as possible, with no object or desire other than to do what is best and absolutely necessary for the good of the country. I have been very interested in this debate, and I think that the people of Australia expect their representatives here to definitely take one side or other of the fence in this fight. I have no doubt that every honorable senator earnestly believes what he has been advocating, and will do his best our side  to translate that belief into action. That, at any rate, is what I intend to do ; and, as a result, I believe that on the 28th October the vote will be in accord with the principles I advocate. This referendum is not quite the same as an ordinary election. There will be no candidates, and, consequently, no authority to appoint scrutineers ; but I hope that, before Parliament adjourns, the Government will make the matter sure by bringing down regulations that will remove any doubts we may have on this score. </para>

                        <para>. - I intend to be brief, if it is only out of consideration for you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. President,</inline> in your dreary vigil, for the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> staff, in their weary laborious work, and for the pressmen and the attendants in this building. For my part, I see no necessity for this all night&#39;s sitting; and, to me, this appears a cranky way of doing business. It is idle to expect honorable senators to be as clearheaded and alert at this hour in the morning as they ought to be, and as they would be if they were considering this great national issue during ordinary working hours. It is by no means fair to impose this task on us, seeing that there are other days and other hours in which we could have dealt with the business with better effect. Perhaps the easiest lot of all has been that of honorable senators, who suffer merely from want of rest, with the prospect of a long journey to our homes, if we are lucky enough to <inline font-style="italic">set</inline> away this week. I should not have spoken under the circumstances, but for the fact that this mav possibly be my last opportunity before the referendum to voice my opinions; and the issue before us is so important that honorable senators feel it to be their duty to tell the people, whose servants they are, on which side they stand. This is a great crisis ; and I regret most profoundly that a Government designated Labour should, on this issue, throw the onus, and likewise the odium, on the great party to which I belong. This proposal should not have been introduced in the way in which it has been. After all, it is a subterfuge - the thin edge of the wedge for the introduction of something which the Government were not game enough to bring directly before this Chamber, and which neither the Labour party, nor the majority of the Chamber, would accept. I am surprised, under the circumstances, that there is a majority of this party prepared to submit this proposition to the people. . An overwhelming majority of the party have declared that the principle of conscription is absolutely wrong - damnably wrong in nature and damnable in effect- and what right have they to ask the people to take an opportunity to do that which they themselves consider wrong and iniquitous ? </para>

                            <para>- Yes, they agreed by a very narrow majority to submit the referendum to the people. I never thought to live to see the day - and I have been associated with the movement ever since I served my apprenticeship as compositor - when a Labour Government would take the risk of crashing the party on to the rocks as they are doing by means of this measure. It must be intolerable and vexatious to those who have devoted money and effort to the interests of the party, and who have placed us here, to find their representatives, after the movement has captured the National Parliament in both Houses, commencing to tear down the edifice which it has taken so many years to build. Old warriors in the movement who have erected fine monuments to themselves, have, in one dreadful and fatal hour placed bombs under those monuments ; and their names will be known, not as before, but ignominiously known, as those of men who have led the party into the present position. Surely those who placed the party in power should have received more consideration - should not have had their hearts torn in such a crisis. It is a crisis which has drenched Australia in tears just as the blood of our heroes drenched Gallipoli. We should not have asked the people to do the impossible, and to do it by such coercive means. The Prime Minister went home to the Old Country on a certain mission, which is known to members of the party, but which cannot be divulged ; and it would appear that while away he imbibed Germanic germs of Prussianism which sent him back a different man. Honorable senators have heard quoted the Prime Minister&#39;s words of last June, when he declared that he would never be a party to sending a man out of Australia to fight against his own free will. The right honorable gentleman has declared that he &#34; sees the light,&#34; but he will find on the 28th October that it is not a beacon light, but a veritable will-o&#39;-the-wisp which has led him and his party into the political bog. We never thought, when the Prime Minister was doing good work in the early stages of his visit, and when he made the very fabric of Great Britain tremble at his words, that he would come back a changed man, and ask us in effect to undo our efforts of the past. I am surprised to have heard from members of this Chamber, and particularly from the Opposition in both Houses, from the press, and even, I am sorry to say from some members of our own party that, in their opinion, the referendum is a democratic proceeding. It is true that it is supposed to be a democratic means of getting an expression of opinion; but it is being used to attain an undemocratic end. This instrument of Democracy was never intended to be used in such a way and in such circumstances. Both conscription and the taking of a referendum on the question of conscription are essentially undemocratic. Can it be democratic to take men from the bosoms of their families? Can it be democratic to send a man away to fight who has no stomach to fight? <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch,</inline> in his lynch-law speech this morning, spoke of men who are not standing at their posts but leaning against them. I would sooner do without such men than have them in my way in a trench, or in any part of the firing line. If soldiers are not sufficiently animated by the spirit of patriotism to voluntarily offer their services in the defence of their country, they are not worth having. Our  volunteer Australian soldiers have written the name of Australia in letters of blood across the history of the war at Gallipoli and in France. Conscripts would never have exhibited the spirit and daring &#39; with which they turned out of the boats and stormed the cliffs at Gab a Tepe. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch,</inline> in this connexion, coupled the name of Eureka with conscription. The men who defended the Stockade at Eureka were amongst the most sterling Democrats Australia has ever seen. I regard the honor able senator&#39;s attempt to justify conscription -by a specious argument upon the action of the men at Eureka as tantamount to blasphemy. The men of Eureka, because they loved liberty and hated oppression, took up the gun against constituted authority, and struck the first blow for the constitutional liberty which we enjoy to-day, and which a Labour Government now dares to attempt to destroy. They will find that throughout Australia the spirit of Eureka still lives, and the Government and those associated with them in this dastardly thing will be discredited now and for ever more. </para>

                            <para>- During the Boxer rising the German force that went to China was a volunteer and not a conscript force. The French and Italians who landed at Salonika were men who had been conscripted, but who had to be asked to volunteer to j;o before they were taken to the Balkans to join other allied forces there. Yet it is proposed that we in Australia should do that which even conscript nations will not do. Why should we do it? </para>

                            <para>- I hope that they will soon be in Berlin with the other allied troops around them. This time last year there were dark days and dismal faces throughout this and other lands. What is the position to-day? Germany and Austria are being squeezed, and we are gradually, but surely, closing the jaws of the vice upon them. We were doing good business before this proposal was made. There had been a splendid response to the demand for volunteers, and the very cream of the manhood of Australia were enlisting. This cry for. conscription, due to a conspiracy of the press and politicians, has damped the enthusiasm of our people, and voluntary recruiting has slackened off. The private profiteer, the food exploiter, and the rent tracker have all done their bit to the detriment of recruiting. Only in to-day&#39;s newspapers honorable senators may see that the Prime Minister has considered it necessary to take some action to curb the rapacity of landlords in Australia. These patriots cheer our troops as they pass along the street, while making it hard and ever harder for the mothers, wives, and little kiddies of the good men and true who are away in the fighting line. Men, knowing that this kind of thing is going on, and is permitted to continue, stop and think when they are told that their country needs them. We are told that conscription is democratic, and are invited to admire the beautiful picture of the rich man and the poor man fighting side by side for their country. Many rich men will be in a position to avoid conscription if they can find a doctor base enough to assist them in their desire. The poor man cannot do anything of  the  kind. There are noble and honorable men in the medical profession, and some have already given up their lives in this war, but we know also that there are black sheep in every fold. There are honorable contractors and commissariat officers, but from time to time we have reports of cases in our Courts of men being punished for robbing their country in the time of its need. We are told that conscription is democratic, that under it rich and poor will be fighting side by side in the trenches, and that it insures equality of sacrifice. Let us consider this.. The poor working-class soldier is shot in action. What is there for his family. A pension, certainly, and the most generous soldier&#39;s pension in the world, yet, when compared with his wages, dependence on the pension must involve a different mode of living for the family the soldier has left behind. Take now the case of the rich man killed in the trenches.  His  insurances, banking account, and estate stand to his family. They may still live in luxury, whilst the family of the worker killed in action must live in comparative penury. There is nothing democratic, and there is no equality of sacrifice, in such a condition of affairs. Let me remind honorable senators that Australia has done wonderful work in the number of troops she has sent to the front. As it may not be generally known, let me state that more men have been sent over a longer distance from Australia than Great Britain ever at any time sent to any part of the world. I doubt whether the achievements of Australia in this direction have been approached by any other country in the world. Military experts say that 10 per cent, is the proportion of a population that can be safely sent out of a country, and, even then, in the case of men fighting on or near the territory of that  country. We have sent 6&#163; per cent. away. Great Britain and her Allies,  with  the single exception of Australia, have sufficient men in their own lands to defend them. Under this proposal of the Government, if carried into effect, Australia will be left practically defenceless. It is like pouring claret into -a vat with the plug out. We are going to drain this country of her manhood and leave her defenceless and open to the invader, and that peril is well known to members of this Parliament. Conscription is a question upon which a referendum should not be taken; because human life is sacred, and the question involved is one of conscience. .There are many thousands of people in Australia who, because of their religious belief, cannot, and will not, go to war. Amongst these are the Quakers. Under this principle of militarism, thirty Quakers in England, who objected to be thrown into the firing line, were sentenced .to death, and it was not until an agitation was got up for their reprieve that their sentence was altered to one of ten years&#39; penal servitude. </para>

                            <para>- Seventeen other men, who were conscientious objectors, were taken across by a press gang and placed in the hottest part of the firing line in France. We have Quakers in Australia, and a member of the Government recently received a deputation from Christadelphians, who told him that it  was against their faith to fight, and that they would sooner be placed against a gaol wall and be shot than go to the front. I saw a letter in the <inline font-style="italic">Evening Echo,</inline> of Ballarat, a few days ago concerning a member of the Church of Christ in England who was in prison because he was a conscientious objector, and because his faith forbade him to do what was desired of him. </para>

                            <para>- I remind honorable senators of the recent military raids on the Trades Hall and the office of the <inline font-style="italic">Labour Gall.</inline> The military went in  a  motor car, and I am surprised that it was not an armoured car, to secure <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Holloway,</inline> the Assistant Secretary of the Trades Hall. They went to his home in the dead of night and conscripted him. They broke their way in, and I suppose that if it had been necessary a battery of artillery would have been called upon for the purpose. He had to hand over a few harmless pamphlets. I may say that it is probable that those pamphlets secured a wider publicity as a result of the raid than they would otherwise have had. So much attention was directed to them that those which were issued have been handed round from house to house so many times that it is now scarcely possible to read them. I wish, even at this late hour, the Government would withdraw the proclamation until they ascertain what the result of the referendum will be. The incident of the Eureka Stockade was mentioned by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> and other honorable senators, and I point out that if this Bill is carried the events preceding Eureka will be repeated, for there will be a hunting for the men as vigorous as was the hunt for diggers. </para>

                            <para>- That may not be a very picturesque term, but it is expressive, and the inference is that he regards the workers as vermin, much iu the same way as <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Frank</inline> Madden, who referred to the workers as &#34;greybacks.&#34; Possibly he is an authority on that class of vermin, and knows what he is talking about. The possibilities of this campaign are many, but for my part I am not going to say or do anything that will offend any man. I feel confident that those who are supporting this proposal will get the shock of their lives on 28th October. Honorable gentlemen sitting in opposition here know quite well that, whilst in this Parliament they stand with the Government for conscription, their own forces are divided on this question throughout the length and breadth of Australia. Earnest thought and attention are being given to this subject by the people, and I am sure they will do the correct thing when the opportunity arises. There will be many recriminations during the campaign, and possibly much abuse and much criticism of a damning and damaging nature concerning the Prime Minister. But I am out to fight something bigger than the Prime Minister and those associated with him. I am out for the principles of Labour against conscription, because that, in my opinion, will open the way to cheap labour. Go down to Hugh V. McKay&#39;s works, and you will find a woman at a lathe there, at 24s. per week, doing work which up till recently was done by a man getting &#163;3 4s. per week, the union standard wage for that class of work. I believe that in some other foundries also similar work is being done by women. I might also remind honorable senators that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Staughton,</inline> at the meeting of shareholders of the Austral Hat Mills Company recently, pleaded for the introduction of Chinese and Japanese labour. We know how clerks are being told already to get out of their positions to go to the front, and that women will take their places. In a part of your own State, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. President,</inline> there is a band of 800 women on a recruiting committee. I give them every credit for the work they are doing in the interests of their country by endeavouring to show the young men their duty. But that is only part of the story. They are pledged that, whenever a man goes from a factory, if they are wanted, they will step into his place, so they are endeavouring tr&#62; get a week&#39;s training in other factories in advance. We have also read that women are boundary riding on <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Faulkner&#39;s</inline> estate on the other side of the Murray, and recently there was an agitation in Queensland for the return of the kanaka. </para>

I give them every credit for that opinion, but I take the view that the people should not be  asked to do that. I can only hope that even now, after the reasoned and seasoned speeches of so many members of this Chamber, those who have taken a stand in favour of the Bill going to the country will reconsider their decision, because it will have the effect of foisting the iniquitous system of conscription upon this Commonwealth. </para>

                        <para>. - It is scarcely possible to say anything new on this question after all the discussion that has taken place during the last two weeks. Before going further, I want to remind <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McKissock</inline> that, notwithstanding the picture he painted of the horrors that would befall this country under compulsory military service, the very same horrors would have befallen it under the voluntary system, .because, if all the eligible and fit men had departed, the way would have been open then, as he says it will be under conscription,  for black labour. But I am not afraid of the introduction of black labour. I cannot be afraid whilst every man and every woman in this community has the right to go to the ballot-box and record a vote. Not a single individual in the Commonwealth would ever see the inside of this Chamber, as a politician, if he ventured to go on the platform to advocate the introduction of cheap black labour, so we may put that aspect of the question at the back of our minds at once. I want to approach this subject without any feeling and without exciting myself, and, I hope, without hurting any one who may disagree with me. I regret to know that that attitude has already been departed from, not so much in this Chamber as in another place, and not so much in Parliament as outside. Some opponents of the measure are already indulging in language that is neither becoming nor proper. I deplore exceedingly the fact that the Prime Minister has been subjected to so much abuse. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> recently returned from the other side of the world-, and, having been admitted into the counsels, not only of Great Britain, but of the allied nations, he must know more of the perils of this war to the Empire than any other man in the Southern Hemisphere. To me it is unthinkable that a gentleman whom we all know so well, and who, all his life, has been in the forefront of the Labour movement, should, for some ulterior motive, cast aside the views he has held for so many years, and go into the opposite political camp. I believe nothing of the kind could occur. I regard the Prime Minister as one of the most earnest men in this Commonwealth, and I am convinced that from his very soul he is satisfied that he is doing what is right in the interests of Australia and the Labour movement. If honorable senators have any intention of denouncing the Prime Minister on the platform, I hope they will remember his splendid record, and the fact also that lie had no reason to return to Australia and face the great task he has undertaken. Every avenue of distinction and usefulness in the old land was open to him; he could select what career he chose. But, in his own words, he returned to fight out this battle in the country that had made him what he is. Therefore, when we are on the platform, whether we believe in compulsory service or not, we should remember the earnestness of our leader, the position in which he finds himself, and the distinguished service he has rendered to Australia in the past. If we do that, we shall be able to eliminate the Prime Minister from the discussion when we are before the people. We must not forget, too, that this Bill is the product of the Government. Let us avoid denunciation of the Government, and particularly of the Prime Minister, for, God knows, his path is thorny enough at the present time, and if he cannot get fair play from his friends, he will be in a sad plight. Whilst I have every respect for the opinion of those gentlemen who differ from me, and who believe that this issue ought not to be placed before the people, I am firmly convinced that no question ever submitted to the people, or to any Australian Parliament, should more properly have gone to the people than the momentous issue which we are now discussing. As a member of the Labour party I advocated the referendum on every platform from which I spoke when seeking the suffrages of the people. What would be my position if now I stood here and told the people that this question should not be submitted to them. I should be belittling myself in the eyes of those who elected me, and doing something damaging to my reputation and the party to which I belong. This question is being properly submitted to the people. The Government have no right to impose compulsory service on them unless the electors themselves are willing, particularly in a democratic community. Moreover, in placing this issue before the people for settlement, we are setting an example to the whole world. Some senators have found fault with the methods adopted to secure volunteers, and have said that, had not this or that thing happened, we should have obtained abundant recruits. Speaking only for South Australia, I am in a position to say that everything man could do was done in that State in the interest of voluntarism. I ana several colleagues and members of the Liberal party spent weeks in travelling through the country, and addressing recruiting meetings in the City. I am sure that we did all that was possible to point out to those men who were eligible for service that it was their duty to go, and in simple and clear language we pointed out that, unless they voluntarily discharged their responsibility in this war, conscription must inevitably come. I remember that, throughout the last recruiting tour, T was met everywhere with this question, &#34; What is the use of coming here and wasting time ? Why not introduce conscription, and have done with your worries? I will not volunteer until so and so goes, and he will not go&#39; until he is compelled to do so. When he goes I shall go.&#34; Thus we were invited by those who would he the first to be conscripted to introduce compulsory service. Therefore, my conscience is perfectly clear. Wherever I had the opportunity I told the people of South Australia that I would do my best to see that this war was brought to a successful issue, and that those who were eligible to go must go. Every fit man in the community within military age, every man who claims the protection of the laws of the country and claims as a right whatever liberties and freedom he may enjoy in our Democratic Australia, has a duty to defend those liberties and freedom, if necessary with his life. I wish to say a word in regard to the industrial organizations which are opposed to conscription. I have no intention of flouting those bodies or the men who conduct them; I have no quarrel with them. In some of the States they have done things which they ought not to have done, for if there are in this community any men who should not be shackled they are members of this Parliament. I think a mistake has been made, and that it would have been better if certain action had not  been taken with regard to members of the Federal Legislature. </para>

                            <para>- I mention no State in particular. I think it was a pity that these drastic steps have been taken; but, in the circumstances, we must make the best of a bad situation. In my opinion, the war crisis in Australia did not happen to-day, or when the Prime Minister announced his policy. It happened in Australia on . the 4th August two years ago, when war was declared by Germany. That was the commencement of our trouble. Whilst at that time I did not think compulsory service was necessary, I have no doubt whatever to-day that had compulsion been introduced at that time much money would have been saved to the Commonwealth, the people would have been spared much heartburning, and the community would have escaped a great deal of worry. Whilst the volunteer system has given remarkable results, it has been most unfair and inequitable in its application. It invariably happened that when one boy of a family of three or four went to the front, he was the hero of his relatives for an hour, but within a few weeks every other lad in the family followed him. They said, &#34; Our brother has gone ; we shall not be cowards.&#34; In the very next house there might be just as many eligible sons in a family, and not one of them volunteered. Will honorable senators seek to justify a system which gives such results? Instances of this kind would have been impossible under compulsory service, for every man would have been called up in his turn, and there would have been no inequality of sacrifice. I wish to show now why Australia has a greater interest in this war than has any of the other dominions. What we have done has been compared with what has been done by Canada, South Africa, and New Zealand, but it is no concern of ours what the other parts of the Empire are doing. Our duty is to play our part, and take our full share of the responsibilities of the war. Indeed, we should do more than other parts of the Empire, because our risk is greater than theirs. We, like the statesmen of Great Britain, were gulled by Germany. Indeed, we are more blameworthy for our blindness to her intentions than they are. For many years she was seeking new territory in which she could place her surplus population under conditions resembling those to which they had been accustomed. She was looking for a country in which a great deal of pioneering work had been done, but in which there were not many people, although plenty of room for expansion. It had to be, moreover, a country easy to seize, and not difficult to hold. They looked first at Canada, but its proximity to the United States protected it, because of the Monroe doctrine. They turned their eyes upon India, where they spent much money to ascertain whether the country would suit them, but determined that, as it was a tropical country, with a population of nearly 300,000,000 natives, it would not do. South Africa again is not quite what they wanted, its soil in many parts not being too good, while the native population is large. But in Australia they had just the place that they wanted, 3,000,000 square miles of country, rich beyond the dreams of avarice, poorly defended, but a white man&#39;s country in every sense of the word. </para>

At Rabaul, where there is a beautiful harbor with practically no trade, they spent immense sums on wharfage arrangements. </para>

                            <para>- Yes. Remembering what we owe to the British Navy, it is impossible for us to do too much in this war. We have, of course, done remarkably well, and every part of the British Empire and the Allies of Britain are as proud of what we have done as our enemies are annoyed by it. While Germany was occupied outside Australia, in the preparations I have described, she was not idle inside. She had her spies everywhere, and as they did not work for nothing, much German money found its way here. I make no charges against any person in Australia, but I am sure that German money was spent freely in obtaining for the Kaiser information regarding everything that took place here, and knowledge of the possibilities of the country. Every one remembers the Agadir incident, a couple of years before the outbreak of the war, when a German fleet took certain liberties which nearly precipitated a conflict before Germany considered herself ready to begin. A British fleet was sent to look for the German fleet in Chinese waters, but for many months it disappeared as completely as if it had sunk to the bottom of the ocean. Finally it was discovered hiding in a harbor in German territory. That fleet, or the greater part of it, is now at the bottom of the ocean, and will remain there. The bulk of it was lost at the battle of the Falkland Islands. When I was at Port Darwin recently I was told that the <inline font-style="italic">Emden</inline> was on one occasion within sixty miles of that port, and shipping men informed me that the officers of that enemy vessel had boasted that they could have sunk every ship sailing on the southern coast of Australia for several weeks but for one thing - it would have attracted the attention of our little Australian fleet and brought disaster upon them. The hiding places of these German warships have not yet been discovered, I understand. German officers have boasted that their vessels were quite close to the Australian coast for many weeks, and could have done incalculable damage but for the fact that they did not know where the Australian fleet was. A visit from this small German fleet would have brought ruin to our cities. For the protection  we  receive here we are indebted to our own fleet, but we are mostly indebted to the British fleet for the fact that the iron heel of the invader has never yet trod on our shores. We have done much on land, but what we have done has not more than paid the debt we owe to Great Britain for the splendid position that Australia occupies to-day. Honorable senators have painted dismal pictures of what might happen should compulsory military service overseas be carried by the people at the referendum, but they have said very little of what would be likely to happen in the trenches if our boys should have to be informed of the defeat of the Government&#39;s proposal. Our share here is the lighter. They are bearing the heavier share, and they will fight with greater vigour and put a stronger push behind the bayonet when they learn that the people of Australia are standing; behind them and  fulfilling  the promise made by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Fisher</inline> that Australia is behind them to the last man and the last shilling. An affirmative decision will also help us with our Allies. Some say, &#34; Shorten the front.&#34; Yes, and compel someone else to go into the trenches ! Let us have someone else to fight for us ! Let us hire the mercenaries referred to by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch!</inline> Let us hire blacks, men we will not have in Australia, to do the fighting for us ! Let us get Russians to fight for us at 2d. per day. Is that what we want? No. Australia will continue the fight. As a free and independent Australian I would scorn a proposal to hire mercenaries to fight for us, because it would naturally be said that we are too cowardly to do it ourselves. Some senators say, &#34; Get Russians or Indians to fight for us.&#34; Indians and Russians alike have responded nobly to the call of their Empires. They are each fighting their own battles, and it is our clear duty to fight our own battle until the war is finished. And then Australians can hold up their heads among the nations and say, &#34; Young as we are, with a small population, and unprepared as we were for war, we have set an example to the world.&#34; I ask those gentlemen who have complained about the failure of the voluntary system whether they are not partly responsible for that failure. Day after day we have heard the 4J-per-cent. patriot condemned, whereas in my opinion every man who put even &#163;10 into one of our war loans has done something to help his country and should not be sneered at. When our Government was in need of money and had to borrow it, it had to pay for that money just the same as any other country that borrows has to pay for what it raises on the loan market. I would no more sneer at a man who put his money into our war loans than I would at the man who put a rifle on his shoulder and went to the fight. Each is doing his share. No one has made the claim that there will be equality of sacrifice - it is impossible - but what the Prime Minister has said on the point has been very carefully distorted. What the Prime Minister did say was that there would be an equality of sacrifice as near as it was humanly possible to get it. And it will be done. The Government have promised to bring down proposals for financing the war which, they say, will satisfy us. The proposals will need to be very drastic to satisfy me, but I accept the word . of the Government in this matter. If I could not accept the word of the Minister for Defence I would not be on this side of the Chamber for five minutes. I could not follow a Government whose word I could not trust. I believe Ministers when they say that they will discharge to the very letter the promise which they have made to Parliament and to the country. I care not how drastic their financial proposals may be, or how much of the wealth of the country they intend to take, or how they will seek to do it, nor shall I grumble if I am among those who are called upon to pay. I should not escape. I cannot go to the war - but I can pay my share towards its cost without grumbling or complaint. At the same time I intend, as far as lies in my power, to see that every man who has wealth and cannot go to the war contributes his fair share towards the cost of paying those who do go to the war, and towards the maintenance of the families of our heroes who will never come back. I had intended to make some reference to remarks which have been made in another place and outside, but it may be just as well to let these things be forgotten. I hope that the campaign will start clean, and that there will be no recrimination or attempt to incite the passions of the people. </para>

                        <para>. - It is not necessary for a Labour senator to say anything to justify his action in voting for a referendum. The Labour party claim that they represent the people, and are always willing to trust them, and rely on the people&#39;s goodwill, and when a Referendum Bill comes before Parliament every member of the Labour party could with perfect safety give a silent vote for it. I can quite understand, however, that a member of the Labour party who rises to oppose a referendum needs considerable time to justify to his constituents something which I am absolutely sure he could never entirely justify to himself. I am not in that position. I am going to support the referendum. A large part of the debate has been occupied in discussing, not whether the question should be submitted to the people, but the merits or demerits of conscription. I intended to refer to the action of outside organizations in dictating to members of Parliament the attitude they should adopt on questions which are really not Labour party questions at all; but, as I want to be brief, I shall leave that matter severely alone. I am satisfied that the Labour organizations are opposing, not the proposal which is to be submitted to the people, but conscription as it is ordinarily understood, that is, a conscription such as that of Germany. Many trade unionists, especially those who are not well informed, still fear that if the people vote &#34;Yes&#34; the military authorities will have power to call up the whole of the manhood of Australia, and set it to work at its various trades at whatever pay they like to fix. I suppose I can claim to be the oldest trade unionist in the Chamber, for it is just about forty years since I first became one, and I know the feeling of the trade unionists. It is only the misrepresentations of some members of this Parliament that are. misleading the outside organizations as to what the referendum means, and that is what is causing the opposition to it to-day. When the trade unionists understand that the proposal merely asks that the Government be given power to send abroad men in Australia who will not go unless they are sent, and who would be liable for home defence under the present Act in the case of an invasion, I am sure they will agree to it by a large majority. The members of the trade unions of Australia are just as loyal and patriotic as any other class of the community. They have proved it by the number who have voluntarily enlisted, and when they understand the real position, they will be found marching behind the Prime Minister in order to protect Australia from the dangers which at present threaten it. Honorable senators have attempted to minimize the danger, and &#34; pooh-poohed &#34; the possibility of anything occurring to Australia if it does not do its share. Certain speeches inside and outside Parliament have, so far, to a large extent misled a number of our trade unionists, but when from every platform the meaning of the proposal is explained to them throughout the States, they will vote &#34;Yes,&#34; and express by so doing their complete confidence in the Government. The more cue Leader of the Government, who knows the conditions, emphatically and solemnly says it is  necessary  for Australia to give her last ounce of effort at the earliest moment, the more the majority of the people will realize that he is speaking the truth, and that the necessity is urgent. Most slanderous statements have been made against <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> and other members of the Government, but these I will not do more than refer to. We have heard a great deal about the financial side of the question. All I am concerned with doing is to enable the Government to get the men. It is their duty to find the wherewithal to equip them, and they will do it. I am perfectly satisfied to leave that matter in the hands of a Labour Government, because every member of it is just as earnest, loyal, and solid as any other Labour man in any part of this chamber, and quite as much so as some of those who are traducing them. The fact that they have become members of the Government has not made them less Labour men or less loyal to the Labour cause. It is more likely that their position has widened their knowledge. I am satisfied to leave in the hands of the Government the preparation of the necessary financial scheme if the referendum is carried. My course in the meantime is clear. I shall vote to refer the matter to the people. I shall tell the people they ought to vote &#34; Yes &#34; to the proposal, and at the same time give my reasons for thinking that they should do so. </para>

I also am prepared to do so if a referendum on this question is to be forced on us; but I shall do my best to prevent the people, or a portion of the people, deciding this issue when it cannot be fairly determined by them. I do not think it reasonable that all sections of the community should have the right to vote on a proposal to conscript only a section of the people, and to send that section into the inferno of war. </para>

                            <para>- I do not know that I would ; but as a party we advocate the abolition of capital punishment. I am prepared to state quite freely and frankly the position which I take up in reference to this matter, and I care not whom I please or displease. The issue is not a fair one to be voted upon by people who have nothing to lose, and may, perhaps, have something to gain by its acceptance. Unlike some honorable senators, I am not out on a heresy hunt. I do not want to engage in a scalp-hunting expedition with the object of capturing the Prime Minister&#39;s scalp. I do not for a moment indorse the statement that some of my colleagues have made that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> has been a traitor to the Labour movement. I believe that he has been one of the most potent factors in the building up of the movement which I with my colleagues have the honour to represent in this Legislature. I am not going to be among those who in this campaign will set out to abuse the Prime Minister, for I know that he has done a marvellous work for the betterment and the uplifting of the workers. I cannot see eye to eye with him on this question, but I give him credit for absolute sincerity. He honestly thinks that he is viewing the situation from the correct stand-point. He has seen the light from his point of view, but that point of view, in my opinion, is not the right one. Holding these views, I believe it to be my duty to oppose not only the Referendum Bill, but the proposal which it involves to conscript human life. If the Bill be carried, I hope that we shall enter upon the discussion of the question of conscription on the platforms of Australia without any heat or passion, and free from any antagonism as between man and mau. Let us discuss the question calmly and dispassionately. I sincerely trust that we shall not act like mad mullahs or dancing dervishes, but that we shall place our views forcibly before the people when asking them to consider what their verdict ought to be. Although I am by nature a pessimist, I have no hesitation in saying that, despite the great influence of the <inline font-style="italic">Age,</inline> the <inline font-style="italic">Argus,</inline> and other daily newspapers published in this State - despite the halo that adorns the head of our Prime Minister, and notwithstanding his illustrious record - the majority of the people of Victoria will vote against conscription. </para>

                            <para>- I am neither a prophet nor the son of a prophet. I propose briefly to state my reasons for opposing this Bill, and to refrain from discussing at this stage the main issue of conscription, which must be dealt with on the public platforms of Australia. It seems to me that the references that have been made to the question of conscription or no conscription during this debate in the Senate have been, to a certain extent, irrelevant to the Bill itself. The only question that we have at this stage to consider is whether a referendum should or should not be taken. I oppose the taking of a referendum, for I honestly and sincerely believe that those who, like myself,, object to the conscription of human life, will not receive the same fair treatment that will be extended to the supporters of the principle. I do not wish for one moment to attribute to the Prime Minister or the Minister for Defence any ulterior motives; I do not think they would conscientiously do anything to stifle freedom of speech on this most important question. </para>

                            <para>- I believe that we should allow the utmost freedom of speech, and also the greatest freedom of the press. If a man says or prints any ridiculous, disloyal, or libellous statement he must take the consequences. If a statement is ridiculous the people accept it at its face value. The more ridiculous or extreme it is the more damage the author of it does to the cause he is trying to advance. I think I view these matters in a fairly temperate light; but my blood fairly boiled when I learned of the seizure of the manifesto issued by the national executive of the congress dealing with the question of conscription. </para>

                            <para>- I do not want to be interned. The manifesto as censored is a rather valuable document, and may some day be of historic importance. After the censor had done with it all that was left was practically the word &#34;manifesto &#34; at the top and the signatures at the bottom of it. Practically everything else was censored. Knowing as I do that the manifesto as originally printed contained some ridiculous statements, such as would not have convinced even the most asinine members of the community, I fail to understand what objection the Minister for Defence could have had to its circulation. It was so silly in some aspects and so true in some others- </para>

                            <para>- Should have been allowed to go out to the public. One reason why I am opposed to this referendum is that I do not think the opponents of conscription will be allowed to fairly, clearly, and properly set out their arguments. In this particular manifesto arguments were adduced that were not in my opinion detrimental to recruiting, that were in no way seditious, disloyal, or obnoxious to our gallant Allies, and yet they were censored. I shall give one illustration. </para>

                            <para>- It is not fair to libel anybody who is fighting for, or assisting us in any way, but I do not regard the manifesto as a libel. It is purely a statement of the case from the anticon.scriptionist point of view. I do not think it is meant to be a libel on the conscript countries of Russia or of France ; and in view of the dramatic manner in which the manifesto was seized at the Trades Hall and the <inline font-style="italic">Labour Gall</inline> office, I begin to wonder whether I ought to vote for the referendum. All the facts seem to indicate that the people who are trying to put their views against conscription . will rot have as fair a deal as those who desire to put their views in its favour. Then we have to take into account the action of the Censor in connexion with cartoons. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> is a gentleman for whom I have the greatest respect, though I happen to differ from him on this particular question . On the 22nd July, 1915. as reported in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard,</inline><inline font-weight="bold">Mr.</inline></para>

                    <para>Hughes said that, in no circumstances, would he agree to send men out of the  country  to fight against their will. That declaration was made just one year and two months ago last night. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> has changed his opinion, and, knowing more than we do possibly, he has good reasons; but the fact is that a. cartoon, with the declaration I have quoted, is not allowed to be circulated. The cartoon is a handsome and very flattering picture of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes,</inline> but it has been censored and withdrawn from circulation. </para>

                            <para>- Then the honorable senator must have seen it by subterfuge, as I got possession of this cartoon. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> knows that, legally speaking, this cartoon is not supposed to be in existence to-day. It was distributed, but <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> himself, or the Censor, after seeing the cartoon and letterpress, in which I can find nothing objectionable, ordered that the copies should be seized and kept from circulation. No doubt it will be circulated in a way; but my point is that a document that contains a cartoon, and an argument against conscription, has been censored. When I know or think that those opposed to conscription will not get a fair hearing, how can I vote for the referendum ? Even some of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes&#39;</inline> own speeches have been censored, and statements made by various honorable members in another place are not allowed to be circulated. We are told that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> has been to the front, and knows a great deal more than anybody else about the war; and I admit&#39; that. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> has been right into the firing line, and has seen Joffre, Haig, and other generals ; and, as a man of discernment, brains, and brilliancy, he must realize the position better than we do. The honorable gentleman has come back, and he says that it is absolutely necessary to conscript men to reinforce the section held at present by the Australians. If we accept his statement, must we not also accept another statement by a man who has also .been to the front, and has seen our men fighting under similar conditions? I refer to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Ryan,</inline> Premier of Queensland. He has been to the front, and has seen almost the same as <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> has seen, and vet has come back with totally diverse views. </para>

                            <para>- I think that conscription can be done without by utilizing the forces at present on Salisbury Plain and in other places in Britain. I do not wish to see our line shortened. The Prime Minister says that if we have, say, 100 men holding a certain length of the firing line, we must send 100 more men from Australia as reinforcements to give them a spell. Accepting that statement as correct, we should then, if the conscription proposal is given effect, have 200 men at the front, and, should they meet with disaster as the result of a successful effort by the enemy, we should have to send 200 more men to reinforce our line. Like the rolling snowball, the numbers sent away would be continually growing, and this might involve the depletion of the manhood of the Commonwealth. In the circumstances, no member of the Senate can agree with the statement made by the Prime Minister in Sydney, that there will be no need to call up married men. </para>

                            <para>- No, I would not. If the safety of the country depended on it, we should call up the aged and decrepit, but we should be candid in the matter, and let the people know what the position really is. I interjected, during the speech made&#39; by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen,</inline> and secured his admission, that if the referendum is carried in the affirmative, the liability to serve will be upon married as well as upon single men, and not only upon those between 21 and 45 years of age, but upon all who may be called up at the present time for home service under the Defence Act. Many who will vote &#34;Yes&#34; at the referendum will stay at home with their wives and families, and be content to send others to the front to fight for them. I believe that under the Prime Minister&#39;s proposal it is highly probable that, within the next six or seven months, married men will have to be called up, because 32,500 men are wanted this month, and 16,500 per month after that. </para>

                            <para>- The Prime Minister has been painting the blackest of pictures, and we are told that every man will be wanted. All I desire in this connexion is that the people of Australia should be told that married men may be called up under the Government proposal. The Prime Minister, in the press, would lead people to believe that only single men without dependants will need to be called up. I shall not say more on that aspect of the question. I have now to refer to the industrial aspect. It may be said that I am a scaremonger when I say that if the scheme is carried out in its entirety it will involve the depletion of the able-bodied men of Australia, our industries cannot be carried on, and, to use the words of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen,</inline> the wool will rot on the sheeps&#39;  backs, and the wheat will rot on the ground. </para>

If a great many are sent away under the conscript system, or, for that matter, even under the voluntary system, it will be said that we must have some one to do the work which has to be done, and to keep the wheels of industry moving. If our men do not return, or return maimed and mutilated, it will be contended by the captains of industry or the Government that we must secure labour from outside sources, and then the condition of affairs in Australia will become what it is in London to-day. In a cablegram which appeared in the <inline font-style="italic">Herald</inline> dated from London last week, it was stated that the influx of Chinese in the East End and in the dock districts was so great that a trade union congress had been held to consider the matter, and it was further stated that fan-tan playing, opium smoking, and immorality were prevalent. </para>

                            <para>- I do not say that the Labour Government would do it, but I cannot tell how long <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> will occupy the position which he now adorns. A Government opposed to Labour may occupy the Treasury benches, and will honorable senators tell me that men of the character of <inline font-weight="bold">Sir William</inline> Irvine would not be only too anxious to grasp at the opportunity? We should then have Chinese working here as they are working now in the docks of Great Britain, and in Prance. I venture to predict that if conscription is adopted, both single and married men will be sent away, an insufficient number of men will be&#39; left to carry on our industries, and a demand will be made to import labour from some other part of the world, just as kanakas were imported in the days gone by to cut cane in Queensland. I sincerely hope that I am wrong, but the fulfilment of my prediction is certainly possible if too many men are sent away whether under the voluntary system or as conscripts. There are some honorable senators in this chamber who, with colleagues of theirs in another place, would be only too pleased if they had the opportunity and the power to bring about such a state of affairs. I say this in view of the predilections they displayed when the kanaka and White Australia questions were being decided in this Parliament in the early days of Federation. I shall oppose this Bill at every stage, and I shall oppose the conscription proposal from every pie* norm during the referendum campaign. 1 do not think that it will require very much opposition, because I feel that I know what the opinion of the majority of the people will be when the position is explained. When the real position is explained to the small business man, or to a woman who may have a sweetheart, or a brother, or some other relative, liable to conscription, they will not be misled and gulled by the Conservative press. </para>

                        (Western Australia &#91;8.15 a.m.&#93;. - My remarks on this subject will be very brief indeed, because I have no apology to make as to my attitude towards the Bill. As far as the principle of the referendum is concerned, I said on scores of platforms at the last Federal elections that not only was I in favour of the initiative and referendum, but that the whole of the party were pledged to it. I am satisfied, also, that if it had not been for the fact that so much time has been taken up in legislative and administrative work connected with the war, the initiative and referendum would ha.ve been on the statute-book of the Commonwealth to-day. Furthermore, I am satisfied that if we had had this law in operation, the people of Australia months ago would have initiated the referendum we are now proposing to take. Coming to the subject-matter of the Bill - compulsory service abroad - I have to say that I am not an ardent admirer of the so-called voluntary system. I term it the &#34; so-called voluntary system &#34; because we never had the voluntary system in Australia. My colleague,
                        <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Barnes,</inline>
                        in his speech this morning brought forward some of the strongest  arguments that have been introduced in this Chamber against the existing system when he said that he knew men who had been starved into enlisting to fight for us across the seas. It is the most rotten system of conscription that we could possibly have in operation, because under it the Government do not decide who shall go to fight; that decision really rests with the Employers Federation. I know that many men with large families have been compelled to go because they could not get work. I met some of them, and to one I said, &#34;I do not think the time has come for men with your responsibilities to go and leave large families behind you ; there are other men with less responsibilities who should go first.&#34; He replied, &#34; Well, we have to go, because we cannot get work, and cannot provide food, let alone clothing, for our wives and families. Wherever we go to ask for a job, the employers say, &#39; Go up to the Barracks ; they want able-bodied men there, and you will get a job.&#39; &#34; These men were actually forced to enlist. One of them lost his life at Gallipoli, and now there are eight fatherless children in that family. If we had had in operation the system of conscription, we would never have had that burden thrust upon the country, for we would never have allowed married men to go, perhaps to lose their lives and leave young children without a parent&#39;s care. I do not want to go into a lengthy argument on this question of the conscription of human life, because I take it, when the referendum campaign is in progress, every member of this Parliament will be called upon to go on the public platform and tell the people as much as he is allowed to say concerning the position in which we stand as a Commonwealth, and our position with respect to the Motherland. I have no hesitation in saying on which side I will be. During the last Federal elections I was asked, if the Labour party were returned to power, would they cancel the enrolment of the 20,000 troops that had been enrolled by the Cook Government, and I answered &#34; No.&#34; The Labour party, I said, recognised that we were part and parcel of the British Empire, and had our duty to do in connexion with this war. Having made that statement before the electors, and having been, to a great extent, elected upon it, it is my duty to vote to send reinforcements for the 20,000 men who were despatched in the first place.. Every man in this Federal Parliament who voted Supply for those men is also in honour bound to continue to vote money, and to continue to find men as reinforcements, even to the extent of bringing in the compulsory clauses of the Defence Act. We have heard a lot about the conscription of wealth to carry on the war. I believe in it, and the Government promised to bring down financial proposals to that end, including a scheme to ensure the success of the repatriation movement. At the present time we have the voluntary enlistment for service abroad, and we have the voluntary and the  compulsory  systems operating side by side to provide funds for the war. We conscript some of the wealth in the form of taxation, and we are asking people to give voluntarily to the repatriation and patriotic funds. Personally I think every penny necessary for the repatriation of our soldiers, as well as the patriotic funds, should be obtained compulsorily ; that every person who is making a decent living here should be compelled to pay a fair share towards the conduct of this war, and the maintenance of the various funds incidental to it. I desire to emphasize the point raised yesterday by
                        <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ferricks</inline>
                        in connexion with the Appeal Boards, and I hope the Minister will give special attention to this matter, and that we will have an Appeal Court constituted in a manner different from that suggested by the Prime Minister, for I am not prepared to trust the resident magistrates throughout the whole of this Commonwealth. A great majority, it is true, can be trusted, but I know that one particular resident magistrate in Western Australia took the stand that he would not appoint a labour representative on a confidential sub-committee of the recruiting committee unless he was compelled by law to do so.

I fail to understand the attitude taken up by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Blakey.</inline> He declares himself opposed to conscription, but is afraid to trust the people of Victoria, because, as he says, old men and old women, and men and women without sons liable to be called up, will have the right to vote on this subject. But in the next breath the honorable senator says, &#34;I am satisfied that so far as Victoria is concerned the referendum will be turned down by a great majority.&#34; If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Blakey</inline> is satisfied that the referendum will be negatived, why is he afraid to trust the people of Victoria?, In my judgment, the honorable senator is not so sure about the referendum being defeated, but is afraid that it will be carried. So far as I can learn, after moving among the workers, a very great number of them are in favour of conscription. I have met a great many who say that they know it is their duty to go to the front, and they are prepared to go when the &#34; other fellow&#34; goes, but they fear that the &#34; other fellow &#34; is waiting to jump into the jobs which they leave. &#34; Why should I go,&#34; they ask, &#34; and allow the other fellow to take my job?&#34; They admit that the fairest method of ali is for the Labour Government to adopt the system of conscription, and I hope that when the referendum is carried, the Minister will be able to have regulations so framed as to deal fairly and justly with all classes of the community. </para>

                        <para>. - It must be admitted by all who have been present throughout the debate that it has been conducted in the best of good humour. There has been an entire absence of recriminations, and may I be permitted to add that the addresses delivered have been of a high standard ; some of them have been exceptionally good. Not only is this one of the most serious questions we have ever faced, but the position in itself is critical, and it demands, as I think it has received from honorable senators, deen thoughtfulness  arid  seriousness. It is no trifling matter with which we are dealing, and we are beginning to realize at last that we are at war. Some prophets have told us that the war is over, but I do not think that at any time during the last two years has there been evidence of such depth of feeling as to what the world conflict really means to Australia. Notwithstanding that, there has been during the debate a tendency to cloud the true issue, and to argue in a limp way the real subject that is before us. The argument has been advanced that  a  submission of this question by referendum to the people is not a just step to take. With that I do not agree. We are appealing to-day, to the people who create Parliaments, upon the most vital question that has ever been before any nation, to give to us who make their laws a direction as to the action we should take, and if it is to be contended that on such a subject as this the referendum shall not be employed, I seriously ask what subjects can be submitted to the people. The argument that some people will vote for conscription who may not be personally affected by it is swept aside by the fact that every man, woman, and child in Australia, from grey-headed old men to little toddlers just escaped from the cradle,  i3  affected by  this war. It is not a wise judgment which prompts some persons to urge that a question so essential to the nation&#39;s best interests shall be decided by a few people who have not received any mandate from their masters as to the course they shall adopt. How far-reaching the effects of the people&#39;s decision may be we cannot tell, but to say that some will vote on the question who are not directly affected is only to beg the issue. We can scarcely take  up  a newspaper without finding that nations far distant from the seat of war are embroiled in it. Although they may be beyond sound of the thunder of guns, and although no shells may be bursting on their territories, still they are affected commercially, socially, and almost in every other way; indeed, it seems as if the present war is a world crisis. Few of us would be daring enough to even indicate what we think society will be like after the war. Few of us dare prophesy in what way we shall resume life again, and try to piece together its broken threads. The world will be so changed and modified that we might almost say that on the day peace is declared we shall enter into a new world, with new conditions and new environments, and, as a consequence, new laws will have to be made to meet the altered circumstances. Not only is magazine literature teeming with opinions as to what may occur after the war, but books dealing with all the post-war possibilities are&#39; being written far more plentifully than they can be read. Therefore, to contend that in  regard  to such a far-reaching question, we, who call ourselves Democrats, are not to take the most democratic weapon we have, and use it to save the people, seems to deny our right to call ourselves Democrats. These arguments are weak in themselves, and weak in the way they are expressed. To-day we are appealing to Caesar, and I must confess that I am &#34;in a quandary as to what to say to Caesar. Am I to go before him as a partisan, and state my case only? Am I to ask Caesar to decide on this question from my view-point alone, or am I to trust to somebody else who may follow after me to state the other side? If  Caesar  is to judge justly he must know both the pros and cons. It is all very well for the man who does not believe in submitting the referendum to the people to say that he is going forth to persuade everybody to vote &#34; No.&#34; It is all very well for the man on the other side to say that he will endeavour to persuade the people to vote &#34;Yes&#34; ; but the general public, who have to decide this vital question, should be possessed of all the knowledge it is possible to give to them, so that they may arrive at a right decision. We have realized the seriousness of the issue, and how much depends on the way it is decided, and we have spoken in bated breath of dangers that are possible, dangers that may be immediate or may be distant. Yet we know full well that the final arbiters in this matter cannot be seized of the facts as we are. When we go forth shortly to debate this question before the people much that we know will have to be kept from them; although a decision that will affect the interests of Australia, perhaps for ages, hence, must&#39; be given on the 28th October. There is no room for hilarity or levity, and no justification for taking a partial view of the question or treating it from a party stand-point. It rises infinitely superior to all parties, and stands forth as a great national issue. </para>

                            <para>- There is no room for either of those things. To allow the subject to be clouded or befogged by any such influences would give the public the idea that we do not grasp the position thoroughly. I honestly believe that every senator has conscientiously expressed his view of the question. I give to others just as freely as I take to myself credit for being conscientious in the attitude adopted. The position in regard to conscription seems to me to be this: I am a member of society ; I receive benefits from society; if I am not prepared to pay the price that society demands from me for the enjoyment of those benefits I have no right to be in society. We cannot reap where we have not sown; and if we are to receive protection from society we must prepare to give defence to society. If we shirk that responsibility by any subterfuge or argument, or by any palliation of conscience, we are most unmistakably showing that we have no right to the benefits society confers. Nationhood not merely confers benefits on citizens, but also imposes obligations, and may demand sacrifices. A  speaker  in this debate has said that it must be left to the individual conscience to determine what sacrifice is called for, but my conception of the duty of citizenship is that, although the individual must be controlled by ais own conscience in regard to actions affecting merely himself, he must be controlled in his actions as a member of a society by the conscience of that society. No member of a society belongs to himself, or is his own master. It has been urged that society ought not to vote away human life, but we know that society takes human life as a penalty for the transgression of its laws. The hangman&#39;s knot proclaims that for the violation of certain laws death is the penalty. The basic principle of all society is that those who receive must be prepared to pay an equivalent. To deny that principle is to ostracize oneself. </para>

                            <para>- I do. The submission of this question to the people is an absolutely democratic course, and one in harmony with the platform of the Labour party. I could no more refuse to give effect to the referendum plank oi our platform than I could refuse to give effect to any other plank. To do so would be inconsistent with my membership of the Labour party. Some honorable senators have dwelt strongly on the financial responsibilities imposed on the Commonwealth by the war. We were not permitted at the beginning of the war to sit down and count its cost, and we have been obliged to conduct our share of it with only a partial knowledge of the obligations entailed. It cannot rightly be contended that because our participation in the war will involve a greater sacrifice than we have ever before had to make we should draw out. It has been argued thai, the referendum should not be taken because Australia has already done enough. When will Australia have done enough? Only when peace is established throughout the world. There can be no half measures, nor can we enter upon our stupendous task light-heartedly. What honorable business man, finding himself in a tighter corner than he had -ever been in before, would repudiate his obligations? Any man who would do such a thing would be regarded as untrustworthy and unstable. </para>

There might have been force in much that has been said during the debate about the small population of Australia, and the great cost of me war, if it had been said before we had decided to play any part in it.

Many of us can remember the period of the bank disasters and commercial failures. At that time Australia was much more thinly populated than it is now, and her financial strength much less, but we cannot forget her magnificent power of recuperation.

                            <para>- Yes. And I do not think there is a man in this Parliament who, iu sober moments, would say that he desired it to be done. We are now in a position from which we  cannot  honorably withdraw. It has been suggested that we have over-reached ourselves, but, if we have, I do not blame the Government very much. At times recruits presented themselves so fast, crowding &#39;the camps to overflowing, that there seemed no power to stay the enthusiasm of our men for service. No doubt it was that that prompted the Ministry to go a step further. They may have erred in judgment, but for that they will have no blame from me. though I suggest that the division which has been broken into for reinforcements should be used entirely to strengthen the others. Coming now to the question of conscription, we were told some months ago by the Minister for Defence that the introduction of compulsion then would not have secured a larger number of recruits than the voluntary system was yielding. If that be so, does it not seem that by holding to that which we have without extending our line we may be able to honorably fulfil our promise to the Old Land ? Much that has been said about the numbers available is due to the use of rose-tinted glasses. We have been told that the number of single men* over the age of twenty-one years that will be available is 112.800, but let me call attention to these figures which appeared in yesterday&#39;s <inline font-style="italic">Age.</inline> Of 8,431 men who have offered themselves for enrolment in Victoria during September, only 1,302, or about one in eight, have been accepted. Those figures so astonished me that I thought at first that I must have misread them. I could not believe that out of 8.431 persons who had presented themselves for examination only 1,302 were considered to be medically fit for service. If the same ratio of unfitness obtains throughout the ranks of the 112,800 single men who are supposed to be available, the number of  physically  fit would be reduced to 14,100. Then, if I were inclined to adopt the reasoning of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Mullan,</inline> by reducing that number by 30 per cent, for one thing, 10 per cent, for another, and perhaps 25 per cent, for a third, how many would be left? We should require a microscope to discover them. But there must be some explanation for those mysterious figures. I cannot conceive that the doctors have been bribed. Is the explanation to be found in the fact that those men who are really fit to go to the front  do not volunteer, whilst those who are physically unfit offer themselves for service ? Is there no way of discriminating between the fit and the unfit before they reach the examining medical officers ? 1 do not know whether the censor will be at work upon our speeches, but if there is any information which the enemy ought not to get, it is that which is contained in these figures. </para>

                            <para>- It would be a terribly bad advertisement for Australia if the facts are what the figures suggest.&#39; I have not compared the returns of other States with those of Victoria from the stand-point of the number of men who have been rejected; I hope that they do not disclose the same ratio - of physically unfit. I wish now to say a few words in reply to the contention that conscription is undemocratic. What is Democracy ? Is it not government ? How is government effected but through those whom the people have elected to make laws for them ? In this instance we are formulating an Act which is to be administered by the people themselves. Yet we are told that it is not democratic. We are further assured that war and democratic government are not reconcilable. But war and democratic government in the present instance are inseparable. If the honorable senator who affirmed that war and democratic government are not reconcilable propounded that doctrine in Germany, I would be in agreement with him. In the making of war, I admit that war and Democracy are irreconcilable. But it is not so when we are defending our own. We believe in the compulsory enrolment and training of men for home defence. How are we going to interpret &#34; home defence &#34; ? Is our defence not to be regarded as &#34; home defence &#39; &#39; until the enemy comes within the 3-miles territorial limit? Was it not true &#34;home defence&#34; when the <inline font-style="italic">Sydney</inline> sank the <inline font-style="italic">Emden,</inline> although the fight took place outside of our territorial waters ? Is there a single honorable senator who argues against compelling men to go to the front who would have said to the crew of the <inline font-style="italic">Sydney, &#34;</inline> You must not go abroad for service, because that would be undemocratic, and because such service would not be for the purpose of home defence&#34;? There is not a single member in this Chamber who would have bidden the captain of the <inline font-style="italic">Sydney</inline> to stay his course and abstain from wreaking vengeance on the <inline font-style="italic">Emden.</inline> As <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> well said, the privileges we enjoy to-day were purchased for us in the centuries that have gone. And the privileges that we hand down to our children will be their inheritance, and surely that inheritance should -be a richer one than we have received. What position, then, ought we to take up on this question? Some contend that Australia alone is threatened. Some urge that the determination of this matter is a party question. Now, I believe that in the life of every nation and of every party there comes a testing time - a time when that  nation becomes from that point onwards, either decadent or stronger, when that party dissolves and goes to pieces, or rises to a higher glory. To Australia to-day has come such a testing time. How are we to stand ? How are we to uphold the banner that has been given to us? How are we to &#39;defend that banner, and to be loyal to those who have handed down to us this great heritage? I cannot believe that there are amongst us those who think that the present crisis affords them an opportunity of lifting their own party to prominence. I  believe  that this question is regarded as a national one, which is far above all party considerations. If we approach it in that light, if we as a party with a history of which we may be proud, with ideals of which we may be still prouder,  ant-  with hopes that are even greater than our ideals - if we remain true to our party and to the nation to which we belong, we shall emerge from this great crisis strengthened rather than weakened, consolidated rather than defeated, and made better rather than injured. For myself, I have been all <inline font-style="italic">my</inline> life a strong anti-conscriptionist. I confess it freely. If there is one thing which I have regarded with horror, it is war. If there is one thing which I have thought Democracy would km stone dead, it is war. If I have hoped that the time would come when the sword would be beaten into a pruning hook, it has been because I have faith in Democracy, and I confess that to me it has been the saddest sight I ever witnessed to behold the Democrats of France facing the Democrats of Germany in a bloody struggle. Although all my life I have been opposed to conscription to the very core, I stand to-day and ask myself whether voluntarism will fill the Bill. That question can be answered in the affirmative only if we have faith in Australia - if we believe that she will respond to the call. My honest conviction is that it is because our young Australian manhood have believed that our training camps were filled to overflowing that they have not come forward. Another reason which has militated against recruiting is that they saw the vacancies created by the enlistment oi their mates, filled sometimes by foreigners, and often by men whom trade unionists describe as &#34;scabs.&#34; I honestly believe that if we can get to these men who have been so remiss in their duty, and say to them, &#34;Your country needs you to-day,&#34; they will respond just as readily as did our people at the beginning of this struggle. But, of course, there must come a time - if the war lasts long enough - when Australia will have sent all her able-bodied men to the front. I do not think, however, that that time will be within the next twelve months. We have been calculating the wastage of the war on the basis of the wastage that has occurred during the present offensive. We have not considered that, during the winter, there will not be the same rate of wastage that there has been during the summer. I believe that the men who have already enlisted, and those who may be persuaded to enlist before the referendum is taken, will be sufficient to uphold Australia&#39;s honour. If I have an ardent wish, it is that right to the close of the war, not <inline font-style="italic">one man</inline> shall have been sent from Australia against his will, that every man who goes to the front shall be a true patriot in the highest sense of the term. If there is one thing of which Australia may be proud to-day, it is the position she has maintained up to the present time. I refuse to believe that there is beating in any Australian&#39;s heart to-day the feeling that any young man able to take his position at the front will fail to do so when tile position is placed before him in its proper perspective. Only the other day, I met a young man in the streets of Adelaide who told me his position. He had enlisted for active service, and he was a married man who was leaving a wife and four children behind him. In the course of conversation, he said to me. &#34; I am going away to fight this country&#39;s battles. I want you as a legislator to remember that I have left mv wife behind in charge of Australia&#39;s Parliament. See that she does not starve.&#34; Every patriot has a right to demand that. If it takes the last shilling Australia has, it will be a price far too cheap for the sacrifice that these men have made for the honour and defence of Australia. Can we believe that those who are left in Australia are inferior in quality to those who have called forth the praises of almost the whole world for the great deeds that they have done? Can we believe that they are less able to be appealed to ? Can we believe that any single man able to bear arms will be unwilling to do so when he knows that the time has come when his services are needed? I think not. Therefore, I am prepared to support the Bill, and, against the convictions of a lifetime, I am prepared to go further. Although I may never stand in this </para>

                        <para>. - I have come to a decision to support the Bill before us on the reports that have been submitted to us by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes,</inline> who is in possession of more information concerning the true position in regard to the war than is any honorable senator. We have trusted <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes;</inline> we have elected him leader of our party and Prime Minister of Australia, and if we have no confidence in him we should no longer follow him as leader. I do not know that any honorable senator has been more closely associated with <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> in industrial matters than I have been for the last twenty-five years, and the fact that during this period I have never had reason to doubt him on any matter has guided me largely in the decision to which I have come. I believe, also, that reinforcements are absolutely necessary. A great deal has been said as to what has been done in other wars, but this war differs from previous wars. What the newspapers have described as decisive victories have proved to be the taking of five yards of trench. In former wars a rout meant that a cavalry charge had swept the enemy away. To-day a rout amounts to the dislodging of the enemy from,, a few yards of trench. I receive information from men as the front. If some honorable senators knew the conditions under which our troops exist in the trenches, and how long they have to remain without relief, they would at once demand the despatch of tl at relief as soon as possible. I have no wish to discourage recruiting, but the letters which I have received show that, owing to the considerable time the men are kept in the trenches, it is impossible for them to get their natural rest. One letter puts the position in this way: &#34;Fritz&#39;s bullets we do not care for - we can dodge them ; but we cannot dodge the other things that keep us awake night and day.&#34; There are rats as big as cats running in and out, and gnawing at everything they can find in the trenches. One can easily imagine the condition of the men&#39;s bodies. Here we consider that eight hours is a fair day&#39;s work. Our men remain in the trenches for three or four times eight hours without being able to get out of them. </para>

                            <para>- This evidence shows how necessary it is to send reinforcements. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> says that the Army Council have advised him that  it  is necessary to get men. Of course we have regular &#34; Bill Adamses &#34; in this Chamber, who could finish off the war at any time. In fact, we heard from one honorable senator that the war was over. But we cannot claim to have taken a foot of German territory. Do we imagine that Germany will sue for peace so long as she is able to keep us out of her country? It is not likely. Having given the matter careful consideration, I have come to the conclusion that a settlement is a long way off yet. We are fighting for the supremacy of the trade of the world. Germany is trying to wrest it from us, and our task is to starve Germany by  a  blockade or get her warships out of the Kiel Canal into the North Sea. It is only there that the decisive battle will be fought. If the German Fleet blows the British ships out of the water Great Britain might just as well invite the Kaiser to London and install him there as Emperor, because Great Britain will be absolutely done for once the Navy is gone. On the other hand, if we can cripple the German Fleet and destroy it we put Germany back for 100 years. During the first year of the war the deaths alone were 5,000,000, and the wounded were twice that number. These figures show the numbers that have to be made up by the Allies. It is claimed that Australia is doing her share; but I hold that the war must be won at any cost, and that every man who is fit to fight should be at the front. </para>

                            <para>- We cannot send our warships into the Kiel Canal, and we can only drive the German warships out of that canal by way of the land. With trench warfare it will take the Allies a very long time to reach the canal, because, under- the present system of fighting a see-saw game is proceeding, one side gaining a few yards now and again and then retiring.. The greater the number of men one side can put into the front line the greater will be its chance of success. Therefore it is necessary that every single man among the Allies shall be put into the field. I have shown one way of reaching a decision. Others hold the opinion that this is a war of exhaustion, and that the side which can hold out in its dug-outs longest and starve the other side by a blockade will win. But how long will that process of exhaustion take? Today the territory of Germany is absolutely intact, her factories are turning out munitions, and her women are cultivating the soil and feeding the nation, and I am inclined to think that some of the neutral countries to the north are helping her with food. Our blockade is not so effective as most people imagine it is, and Germany can hold out for a very long time. Every honorable senator has lauded our soldiers, and said that they are the best in the world, and that they should get the best conditions in the world. Let us then give them an eight hours&#39; day in the trenches. But we cannot until we have more men. </para>

                    <para class="block">Avar ? Some honorable senators and people outside said that the war was a matter of six months only. I always said that Lord Kitchener had asked for supplies for three  years,  but had not said the war WOUld be finished in that time. I think it will be a lone-drawn-out struggle, and that we ought to make every provision in our power to bring it to an end as soon as possible. On the financial side of the question, will it not pay us better to go to the expense of sending the extra men if they are going to end the war a month or two earlier ? I am going whole-souled for the referendum, and will advise the people to vote &#34;Yes&#34; to the proposition. It has been said that we are doing better than Canada, and quotations have been read from speeches by the Premier and Leader of the Opposition in that country. They say they will not go in for conscription, but there is a very good reason for that. Even in Australia the Government have had to decree that every individual wanting to leave Australia must first produce a passport, but in Canada it is a mere matter of slipping through a wire fence into America. It is further said that the adoption of conscription would interfere with immigration, but Canada is situated entirely differently from us.  South Africa has had its own troubles, and has nobly done great service to the Empire. The freedom and privileges we have enjoyed in this country are worth fighting for, and we ought to do our level best to maintain them.- We should not consider the trifling question of what&#39; may happen to a little business man if our men go away, and he sells a pair of trousers less than he did before. As the Leader of the Opposition well put it, what if the wool is not shorn, what if the wheat is not reaped ? If we lose the war it will belong to the Germans, and it is just as well that he should get the wool and wheat without it being shorn and reaped. I shall do my level best to see that the proposals of the Government are carried out. </para>

                        <para>. - It was laid down by the first  President  of the Senate that the right of the  President  to a deliberative vote also carried with it the right to take part in the deliberations of this Chamber. That ruling- 1 entirely agree with, although I must candidly say it is a right that ought to be very sparingly used. It is only the importance of the present occasion that induces me to depart from the very sound rule that the  President  should not take part in the turmoil of debate. I wish to put the question as clearly and plainly as T can. I am speaking now as a senator, and as  President  of the Senate, and must appeal to the indulgence of honorable senators, who have always treated me with the utmost consideration and kindness, and assisted me in every way, on this occasion to further extend that indulgence and kindness to me, because if there is any disorder when I am speaking I shall immediately have to forego my right to speak, and resume the chair in order to fulfil my functions as  President.  By indulging, therefore, in any disorder, honorable senators would deprive me of the right to speak. If that obligation is upon them there is an equal obligation upon myself to speak in a very restrained fashion, so that I may not excite animosity, contention, or recrimination. That condition I intend to rigidly impose upon myself, and to address myself to the subject in a far more restrained fashion than I would feel free to do if I occupied a seat as a private member on the floor of the Senate. </para>
                    </talk.start>
                    <para>The question we are discussing ought to be capable of being reasoned out to a logical conclusion, stripped of all the side issues and cloudy paraphernalia that has been raised around it in various quarters. It should be capable of being reasoned out to a logical conclusion by any intellectual person, and even by any person with the rudiments of an intellect. I do not intend to cloud the issue by any Imperialistic flag-waving, or talking of the glories of the Empire, or the honour and fame to be gained by war. The question before us is, &#34; Is compulsion a right or wrong thing to resort to in the circumstances?&#34; I propose to discuss that question, and that alone. I have no judgment to pass upon any honorable senator for what he has done here. Probably those who voted against the first reading, and are voting against the referendum, have full justification from their point of view. I am not going to bit in judgment upon them, nor upon those who say they are in favour of the principle of the referendum, and are going to vote for it, although opposed to the principle of conscription. I am responsible for myself. I intend to accept that responsibility, and want to concede the same right to everybody else. </para>
                    <para>Honorable senators have said, and it has been repeated over and over again outside, that compulsion is undemocratic. I absolutely deny and disagree with that view. All law is compulsion. The ten commandments are compulsion. Most of them begin with the words &#34; Thou shalt not,&#34; and the punishment is not to be merely to the persons who break the commandments, but for a breach of at least one of them, is to extend to the third and fourth generations. If we break the supreme law - the defence of our country and liberty - the punishment will fall, not merely upon us, but on our children to the twentieth and thirtieth generations. </para>
                    <para>Democracy is entirely and absolutely different from despotism, and I often shudder to think what is going to be the fate of Democracy if Democracy will not face the facts. Despotism may silently, gradually, for years in advance, prepare to destroy Democracy, and if Democracy will not take adequate and complete steps to protect itself it i9 wiped off the face of the earth. There can be no advance in liberty, there can be nothing, unless Democracy is prepared to face the facts. The great fact to-day is that we are face to face with the most horrible, bloody, blood-curdling, and revolting war the world has ever seen, greater in its horror and repulsiveness than the sum of all the wars that have preceded it. Are we responsible for it? Had Australia any share in bringing it about? Absolutely none. Are we concerned in the war ? No one can deny that we are vitally and absolutely concerned in it. What was the war begun for? The cry of Germany, who forced the war upon the innocent nations of Europe, was for &#34; a place in the sun &#34; - for world power. Where has Germany a better opportunity to obtain it than in Australia - a whole continent, the richest and most desirable on the face of the earth ? </para>
                    <para>If a nation like Germany, with its despotic power, occupied and conquered Australia she would have the most absolute and complete power that the world has ever known any nation to possess. There is no getting away from that fact. It is the bounden duty of us, who possess this splendid heritage, to see that the structure of Democracy we, have built up here does not fall into the hands or despotism. It is our bounden duty to see that the autonomy ana liberty which we possess are handed down in all their integrity, unimpaired and intact, to our children; otherwise we shall ,prove ourselves totally unworthy of having enjoyed them ourselves. We have in this country, under our free constitution, built up a structure of democratic freedom and progress, industrially, socially, and politically, unequalled in the history of the world. What will become of that splendid heritage if we allow ourselves to be attacked and conquered? The structure we have already built up, the heights of democratic freedom that we have already reached, are as a mere nothing compared with the grandeur of the heights which we may reach if our liberty is preserved to us. Are we going to sacrifice them, or even risk their sacrifice? Others may take the responsibility. I will not. </para>
                    <para>I am not concerned, as some honorable senators seem to have been, about what <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> said or did in England, or what he says or does now. I am not supporting this Bill because it is a Government proposition. Those who have been any considerable time in the Senate know I have never been a slavish follower of any Government, whether it was a Labour Government or not. Some of the most strenuous fights ever (put up in this Chamber against a Labour Government were put up by myself, when I did not agree with them, and if I were in the position of some honorable senators, who are so violently opposed to the Bill, and the principle embodied in it, and occupied a seat on the floor of the Chamber, with the same number of men at my back, I- would put up a fight that would make their present efforts look small. I say this to show that it is not because this is the Government proposition that I am supporting it. I support it because I believe in it, and I shall prove that every Democrat must believe in it. Every law is compulsory. If you have no law, and no compulsion, every man becomes a law unto himself, and you have anarchy. Scientific anarchy may come by-and-by, when we are all perfect, and no man will need any law to control him. That is a considerable way off yet. All law is necessarily compulsion for the good of the whole people. Man has had to a certain extent to surrender his own personal liberty in order to attain the full liberty, well-being, and welfare of the whole of the people of the State. That is society as we know it to-day. Seeing that all law is compulsion, are we, then, to stop short of compulsion when the chief end and the highest function of the State is at stake? Are we to stop short of compulsion there ? To those who say that compulsion is contrary to Labour principles, I would point out that I have been a unionist all my life. I have supported the ideals of unionism when we often had to starve for the faith that was in us, and when some of the men who are now talking so loudly were enjoying the fat of the land. It is absolute compulsion by starvation if you will not allow a man to work unless he joins your union. If he cannot get work he must either beg or starve. We believe in compulsion as applied to unionism, and justifiably so, because it is for the good of every one. It is better far that one should suffer than that the whole should be reduced to sweated and slavish conditions. We apply that compulsion to every walk of life. And yet we are to stop short at the chief end, the supreme function, of our national life, and to say, &#34; Compulsion is good enough for everything else, but in respect of this, the supreme function of the State, it is not.&#34; </para>
                    <para>I am in favour of the application of compulsion to this supreme national emergency, because I believe it is the fair way, the democratic way, and, above all, the socialistic way. When I hear men claiming to be Socialists, and. find that they are Socialists in everything but in respect of the supreme national function, which is defence of national life and integrity, I take leave to doubt if they understand what Socialism really is. </para>
                    <para>All our misunderstanding and recrimination to-day is entirely due to the fact that we in Australia do not realize to the full that we are at war. Nine-tenths of our people are going about  their  daily avocations in exactly the same way as if war were a thing unheard of. Our business people are more prosperous than ever. Our pastoralists, our mineowners, and others are drawing fatter prizes and bigger dividends; and our workers, I think, are as well off as ever they were. They are even better employed than they were in peaceful times. And so the people of Australia do not seem, to realize that we are at war. </para>
                    <para>I have said that I am in favour of the method proposed by the Government because it is the fair way, the democratic way, and, above all, the socialistic way. I am not now approaching the consideration of this subject from the point of view as to whether more men are or are not necessary. That has absolutely nothing to do with the rights or wrongs of the question. The question we have to determine is what is the fair way, the democratic way, and the socialistic way. Dealing first of all with the fairness of the proposed &#39; system, let me say that I have before me a paragraph such as may be read every day in the week in any newspaper that one chances to pick up. This paragraph appeared in the Cairns <inline font-style="italic">Times</inline> of the 13th inst - the last issue to reach me. The Cairns <inline font-style="italic">Times,</inline> which is a Labour paper, and is opposed to conscription, published this paragraph, not with any scare headlines calling special attention to it, but as a mere matter of every-day news, and it is only a fair sample of others to be seen in every newspaper - </para>
                    <para>During the week <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. J.</inline> G. Hoare received word that his younger brother William had been killed in France. Deceased had been wounded in Gallipoli, and had been invalided to England previously. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. J.</inline> M. Bragg, of Charters Towers, who was recently in Cairns on a conference of the engine-drivers and firemen, received word when he arrived in Townsville from here, that his two sons, William and John, had been killed in France. <inline font-weight="bold">Mrs.</inline> Marett,  of Stratford, has received word that her only son has been killed in France. </para>
                    <para>That is what happens under the beautiful system of voluntarism. The first of these men, after bearing the brunt and heat of the fight at Gallipoli, was wounded and maimed, and then invalided to England. On being convalescent he was sent into the trenches in France and there was killed. He had to go twice to the front, was severely wounded, and finally was killed, while there are others who will not go at all. Then we have the case of the unionist returning from a conference with his brother unionists who receives word that two of his sons have been killed. Two brothers in the one family are killed, while other families, with four or five able-bodied sons, have not sent one to the front. Is there anything fair about that? Then we come to the concluding portion of the paragraph. <inline font-weight="bold">Mrs.</inline> Marett,  of &#39;Stratford, hears that her only son has been killed in France. The only son of a widowed mother. And yet you talk of the beauties of your so-called voluntary system - a system which allows one man after being wounded at the front to go back again, only to lose his life; a system which allows one family to send two, four, and even five of its sons to the front, while other families, who have an equal right to share that burden, send none. Is there anything in the way of justice or fair play in that? I have travelled over a large part of Australia assisting in the recruiting movement. Wherever I went in Victoria I heard that the workers had volunteered freely. It is our proud boast, and a true one, that the unionist has come up with the most splendid courage, the most magnificent patriotism, and has volunteered for the front. We heard that wherever we went in Victoria. On the other hand, what did we hear of men who had property, who were well off, and, in fact, independent? We heard of well-to-do farmers&#39; sons - of families of four and five able-bodied sons of military age - not one of whom had volunteered. </para>
                    <para>While at Daylesford I was told of a wealthy farmer with five sons of military age, and so well-to-do that he was able to keep a couple of motor cars. One of his sons was anxious to volunteer, but he was told by his father, &#34;If you go you will never get a penny from me.&#34; This, then, is the beauty of your voluntary system ! </para>
                    <para>I deny absolutely and completely that Australia has sent one man to the front. Australia has found the money - she has found the equipment and the pay - but as to sending a single man to the front, she has not done so. &#39; What has happened is that a great many Australians, to their eternal honour and credit, be it said, have done more than could be expected of them - have maintained the honour of Australia in their own persons, and have done for Australia what Australia has refused to do for herself. </para>
                    <para>Let me come, now, to the next section of my question as to which is the democratic way. Democracy means, if it means anything, government of the people for the people and by the people. Democracy means that every man shall have equal rights, equal privileges, and equal opportunities. Does that not carry with it the absolute obligation, without question and without doubt, that every man must have equal responsibilities and an equal duty to share in all the burdens of his country? Does Democracy mean that it shall be the duty of only some men to fight for their country, for its liberties, and for the maintenance of its integrity - that it is only those who can be induced to volunteer who have that duty imposed upon them? If Democracy means that, then it is something  absolutely  contrary to any conception I have ever had of it. </para>
                    <para>Let us examine for a moment the socialistic way. Socialism, if it means anything at all, means national organization for the carrying out of every national function. It means the Socialization of industry, and the Socialization of production and distribution for the benefit and welfare of the whole. It means organization full and complete in every walk of national life, every function of government, and every function for the welfare of the people. A socialistic State must have an organization thorough and complete, and in it the duty of every citizen must be fully recognised. It cannot be denied that the highest duty of any State is that of protecting itself from aggression. If that be so - and I challenge any one to deny it - must that duty fall  only  on some of the men of the State, and not upon the remainder ? Must it fall only on those high-minded and public-spirited citizens who will jump into the breach and say &#34; We will fight,&#34; while other men skulk behind, in the hope of reaping fat profits or of getting comfortable jobs in the absence of the others who are sacrificing themselves ? There is absolutely nothing socialistic in that. Socialism means full and complete organization for this, the highest of all national purposes, just as it means complete organization for every other national purpose. Those persons who say they are Socialists, but oppose conscription, are in the ridiculous position of favoring individual effort and private enterprise for carrying out the highest national duty or function - individualism run mad ! I said a few moments ago, and I say now, that the highest and the supreme duty of a Democracy is that of protecting itself. Any Democracy which fails to do that will be wiped completely out of existence. </para>
                    <para>We need only turn to the lessons of history for proof of that statement. I suppose most honorable senators have read that classic, Prescott&#39;s <inline font-style="italic">Conquest of Peru.</inline> Long before the discovery of the American Continent, the Peruvians had a civilization of a very high and complete order. They had a wonderful civilization, the remains of which even to-day astonish the archaeologists and the historians of the world. They had the most complete socialistic State the world has ever seen. They had secured this quite independently of European civilization, with which, as a matter of fact, they had had no connexion whatever. It was under a patriarchal form of government - what might be called a benevolent despotism. In taking care of the welfare of their people they fulfilled every complete function of government, with one exception, and that was that they neglected to provide for the defence of their country. Thus it was that when Pizarro went there with his handful of buccaneers and filibusters he conquered their country, although the people met him with outstretched arms and open hands. That socialistic people not only saw their Democracy destroyed and their socialistic State wiped out of existence, but the people themselves absolutely disappeared. Let me read to honorable senators one short passage, which they will find on pages 56 and 57 of the first volume. It shows the sort of society and people they were. Prescott says- </para>
                    <quote>
                        <para>If no man could become rich in Peru, no man could become poor. No spendthrift could waste his substance in riotous luxury. No adventurous schemer could impoverish his family by the spirit of speculation. The law was constantly directed to enforce a steady industry and a sober management of his affairs. No mendicant was tolerated in Peru. When a man was reduced by poverty or misfortune (it could hardly be by fault), the arm of the law was stretched out to minister relief; not the stinted relief of private charity, nor that which is doled out, drop by drop, as it were, from the frozen reservoirs of &#34;the parish,&#34; but in generous measure, bringing no humiliation to the object of it, and placing him on a level with the rest of his countrymen. No man could be rich, no man could be poor, in Peru; but all might enjoy, and did enjoy, a competence. </para>
                    </quote>
                    <para>Where is that splendid civilization now? Where are the people? They are wiped out, because they would not take precautions to defend their country. I appeal to honorable senators to recognise and face the facts, for if we do not the same fate will overtake this splendid Democracy we have in Australia. </para>
                    <para>Who is responsible for this war? Is Australia responsible? Is France responsible? Is little Belgium responsible? If we allow Australia to be conquered, those who say that they are opposed to compulsion, and will (have nothing to do with the accursed thing, will have to submit to the compulsion that was exercised over the women and children of France and Belgium, who were herded away in cattle-trucks to do the work of Germany. Will Australia take that risk? Will Democrats and Socialists take that risk? If so, I am not with them. The future of Australia is dearer to me than any consideration whatever. I would die a thousand deaths, suffer any torture - be hacked into a thousand pieces - lose a thousand seats in Parliament, do anything rather than take the risk of the children of Australia, including my own, enjoying one whit less of the advantages and opportunities of liberty than I have. </para>
                    <para>We have heard all sorts of arguments and suggestions as to how we may avoid war. One, which is put forward seriously, is that we would never have war if we took  a referendum of the people before it was started. It is a very beautiful theory, but like &#34;.the flowers that bloom in the spring,&#34; it has &#34;nothing to do with the case.&#34; The absurdity of the argument can be seen in a moment. Suppose two nations have a quarrel, and they each decide to hold a referendum on the question whether they shall appeal to the dread arbitrament of war. One nation, feeling itself strong enough to conquer, declares in the affirmative, while the other, a peaceful people, vote in the negative. Does that stop the war? No. The most probable result is that the people who voted &#34; No &#34; will be destroyed. The people who say that they will have no war are like the ostrich, with his head in the sand ; they blind themselves to the facts and think the enemy is not there, with the result that he comes along, takes possession of them, and wipes them out. Then there is another point. It is a beautiful theory, but, again, like &#34;the flowers that bloom in the spring,&#34; it has &#34; nothing to do with the case.&#34; When you are attacked, are you going to take a referendum to decide whether you will fight? If a man comes up in the street and gives you a punch in the jaw, are you going to take a referendum with yourself as to whether you will return the blow? The whole idea is so absurd that I am consumed with wonder that people, ordinarily intelligent, should be blinded by prejudice and passion to such an extent that they cannot see the ridiculousness of the position. Other people, and very estimable and good people, say that they opposed to all war. </para>

                            <para>- I shall come to that, and show the honorable senator the absurdity of his position. Every man has in his blood myriads of white corpuscles, whose work it is to preserve him against attack - to shield him from foreign invasion. Every day in the week, and every hour of the day, whether asleep or awake, we are being constantly assailed by myriads of hostile microbes, and it is the duty of the white corpuscles in the blood to be constantly on the watch and frustrate their efforts. You cannot prick your finger or skin anywhere in the slightest degree but myriads of these white corpuscles, which I may call the army of the interior, immediately rush to the place to prevent any encroachment by the hostile invaders. Every drop of drink we take and every bit of food we eat contains those hostile microbes; and were it not for the &#34;army of the interior&#34; not one of us could live. If this &#34; army of the interior,&#34; which exists in the body of the most ardent and fervent anticonscriptionists, were imbued with the same principles, and declared that it would not fight except on the voluntary system, the man who is opposed to all war would not live a single hour. If his descendants, as they probably would, had an army of the interior in their bodies imbued with the same doctrines their children could not live, and so with the nation. We are the army of the interior so far as the nation is concerned. If we will not fight to repel the invader we shall be wiped out as a nation. And our descendants will be degenerate, too. That is an illustration from nature. I defy the most eminent scientist or doctor you can get in Melbourne to deny the truth of it; and it is an absolute and complete answer to those who say that they are opposed to war. </para>

                    <para>I am opposed to war, but I draw a distinction. I am opposed to all wars of attack, and in favour of all wars of defence, for a war of defence is a sacred war. We are now attacked and endangered; and if those to whom I have referred really believed the doctrines they enunciate, they ought to do exactly as I and others did at the time of the Boer war. I did not believe in that war. There was no question of conscription then, but there was the question of volunteers, and of finding moneys and supplies to maintain them. I was a member of the Queensland Parliament at the time, and on the floor of the House I opposed the voting of money, with the result that I lost my seat. I am prepared to bear the same fate now, but on the other side, for there is a mighty difference in the two cases. The Boer war was a war of attack, while the present war is one of defence; and I should like honorable senators to bear that distinction in mind when discussing the matter.- </para>
                    <para>It has been said with a great deal of force that Australia has done enough, and that there is the greater necessity to keep men here in order to insure the economic and industrial well-being of Australia. It has been said that we have done as well as or better than Canada, and that all these are reasons why we should not do any more. Adverting to that illustration of mine with regard to how our bodies are preserved by an army we carry about with us, I would point out that if ever these beneficent white cor&#39;puscles in the blood came to the conclusion that they had done enough we would be &#34; down and out &#34; in five minutes. </para>
                    <para>Let me deal with those arguments seriatim. I give honorable senators full credit for being absolutely sincere in all the arguments they put forward. But while sincerity is a good excuse for them and an absolute justification of their attitude, it is no solution of the question. Byron, in speaking of the sincerity of good people, said - </para>

While I am prepared to give credit for sincerity of motive, as every one must do in this chamber, I say, as a reasonable, and reasoning being, that we ought to face the facts squarely, and, having examined them, come to the logical conclusion to which every intellectual man must come when he is faced by a problem so easy of solution. </para>
                    <para>The danger to Australia from Germany was undeniable, and it was only the prudence and foresight of previous Governments here that protected us from all the horrors of war. At the outbreak of the war we had a hostile German Navy in the Pacific, and it was only the fact that we had one battleship and three or four cruisers, which were sufficiently strong to keep the hostile vessels away from our shores, that averted those horrors. If the Germans had only effected a landing, and had been able to put into the hands of certain people in Australia at the time, a quantity of arms and ammunition, God knows what our fate might have been. Do not forget that in every part of Australia there is a trained military garrison of the enemy only waiting for organization and arms to begin. Never forget that fact, which was boasted about by the Germans, as my honorable friends from Queensland and others know as well as I do. </para>

                            <para>- I shall come to that matter directly. There is another argument - that we have something to fear at the hands of other alien enemies. It is very true that there are constant dangers and menaces threatening Australia, and it would be idle to deny the fact. But one way to secure safety and immunity is to win the present war. We could then defy all the dangers and menaces from any direction; whereas if the enemy wins the war, there is nothing we can do, though we resolve to perish to a man, that can save us. </para>

                    <para>I speak seriously and I speak warmly, because I feel warmly. Australia is everything to me; all I possess and all that is dear to me is here. The country itself is dear to me - dearer than any other country in the world, with the exception of the land of my birth. I am not prepared to, and I will not, take the risk of danger, misfortune, and slavery overtaking this country that I love so well, and in which the future of my children is bound up. </para>
                    <para>Another argument I wish to deal with is that advanced by our anti-conscriptionist friends when they say that the State has no right over a man&#39;s body, and, therefore, no right to say, &#34; You shall go and fight for the country.&#34; I say that the State has that right, full, absolute, and complete, or else it has the further right to say to a man, &#39; &#39; If you will not be faithful to your duties as a citizen in a country which is so good to you, and offers you such splendid opportunities, then clear out of the country. If it is not good enough to fight for, it is not good enough to live in.&#34; I ask those who put forward this argument to say whether the State has any right to supply any men with munitions, or other means to protect his body, if his body will do nothing to protect itself. What right has the Senate to vote money to send any man to protect another who will do nothing to protect himself ? </para>
                    <para>Some honorable senators say that they would not send a single man to the front, and would not assist or encourage men to go, but they overlook the fact that they have incurred the responsibility of sending them to the front by voting the money required for that purpose. If they were really sincere in their opposition to military service and the compulsory power for which the Government are now asking, they would have refused to vote a single shilling for such a purpose. Our good friends the Quakers, the Christadelphians, and others say, &#34; We are opposed to all war. Even if the country is attacked, we deny your right to compel a single man to fight in its defence.&#34; I can understand their attitude. I could understand the attitude of any member of the Senate who said he was opposed to all war, but how those who believe in national organization for national defence can at the same time believe in voluntary defence is something that no one can understand. </para>
                    <para>Compulsory military service is the law of the Commonwealth, and has been its law since we have had a Commonwealth. Every labour man has subscribed to that. We have boasted about it and gloried in it. We have said, &#34; This is one of our achievements.&#34; We have said this upon the platform, and have called upon the people to admire us because we did this glorious thing. Now when the test comes we say we are in favour of it only for home defence. I want to ask: Where does home defence begin and end ? Those who say they will give the State no rights over the body of any man for foreign service have already given the State a right over the body of every man within Australia, and in our territorial waters, that is, up to 3J miles beyond our coasts. </para>

                            <para>- I shall come to that if the honorable senator will allow me. I ask how it can be said that we have a right to control the body of a man for the defence of the country within the country, and miles from its coast, within our territorial waters, and then stop short and say, &#34;You should not go one yard beyond that?&#34; Must we wait to fight until our women are outraged, violated, and murdered, and our little children spitted on bayonets before our eyes ? Why, even an old hen would fight under these circumstances. If honorable senators admit the right to take a man 1 yard beyond 3^ miles from our coast they admit the right to take him 1,000 ir 10,000 miles beyond that limit. Where are we to stop ? </para>

                    <para>What is the chief advantage which Germany possesses in this war ? It is that the horrors of the war have been kept outside her own borders. It is that none of her people have suffered any of the horrors, tortures, and miseries inflicted by the war actually in their presence. That is also the chief advantage which Australia possesses, and we have reason to be everlastingly grateful that that is so. The horrors- of the war are kept away from our own borders, but that is not due to any effort of ours as a nation. It is due to the heroic efforts of the splendid men who have recognised their duty as citizens, and have gone to fight for us. If we enjoy safety in Australia, I remind the opponents of conscription that we owe that safety to the conscript armies of our Mother Country and her Allies. Are we going to exact sacrifices from them in which we are unwilling to share, and to enjoy security purchased by conscription by them when we will not have conscription ourselves? </para>
                    <para>On this question I refer honorable senators to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. W.</inline> Winwood Reade, and what he has to say in his <inline font-style="italic">Martyrdom of Man,</inline> a classic which every Labour man ought&#39; to read. He points out that mankind in all ages have  suffered  in order that mankind may progress. Are we to be the only people who refuse to contribute our share of suffering in order that mankind may progress? I am at a loss to understand the attitude taken up by some people, and I feel that were it not for the prejudice and passion that seem to govern them now, and blow out the light of reason, not one of them would assume such an attitude. Conscription in France, Belgium, Great Britain, and the other allied countries preserves for us the rights and the liberties we enjoy. </para>
                    <para>There are three courses open to us in dealing with this matter. The first is to let the liberty and integrity of Australia take care of themselves - to let them go hang. That is unthinkable. I do not think that a single individual in Australia would listen to such a proposition for a single moment. Another alternative is that we should rely upon the conscripted armies of other countries to preserve our liberty and integrity; and the third course open to us is, while relying on them to help us to maintain our liberty and integrity, that we, at the same time, like manly men, should do our share. </para>
                    <para class="block">That is the third alternative, and the one which Australia, if we are to preserve . our independence and self-respect, must take. It is seriously put forward that no effort on the part of Australia can make any difference in the result of the war. Our friend <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley</inline> told us that the war is already won, and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guy</inline> said that if Australia never sent a single man to the front, the Allies would still secure the victory. </para>

                            <para>- It does not matter, so far as final victory is concerned. I believe, also, that it does not matter; but is Australia, this manly young nation, of whose honour and glory we are proud to boast, and the manly qualities of whose people we claim to be equal to&#39; those of any other people in the world, to occupy the position of a loafer, and let  other  nations make the supreme sacrifice while she makes none? I feel ashamed thai such an argument should be put forward by any manly man. </para>

                    <para>Again, we are confronted with the comparison with Canada. Must Australian manhood, spirit, daring, and patriotism be measured b)&#39; the manhood, spirit, daring, and patriotism of any other country in the world ? I deny it. I absolutely decline to take the standard of any other nation for Australia. We have put up a standard of our own in a hundred directions, and we should put up our own standard in this case. We are told that what is good enough for Canada is good enough for Australia. That is the cry of anti-conscriptionists all round the country. It might come very well from our Liberal and Conservative friends, but it cannot come with consistency or logic from our Labour friends. Canada has not established old-age pensions. Is what is good enough for Canada in that particular direction good enough for Australia? Canada has none of our splendid industrial laws and legislative machinery for protecting an3 alleviating the condition of the workers, or, at least, she has nothing in that direction in any way comparable with what we have. Is what is good enough for Canada really good enough for Australia? Will any man who subscribes to Labour doctrines for a single moment assert such a belief as that? Australia has standards of her own that are the envy of the whole of the civilized people of the world, and are pointed to with pride by reformers in every section of the earth. Yet in this supreme matter of preserving the splendid structure of Democracy that we have built up in Australia, we are told that we should accept the standards of other countries. If Canada had never sent a single man, it would in no way alter my view as to what we in Australia should do. I say that Australia will never have done enough until the war is won. That is the measure of the time when we shall have done enough. </para>
                    <para>We are asked what is to become oF our economic and industrial life, and of all the splendid industries we have built up? I say that it does not matter a straw to us what becomes of them if Australia is conquered. Apparently, that is a risk which some honorable senators would take, however sincerely patriotic we may admit them to be. I say here again, that I do not care a button about their sincerity. What I am concerned about is the effect of the policy they advise, and their sincerity will be no excuse to Australia if, as the result of their advice, we should lose our liberty, integrity, and independence. So much for that aspect of the argument about Canada. </para>
                    <para>There is another aspect of it to which I direct the attention of honorable senators, and that is that Canada is not in nearly the same danger as Australia, and is not running anything like the same risk in this war. As compared with the position which Australia occupies, Canada can afford to sit back and smile. She is sheltered by the broad wing of the Monroe doctrine. She is sheltered by the fact that along 3,000 miles of her border line she has a neighbouring nation of 100,000,000 of people. She is sheltered by the fact that the whole broad Atlantic lies between her and any possible enemy, and on the other side by a nation that has said &#34; Hands off &#34; to every nation in the world. If England were conquered to-morrow, have we any such protection for Australia? Honorable senators know that we have not. Suppose for a moment that the war should unfortunately go against us, and that England were beaten to her knees. Suppose that the prize, or a portion of the prize, demanded for the settlement of the war was the handing over of Australia to Germany. What could Great Britain do? It would cut her to the heart to give up a possession which is so dear to her, and where her children have been striving to build uo a new nation under the Southern Cross. But is Australia any dearer to Great Britain than Alsace and Lorraine were to Prance at the close of the war of 1870 ? Yet France had to give up those two beloved provinces to satisfy the rapacious maw of Germany at the conclusion of that war. If England were beaten to her knees, and that alternative were put to her, what could she do but accede to the demand. Where would Australia be then ? Where would our anti-conscriptionist friends be then ? They would be hiding their diminished heads in the gullies up the bush and in every remote corner of the country they could get to, because when they looked in the face the little children whom they deceived and betrayed, their responsibility and shame would be so great that they would be objects of pity to every one in the world. </para>
                    <para>I hope that such a fate will never overtake Australia, and I am sure that the most ardent anti-conscriptionist cherishes the same hope. It is for this reason we should be prepared for the national sacrifice which every nation must ultimately be prepared to make to preserve its liberty, or it must go down. </para>
                    <para>I want to point out now that conscription is not, and never was, in its origin, a Conservative device. Conscription had its genesis in the revolution of France. When she found herself opposed by a combination of all the powers of Europe, France adopted that method of organization to preserve the liberty for which she had sacrificed so much. That system of the national organization is now known as conscription. By it .France, now honoured by the liberty-loving nations of the world, has been able to maintain her position in the face of the fiercest onslaughts of despotism to this day. Another Democrat upon whom we look with admiration was Abraham Lincoln, who, using conscription as the instrument, freed the slaves of North America. And yet opponents endeavour now to persuade us that conscription is not democratic. Why, it is the logical working of the democratic movement, and the several examples I have quoted, all show clearly and unmistakably that it is the very essence of Democracy. If it be the duty of a country to defend itself, it must be the duty of every individual in that country, and not the duty of only a section of the people, to take part in its defence. _ </para>
                    <para>What position do we find ourselves in now under the present vaunted voluntary system ? We find that while it may be exercised against a poor man, its pressure is not necessarily felt by the wealthy man. It has been stated over and over again that in some instances young men, unable to obtain work, have had no other alternative but to offer their services. Thousands of working men who should not have been asked, have been obliged to go to the front, while thousands who should have been sent there have stayed at home in luxury and comfort. That is the position under this so-called voluntary system. Under it you have unfair conscription by the employers. What we advocate is fair discharge of national obligations by a system of national service under the Government chosen by the whole people. </para>
                    <para>I come now to another argument, which I suppose has some force and more weight with those who are opposed to conscription in the ranks of Labour. It is an argument which, however, lacks force or logic and reasoning, and it should carry no weight with those who desire the welfare of our race. It is that conscription for military service means also conscription for industrial service. Let us examine that argument for a moment. I am not concerned with the Bill itself at all. I have not discussed the measure, and I am not discussing it now, except as a means for national service in our hour of national need. I do not care a straw about the Bill, for I believe it will not affect the situation one way or the other, but I am concerned with the righteousness of the principle for which I am contending. Those who argue that under this Bill conscription for military service means also conscription for industrial ser vice, cannot be sincere, or else they would not entertain the argument which has been put forward, because the Bill distinctly says that the Government are only asking for authority to conscript for military service and for the term of the present war. Those who persist in maintaining any other view are only begging the question, or else are looking for excuses to justify their attitude. </para>

                            <para>- Let me reply to my honorable friend&#39;s interjection. I would point out to him that conscription under a despotism and conscription under a Democracy are two and entirely different things. Conscription under a Democracy cannot be enforced against the wishes of the people, but under a despotism the people would not be asked; the system would be put into operation with a gun and at the point of the bayonet. Do those people who argue that, under this Bill, conscription for military service means also conscription for industrial service bear in mind that the people of Australia are in the enjoyment of a splendid franchise? Do. they bear in mind the fact that our free political institutions make the humblest woman who toils at the wash-tub the equal, politically, of the grandest lady in the land, and the man who sweeps the streets the equal, from a political point of view, of the millionaire? If they remember this can they seriously contend that, under this Bill, conscription for industrial service will follow on the conscription for military service? Such a position will never be reached while Democracy remains. Before that state of affairs can be brought about Democracy will have to be destroyed. In this country of free civil government the people are kings and queens; they can make and unmake governments, and no law can be forced upon them against their will. If any Government dared to attempt the conscription of men for industrial services they would be ejected from office in the shortest possible time. </para>

It has been frequently stated in this chamber during the course of this debate, and elsewhere, that all the Labour organizations outside are against this projected action. It is said with considerable force and truth that instructions have been issued by the  organizations of the different States directing Federal Labour members how they shall vote in connexion with this referendum. I am speaking now, not only as a senator representing Queensland, but also as  president  of the highest political body in Australia - the Inter-State Executive - and I say that no State organization or executive has the right or authority to issue any such instructions, and that the organizations which fathered the instructions have usurped functions and authority which they do not possess. </para>

This question of conscription was not discussed at the last Inter-State Conference. There was a discussion as to which was the proper body to enforce the binding decisions of that conference, and to interpret the platform or questions affecting the platform, and give a decision thereon. I am going to tell the Senate exactly what occurred, for there is no secret about it. Everybody knows what was done at that Conference, because, although it was confidential at the time it was discussed, the information has since been published. At the Inter-State Conference, there was a suggestion to create an Inter-State Executive to discharge the functions I have referred to, and to decide what the party action should be on them. Against this course, it was pointed out with force that a scheme of that kind would be unworkable; that the proper thing to do was, as has always been done, to leave the interpretation of the Labour platform and policy, as well as all questions of fact, in the hands of the Federal Labour members, who could consult and discuss together the various political questions as they arose. It was further agreed that every Federal Labour member was to be bound by the majority decision of the properly constituted Labour Caucus. In addition an Inter-State Executive was created, whose function was to give effect to the binding decisions of the Conference. At the meeting of the </para>

                    <para class="block">That motion was carried in pursuance of the power and authority of the InterState Executive to give effect to the binding decisions of the Conference. Where, in that resolution, is the authority giving the various State executives the prerogative to issue instructions to this Parliament, and to expel members because they will not do their bidding? There would be an end to all solidarity in this party if such a state of affairs were allowed to continue. If we are to have a Federal Labour party, the members of which are subject to six warring and contrary instructions from the several State executives, there can be no cohesion, no co-ordination of action, no unity, and no solidarity in the movement, and we can have nothing in the way of effective legislation or reform in this country. </para>
                    <para>I say, having regard to past experience, that if any branch Labour League in any State were to set itself up as superior to the central State Executive, and as having the right to issue orders to its own particular Labour member for that district without the authority of the executive for the whole State, that branch would be immediately declared bogus and expelled, the only course which could be followed if we are to have solidarity, and to effect any useful purpose! The argument has been dragged into this debate that Labour members and senators are bound. I say they are bound only by the one pledge to carry out the wishes of the supreme Labour authority in Australia when those wishes have been properly ascertained and expressed. They cannot be loyal to two institutions at one and the same time. If that were expected of them, what sort of position would we have in this Senate? A Labour senator from Queensland who voted for the second reading of this Bill would be anathema; he would have committed the unpardonable sin, and probably would be cast out of the State organization; whilst Labour senators from Western Australia, Tasmania, South Australia, and, in some instances, from Victoria and New South Wales would be perfectly honest, loyal, faithful, and worthy members of the Labour party. Such a position would be impossible, and it could be advocated only by men who have given no consideration to the subject, because I cannot imagine any intelligent being giving adhesion to anything so absurd. </para>
                    <para>I thank honorable senators for the courtesy and consideration they have shown me in the very unusual departure I have . made in addressing the Senate while  occupying  the position of  President.  This is the first occasion on which I have trespassed in this fashion, and it was only the supreme gravity of the question that made me depart from that salutary rule that the  President,  occupying, as he does, a semi judicial position, shall not take part in debate. It has been to me a painful and horrifying thought that Australia might be lightly sacrificed because we failed to be fully seized of our duty. I am prepared to repeat on any platform in Australia that I will never send a man to the front to fight for the existence and the integrity of Australia, &#187; and to run the risk of losing his life, when I am afraid to lose my seat in Parliament. I would lose a thousand seats in Parliament rather than that even a risk should be taken that my child, and the other children whose well-being is all in all to every father and mother, shall enjoy the liberties and benefits of our Democracy one whit less than we enjoy them to-day. What does it matter to me, or any of us who have reached advanced age, what becomes of us for the few remaining years of our lives? We have lived full lives, and we have enjoyed all the advantages that Australia could give us - they have been many and great. We are grateful to the people of Australia, and we should be recreant to our duty if we weighed the remainder of our lives as even the weight of a straw in the balance against the future well-being of Australia and its people. Noble sons of Australia are fighting, suffering, and dying to preserve to us the freedom, happiness, and prosperity which we enjoy. The tree of liberty is being nourished by their blood, and is being watered by the tears of their suffering womenkind. Let us prove worthy of their heroic and supreme sacrifice, and let us pray that we, too, may in this great crisis in the history of our country acquit ourselves as men, so that this loved Australia in which we live may have no reason to be other than proud of the stand we take. </para>
                    <para>SenatorPEARCE (Western Australia -Minister for Defence) &#91;12.20&#93;.- I do not desire to traverse the very excellent speeches that have been made, but 1 wish to extend to those who have taken an opposite view to myself my congratulations upon the tone of their addresses, upon the restraint they have exercised, and upon the absence of recrimination throughout the debate. Naturally I have disagreed from the views they have put forward. I think those honorable senators are on false ground, that they are mistaken; but, at the same time, I wish to say that, although I have been a member of the Senate from its establishment, I have never heard, in the whole of that period, a debate that has approached the level of that on this Bill for the serious and thoughtful way in which honorable senators on both sides of the question have dealt with it, and their restraint. May I add, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir, that</inline> I think your speech was a fitting close to such a debate? Every honorable senator has been given full opportunity to express his opinion on the Bill, the principles it contains, and what will follow as the result of the passing of the Bill. It is known that many honorable senators desire to leave this afternoon for other States, and I appeal to the Senate for an opportunity for the Bill to pass before the departure of the trains. It must be recognised that the Bill is of a machinery character, and, if the principle be affirmed on the second reading, it should not take long to pass the measure through all other stages. I wish to thank honorable senators for the way in which the debate has been conducted. </para>

Indeed, when <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Cook</inline> in another place said to the Prime Minister, &#34; Suppose the Bill had not been passed by the date mentioned,&#34; the latter replied that he would then be inclined to find a remedy under the War Precautions Act.

Why has it been decided not to wait for 2 per cent. of votes which may not have been scrutinized instead of 1 per cent. or 4 per cent. ? On the basis of the polling at the last general election 2 per cent. of the votes polled would number 56,230. It might happen that the exclusion of 4 per cent. of votes would still leave a big enough majority to determine the issue. It seems to me that if the Chief Electoral Officer were in a position to state definitely that there is a majority exclusive of any percentage of votes awaiting scrutiny, he might return the writ. </para>

                        <para>.- The Bill as originally introduced disqualified naturalized persons born in countries with which the Empire is now at war ; but it was pointed out that many such persons had sons serving at the wax, or had lost sons on active service, and that therefore they should not be denied the right to vote at this referendum. The sons of these persons will have the right to vote, and it seems fair that the fathers should also be able to vote. There was some difference of opinion on the proposal, but I think that in the majority of cases the sending of a son to fight for the Empire is pretty reliable evidence of the loyalty of the father. </para>

                        <para>. - I do not object to the provision, but there are other persons who, it seems to me, are as much entitled to the privilege of voting at the referendum as those covered by the provisions to which I have referred. For a long while it was the practice of the Defence Department not to accept the son of a naturalized enemy subject. I know a man who was born a Dane in Schleswig, and was a lad when, in 1864, the Prussians took that duchy from Denmark. At the time he was not old enough to understand what was happening, but what he saw of the ravages of the war burned itself into his brain. As soon as he was able to shift for himself, with a hatred for Prussianism which none of us can feel, he quitted his country for Australia. Upon his arrival here he started to earn his livelihood, and has been a reputable citizen ever since. Some time ago his son desired to enlist, and came to the city for that purpose. Certain questions were put to him which he answered truthfully, with the result that he was told that the authorities did not require his services. Why should the father of that young man be disqualified from voting at the forthcoming referendum? Our casualty lists show that there are quite a number of young men born in Australia, but whose parents are of enemy origin, who have offered to make the supreme sacrifice, if necessary, on behalf of the Allied cause. Nevertheless, large numbers of them have been rejected. I wish to cite another instance in that connexion. A friend of mine enlisted, and entered a training camp. He is an Englishman who married an Australian girl whose parents were Germans. As the result of his marriage he had become acquainted with quite a number of persons throughout the State from which he hailed. After his enlistment he wrote to some of his friends, and two of them,  both young Australian natives, endeavoured to follow his example. The father of one of them happened to be a German. This volunteer was accepted and the other was told that his services were not required. It seems to me that under this clause we shall, in many cases, be doing an injustice to parents whose sons were quite prepared to fight for the Empire. </para>

                            <para>- Yes. I know that during the past few weeks the regulations have been relaxed to the extent that if an Australian native, whose parents were born in an enemy country, volunteers for service, he will be accepted so long as the recruiting committee in the district from which he hails is able to vouch for his loyalty. But the fact remains that the services of a very large number of young men who volunteered have been rejected because their parents are of enemy origin. Now those parents are to be disfranchised at the forthcoming referendum, and at the same time these young men will be liable to be conscripted. </para>

                    <para class="block">I am quite prepared to admit that under this Bill no person will be deprived of his right to vote at an election for either House of this Parliament. But many people will be deprived of their right to vote at a referendum. The spirit of the Constitution undoubtedly is that where a man or woman has the right to vote at an election for members of this Parliament, they impliedly have the right to vote at a referendum. To my mind, that was the intention of the framers of the Constitution. If any authority can deprive these persons of that right it is the State Parliaments, and not the Commonwealth. It may be rather an anomaly that the States should be superior to the Commonwealth, especially in a time of grave crisis. But there is the Constitution on the matter, and while I recognise the position of the Government, I question their power, if they respect the spirit of the Constitution, to do what they propose to do. </para>

                        <para>. - Section 41 of the Constitution obviously applies to elections for this Parliament. Now, this Bill does not relate to an election, but to a referendum, and it is not a referendum which is provided for in the Constitution. It is a special referendum. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Mullan</inline> has argued that if certain persons had not a direct right to vote at the approaching referendum, they have the implied right. But if he is going to rest his case upon an implied right he must have some regard for the military position. The defence of the Commonwealth is something more than an implied right - it is an obligation. Whilst there may be an implied right on the part of these persons to vote, there is an obligation thrown upon the Government to exercise our defence powers, and in the exercise of those powers we have framed this provision. </para>

                        <para>. - I think that this clause is clumsily drafted, inasmuch as it provides that the scrutineers employed must be authorized so to act by a majority of members of both Houses of this Parliament. I think that any person who is authorized so to act by any member of this Parliament should be a scrutineer. At an election for this Parliament any scrutineer&#39;s form signed by any candidate entitles such scrutineer to obtain admission to the polling booth, and to act in that capacity. It is ridiculous to say that a majority of members of both Houses of this Parliament should be required to authorize a scrutineer to act. Why should not any honorable senator be able to authorize a person to act as scrutineer? </para>

Any honorable senator has a right to authorize a person to act as a scrutineer, and that is practically what will happen in this case. Any person who, in the opinion of the Chief Electoral Officer, is authorized by a majority of those members of both Houses of Parliament who are not in favour of the question that is being submitted to the people, may appoint one scrutineer at each polling place. In actual practice, any one of the members of Parliament opposed to the question may appoint scrutineers. Who would be likely to object? The Chief Electoral Officer would not object so long as he was satisfied that the member was authorized by a majority of those members of Parliament who are opposed to the question to be submitted to the people. </para>

                            <para>- At the last election there was no difficulty in regard to the issue of scrutineers&#39; forms. In that case each candidate was authorized to issue the necessary authority. In this case the only thing necessary will be the approval of the Chief Electoral Officer in regard to the person who is intrusted with the task of issuing these forms by the majority of members of Parliament opposed to the question on which the referendum is to be taken. Any dispute amongst those opposed to the Bill as to who shall be the person empowered to issue the authorities to scrutineers must be settled by the majority of those members of both Houses who are not in favour of the question. Clearly, the Government could not act as the umpire on such a matter, nor could the Chief Electoral Officer. The provision has been carefully thought out with the view to avoiding trouble. Any member who is opposed to the question that is to be submitted to the people may be selected by the majority of the representatives of a State who are opponents of the question for the purpose of issuing; scrutineers&#39; authorities in his State. if all the representatives of any particular State are supporting the question that is being submitted, then the majority of the representatives of all the States who are opposing the question may appoint some person to issue the forms for that State. </para>

                        <para>. - There will be an envelope as in the case of the absent vote. The name of the voter will appear on the envelope, but the ballot-paper will not be opened. If questions as to the right of an elector to vote are to be decided as the voting proceeds there will be tremendous delay. Therefore, the ballot-paper is enclosed in an envelope, which is placed in a separate box and afterwards investigated by the prescribed tribunal. The envelope is investigated, but the ballot-paper remains unopened, and if the person is found to be entitled to a vote it is dropped into the box containing the valid ballot-papers. </para>

                        <para>. - I hope the honorable senator will not press the amendment. There are two classes bf vessel - the interned enemy vessel not used as a transport but for trading purposes, and those used as transports. We can give this special provision to transports, because they all carry officers under the control of the Commonwealth. The others do not. If we extend it to enemy ships used for mercantile purposes, we ought to extend it to all trading ships. The Government do not see their way to do that. Our own officers can be penalized if they do not regard the conditions we lay down as regards voting ; the others cannot in the same way. The other ships are not entirely left out, as the ordinary Electoral Act provisions apply to them, and there have been no complaints on that ground at previous elections. That Act provides that at .any time within six weeks after the issue of a writ, if any of these ships comes into port and the crew are entitled to vote, they can record an absent vote. This clause applies the provisions of the Electoral Act to the referendum, so that the crews of any ships that are in port, or come here within the six weeks, can record an absent vote. </para>

Why did they not include those under twenty-one in paragraph <inline font-style="italic">a</inline> of this clause ? If a young man is good enough to fight for his country, he ought to be good enough to vote on this question. I realize that probably the majority of these men may vote conscription, but, although an anti-conscriptionist, I would give them the right to vote at the referendum. </para>

                        <para>. - My heart goes with the honorable senator, but my reason is against him. If I agreed to do what he says, we should have to give the vote to returned men under twenty-one years old now in Australia. We should also give it to rejected volunteers under twenty-one, and to others who have been prevented as munition workers from enlisting. The alteration would really involve the question whether the voting age should be reduced. It would be better to do that, if it is to be done, in a general measure than piecemeal. </para>

                    <para>. -  I desire to complete a. statement that I was proceeding to make on the motion for the third reading of the Military Service Referendum Bill when I was prevailed upon by the Minister for Defence to resume my seat. During the debate on that Bill we heard the statement repeated <inline font-style="italic">ad nauseam</inline> by those who are opposed to conscription that they object to conscript human life. And yet, when a sick comrade was lying close at hand, too ill to attend to take part in the division, although he would have dearly loved to do so, those very men who talk about the sacredness of human life, and would not have it subjected to any risk, would have had that&#39; comrade endanger his life by coming here to record his vote. They would not extend to him the courtesy of giving him a pair. They would not play the game. These men, who talk about the sacredness of human life, and say they object to any man being called upon to risk his life, would have allowed a comrade - my comrade, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator George</inline> Henderson - to risk his own life by attending here, rather than give him a pair. On his behalf I enter this my final protest, and say that it is not playing the game. </para>
