                <para>Tho debate on a motion by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McDougall</inline> (N.S.W.) in favour of the establishment by the Government of works for the manufacture of all the electric cables it required was continued by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner.</inline> A motion by the Minister for Works <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Lynch)</inline> to adjourn the debate was negatived by  18  votes to  15;  but almost directly afterwards, when a Caucus member, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Beady,</inline> moved "a similar motion, it was agreed to without discussion. That report is absolutely incorrect. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> rose - after the Minister, and asked me to accept an  Adjournment  of the debate, as he wished to bear the arguments. To that I agreed, and allowed the debate to be adjourned. The <inline font-style="italic">Argus</inline> report makes it appear that my intention was to harass the Government, but it waa nothing of the sort. . I moved the motion some time, ago, so that Ministers had ample time for preparing information in refutation of what I said as to the advisability of establishing the factory. My wish was to get a vote on the question, not to embarrass the Government; but,  at <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen's</inline> request, I was willing to have the matter adjourned. </para>

If we have no business to do, the best course to take is to make a report from the Committee, and leave it to the Government to say whether, in the circumstances, they ought not to move the adjournment of the Senate. We all know what has happened elsewhere, and the only thing for us to do now is for the Committee to report to the Senate, and then for the Senate to adjourn till there is business to occupy its attention. </para>

                    <para>.- I would ask the Minister for Works whether there is any advantage in adjourning until Monday, if when we meet on Monday we shall be in the same position we are in to-day. In fixing the date for the resumption of sittings after the adjournment, I would suggest that as we are nearing the Christmas holidays the Government should take up those measures which have some prospect of being quickly dealt with, and should leave debatable measures until later. </para>

I suppose that most of us would like to spend Christmas at our own homes, but unless I can get away from Melbourne on Tuesday I need not go at all, as I should otherwise be unable to reach the place where I live before Christmas. I would like to know from <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> if it is possible for the Senate to rise on Tuesday. </para>

                        <para>- That may be, but my experience of another place and of the Senate this session impresses me with the fact that meeting does not necessarily mean doing anything. As a matter of fact, Parliament has been sitting for several weeks, and visitors have probably noticed the placards " Galleries full." We might just as well have placed under those notices "Nothing doing." </para>

                        was quite in order in urging as a reason why the Senate should not meet on Monday next, the alleged dilatory way in which the Senate has conducted its business. Any honorable senator is entitled to criticise the conduct of business at any time, so long as he does it in an inoffensive manner.

Yesterday, by way of interjection, I suggested that we should sit to-day in the belief and hope that another place would- have sat late last night and today, and that we might nearly complete the business this evening. I have no objection to the Senate sitting on Monday, but I hope the Minister will give us some assurance that we shall not meet here purposelessly, as we have practically done to-day, but that there will be business to which we may apply ourselves. </para>

                    <para>. - Ministers in this Chamber are entitled to a measure of sympathy. They stand between the devil and the deep sea - I might say many devils. It is well known that honorable senators are anxious to return to their homes, and we met her© to-day with the desire, if possible, to enable them to realize their wish. I assume that when we agreed to do that there was some hope that another place would have made such progress with the business that we should have something to do to-day. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating</inline> asked for some guarantee that there would be work for our attention on Monday. Any guarantee that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> might give must be subject to the frame of mind of another place. On the other hand, if the Minister is not able to give that guarantee, and we adjourn till Tuesday, and another place, in quite a phenomenal fit of energy, did pass some business for our consideration by Monday afternoon,- and as a result of our belated start we had to continue sitting on Wednesday and Thursday,  another set of honorable senators would be inconvenienced. In this matter I can hardly hold the Government responsible for the motion, which, no doubt, was moved for the purpose of meeting the convenience of a majority of honorable senators, but as the Minister is asking the Senate to meet again at 3 o'clock on Monday, it should be possible for the Government to submit to another place as the first business on Monday such measures as are likely to be passed most expeditiously. Last night, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> intimated that there are one or two measures which the Government are desirous of placing on the statute-book before Parliament adjourns. Those measures are not likely to arouse controversy. If the other branch of the Legislature dealt with them first, so that they could be forwarded to the Senate, we could be considering them while the remaining business of the session was being transacted elsewhere. </para>

                        <para>- At the close of every session, the Government are not masters of the situation, and the very best that previous Administrations have been able to do is to assume that certain things will happen in another place.- I can remember, when <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating</inline> filled Ministerial office, that he was similarly circumstanced. I think that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> has made a suggestion  which can be readily accepted by myself and my colleagues. I understand that there are about four Bills which the Government desire to place upon the statute-book this session. At least two* of them are non-controversial, and we can request our leader in the other branch of the Legislature to proceed with those measures  first. They could be at once forwarded to the Senate, and their consideration would occupy us until the remaining; measures had been disposed of elsewhere.. I can assure <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> that we shall, do all that we can to expedite the transaction of business in this regard. </para>

                    <para>. - It is quite plain that we assembled here this morning for the despatch of business, and it is equally plain that an opportunity has not been afforded another place to despatch that business to us. I do not suggest that the other branch of the Legislature is endeavouring to exploit the patience of this Chamber in any way. But, as has been already remarked, it is very difficult for me to give a guarantee that the consideration of business elsewhere will be completed so that it will be available to this Chamber when it reassembles. Whatever happens is the result of circumstances over which we have no control. So long as we are confronted with that position it is obviously impossible for me to enter into any guarantee. What I propose is that we shall meet at 3 o'clock on Monday afternoon, in the confident hope that some business will then be available for our consideration. I am led to believe that in the other branch of the Parliament there are certain measures the consideration of which is approaching finality. But we cannot be sure that at the eleventh hour and fifty-ninth minute something will not happen to prevent that finality being reached. We have, therefore, to choose between the possibility of wasting time by not meeting here till Tuesday and re-assembling here on Monday afternoon on the assumption that business will then be available. This is no new experience in parliamentary life. , The Parliaments of which I have been a member have had a similar experience. In other Legislatures, one Chamber usually blames the other for these delays. Here we think that the Senate is spotless. There is, however, another side to that question. To be brutally frank, the delay on the part of another place in forwarding business for our consideration has been materially contributed to by events which happened in this Chamber quite recently. The present position has been created by a host of circumstances, for some of which we are responsible. We are, therefore, swinging between two alternatives. </para>

                    <para>. - I wish to ask the Minister for Works whether the Government have given further consideration to the question of granting free railway passes to gentlemen who have served twelve months as Commonwealth Ministers of the Crown? Last night the Minister informed me that the matter was under consideration. I wish to be clearly understood in regard to this matter. I consider that it was a wrong step to take when the ex-Minister for Home Affairs issued an order granting free trips to New Zealand to members of the Federal Parliament. I am also opposed to his order granting free railway passes for life to ex-Ministers of the Crown, ex-Presidents  of the Senate and ex-Speakers of the House of Representatives. When the question was raised by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Story</inline> I asked the Minister for Defence what had been done, and he said that the Government had cancelled that portion of the order relating to ex-Presidents  and ex-Speakers, but had decided to grant free railway passes for life to ex-Ministers of the Crown who had served twelve months in office. I am against the whole proposal, lock, stock, and barrel. No ex-Minister of the Crown, ex-President or ex-Speaker should have a privilege in this regard above and beyond that of any private member, and as I would not agree to any order of a Minister of the Crown giving  free railway passes for life to ex-members of this Parliament,. I cannot agree to the granting of the privilege to ex-Ministers. A private member is elected to -this Parliament to do his work, and he is allowed certain remuneration for doing it. A member who is appointed to a Ministerial position is quite properly allowed extra remuneration. Presidents and Speakers come under the same category. They are properly allowed extra remuneration while they hold their positions. But once they no longer remain in their positions the Government should not grant to them something which no other private citizen enjoys. The present Government have retained the ' privilege for Ministers who have served twelve months in -office - most of the present Ministers have been in office for that period. They will be entitled to a free railway pass for life over the railways of the Commonwealth. </para>

If these free passes are confined to the railways owned by the Commonwealth I shall still object to them. I wish to know why the present Government have cancelled one portion of the order issued by the ex-Minister for Home Affairs and re-arranged the matter so .as to give free passes for life to ex-Ministers of the Crown who have served twelve months in office. If it is their determination to do this they can continue the practice until Parliament otherwise -decides, but I shall take every opportunity in my humble way to see that the arrangement is cancelled. </para>

                    <para>. - As one who was a member of the Government when the issue of these passes was agreed to I dissent altogether from the speech of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Needham.</inline> My thoughts have been saddest when I have thought of men who have served their State or their country in the highest positions and have met with an adverse vote from their constituencies. It has always appeared to me that there was not the slightest spark of gratitude in the hearts of the people to whom they had given their services. You have only to mention any distinguished politician in this country for the last fifty years, and you mention a man who has lost his opportunity for making private wealth. The saddest sight I have seen is that of the splendid men who have given all their lives to the service of their country left almost friendless the moment they lose their popularity. If a man loses the opportunity of creating private wealth by private business through serving his country, there should be no.t grudging recognition by the country of his services. The gratitude of Kings and Courts is proverbial; but when Democracy takes over the Government, I hope that some spark of gratitude will be shown for services rendered. I resent the cheeseparing system that refuses to extend to public men who have served their country faithfully and well considerations that nearly all reputable private firms extend to those who have served 'them well in their businesses. There are plenty of firms in this country who grant <inline font-style="italic">si</inline> life annuity to men who have given their lives to the business, and I protest against a man who falls on evil days after giving the best years of his life to the services of his country, being dragged down to the same dull, dead level, and made to travel simply on an equal footing with men who have never thought of anything but their own private interests all the days of their lives. </para>

This is wrong, absolutely wrong. We can run our own show without them; and, besides, most of this stops promotions amongst the Australians. The excuse is that we are not competent for- these positions. This is absurd when none of us have been tried, or very few of us.. </para>

While I shall not reveal the officer's name, I can state that he has recently been promoted from Lieutenant to Captain, so that he has no personal axe to grind..

                <para>I have been advised by cable from Tasmania that the speech made in this Chamber by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Grant</inline> the other night on the Ministerial .statement, and reported in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard,</inline> has been debarred from publication in one section of the press in Tasmania. The <inline font-style="italic">Daily Post</inline> desired to republish <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Grant's</inline> speech and comment on it; but I am told there has been a complete closedown by the Censor at Hobart on the reproduction of the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> report of that speech, and of another made in another place, and also on any comments. When men responsible to the people in the Senate make speeches they are prepared to take the responsibility of them, and if the censorship is to be used to prevent the republication of their speeches in the press, we shall have complete justification for reopening the whole question of the censorship in this Chamber. What has happened is unfair, and calculated to create discord and suspicion of the worst possible kind. </para>

Any harm that may be done by it -has already been done by the making of the suggestion, and no withdrawal can alter it. It was, however, a most improper suggestion, because there has never been any  censoring of <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> If' anything has been kept out of <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> it has been only with the consent of the member who made the speech. That has been known to honorable members of both Chambers for over twelve months. </para>

                        <para>- Then we had better bring the censor right in here ! Once a statement is reported and published in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> it is absurd to prevent a newspaper making an extract from that report. I protest against these methods, which are calculated to bring our censorship into disrepute, and to engender amongst the people a dangerous feeling of suspicion. I hope that the Minister will look into this question. In order that he may thoroughly understand the position, let me say that I understand from the cablegram I have received that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Grant's</inline> speech referred to what is known as the Goulburn cases - cases affecting a number of soldiers. The speech in the other House, which is referred to in the message received by me, probably had to do with the -same subject. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> will be able to call for a report from the censor, and give us next week, I hope, the reasons why this drastic course was adopted. I shall certainly want more reasons for this action than have so far been given to the editor of the <inline font-style="italic">Daily Post.</inline></para>

                <para>There is another matter that I should like to bring before <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch.</inline> I have had a good many letters from the front complaining that men there are not being paid' the full amount of pay which they should receive after providing for their allotments here. I have always discounted statements of this kind, because I am aware that misapprehensions often occur. I have never had a sufficiently specific case of this kind to bring before the Minister, but I have here a letter from the front addressed to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Long</inline> - who is on the State "War Council, and who, unfortunately, is laid aside with severe illness - which is very definite. I do not know whether or not the statements are correct, but the letter sets out clearly and fully what has previously been put before me. That being so, I shall read this letter and ask the Minister to cable at once for a report - </para>

                    <para>In the Field in France, 16th October, 1916. </para>
                    <para>Dear Senator Long,</para>
                    <para>I suppose you will be surprised to hear from the undersigned. It is not a " lawyer's letter," but a request for you to do something for the boys who have come away. I want <inline font-style="italic">to</inline> acquaint you with something in connexion with, the rates of pay paid to the Australian Infantry Forces on active service, which is a breach of faith with the men, and should, I venture to think, be rectified. If you agree with me I am sure that you will do what you can to put the matter right. Shortly, it is this : The Commonwealth contracted to pay those enlisting a stipulated sum per diem. The men trusted its word and made their arrangements accordingly. When the men get away from Australia the military authorities throw them over and pay them what they like. I have tried to get the matter rectified by discussion with officers, but they cannot, or will not, see that any wrong is being done. </para>
                    <para>I hope I won't weary you, but I would like to set the matter out a little more fully. The Commonwealth called for volunteers and offered to pay those who answered the call a certain amount of pay. The sum varied according to the branch of the Army one was drafted to. The minimum rate was 6s. per diem. For some ranks it was 7s., and for others 8s. per diem. These were the rates offered to men below the rank of noncommissioned officers. Non-commissioned officers were to get a higher rate. It will be sufficient for the present purpose to take the case of a private. The Commonwealth contracted to pay him 6s. per diem. The whole 6s. was not to be immediately available - ls., per diem, it was stipulated, should be held by the Commonwealth for a period, and be paid some time in the future. That sum is what is known to us as our deferred pay. Again, the balance 5s. per diem might be subject to an allotment. Before leaving Australia, or while on active service, a soldier may have directed that either the whole or a portion of the 5s. per diem should be paid to a third party. The balance, after deducting the deferred pay and the allotment, was to be paid to the soldier in the Field. </para>
                    <para>That was the contract on which the men enlisted. It is the contract set out in their pay books. The amount immediately payable(that is, from time to time) to the soldier is there referred to as the " net daily rate <inline font-style="italic">for- issue."</inline> Take the case of a man who has allotted 2s. per diem. His " net daily rate for issue " -will be 3s. per diem, but the Commonwealth won't pay it to him. An order or regulation has been issued by the military  autho- </para>
                    <para>Titles fixing a scale of payment for the various ranks without regard to the Commonwealth's contract with the men. According to that scale the maximum amount to be paid to a private is 40 francs per fortnight, which, at the present rate of exchange, works out at £1 8s. 8d. per fortnight, or 2s. 4-7d. per diem. That is to say, a man to whom the Commonwealth Government has agreed to pay 3s. per diem is underpaid 13s. 4d. per fortnight- </para>

                    <para>There is another grievance with which I desire to deal. Between Tasmania and the mainland, we have a contract mail service, under which the freights and fares have been fixed at certain rates. As the result of a good deal of agitation in this Chamber, the last mail contract to be signed had inserted in it a provision by which these freights and fares cannot be increased without the consent of the Commonwealth Government. Clause (i) of section I. reads as follows : - </para>
                    <quote>
                        <para>That the contractors will not without the approval of the Postmaster-General increase the rates freight and/or passage money existing at the date of the execution thereof. </para>
                    </quote>
                    <para class="block">In other words, it is provided under that contract that there shall be no increase in freights or fares without the consent of the Postmaster-General. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Keefe, Senator Long,</inline> and I fought bitterly to get that clause included in. the contract, and we had the impression that the people would then be protected, but what has been done by the company ? When the coal strike started they refused to issue return tickets, and issued single tickets, which resulted in an increase of 10s. 6d. for the return journey. Under the old scale a return journey cost £2 12s. 6d. The single fare is £1 lis. 6d., so if you double the single fare you get £3 3s., or 10s. 6d. above the ordinary return fare. A deck cabin return fare costs £3 2s. 6d., and now a deck cabin single fare is £1 16s. 6d. Double that and" you get' £3 13s. It would seem, therefore, that by issuing two single tickets, where formerly the company issued one return fare, they mulcted the people of an extra half -guinea. </para>

I am, therefore, asking the Minister to insist, at once upon a return of this extra half-guinea to those people who have been obliged to pay it. The fare is too high now, arid the line is one of the most profitable in the service of the Union Steam-ship Company. Their dividends have increased, and now, by an indirect back-door method, they are penalizing the people who travel on the Tasmanian route. Their action cannot be too strongly condemned. </para>

Members of the Commonwealth Parliament are- in the same position, because they have to pay an extra 10s. 6d. for the return trip, and even if we do get a refund thousands of people throughout) Australia who have travelled by boat during the last few weeks will not be recompensed. I urge that strong steps shall be taken against this company for their underhand method of mulcting the people at the time when everything was dislocated by the coal, strike, and if the Government take no action, I can promise that a good deal more will be heard of it in this Chamber. The company could have continued issuing the return tickets even during the coal strike, because such tickets are available for six months, and even if passengers could not have returned as promptly as in other circumstances, many of those who made the trip to Tasmania would not have felt inconvenienced. </para>

                    <para>There is another subject to which I wish to refer. In Tasmania we have in existence a Prices Commissioner, and the Commissioner, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. G.F</inline> . Martin, has been doing excellent work. I have with me some samples of Tasmanian flannel, the best in the Commonwealth, because the three woollen mills in that State have not the machinery for mixing cotton, and so they turn out the best flannel in the Commonwealth. I sold' thousands of . yards of it myself when in business. It used to cost me ls. 1½d. wholesale and I retailed it at1s 3d. a yard. When war broke out, this flannel was required for military contracts, and the Government commandeered the output at ls. 5d. per yard, from the Waverley Woollen Mills, in. launceston; Johnstone Brothers, of Hobart; and Aiten and Sons, also of Hobart. It was a very fair price to pay; but, subsequently, as there was a great scarcity of flannel in Tasmania, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Long'</inline> approached the Government to release some of the flannel for the use- of miners in the cold west coast country. Later on, the military demands eased off, and a quantity of this flannel was released for the general public. But what have the people of Tasmania to pay for it? For flannel of the sample which I have- with me,, and which I retailed at ls. 3d. a yard, they have now to pay 2s. 6d. a yard. This is an infamous attempt, by men who call themselves patriots, to' exploit the general public. </para>

                            <para>- In my opinion, the price paid by the Government was high, and evidently it paid the firms well or we would have heard a lot about it. But I am sure the Minister will agree that firms should not be allowed to charge the public 2s. 6d. - an increase of ls.1d. per yard - for the same quality of flannel that the Government bought for military purposes at ls. 5d. The Minister should cable to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Martin,</inline> the Prices Commissioner, and ask' him to have an immediate inquiry into the price of flannel in Tasmania. </para>

                        <para>. - I wish to bring under the notice of the Government the fact that, in New South Wales, there are many returned soldiers without employment. Each Sunday there is in the newspapers of the metropolis a long list of the men wanting employment. Last Sunday there were 269 names in this list, and more than half of them were names of married men, and 25 per cent, of them were names of men with three or more children. They are appealing for employment to the patriots of Australia, but they should not be forced to do this. It is the duty of the Government to see that men who have served the country at the risk of their lives, and in some cases have been maimed, are given work. I draw attention to the claims of a section with many of whom I am personally acquainted, the motor-drivers. The Government has in its employment men who have never volunteered for active service, and who tell me that they have been asked not to volunteer. On the other hand, there are returned men who are competent motor-drivers, who have driven motors on active service, and are pleading to the patriots of Australia to employ them. While there are so many unemployed returned soldiers, the recruiting scheme of the Government cannot prove successful. I wish the recruiting to be successful, and it is in the interest of the campaign and of the nation, as well as of the men themselves, that I call attention to this matter. Work should' be found for our returned soldiers by some of our loud-voiced patriots who were calling us nasty names during the referendum campaign. Another matter to which I draw attention is the dismissal of mechanics and others at Cockatoo Island Dockyard. I understand that this has been necessitated by the want of material ; but work could be found for the men in the manufacture of munitions of war. This would employ quite a number. We have the ' necessary steel, and the Government should find employment for the whole of these- men, if possible, and for the machinery. While workmen have been dismissed, however, none of the staff has been sent away, and there are now nine managers on Cockatoo Island with no men to manage. Their services might also be utilized in the manufacture of munitions of war. </para>

                            <para>- I do not ask for the dismissal of those connected with the staff, but I desire that work should be found for them and for the men. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ready</inline> has drawn attention to the fact that Imperial officers are replacing Australian officers in the Australian divisions, and that this is causing great discontent. As one who has been as near to the front as it is possible to get, and has mixed with many Australian officers, I say that there is great discontent from the cause named. I find fault with the military authorities in Australia for not exercising greater control over the Australian divisions. I know of four able-bodied colonels who have been returned to Australia, though quite fit to command. One colonel returned to Western Australia served through the Gallipoli campaign and at Poziéres. He was ordered to return to Australia, and pleaded with the authorities to tell him why, and to give him a chance. He asked for a court martial, but he could get no information as to why he was being sent back. </para>

                            <para>- No. I brought the case under the notice of the Minister for Defence, but he said he was powerless to interfere. I object to that sort of thing. The authorities in Australia should have power to remedy cases of this kind. This colonel was an able-bodied man, who was beloved of his soldiers, who call him the.. grand old man, or the good old man. He seems to have been too good to them, because he was shifted. I understand that he is going back on a transport at reduced rank, and is to be given an opportunity to plead his case before the British military authorities, and to ask for fair play. We should have given him that here. Our authorities should be able to deal with such a case. But their powers have been usurped by those on the field. This may be proper in many instances, but when our men are subjected to treatment like that meted out to this officer, they have a right to be tried -for any offences with which they may be charged. Charges should not be trumped up against them, and they should not be sent back here in disgrace on such charges. Another matter among many that require rectifying is the delay in paying the men, although the officers are paid promptly. There should be a civil commission appointed to inquire into all these things. To make a speech ' about them here does little good. I have pleaded with the Department. On my return 1 sent a letter to the Department, appealing to be heard on behalf of these men. I. said that I had a number of cases to put forward. But -I have not received a reply to that letter yet. I shall have to say these things before the public, but I should prefer to say them here, because I wish to have matters rectified in the proper way. When I was on my way out here, the men on the steamer pleaded with me to intercede for them, so that they might have a run ashore at Capetown. They 'were allowed ashore, but without a shilling in their pockets, although some of them had as much as £100 owing to them by the Department. The officials were willing to assist these men, but they could no nothing under the regulations. While the officers got their pay before they went ashore, the privates had to go without a shilling. This, of course, may have been a good thing for some of the men; but there were others quite capable of taking care of themselves, amongst them, for instance, a commercial traveller from New South Wales, who earned, I suppose, in private life a salary of over £500 a year. However, this man, amongst others, had to go ashore without a "bean", to bless himself with ; and, as a matter of fact, the men have had to plead for money with which to buy even cigarettes. I had not intended to mention all these matters, but really it is almost a duty that we owe to these boys to make the facts public. I urge upon the Government to do their utmost to afford employment, especially for those for whom places can be found in the Public Service. </para>

                        <para>. - I wish to make my position clear, in view of a little misunderstanding which arose over a question I asked earlier in the day. The Minister for Works rather took exception to my remarks when I said that some persons in prison under the proclamation had been released owing to " influence." I wish to repeat that I did not use that word in any offensive sense. I merely meant that some men had been released because of the fact that their cases had been brought prominently before the Defence authorities by members of Parliament and others. </para>

                            <para>- I am not arguing that point, but merely replying to the interjection of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Needham.</inline> Men have been released from .custody, and rightly I think, because the proclamation lias been withdrawn. For instance, men prominent in the public eye, like John Curtin and the Brothers Grant - in whom I interested myself - have, I understand, been released. At the same time, there are other men still in gaol for the same crime, if it be a crime, that those whose names I have mentioned committed. , </para>

                            <para>- No man is infallible. I have been told that there is some connexion between the Defence Department and the speeches made by honorable members of this Parliament. I understand that if a member says something which the Defence Department fears may be injurious in some way, the Department may write to that member, and, if he consents, may excise from the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> report the words in question. It may be that, owing to the existence of some such arrangement, the idea has got abroad that there is a sort of censorship. I shall again go carefully through the speech I made, and, as I say, take an opportunity next week of referring to certain statements, which, by some means or other have not got into <inline font-style="italic">Hansard.</inline> It is, of course, possible that I was speaking too rapidly for the reporter to take the words down. In making that suggestion I do not wish in any way to suggest that the reporter is to blame. </para>

                        <para>. - <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ready's</inline> references to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Martin,</inline> the Prices Commissioner for Tasmania, have afforded me the opportunity of saying that the object in the appointment of these Commissioners is to protect the public against exploitation. I am glad that the matter has been mentioned, because I wish to say that, whenever honorable senators are informed of a specific case of exploitation by overcharges, they will greatly assist the Department if they bring the case immediately under the notice of the local Prices Commissioner, and the Government will greatly appreciate their action. After inquiry, the Commissioner reports to the Minister, who will take whatever action may be necessary. I shall not refer at length to the matter of the censorship which has been raised, but I may mention that recently, when <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Grant</inline> was giving the Senate a statement concerning a number of soldiers who have been sentenced to various terms of imprisonment, I happened to be in the gallery with a returned .Victorian soldier, who is favorably known to all the Victorian senators, and whose word will bt taken by them. He had come back a; one of the officers in charge of the men to whom <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Grant</inline> was referring, and while the honorable senator was reading their letters he said to me, in a humorous way, " My God, Ted, I came back in charge of some of those men. If you only knew them !" </para>

                            has referred to the free railway passes issued by my predecessor in the Home Affairs Department. Information was given to the honorable senator at a time when the matter had been partially considered by the Government. For perfectly obvious reasons, we have not had the time to give attention to such trivial affairs. The Government are called upon to solve problems with which no other Government has been confronted. We are in the position to-day of chief salesman for nearly every primary product of the country. I thoroughly indorse the statement made by
                            <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline>
                            with reference to the privileges granted to public .men. I firmly hold the opinion that the public men of this country are given too few rather than too many privileges. I have never let an opportunity pass, whether in the Western Australian or in the Federal Parliament, of voting for a proper recognition of public men, either in the way of salary or privilege. I believe that the people of Australia are given exceptionally honest service by her public men. On the other hand, the people are somewhat prone to neglect public men when, as the result of untoward circumstances, they are thrown on the scrap heap, and are turned down at an election. Much has been said about the issue of free passes, but it is only a twopenny-halfpenny affair.

There is some reason to believe that they have been hasty in voicing complaints in Parliament, or through the press, and this has militated against successful recruiting in Australia. I presume to advise honorable senators, if I may, that they should be very chary of championing any case unless they have absolutely good grounds for believing that it is a just one. They should not forget that even an ordinary sheet of paper has two sides. We have an officer in command of the Australian section in whom the utmost confidence is reposed. </para>

                            <para>- That is a matter which should be kept in mind before honorable senators associate themselves with complaints that are made. After all, there may be a good explanation of what is complained of. Though I say this, I shall, of course, refer the complaints that have been made to the proper authorities for inquiry, out of respect to the representations of 'honorable senators. In reference to the increase in rates and fares on the steamers trading to Tasmania, if, on inquiry, it is found that the company has violated the terms of the  contract, it will be made to toe the scratch and account for its actions. I see no reason why there should be any differentiation .between the treatment of a company, which -is a collection of individuals, and the treatment, of the humblest individual in the land. </para>

                            <para>- <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ready</inline> referred to the British authorities withholding some of the pay due to Australian soldiers. That matter will receive the attention of the Defence Department as soon as possible. I hope the honorable senator will realize that there must be some reason for the differentiation, but whether that reason furnishes a sufficient justification I am not prepared to say. The honorable senator is quite aware mat the rates of pay fixed for the members of the Expeditionary Forces will be adhered to, no matter what happens. There is no suspicion that the pay has been actually reduced, because that has not been even thought of. </para>

                            <para>- Then the complaint is merely that portion of our soldiers' pay, in excess of what is paid to the British soldier, is being deferred. The matter will be brought under the notice of the Defence authorities, and an attempt made to rectify the grievance, if possible. The statements in regard to the fixation of prices have been replied to by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Russell,</inline> who appointed the gentleman in Tasmania, whose business is the revision of prices in that State. There is no need for further reply by me. I was pleased to hear the testimony of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ready</inline> that the work done by that gentleman is giving satisfaction. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McDougall</inline> dealt with the grievances of returned soldiers in New South Wales who had not received the consideration which they were led to expect. I am not aware of the actual position in New South Wales, but it is the duty of the Government to see that any promises given to our soldiers are honoured to the last letter. </para>

                            <para>- The question arises whether it is within the proper domain of governmental action to compel private employers to give employment to returned soldiers who, prior to enlisting, had been in their employ. My own opinion is that the Government have no authority to do that. We can only exercise moral suasion; but if specific cases can be mentioned of returned soldiers having been refused employment by those firms with whom they were formerly employed, the duty will rest upon the Government to make a special appeal to those firms. </para>
