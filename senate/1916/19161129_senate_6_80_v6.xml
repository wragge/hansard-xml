                    <para>In regard to September and October, enlistment during these two months was doubtless stimulated by (the announcement of the Government's intentions, and by the issue of the proclamation under the Defence and War Precautions Acts. </para>
                    <para>It seems hopeless to expect that we can by voluntary enlistment raise 16,500 per month, but we propose to do the utmost that voluntary enlistment is capable of. </para>
                   <para>In the past, voluntary enlistment has been conducted by voluntary organization, and the Government now proposes to supplement voluntary organization by a permanent and paid organization throughout the Commonwealth. </para>
                    <para>The weakness of the voluntary organization has been that in some districts, where there were considerable numbers of men available, but very little enthusiasm, no organization was formed to stimulate recruiting, with a result that there was a very poor response to the call for recruits. In other districts where a good organization was in existence, splendid results were obtained, in some cases the whole of the single men of fighting age coming forward. </para>
                    <para>The work of directing recruiting throughout a campaign covering the whole of Australia obviously calls for the entire time' and effort of the man who is directing it. It has been impossible for the Minister for Defence, owing to his multitudinous duties, to give a great deal of. his time to this important work in the past, and it is, therefore, proposed to appoint a Director of Recruiting, who will be responsible to the Minister,, but will take complete charge of all matters relating to voluntary enlistment. Under him will be an organization covering the whole of Australia, particulars of which are as follows : - </para>
                    <para>Central Head-quarters. A Director of Recruiting to be appointed under the Minister. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. D.</inline> Mackinnon, M.L.A., of Victoria, has been offered and has accepted the position in an honorary capacity. The Director will be in close touch with the Military Secretary on all matters affecting recruiting. He will visit each State, arrange and perfect organization, obtain full co-operation of Federal and State members of Parliament and local organizations, and generally arouse public interest. </para>
                    <para>State Head-quarters. A Central Recruiting Committee will be organized in each State, containing one Federal member or more, one State member or more, and civilians. Their staff will consist of the Military Director of Recruiting, who will be the officer in charge of recruiting on the staff of the District Commandant, and. such clerical assistance as may be required. </para>
                    <para>District Organization. Each Federal electorate of the House of Representatives to be a recruiting district; each member of the House of Representatives will be <inline font-style="italic">ex officio</inline> chairman of the District Committee. He will act under the State Central Committee, and will form such committees as are practicable. The Federal member will invite the cooperation of the State members within his division, of the local governing bodies and their organizations. The Military Registrars appointed under the recent proclamation in each Federal division, or such of them as are suitable, will be the district recruiting officers. They will be supplied with such, clerical, assistance as may be necessary, and under the direction- of the State Committee will make all arrangements for meetings,. recruiting arrangements, medical examinations, and the forwarding of recruits. </para>
                    <para>Organizers. Organizers may be appointed if found necessary, but they should, as far as possible, be suitable discharged returned soldiers appointed as civilians, civilians not eligible for active service, or civilians who, having volunteered for active service, have been rejected. </para>
                    <para>The Government appeals to every member of the Federal Parliament, whatever his views may be, to give the utmost of his time and interest in making this scheme a success, with a- view to supplying as many as possible of the recruits required. It appeals to members of the State Governments and Parliaments to cordially co-operate with the Federal organization in this work. It also appeals to all local governing bodies, and all patriotic organizations of every kind, to assist to their utmost. By the location of recruiting officers in each Federal division with the necessary clerical staff, it is hoped to have an organization that will keep alive public interest throughout the Commonwealth in the stimulation of recruiting. The Government also appeals to the people of Australia to realize the absolute necessity, in the interests of Australia, of the Allies winning this war. It points to the statements of British statesmen and military leaders that the utmost man power of the whole of the Empire is required to that end, and it asks all sections to sink their differences of opinion and work unitedly to this common end. The Government asks every citizen to do his utmost to make the scheme a success. I lay the statement on the table and move - </para>

                        <para>- I have no knowledge as to any of the statements included in the honorable senator's questions. I am not aware in any case that such prosecutions come under the Defence Department. Disturbance at a public meeting is an offence against the Electoral Act, and, that being so, such prosecutions would be under the Minister administering that Act. I suggest to the honorable senator that he might direct his questions to that Minister. </para>

                            <para>- In order to remove a misapprehension which has evidently been created by some garbled report of the Prime Minister's statement, I wish to say that that statement had relation' to those men who were called up under the recent proclamation, and who were then in camp. It referred only to the Australian Imperial Force Camps, and not to the camps of the Australian Military Forces. </para>

                            <para>- The statement to which the honorable senator alludes was made many months ago to meet the convenience of farmers and others who follow seasonal occupations. Men were then informed that, if they chose to enlist, they could submit themselves to medical examination, and if they emerged from it satisfactorily they could fix a future date on which they would enter camp, thus affording them an opportunity to take off their crops in the interim. But they were distinctly given to understand that, when once they had entered the training camps, no further release from duty would be granted. </para>

                            <para>- It is quite possible. The procedure is that each State, as far as possible, has to provide its own reinforcements. It is quite possible, therefore, that in some of the States men in the Australian Military Force camps have been despatched overseas before others who had enlisted in the Australian Imperial Force. </para>

                        <para>. - I should like to seize the opportunity, which was not presented at the normal time, of offering a few words of congratulation to the new Minister who is present to-day. It is customary for such congratulations to be offered when the Minister representing the Government announces the changes that have taken place, but for obvious reasons that course could not be followed to-day, because the Minister for Defence, after announcing those changes, was immediately obliged to proceed with his statement of the future war policy of the Government. Therefore, it was impossible for me to do then what I wish to do now on behalf of the whole Senate, namely, to offer congratulations to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> on his elevation to Ministerial rank. However much we may differ in our opinions on political questions, every honorable senator has the best of personal good wishes for that honorable gentleman, and trusts that he will succeed in adding to his public laurels by his achievements in the Works Department. </para>

                        <para>. - I have to thank <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> and those who joined with him in the congratulations which he has extended to the new Ministers, for singling me out for a special share of them. I assure the honorable senator and the rest of the Senate that I shall endeavour to do my best to discharge the responsible duties that will fall to my lot as the first Minister for the new Department of Works and Railways. If my endeavours fail, it will not be for want of trying. I have been a fair trier in the past, and if on this occasion I fail it will not be for want of a conscientious effort to discharge my duties faithfully, fearlessly, and fully. </para>
