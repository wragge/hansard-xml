                    <para>. - I ask the Assistant Minister, who is in charge of the wheat scheme, what are the prospects of the wheat growers getting their extra sixpence? Is the Minister impressed with the fact that the payment of that 6d. is vital to the putting in of a much larger area of wheat for the next season than: will otherwise be possible? </para>

                    <para>- I can assure the honorable senator that the prospects of the wheat growers securing the extra 6d. are first-class. The only difficulty is as to the time at which it can be paid, and on that point the only assurance I can give the honorable senator is that the Wheat Board will make the 6d. payable at the earliest possible moment, according to the condition of their funds.

                        <para>Whether, in view of the fact that the Acting Prime Minister cabled to the Imperial Government expressing deep regret at the Irish Rebellion, and intimating that representative Irishmen here had denounced and repudiated it, he is now prepared to again cable to the Imperial Government informing them that the Irishmen to whom he referred in his former cable deeply deplore the hasty and wholesale execution of Irish revolutionaries, and regret that their countrymen are not receiving that clemency which was shown to the rebels in the recent South African revolt?</para>

						<para>In view of the attitude of the Government of the United Kingdom on this question, as reported by cables appearing in the Australian press, and of the fact that the Prime Minister, Mr. Asquith, is now visiting Ireland to inquire into the whole matter, the Government think it inadvisable to send such a message at the present time.</para>
