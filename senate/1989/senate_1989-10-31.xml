<PARA>To the Honourable the President of the Senate and the senators in Parliament assembled:</PARA>
<PARA>The humble petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth:</PARA>
<PARA> That every abortion kills an unborn human baby.</PARA>
<PARA> That the right to life of all humans is the most fundamental and essential of all human rights.</PARA>
<PARA> That in 1987-88 the Federal Government paid $6.4 million from taxpayers funds for 61,879 abortions under Medicare Items 6469 and 274/275 alone.</PARA>
<PARA> That in the same year Federal Government grants to the States indirectly financed the deliberate killing of thousands of other unborn babies in State Public Hospitals.</PARA>
<PARA> Your petitioners therefore humbly pray that the Australian Parliament will carry out its duty to protect the right to life of Australian babies and abolish Government funding of abortion.</PARA>

<PARA> (b) notes in particular:</PARA>
<PARA> (i) the latest arrogant rejection of any discussion of the proposal which could regain adequate Australia-wide services,</PARA>
<PARA> (ii) the total disregard and lack of concern for the vast, long-term disaster that the lack of resolution is having, particularly on the tens of thousands of smaller businesses already insolvent or facing insolvency,</PARA>
<PARA> (iii) the enormous disruption to the ordinary private individual Australian, particularly those whose need of air travel involves such personal family issues of sickness, death, weddings, etc.,</PARA>
<PARA> (iv) the selective subsidising of the 2 highly profitable airline operators in such a manner as to ensure that the disruption will not only continue but produce even worse financial disaster to all the other thousands of businesses not subsidised but also suffering, and</PARA>
<PARA> (v) that the Prime Minister's position, noting particularly his long and close relationship with Sir Peter Abeles in a business and personal way, makes him unsuitable to be involved in the direction of the issue;</PARA>
<PARA> (c) calls on the Government to have the parties in the dispute, in the interest of all Australians, come together with no preconditions, threats, or writs to see that full domestic services free of charters, retirees, conscripts, servicemen or others, be restored within 7 days; and</PARA>
<PARA> (d) considers that should such action by the Government not be possible, or should the parties be unable or unwilling to participate in such action, then the Government should call on Sir Peter Abeles to proceed with his undertaking to sell Ansett Airlines, and call on the undertaking by the Prime Minister that if he was not able to secure a settlement of the dispute he would resign, to do so forthwith.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In directing a question to the Minister for Finance, I refer to the front page article of today's Sydney Morning Herald in which the Minister for Social Security is quoted as saying:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>In April this year you got the largest tax cuts in history. Massive. $5.8 billion . . .</PARA>
<PARA>The Minister goes on:</PARA>
<PARA>And probably in a tax-wage trade-off next year you'll get something of the same order. All paid for.</PARA>
<PARA>I repeat those words:</PARA>
<PARA>All paid for.</PARA>
<PARA>If we set aside that part of any such tax cuts which merely involves returning to taxpayers the proceeds of bracket creep during the current financial year, I ask the Minister how the remaining roughly $3 1/2 billion of such tax cuts will be financed. Will the Minister give an assurance that full details of the required $3 1/2 billion offsetting expenditure cuts will be given at the time of any such announcement?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is exactly what I was going to say, Senator Collins. Fancy anybody on the other side of the House having the effrontery to call anybody else a squib. Who were the squibs? Who left government with a prospective Budget deficit of $10 billion, 5 per cent of gross domestic product (GDP), as Senator Stone told them at the time? Who are the squibs? There were five Howard Budgets in which outlays exceeded the Budget estimate every year-a Budget deficit every year.</PARA></TALK.START>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="TJ4">Senator WALSH</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Very well, Mr President. Any suggestion that this Government needs to enter into a shabby bidding duel on tax cuts is, of course, clearly ridiculous. The Opposition tried that one back in 1987 when it came in and said that it would give everybody $50 or $60 a week in tax cuts. I have forgotten what the exact tax cuts were. One of the Opposition's former, more rational and more honest colleagues, the former member for Moore, had previously written that any party that promises tax cuts-this was in the 1987 context-in excess of a few dollars a week should not be believed. The Opposition tried that then, and it did not work then. It is trying a variant of that now, and it does not work now.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The fact is that the Government does not have under consideration a wage-tax trade-off for next year. The Treasurer has said that the Government will have no hesitation in increasing further the surplus in the next Budget if it is necessary to lower interest rates and keep the investment surge going. Of course, we will not overcome our trade difficulties unless that sort of thing happens.</PARA>
<PARA> In response to the earlier part of Senator Stone's question, in the last Budget the Government delivered $25 to $30 a week to families with children, at the same time as we delivered the biggest Budget surplus in history. Of course, there are not too many Budget surpluses in history; in fact, there are only two to date, and the third and biggest one is looming up this year. As for Senator Alston talking about who are and are not the wimps, the Liberal and National parties, which governed this country for 30 years after the Second World War, did not produce a Budget surplus in any year, and were ignominiously kicked out of office in 1983 with a Budget deficit of $10 billion or 5 per cent of gross domestic product. If one converts that into current values, that is about a $17 billion Budget deficit as a proportion of GDP. That is what the wimps opposite left behind.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I ask a supplementary question, Mr President. I thank the Minister for his reiteration of the Treasurer's recent statement that the Government has no intention of entering into a shabby auction.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade. In view of the signs of a softening of South Africa's position towards its black majority, as evidenced by the release from prison on 15 October of seven African National Congress leaders after serving lengthy sentences, has any approach been made by the Federal Government, or is one contemplated, to try to obtain the release of ANC leader Nelson Mandela?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator GARETH EVANS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As the Government made clear at the time of the release of the press statement by the then Acting Foreign Minister, Mr Duffy, the Australian Government absolutely and unequivocally welcomes the unconditional release from prison on 15 October of eight democratic political leaders, although our positive response to those releases is, of course, constrained by the knowledge that, as Senator Jones has intimated, Nelson Mandela and hundreds of other South Africans remain in prison because of politically inspired activities. Nelson Mandela himself, in welcoming the releases, is reported to have said that many other people serving long term sentences should be released before him, and that his release was, as he put it, not on the agenda now.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Notwithstanding that, we will continue our longstanding efforts to urge the South African authorities to release Nelson Mandela and other political prisoners unconditionally, to repeal current repressive laws, to allow free political expression and organisation, and to negotiate now with authentic black leaders on a non-racist democratic political system based on equality and dignity for all South Africans. The Ambassador has made this view known to South African Ministers, including the Minister for Justice, in a number of discussions over the past year and in recent months and will continue to do so.</PARA>
<PARA> Of course, Australia's position in this respect is very clearly on the record, most recently as a result of our efforts in Kuala Lumpur at the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting. The Australian Government considers it vital that Mandela, when he is released, is able to join other genuinely representative black leaders at the negotiating table with South African authorities and is not released into a political vacuum. It is encouraging in this respect that the release of the eight was unconditional and not subject to restriction orders. It was also encouraging that the celebrations and meetings which have accompanied that release were orderly and posed no danger to the safety of the community at large. In that respect, I pay particular tribute to the moderation shown on both sides of the very large meeting which has taken place in the last day or so in South Africa and which was reported extensively in this morning's press. Finally, it would be a significant and most welcome sign of the new South African Government's open door approach and willingness to negotiate were it to release Mr Mandela immediately.</PARA>

Having said all that, I recognise that the difficulties of Tasmania are high when compared with other parts of Australia because of its very large dependence on aircraft movements in and out of that State. It is often said that the effects of the current dispute relate solely to the Tasmanian tourist industry; I believe them to be more widespread than that in their impact on the Tasmanian economy.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4F4">Senator BUTTON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am provoked to comment on that article, which I have seen. It refers to claims by the Opposition spokesman on science that `two senior CSIRO environmental scientists have been sacked because of federal government funding cuts'. That claim is fatuous and utterly without foundation. It is one of a series of claims being made on a variety of issues by the Opposition spokesman on science and technology. If I had the time I would spend it writing letters to the newspapers pointing out the outrageous and absurd nature of claims made by Mr McGauran. He seems to be totally unaware of the structural and financial plan announced by the CSIRO board earlier this year in conjunction with the senior officers of CSIRO, the division chiefs. That plan, which was implemented at the behest of the CSIRO board itself, called for reductions in staff numbers over the next three years due to an urgent need to reduce the Organisation's very high current ratio of salary to operating costs so as to provide more flexibility and higher levels of support in areas of high priority.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In line with the board's plan, which requires CSIRO divisions to rationalise their activities and target research into areas of high priority, both the Division of Soils and the Division of Entomology reviewed their research projects in order to meet this objective. I do not want to go into the details of the nature of those reviews and the decision about what the priorities were. But a high priority of environmental research in the Division of Soils is combating soil erosion and salinity. This is in line with the Government's view and the Prime Minister's statement on the environment, and the views of the National Farmers Federation and the Australian Conservation Foundation, which have jointly identified this as a matter in need of urgent attention. I would have thought that Mr McGauran might have supported that. About $500,000 a year will now be put into work on these aspects of soil degradation over the next three years. As I say, that claim by Mr McGauran is one of a set of silly claims made by him as shadow Minister for science in recent weeks.</PARA>
<PARA> I draw the Senate's attention to one or two issues which he is not talking about in public, those matters which relate to cuts in funding for research announced in the Opposition's Economic Action Plan. Amongst the things which the Opposition proposes in that plan are, firstly, to withdraw Commonwealth support for the national industry extension service.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Dr Hewson has questioned the accuracy of economic forecasts in the past, especially those economic forecasts which have a direct and significant impact on Budget outlays. I have not had time to look at all the comments that Dr Hewson has made which are on the public record, but in view of Mr Peacock's recent confident statements about future unemployment levels in Australia under different scenarios, I have checked Dr Hewson's record on forecasting levels of unemployment. For example, in the Business Review Weekly of 26 September 1986, Dr Hewson roundly condemned the 1986 Budget estimate of unemployment during the 1986-87 financial year. Indeed, he devoted most of the article to discussing that topic. He concluded:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>This year's budget calls for an estimated average number of unemployment benefit recipients of 595,000. The likely outcome is closer to 650,000 or 700,000, even on the most optimistic assumptions.</PARA>
<PARA>I repeat: he said that even on the most optimistic assumptions the range would be 650,000 to 700,000. The actual figure came in at 574,000, which was 100,000 less than the median figure of the range that Dr Hewson suggested and, indeed, 20,000 below the Treasury estimate. Earlier in that same article Dr Hewson noted that the 1982 Budget forecast of the number of people in receipt of the unemployment benefit during that year had been `wildly in error'. He claimed that that was part of a conspiracy by senior Treasury officials against the then Prime Minister. Dr Hewson wrote:</PARA>
<PARA> Undoubtedly, part of the error in those forecasts related to the fact that some of the `powers that were' in Treasury at the time . . .</PARA>
<PARA>It should be remembered that this article was written in 1986. He spoke in the past tense in regard to Treasury officials of the day-and one Treasury official in particular, I suspect. Dr Hewson continued:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . the `powers that were' in Treasury at the time were not prepared to admit the possibility of a substantial rise in unemployment to a `disturbed' Malcolm Fraser, for fear that he might seek to blow out the deficit announced in the 1982-83 budget.</PARA>
<PARA>He did that, anyway. But as far as I am aware Senator Stone has never denied that very serious allegation which is very clearly levelled at him because of the reference to `powers that were' in Treasury. If Senator Stone cares to tell us whether that is true, I am sure that the Senate would welcome a statement from him.

Senator Lewis can indulge in sloganeering as he did when he told Kodak that what it needed was a good dose of waterfront reform as a solution to its problem. He can indulge in slogans. This particular example certainly stands out as being not consistent with the overall thrust of Government industry policy. I concede that. The Kodak decision is consistent with what was done by Liberal governments year in year out, asking companies, `What tariff do you want? What electorate are you in?' and forming a motor vehicle plan in 1982 with the executives of the principal companies sitting outside the Cabinet room and called in for advice. That is the sort of record that we inherited for industry assistance.</PARA></TALK.START>

The package which has been announced in respect of Kodak is different from the preliminary discussion reported in the newspapers and which greatly excited the Opposition at the time. This was a futile exercise, if I might say so, because no government announcement had been made about it. It was pretty futile dealing with that man of straw.

The projected earnings of Kodak over the next five years are close to $1 billion, all to Asian markets-not back to Britain, Europe or somewhere else. Kodak Australia has the Asian marketing franchise for Eastman Kodak internationally. It was very easy for Eastman Kodak to look around the world and say, `Well, we don't want to get our plant in Brazil closed because we have a 13 per cent corporate tax rate there and very low labour rates. We don't want to close our plant in Europe, because the French Government is putting pressure on us to keep it there. We don't want to close our plant there because of the situation post-1992. What about this little one down in Australia? Why don't we knock that off? That will be an easy decision and will not cause repercussions in the United States domestic market. It will not bring opprobrium to the company in the United States'.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It was an easy decision to make, but, in terms of the Australian interest in this matter, if that plant closes we stand to lose more than twice as much in corporate tax as the bounty will cost in each of the three years; we stand to lose valuable Asian markets; we stand to lose some highly qualified technical personnel; and we stand to lose a billion dollars in exports over the next five years. Senator Lewis asks me, `What do you say to the next company that comes along and asks about this sort of problem?'. There is no such other company in Australia. If the honourable senator provides me with the name of one I will look at it, because I believe in retaining manufacturing capacity if and when we can. It is very easy to portray this as a sort of a reversion to the type which honourable senators opposite are used to and were used to in the years of their Government.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question, which is directed to the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, is about apartheid and South Africa. Has the Minister noted a downtrend in the price of gold in the last few years? What in the view of the Australian Government are the implications of this for the already troubled South African economy?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="2588" SPEAKER="Evans Sen The Hon G.J." NAMEID="VD4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="VIC" MINISTERIAL="FOREIGN AFFAIRS AND TRADE" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator GARETH EVANS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The price of gold internationally has fallen from an average price of $US608 in 1980 to $US437 in 1988. It is currently around $US360. Industry analysts are divided about whether the downward drift in the dollar price has yet come to an end. In the past decade South Africa's share of world gold supplies has fallen from 52 per cent to 27.5 per cent. As a percentage of the Western world's production, South Africa's decline has also been sharp, decreasing from just over 70 per cent in 1980 to a forecast of just under 40 per cent in 1989. That decline has been absolute as well as relative. The peak production was reached in 1970, when South Africa produced 1,000 tonnes. Since then it has, with small fluctuations, been in continuous decline to an estimated 616 tonnes in 1988. South African gold output has been declining in recent years because of high running costs and deep lodes. South African mines used to have the world's lowest production costs, but they have lost their competitive edge as new mines have opened in North America and Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The combined effects of that decline in production and in the price of gold are having a particularly damaging effect on the South African goldmining industry and its prospects. They are also having a very significant effect on the South African economy, in which gold plays a very central role. Gold remains the country's most important export. In 1988 gold accounted for 38.4 per cent of all South African export earnings. It accounts for almost one-eighth of gross domestic product and 10 per cent of all government revenues. The industry last year accounted for 7 per cent of gross fixed domestic investment. It employed 536,000 workers and is estimated to provide approximately 10 per cent of the state budget via indirect taxes. It is the basic industry which has created the Witwatersrand industrial complex and provided prosperity for many white South Africans-not too many blacks.</PARA>
<PARA> The South African economy could not survive in its present form without foreign exchange earnings from gold to sustain its balance of payments position. As income from gold declines and continues to decline, obviously the South African Government comes under increasingly intense pressure to reform in order to regain access to international markets generally and in particular to financial capital flow resources now being denied to it.</PARA>
<PARA> Periodically there is against that background speculation-or in some quarters agitation-about the introduction of sanctions against South African gold exports. However, until such time as a reliable process is developed to distinguish South African gold from the gold produced in other sources-and such technological capacity for drawing a metallurgical distinction of that kind does not presently exist-the potential of sanctions specifically directed against this most important export of the country must remain limited. The export of Krugerrands has already been curtailed by international actions, including Australia's decision in August 1985 to prohibit the import of Krugerrands and all other coins minted in South Africa. That is, of course, a sanction which we will maintain.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I ask the Minister representing the Minister for Defence whether it is true the HMAS Tobruk will be used as a floating arms bazaar on its way back from a visit to Gallipoli next year in order to promote military exports to countries in southern and south-western Asia. I also ask the Minister what difference there is between selling the weapons that kill and selling defence-related material such as his Department proposes, given that both are vitally necessary in wars and one cannot exist without the other? Would the Minister agree that this is a bit like saying that we will not sell heroin, but we will sell syringes, knowing that plenty of other dealers are willing to supply the heroin? I raise this question in light of the decision not to visit countries such as Iran, Iraq, Syria and Israel and further ask which countries HMAS Tobruk will visit and on what grounds countries are selected. How can the Minister reconcile this floating arms bazaar with the statement by the Director of the World Bank on 26 September this year that developing countries and their arms suppliers and creditors should explore ways to bring military spending into better balance with development priorities and that resources in both industrial and developing countries should be increasingly allocated to more productive purposes?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4E4">Senator RICHARDSON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am not certain that I can answer every part of that question. First of all, as to the part of the question dealing with HMAS Tobruk, the Department of Defence does propose to discuss with industry the possibility of setting up a joint mission next year using HMAS Tobruk. However, a firm itinerary has not yet been finalised. It is envisaged that the Mediterranean, South East Asia and the Middle Eastern countries will be visited. This is not a new policy; successful missions of this kind have been organised in the past and no doubt will be organised in the future.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The remainder of Senator Vallentine's question really related more to her general philosophical view of the world rather than to specifics. I believe that the best way to answer that part of the question would be to restate government policy. The Government encourages the export of defence-related material because it allows us to develop our defence industrial capability. I do not think that anybody could complain about that, because it is an important contribution to our economy. When it comes to the subject of defence posture, obviously we want to be as self-reliant as possible.</PARA>
<PARA> In accordance with schedule 13 of the Customs regulations, defence exports are subject to rigorous controls that apply equally to aggressive and passive equipment of military significance. Australia will not export defence goods to countries against which the United Nations Security Council has instituted measures or where exports of arms are proscribed under international agreements to which Australia is a party. Exports of military equipment are not approved where the equipment would be used by the recipient for a suppression of human rights. The Government also opposes private traffic in arms.</PARA>
<PARA> Obviously those principles will govern the list of countries that are visited on the mission to which Senator Vallentine referred. The nature of the goods and services that are offered for sale on the proposed mission will be in accordance with those principles.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not know that I would put it with that degree of largess. We want to get back to an operating airline system in this country which is not susceptible to the sort of behaviour of its employees as has occurred within the Australian Federation of Air Pilots during the past couple of months. If the Government had acceded-as the Opposition probably would have done and as it did in 1981 and 1982-to the request of the Australian Federation of Air Pilots for a 30 per cent wage increase without consequent productivity increases, and if the pilots had resumed work on that basis, the fact of life is that other airline employees would have said-with a fair degree of logic-`Thank you very much. If the pilots get 30 per cent without any productivity increase, we want a bit of that, too'. That is what they would have said, and the honourable senator knows that to be perfectly true.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I have said that the Government wants to see the airlines operating in this country with the utmost efficiency and not subject to this sort of thing in the future. The latest offer from the Australian Federation of Air Pilots is that pilots will return to work till Christmas. What will happen after Christmas if this issue is not resolved? When the Opposition was in government it had the ignominy of having its Federal Minister for Aviation attend a Pilots Federation convention at which he was told, `You caved in and you will always do so, because we, the Pilots Federation, will always win'.

It is, I think, recognised now by thousands of people throughout the country just what a phenomenal job they have done. Given that they are assisting the airlines, they are of course enjoying some of the benefits which have in the past accrued to civilian pilots. Judging from the comments some of them have made to me during the past few months, they are enjoying staying in the first-class hotels which they now find themselves in during the strike.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I have not been informed of any short term morale problems, to which the honourable senator referred.

<PARA> From the viewpoint of the retention of pilots and personnel during this time, there has perhaps been a positive effect on our retention prospects. Our service crews are obviously flying many more hours than usual; there is no doubt about that. But many of them have suggested that they feel that the repetition of commercial flying does not offer them the same challenge as normal service time does. Given that, as a result of the ending of this very difficult period, there will be a great reduction in the number of vacancies within Australia for commercial pilots, in the longer term it may in fact assist us greatly with the retention of pilots in the Services.</PARA>

Is it a fact that the responsible Minister, Mr Willis, has for the last six weeks been sitting on a report from the Bureau of Transport and Communications Economics, which assesses the cost of Telecom's community service obligations at less than $100m, because it is political dynamite which would blow the Government's anti-competitive arguments out of the water?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Government and Telecom Australia have the interests of Australian consumers very much at heart. The point is that all of Telecom's profit is spent on ensuring that Australia has, and continues to have, one of the most efficient, effective and up to date telecommunications systems in the world. Australian consumers appreciate that, and it is certainly appreciated by contrast with the situation that exists in most other parts of the world. This year Telecom will spend $3 billion to achieve the continued upgrading of the telecommunications system. Any cuts in its profit would have a consequent effect on that spending program. I am not sure whether even Senator Alston-armed as he is with all the insight that comes with doing a semester course at Monash University on telecommunications, which he has been belabouring us with for the past five years-would propose that Telecom should cut back on its capital investment program in order to achieve that. He says, in everything that he has been uttering over the past couple of days, that subscriber trunk dialling rates are double what they should be; but cutting STD rates by half would mean that Telecom would have to increase local call rates and line rentals to compensate, and this would have a serious effect on Telecom's ability to continue to meet its obligation to provide universal access to standard telephone services at affordable prices.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator Alston says that we have the highest local call rates in the world. This is the other part of his formidable case against Telecom's profit, but this is misleading and mischievous. Australia has one of the few untimed local call regimes in the world and, when the dimensions of that regime are combined with our low rental rates, the total cost to customers of local calls is lower than in most Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development countries. I wish that Senator Alston would plumb some of the articles that he should have read during his semester course, to appreciate the implications of that, because he is simply not putting the situation in any realistic way.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is not surprising that we get that sort of response from the other side, because the question asked by Senator Devlin relates to a very important social indicator. I suggest to Senator Hill and Senator Puplick-who may still be here after the next election-that it may be important for them to understand what the indicator is all about. In essence, the dependency ratio is the number of people dependent on pension or benefit for every 100 people in the work force. It is illustrative to look at the history of this ratio over the past few years to see how it has moved and the implications involved in that. At the end of 1975 the dependency ratio stood at 30.9 dependent people for every 100 workers in the work force. Over seven years later it stood at 43.7 for those 100 workers, and six years later, in June 1989, it went down to 33.6 per 100 workers. In essence, there has been a cutback of 25 per cent over the last six years and that compares quite favourably with the increase by some 43 per cent in the period from the end of 1975 to March 1983. That period reflects very much the policies of the same three people who are at the forefront of economic development in the Opposition at the moment: Hewson, Stone and, in latter days, John Howard. As I said, there has been a substantial increase, and this is a very important social indicator because it shows the degree of dependency on benefits and pensions.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> These figures and their history have some quite clear implications. First of all, the period of seven years or so up to 1983 was a reflection of the policies of the time. Not only did we have economic policies that were conducive to higher unemployment, but we also had the same degree of slackness in approach to checks and fraud control that is now part of the Opposition's political action plan. Senator Chaney was the responsible Minister then. He was one of the group of five or six who developed the current social welfare policy direction. He removed checks on unemployment beneficiaries then. He removed checks that would have ensured personal lodgment of unemployment benefit forms. He also removed the requirement to register with the Commonwealth Employment Service. That is the same sort of policy which we have been confronted with but which we are told will now be much more stringent in its application.</PARA>
<PARA> It is illustrative to look at our history in recent years to see the implications of what this Government has done. We have tightened the welfare system quite substantially in a number of areas. For a start, we have delivered a tighter welfare system in relation to the front door, the entry into the system. Now people cannot get into the system without adequately proving their identity and eligibility. We have also tightened review processes in a number of diverse ways. We have review processes to detect wrong payments and to encourage compliance. Those processes include the mandatory personal fortnightly lodgment of unemployment benefit continuation forms, highly effective mobile review and selective review teams--</PARA>

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the paper. </PARA>
<PARA>A matter of some concern in this report relates to the Australian honours system. The Office of the Official Secretary to the Governor-General has clearly been having a great deal of difficulty in handling the work that it is obliged to undertake in dealing with the award of Australian honours. In fact, the previous report gave a warning that the Australian Honours Secretariat was facing severe problems due to a lack of staff to carry the workload allotted to it. At that time there was a prediction that the Secretariat was unlikely to be able to continue to find reserves of capacity, as it had managed to do in the past, to meet the expansion of its workload resulting from the Government's decision to add new awards to the Australian honours system. According to the latest report from Mr David Smith, the Official Secretary to the Governor-General, that prediction is proving to be grimly accurate. </PARA>
<PARA> The Senate will be aware, of course, that this Secretariat was started in 1975 to administer the Order of Australia awards and that since then it has been considerably expanded, because on Australia Day in 1986 the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) announced the Government's intention to establish progressively a further 19 awards for various categories of civilian and military achievement and service of the kind provided for in the imperial honours system, but not yet in the Australian honours system. The dropping of the imperial honours system has meant a massive increase in work for the Honours Secretariat, so much so that the eight individual awards which made up the Australian honours system in 1975 will have increased to 31 individual awards. I quote from the report:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . the Secretariat which once dealt with 5400 recipients each year will, by next year, be dealing with 13,000 recipients annually; and the approximately 630 merit award nominations which the Secretariat processed each year for consideration by the Council for the Order of Australia and the Australian Decorations Advisory Committee will have increased to more than 2400 a year. </PARA>
<PARA>That represents something like a fourfold increase. The report continues:</PARA>
<PARA> Although the original Secretariat of seven now numbers eleven, it is clear that the increased workload has far outstripped the additional staff resources available for the task. The fact that, so far, we have been holding our own is due to some unusual measures which cannot persist for much longer, and which, even if they could, would not be adequate for the present task. </PARA>

It is clearly starving this operation of staff. I believe it is a gross insult to the people who are nominated by citizens of Australia for this award. It is clearly very difficult for proper consideration to be given by the Honours Secretariat because of its massive workload and the enormous pressure imposed on it because of this Government's lack of interest in and concern for its own honours system.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In conclusion, I call on the Government to provide adequate resources so that the honours system which is in place of the old imperial honours system is at least working effectively and properly, so that there is the capacity for proper judgments to be made about who should be rewarded, whose work should be recognised in this excellent way through the honours system, which has been a traditional and proper way, I believe, of rewarding merit in Australia. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the paper. </PARA>
<PARA>In speaking to the latest annual report of the Australian Wool Corporation, I am tempted to suggest what a difference a day or two makes in the wool industry. This report, covering the 1988-89 financial year, records unquestionably the best year for wool in Australia for a long time. It was a year in which a record 882 million kilos of fleece was produced; a year when wool was worth nearly $6 billion of very valuable export income; a year in which the reserve price scheme only came into operation for 5.2 per cent of the wool offered at auction. It was a year when the average price per kilo across all 13 categories of wool averaged 980c clean, after peaking at 1,100c in October. It was a year when flock ewes sold at Hay for $179 a head. I had the pleasant good fortune to be at the sale that day. It was truly the year of the golden fleece. For the first time for many years we have seen woolgrowers having an extra dollar left in their pockets at the end of the day. </PARA>
<PARA> However, this year woolgrowers have come back to the flock. The wool trade is living hand to mouth according to the Wool Council of Australia because of the enormous stocks on hand and the wool yet to be sold from increased sheep numbers. Therefore, buyers are not tumbling over each other for our wool. This year we have seen a downturn in wool prices with the result that the Wool Corporation has purchased 55 per cent of wool produced under the reserve price scheme arrangements. This has cost the market support fund $1 billion. A figure of $750m is still to be used for the remainder of the season to keep the floor price operating. Of course, the Wool Corporation will not see the woolgrowers go to the wall by lowering the floor price. It is up to the Government to make sure that it does its little bit too. Devaluation of the dollar would be the best thing to happen for woolgrowers. If this happened we would find that trade clearances would improve. The average price per kilo at the moment is down to 879c with the floor price at 870c. So there is not much margin at the moment. </PARA>
<PARA> Restockers can pick up merino wethers very cheaply because problems exist with the cessation of the live sheep trade. At present old sheep can be disposed of only in the mutton market and prices are only those that the mutton buyers are prepared to pay. Wool highlights the very fickle nature of primary industry. Through no fault of their own, woolgrowers' incomes have been slashed but their costs have not. They are also suffering from high interest rates imposed by this Government. While last year's cheque was pretty good, in many cases it was not enough to put the farm out of debt. They are also suffering from higher terms of trade. The costs of inputs such as drenches, fuel and shearing costs have all risen while incomes have gone down. It seems that last year was not all roses for woolgrowers. </PARA>
<PARA> I note that the report on page 56 refers to the waterfront situation and the shambles that that is. It seems, once again, that it is not just the Opposition parties that think the waterfront situation is a big issue for Australia and its future as a reliable exporter. On page 56 of the report it is stated:</PARA>
<PARA>While this extra capacity will reduce the delays in preparing wool for export, industrial problems on the waterfront continue to cause significant problems involving additional costs to wool exporters and their overseas clients. </PARA>
<PARA>On other matters in the report, I commend the Wool Corporation's initiative in continuing its shearer and shedhand training scheme, its promotion-which is second to none-and its efforts in testing for pesticide residues. I commend the report to the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to take the opportunity afforded by the presentation of the annual report 1988-89 of the Australian Wool Corporation to draw the Senate's attention to a number of disturbing features within the industry. Both during and subsequent to the period covered by this report prices have been tending downwards, a particularly disturbing concern for producers and the Australian Wool Corporation, as adequately outlined by my colleague Senator Brownhill. When the bottom falls out of the wool market some overseas buyers, having bought at a high price, have refused to take up that wool and are attempting or have attempted to renegotiate downwards the prices.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I have been advised that a number of Korean operators are not opening letters of credit and are falling into this default category of not taking up the wool at the original sale price. This is a matter of some concern. Unfortunately, the Koreans are not alone in that a number of Taiwanese firms also have a different commercial outlook and do not appear to be bound by the Anglo-Saxon sanctity of contract. They have also negotiated lower prices. </PARA>
<PARA> However, on a more positive note, some Chinese businessmen are currently taking an interest in Australian wool, although at present they are not buying in significant quantities. Honourable senators may recall that some time ago I gave a warning about the detrimental effects of oversupply in relation to Australian scouring capacity and, unfortunately, that prediction about scouring capacity has now been realised. </PARA>
<PARA> A further worry for local mills is that Dalgety Winchcombe and Elders Pastoral, two of Australia's major wool brokers, have announced that they will commence the pre-sale dumping of skirting wools in 1990. Their justification for this pre-sale dumping of skirting wools is the premium on space due to increased arrivals, which apparently is 30 per cent up on last year. This may be a sound decision from the brokers' point of view but it is not welcomed by Australian processors or by some of the overseas countries that are not equipped to handle the tri-packed dumped wool. </PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Wool Processors Council has voiced its objection to the pre-sale dumping of wool. The Council objects on the basis that the local processor who purchases a high percentage of these wools will be forced to purchase skirtings presented in a totally unacceptable form and to carry the extra cost of the pre-sale dumping. The estimated cost to local processors in handling and processing pre-sale dumped wool is some $40 a bale or about 40c a kilogram on carbonised wool and $28 a bale or 28c a kilogram on scoured wool. This additional handling and processing cost is not completely offset by reduced internal freight savings, which are minimal. </PARA>
<PARA> In order to remain competitive, this additional cost to local processors will obviously be reflected in a downward adjustment of their limits. This reduction in limits will result in lower prices for the grower at auction or a further swing by local processors towards private buying or buying from other centres where pre-sale dumping does not occur. Much has been made of the competitive advantage available to processors through adding value in Australia. By adding costs in this way, the industry's competitiveness will be severely eroded and the advantage to the grower of a strong bidding force in the auction room will decline. </PARA>
<PARA> In addition to the problem which pre-sale dumping poses for local processors, it is Dalgety's and Elders' intention to pre-sale dump into tri-packs, a form of packaging which 40 per cent of Australia's wool export market cannot handle. Customers such as Russia, China and a number of the eastern European countries which cannot handle these tri-packs either will not be in the market or could have to offset against the price paid the cost of the pre-dumping and the re-formatting of the tri-packs. The reluctance of traders in these sectors is likely to be reflected in reduced interest in pre-sale dumped wool and, in the current market, the price depressant effect of pre-sale dumping is likely to far exceed any savings on handling and storage costs to the grower and the broker. </PARA>
<PARA> From the marketing point of view, a customer should surely be allowed to purchase a wool product packaged as he requires it, rather than as dictated by the broker. While it is appreciated that the brokers are facing severe storage problems this year, the proposal to pre-sale dump skirtings is in the interests of neither the wool grower gaining the best price in the current market nor the efficient processing of the product at the lowest possible cost, and it is totally opposed by the Australian Wool Processors Council. Wool remains our most important export commodity, worth about $6 billion or 15 per cent of the total value of Australian exports. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the Minister for that. I had read that it was a record, but obviously it was a record wool clip rather than a record number of sheep. Anyway, regardless of that, I think the Minister would agree that sheep numbers are at a high level at the moment. With the live sheep export trade in some sort of state of suspension at the moment I am rather concerned about what will happen to the sell-off stock, the prices, and all the rest of it later in the season.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As Senator Brownhill has already pointed out, 55 per cent of the wool clip at the moment is being purchased by the Australian Wool Corporation under the reserve price scheme. With the large increase in the number of sheep that have to be handled, the Corporation is to be commended for taking the trouble to employ a further 20 shearing instructors, thus bringing the number of instructors in its training program to a total of 41. With no other form of shearing sheep at this point, it is important that the Corporation ensures that the labour force is there to handle the surplus amount of wool that seems to be around at the moment. </PARA>
<PARA> I particularly want to draw attention to some aspects in the report which relate to wool research and development. As the Senate would be aware, the Government and the growers contribute something like $30m to research and development. In my capacity as a member of the Senate Select Committee on Animal Welfare, I have had the opportunity-along with other senators-of observing at first-hand some of the recent innovations in wool research, particularly the new methods of shearing. It is interesting to note that in 1988-89, by way of robotic shearing, the time taken to shear a sheep has been reduced from 25 minutes to 12 minutes. The long term target of robotic shearing is three minutes and 45 seconds. I think it will be quite some time before the robotic machine can compete with the shearer. We also observed at first-hand work on the epidermal growth factor experiment. Whilst the report says that its `economic viability remains doubtful', more work needs to be done in this area. </PARA>
<PARA> Another aspect which is of interest to me as a sheep grower and a wool producer is the amount of research that is being done on the problem of flystrike, particularly from the sheep blowfly. I read with some enthusiasm that the Wool Corporation, or those people doing the research, will release 15 million sterile flies on Flinders Island. I would not like to be taking a picnic there. I hope that there will be some benefit from releasing these sterile flies. Research work on developing a vaccine to prevent blowfly strike is also being done. This is also important because, as mentioned in the report of the Animal Welfare Committee on sheep husbandry, which was tabled earlier, we have to find an alternative to mulesing. That practice is unacceptable to people in and outside the industry. The Australian Wool Corporation is to be commended for the work it has done. </PARA>
<PARA> In conclusion, I note the increase in `sale by sample'. I hope that the Corporation allows the continuation of wool sales in Launceston. We have a very efficient selling centre there at the moment. I was very pleased to see that, even with the airline strike, we managed to have a full sale of the clip in Launceston. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will briefly deal with the serious warning to the Government that emerges from the annual report of the Australian Wool Corporation. This Government had the benefit, during the financial year that ended in June, of $6 billion of exports from wool to help it out of the problems it created for itself with the balance of payments. That massive help from the wool industry is simply not being repeated this year, with the downturn of probably at least $1 billion in this year's export earnings having another major impact on the balance of payments deficit, on the current account, which we will be looking at which will once again underline the Government's incapacity to forecast accurately in this area, and which will lead Australia into a worsening debt problem and a continuation of massively high interest rates. Those high interest rates are working to the disadvantage of the wool industry to the extent that they are probably keeping the Australian dollar at a higher level than the fundamentals probably indicate that it should be at. The higher the Australian dollar, the lower the Australian dollar return to this industry as against what it earns in foreign currency.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The seriousness of the situation is clear. The annual report reveals that stock levels increased from only 9,203 bales at 1 July to 53,738 bales by the end of February. As market prices fell closer to the floor in the latter part of the season, the Australian Wool Corporation purchases at auction increased from a seasonal average of 2.9 per cent of offering at the end of March to an average of 13.4 per cent in the following three months. Stocks increased to 188,278 bales by the end of the season. Stock holdings were up from under 10,000 bales to almost 200,000 bales by the end of the season. Since then, things have become much worse. As Senator Brownhill said, something like 55 per cent of this season's sales have resulted in the Wool Corporation having to buy in at a cost of something like $1 billion. This support will clearly have to be maintained if the floor price of 870c is to be supported. Obviously a failure to do that would be disastrous for the wool industry, but for the rest of Australia, more interestingly, it would be disastrous once again for our balance of payments. </PARA>
<PARA> This is a clear warning that the Government has ridden on the back of not simply the wool industry but also various other fortuitously strong commodity prices in order to try to get itself out of the horrendous mess it has made of the Australian economy. It bleated when commodity prices fell and the terms of trade were against us that it was not its fault that we were doing so badly; it was all because of the terms of trade. The terms of trade turned up-wool prices, for example, went through the roof-yet we kept on going broke internationally because of this Government's monumental incompetence. It did not take advantage of the recovery in the terms of trade which now appears to have passed. As I said, the annual report just dramatises how serious the position is in one commodity alone. </PARA>
<PARA> The simple forecast we can all make from this is that the Government will drive us further into debt. The balance of payments deficit on the current account will continue to be awful; the Budget forecasts will clearly be demolished. The Government has not admitted it yet, and the Minister for Finance (Senator Walsh) will not face up to what the reality will be this year. He can see what is happening to commodity prices, but he does not have the stomach to come into this place and admit that the Government's forecasts are hopeless and that the balance of payments current account deficit will be nowhere near the forecast in that phoney Budget, although he still claims that things will get worse next year. The Wool Corporation report shows the seriousness of the problem. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the paper. </PARA>
<PARA>In moving the motion, I note two things: the use of energy, the putting through of energy in an industrial system, is absolutely fundamental to an advanced industrial lifestyle; moreover, the use of energy is also fundamental to the necessary protection of the environment which will ensure that that lifestyle can continue into the future. The marrying of these two objectives of energy use is one of the most pressing problems that we face today. It is therefore disturbing to find that, while we have a body which is designed to provide funds for energy research and development, the major push of those funds has consistently gone to old technologies, to technologies which need to be superseded by a raft of newly emerging technologies. </PARA>
<PARA> On page 29 of the report, we find that, of the $234m which has flowed through the National Energy Research, Development and Demonstration Council, approximately 85 per cent has gone into things like coalmine site technology, resource assessment and synfuels-those are the conventional fuels-technology of coal utilisation, and so on, and only 10 per cent has gone into renewable energy. Only 4 1/2 per cent has gone into the social and environmental consequence of energy use. As I have indicated, it is quite clear that a range of emerging technologies would allow us to move away fairly quickly from the use of fossil fuels, the burning of which necessarily means addition of greenhouse gases to the atmosphere with consequences that honourable senators know only too well. </PARA>
<PARA> I was interested to see the other day at the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation demonstration which was conducted in Parliament House that CSIRO has developed a very interesting ceramic fuel cell which has the capability of converting initially the gases which are found in natural gas-gases such as methane-to electricity with about a 60 per cent efficiency. Most of our conventional power stations which burn natural gas succeed in burning that gas with only a 30 to 40 per cent efficiency, so the use of these fuel cells, initially using natural gas, would be capable of substantially increasing the efficiency of the use of that gas and consequently producing electricity with much lower emissions of carbon dioxide. </PARA>
<PARA> These fuel cells could also move on and use the fuel which would come from other sources. I notice in the annual report that one of the grants made in the past year was to Professor Green of the University of New South Wales who has developed solar cells which have a very high efficiency. Some honourable senators may have seen the program on Quantum several weeks ago which dealt with the technology of manufacturing these cells. The efficiency with which the cells can now turn sunlight into electricity has risen to the point where already the cells are more than competitive with nuclear power stations and certainly within reach of many of the coal-fired power stations in operation in the world, although not yet equally competitive with coal-fired power stations in Australia where we have very low cost coal. The linking of these very efficient solar cells with the electrolysis of water, the storage of hydrogen and the reconversion of that hydrogen through fuel cells developed by CSIRO would allow us to store solar energy or energy from wind sources and totally avoid the addition of further greenhouse gases to the atmosphere. I express the hope that the National Energy Research, Development and Demonstration Council will direct a much greater proportion of its funds in this direction in the future. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The reports I have just tabled refer to the following proposals:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Stage 2 development, including new submarine school, HMAS Stirling, Western Australia; and northside development of civil aviation facilities, Darwin Airport</PARA>
<PARA>The stage 2 development of HMAS Stirling consists of more than 35 individual projects ranging from additional accommodation and recreational facilities to new workshops, administrative buildings and wharf facilities as well as a new submarine school. The estimated cost is $135.6m at April 1989 prices. </PARA>
<PARA> Since 1972 HMAS Stirling has been progressively developed as a naval support facility and was commissioned in July 1978. The need to further develop HMAS Stirling is the direct consequence of the decision by the Government to relocate half of the fleet to Western Australia and the establishment of the two-ocean navy concept. </PARA>
<PARA> In recommending that the works proceed the Committee has drawn attention to the planning done by both Commonwealth and State agencies to ensure that adequate services and facilities are planned and in place to meet the demand caused by the influx of naval personnel and their families. The Committee has also recommended that environmental reviews of Commonwealth projects required under the Environment Protection (Impact of Proposals) Act 1974 should be completed before a particular project is referred to it for examination. </PARA>
<PARA> The second report relates to the development of civil aviation facilities at Darwin Airport for domestic, international and general aviation services at an estimated cost of $72m at May 1989 prices. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee concluded that existing civil aviation facilities at Darwin Airport, particularly the terminal building, are inadequate and substandard. The Committee has also concluded that there is a need for the development of new facilities to improve the standard of service to passengers, to overcome the existing problems of congestion and to meet likely future demands. The Committee has recommended that two aerobridges should be provided for the domestic section of the terminal and that the Federal Airports Corporation should explore the possibility of the airlines making a financial contribution to the cost of the aero- bridges. I commend the reports to the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA> Senator TATE The second reading speeches read as follows:</PARA>
<PARA>CUSTOMS LEGISLATION (ANTI-DUMPING) BILL 1989</PARA>
<PARA> This Bill, together with the Companion Customs Tariff (Anti-Dumping) Amendment Bill 1989, proposes a series of amendments to the Commonwealth's anti-dumping legislation, contained in three Acts: the Customs Tariff (Anti-Dumping) Act 1975; the Anti-Dumping Act 1988; and part XVB of the Customs Act 1901. The amendments contained in this Bill give effect to two substantive proposals, and some other technical amendments. </PARA>
<PARA> The first substantive proposal effects the restructuring of the provisions dealing with anti-dumping matters into discrete taxing and non-taxing Acts. This has involved the repeal of a substantial number of provisions of the Customs Tariff (Anti-Dumping) Act, effected by the companion Bill, and the transfer of those provisions to part XVB of the Customs Act, effected by this Bill. A detailed analysis of the repeals and transfers, including a concordance of the provisions affected, is contained in the explanatory memoranda to both Bills. </PARA>
<PARA> The purpose of this exercise has been to avoid possible difficulties arising out of the High Court's decision in Air Caledonie International v. the Commonwealth. That decision relates to section 55 of the Constitution and the treatment of taxing and non-taxing provisions, and it has raised doubts about the proper placement of some of the provisions in the Customs Tariff (Anti-Dumping) Act 1975. The Government has decided to put those provisions beyond doubt by transferring them to the Customs Act. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn now to the second substantive proposal in this Bill which is aimed at implementing the Government's recent decision, announced on 10 September 1989, on the inclusion of a profit margin when the normal value of goods is being `constructed'. Dumping occurs when the price at which goods are exported to Australia-the export price-is less than the normal value of the goods in the country of export. This normal value is usually just the price of the goods in the domestic market of the country of export. </PARA>
<PARA> Sometimes, however, that price is unavailable-for example, because the goods are produced only for export, and are not sold on the home market; they are unusable; or when the exporting country has a centrally planned economy. The normal value must then be obtained in some other way. One such way is to add up the costs of making and selling the goods within the country of export and, in appropriate cases, to include a margin of profit. Such a normal value is said to be constructed. </PARA>
<PARA> One possible reason why the domestic price might be unusable would be that the overseas company had been selling the goods in its domestic market at a loss, for an extended period of time and in substantial quantities. Under subsection 5 (9) of the Customs Tariff (Anti-Dumping) Act, which is to be subsection 369TAC (12) of the Customs Act, such sales would be considered not to be in the ordinary course of trade, and their price therefore would not be usable as a normal value. </PARA>
<PARA> In 1986, the Government asked Professor F. H. Gruen of the Australian National University to review aspects of anti-dumping policy. Professor Gruen's subsequent report made many recommendations for change, most of which were accepted by the Government. In his report Professor Gruen noted, and deplored, an increasing propensity to use constructed normal values. He noted, too, that such values could be substantially above the actual domestic price. </PARA>
<PARA> He therefore suggested that the number of constructed normal values should be reduced to the absolute minimum and that this be achieved by repealing subsection 5 (9) of the Customs Tariff (Anti-Dumping) Act. He went on to say that, if this approach were not adopted, more realistic normal values could be obtained by not including a profit in constructed prices. </PARA>
<PARA> In the event, the Government decided to retain subsection 5 (9) of the anti-dumping Act, but to tighten some aspects of its use. In particular, it decided that, unless there were strong reasons to the contrary, a zero profit should be assumed when subsection 5 (9) was being used. </PARA>
<PARA> However, this intention could not be achieved by amending subsection 5 (9) itself. The operation of that subsection might make it necessary to construct a normal value, but the method of construction-including the matter of a profit margin-was specified in three other subsections of section 5 of the then Act, any one of which might be used in a given case. The amending legislation passed by this Parliament last year therefore included changes to each of these three other provisions. In each case, the amendment was to the effect that a profit would only be included in circumstances specified in regulations to the Act. The same legislative package created a new Anti-Dumping Authority, which came into existence on 1 September 1988. </PARA>
<PARA> Shortly thereafter the Government referred to the new Authority the question of what regulations might be made to prescribe the circumstances when a profit component should be included in a normal value construction. The Authority held a public inquiry into this and some other questions referred to it at the same time, received and considered many submissions, and reported in March 1989. </PARA>
<PARA> In its report, the Authority distinguished sharply between the construction of a normal value because subsection 5 (9) had been invoked, and the construction of a normal value for any other reason. Subsection 5 (9) comes into play only when prices, in the domestic market of the exporting country, have been unprofitable for an extended period. Under the Authority's rationale, had the sales not been at a loss their price would probably have been accepted as a normal value and construction of a value would have been unnecessary. The constructed value should therefore take account of all costs, so that sales at that price would not be at a loss; but there was no reason to include any profit. </PARA>
<PARA> The Authority went on to argue that, when a normal value was being constructed for any other reason, a profit should indeed be included. The margin of profit allowed would vary from case to case, and could sometimes even be zero. Like other components of a constructed normal value, it would always be so chosen as to obtain the best estimate possible of a fair price within the domestic market of the country of export. </PARA>
<PARA> The Authority reasoned that the inclusion of a profit, which might be zero, in such cases would improve consistency. A company, for example, might produce two kinds of goods, export both to Australia but sell only one on its domestic market. For the latter goods, the domestic price-which would usually include some profit-could be used as the normal value. For the other goods, a normal value would have to be constructed; and for consistency it, too, should usually include that same level of profit. </PARA>
<PARA> The Authority considered, and rejected, the argument that profits should never be included in constructed normal values, to keep these values as low as possible. If the construction process tended to lead to overestimated normal values, it reasoned, the solution should be found in revising the process rather than in compensating for the error by an arbitrary exclusion of profit from all constructed values. The Authority also considered arguments that the level, if any, of profit to be included should be decided by referring to the conditions facing the relevant Australian industry, such as its need for protection against dumped imports. This argument, too, it rejected. The Authority said in its report that it could not `see how the current condition of, say, the Australian lampshade industry can conceivably be relevant to the normal value of (say) Egyptian lampshades sold on the Egyptian domestic market'. I must say that I agree. The Government has considered carefully these conclusions by the Authority, and agrees with them. </PARA>
<PARA> In its report, the Authority went on to recommend regulations which might be made under the Customs Tariff (Anti-Dumping) Act to achieve these effects. After consideration, the Government has come to the view that these same objectives can best be implemented by amendments to what was section 5 of the Customs Tariff (Anti-Dumping) Act. Under other changes proposed today, that section will become section 269tac of the Customs Act. Its wording, as proposed to be amended, allows a profit, which may be zero, to be included in a constructed normal value except where the reason for con-struction is that subsection 269tac (12) -the equivalent of the old subsection 5 (9)-has come into operation. </PARA>

<PARA>CUSTOMS TARIFF (ANTI-DUMPING) AMENDMENT BILL 1989</PARA>
<PARA> This is the companion Bill to the Customs Legislation (Anti-Dumping) Bill 1989. This Bill effects the repeal of a substantial number of provisions of the Customs Tariff (Anti-Dumping) Act, as well as making other necessary amendments consequent upon the transfer of these provisions to Part xvb of the Customs Act 1901.

<PARA>PASTURE SEED LEVY BILL 1989</PARA>
<PARA> The purpose of this Bill is to provide for the imposition of a levy on pasture seed produced in Australia, as requested by the Grains Council of Australia as the body representing pasture seed growers. The funds raised by the levy will be used to finance a pasture seed research scheme. The Government will provide funding to match industry levies as part of its broad program of encouraging increased rural productivity through research. Before speaking on the Bill itself, I should place this current research initiative in the context of the research arrangements in place and the changes which are planned following the release in May 1989 of the joint ministerial statement on research in the Primary Industries and Energy portfolio. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has placed a great deal of emphasis on the administration and funding of rural research in Australia with a view to further improving the contribution of the rural sector to the national economy. The first major step in this process was the passage of the Rural Industries Research Act in 1985. The research councils established under that Act and portfolio research and development (R&amp;D) corporations established under separate Commonwealth legislation administer commercially oriented research programs with a total budget of $141m in the current year. </PARA>
<PARA> Consistent with the policy reflected in the Rural Industries Research Act, the Government has encouraged rural industries to increase their contribution to existing schemes up to at least 0.5 per cent of gross value of domestic product. It has demonstrated its commitment to match industry funding dollar for dollar to the 0.5 per cent level and it has also encouraged new schemes such as the proposed pasture seed scheme which is the subject of the Bill before the House. Rural research is the biggest single budget item within the Primary Industries and Energy portfolio, with 1989-90 expenditure expected to increase by $80m. </PARA>
<PARA> As reflected in the May 1989 research statement, the Government has continued to explore avenues to increase the benefits to the individual industries and to the community in general of the significant level of research expenditure. R&amp;D corporations have been identified as having advantages over the research councils and other administrative structures for funding R&amp;D in respect of administrative and funding efficiency and effectiveness. The corporations will become the model for revised R&amp;D funding arrangements. The Government will be holding discussions with industries on the specific research arrangements to apply and will be presenting a Bill for an Act to replace the Rural Industries Research Act and other arrangements to implement those changes. In addition, a Primary Industries and Energy Research Council will be established to promote a high policy forum and networking facility for R&amp;D, to further develop consultation on R&amp;D policies and to improve the linkages between portfolio programs and the efforts of outside research organisations. </PARA>
<PARA> The proposed pasture seed research scheme will be administered initially by the existing Australian Special Rural Research Council. The funds to be raised by the levy would be insufficient to justify the establishment and maintenance of an industry specific research council. As a body catering for research into a number of emerging industries, incorporation within the Special Research Council will ensure that administration costs are in reasonable balance with total expenditure on research. Under the proposals for future R&amp;D arrangements being developed by the Government, the Special Research Council will be replaced by the proposed Rural Industries Research and Development Corporation, and it is envisaged that, in the first instance, the proposed pasture seed research scheme will become a responsibility of this Corporation.</PARA>
<PARA> Turning now to the Bill before the Senate, the pasture seed industry makes a contribution of fundamental importance to Australia's livestock and pastoral enterprises through the provision of bulk quantities of pasture seed of the required quality and varieties for pasture production. The development in recent years of significant export markets for Australian pasture seed has added a further dimension to the industry's importance as a contributor to regional economies. </PARA>
<PARA> Pasture seed production occurs throughout Australia but predominantly in the temperate areas of South Australia, Victoria, Western Australia and New South Wales. Annual gross value of production of pasture seed has been estimated at $57m, while export earnings have been around $10m per annum. </PARA>
<PARA> Pasture seed research to date has been funded mainly by State government and livestock industry research schemes. To support the industry's continuing role in domestic agriculture and encourage the further development of export opportunities, Australian pasture seed growers have identified the need for an expanded research program into production, storage, transport and marketing of pasture seed. The establishment of a joint Commonwealth-industry scheme will broaden the industry's research funding base and assist in enabling the industry to achieve its full potential. </PARA>
<PARA> In view of the widespread and significant production of pasture seed in Australia and the administrative problems that would likely occur in effectively levying all production, the pasture seed industry agreed that only certified seed of certain pasture species and cultivars be levied. The levy will apply initially to specified certified seed of clovers, medics and lucerne produced in Australia. Provision is made for certified seed of other pasture seed species and cultivars to be added to the scheme. </PARA>
<PARA> As marked variations in value can occur both within and between species of pasture seed, the legislation provides for different operative rates of levy for different leviable cultivars. On commencement of the scheme, certified seed of the medic, clover and lucerne cultivars set out in a schedule to the Act will attract a levy of $7.50, $10.00 and $12.50 per tonne respectively. The legislation provides for new operative rates to be added and for existing rates to be varied by instrument. The maximum rate for any one cultivar is established by the legislation at $50 per tonne. The legislation requires that the growers organisation recommend any variations to the levy rates and the pasture seed to be covered by the scheme. </PARA>
<PARA> The levy is payable by the grower and will be collected on the Commonwealth's behalf by State or Territory government departments responsible for seed certification. State government Ministers in all States in which leviable seed is produced have agreed to these arrangements and a formal agreement between the Commonwealth and each participating State covering the collection arrangements will be put in place. Inclusion in the scheme of further pasture seeds which are also grown in States other than those currently participating in the scheme would be dependent on agreement being reached by all States in which the additional seeds are grown. </PARA>
<PARA> Amounts equal to the levy will be paid into a separate account established for the purpose of the Australian Special Rural Research Fund. The Commonwealth's matching contribution will be up to a maximum level equal to 0.5 per cent of the average gross value of leviable pasture seed production. It is expected that in the first year of operation the levy will raise $106,000. The Australian Special Rural Research Council will therefore have scope for an annual pasture seed research program of the order of $200,000. </PARA>
<PARA> The commencement date of this legislation will be on royal assent. It is intended that the levy be imposed on pasture seed produced in the 1989-90 harvest and the research program commence in 1990-91. I commend the Bill to honourable senators. </PARA>
<PARA>PASTURE SEED LEVY COLLECTION BILL 1989</PARA>
<PARA> The purpose of the Bill is to provide the machinery necessary for collecting the levy imposed by the Pasture Seed Levy Bill 1989. This Bill should be read as one with the Pasture Seed Levy Bill 1989 and is to come into operation on the same day that the levy Bill becomes operative. </PARA>
<PARA> This Bill gives authority to the Commonwealth and States making arrangements for collection of the levy, outlines penalties for non-payment and provides appropriate powers of enforcement. There are no financial implications other than those covered in the second reading speech for the Pasture Seed Levy Bill 1989. I commend the Bill to honourable senators. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Today we are debating the Appropriation (Parliamentary Departments) Bill 1989 and cognate Bills. This legislation finally gives the Senate the opportunity to debate the 1989-90 Budget of the Hawke Labor Government; something that Labor, of course, is not anxious to do. That was clear yesterday when an unprecedented number of Labor senators decided to speak in the debate, but not about the appropriations as such. It was typical that, in the immediate aftermath of the Budget, the Treasurer (Mr Keating) in his speech at the National Press Club devoted only two pages of his eight-page speech to the Budget and the rest to an attack on the Opposition. If Government senators have a lead, the lead is from the Treasurer. It does not necessarily have to make sense, but that is the ploy.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is typical of a rather ideas-bankrupt Government that it sees its only hope of re-election as attacking the alternative government, and it is equally a sign of the times that its attacks have been falling increasingly flat. For a week the Treasurer was reduced to saying that the coalition Economic Action Plan is no good because Opposition members are dreadful people. He had no facts or figures, and still has no facts or figures, after he has spent a week misusing the Department of Finance for party political purposes, trying to get it to do his dirty political work for him. It is less an Exocet missile than a custard pie that he is able to throw, and it is a great tragedy that he has wasted taxpayers' money on using the Department of Finance to try to blow something out of the water that he is clearly unable to do. </PARA>
<PARA> The Treasurer has had to admit that there are no errors in our taxation estimates. His criticism of coalition spending projections are based on nothing more than his own questionable suppositions that long term unemployed people are totally unemployable and that older Australians all want to give up work and will not take up the deferred pension plan. It is tragic that the Treasurer has said, in his own words, that the long term unemployed will be unemployed forever and that he dictates that all older Australians must give up work. Those two things are a reflection of where the Government is at. The Government does not understand the realities of today's climate, of what people really want. The long term unemployed are not necessarily unemployed forever; they need to be given the incentive and encouragement to get back to work. </PARA>
<PARA> The Treasurer can no longer get his own arithmetic right, when his attack on the Economic Action Plan makes contradictory estimates as to whether the number of Australians on special benefits will increase by 340 per cent or 600 per cent. Which is it-340 per cent or 600 per cent? I contend that it is neither, but neither figure has been based on anything more than self-interested guesswork. The Treasurer in subsequent weeks, after misusing the taxpayers' money in the Department of Finance, has still not been able to give anything more than the figures that were originally based on that guesswork. </PARA>
<PARA> It is of no comfort whatsoever to Australians to be told that the Hawke Labor Government is signalling `Steady as she goes' through this Budget, against its own predictions of 7 1/2 per cent inflation, which is already shown to be wrong, and a current account deficit of $18 1/2 billion for 1989-90. The only direction in which Australia is moving under this Government is steadily down the gurgler. From private conversations that have been about-and I will not name names-I think many Government members realise that, and it is quite evident to the people of Australia that the country is on very shaky ground. It was only on 16 July that the Minister for Finance (Senator Walsh) stated that the public did not recognise the gravity of the economic situation. The Minister for Finance was saying in crystal clear terms that he believed the situation was grim. </PARA>
<PARA> Thanks to the Labor Government, from March 1983 net Australian foreign debt has risen from $23 billion to $108 billion; the repayments on which absorb 30 per cent of the value of Australian exports, with the servicing of external liabilities taking more than $1 billion per month in foreign exchange earnings. Australian foreign debt per capita, $7,000, just happens to be 10 times that of the Philippines and three times that of Argentina, the country that at the beginning of the century was said to be our equal in economic potential and is now held up as a dreadful warning-but we are worse. The Government cannot pretend that capital goods imports are largely responsible for the deficit when in 1988-89 these have risen by $2 billion against an overall current account deficit deterioration of $5 1/2 billion. It would take only a 10 per cent decline in Australia's terms of trade to add another $6 billion to the current account deficit. </PARA>
<PARA> The two broad strategic paths out of that morass are complementary. We can as a nation tighten our belts-and heaven only knows how many times people have been asked to do that-or we can increase productivity. This Budget and the entire Keating policy thrust concentrate upon the former option, while leaving the second and more constructive option in the too hard basket because it involves hard decisions that are absolutely unacceptable to the political masters of this Government, the Australian Council of Trade Unions (ACTU). </PARA>
<PARA> It is a fact that, ever since monetary policy was eased in 1986 in order to get interest rates down to win the 1987 election, this Labor Government has relied excessively upon interest rates to reduce demand. Rates of 17 per cent plus for home buying families, if they are lucky enough to have loans with the four big banks, and of 21 per cent for small business, are the consequences of this policy. Only yesterday we saw that people had to be earning $64,000 to buy an average home in Sydney, worth about $117,000, and then would be forced to make mortgage repayments of $1,600 per month. How on earth can people afford to do it? But this is a direct consequence of this Labor Government's policy. </PARA>
<PARA> This Labor Government may boast of its large Budget surplus but let us not forget one thing: this is obtained not by real reductions of Federal Government expenditure but through increasing taxation revenue and further reducing payments to the States. That is what this Government is all about: the tightening of other people's belts rather than its own. The Treasurer, the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) and the Minister for Finance all go on ad nauseam about the necessity for people to tighten their belts. Why do they not practise what they preach? In real terms there has been a further reduction of 4 per cent in payments to the States in 1989-90 while real overall spending marginally increases and will rise by 1.3 per cent in 1990-91. On one hand, they are chopping out distribution of the funds to the States but, on the other hand, they are continuing to increase the tax take. </PARA>
<PARA> As I heard my colleague Senator Bjelke-Petersen say last night, it must still be remembered that this is the biggest taxing, biggest spending government in Australia's history. There is no getting away from that. This is not to say that the Federal coalition does not fully recognise that big spending State governments are a major cause of the national debt problem. One only has to look at the most classic example-my own State of Western Australia-where former Premier Brian Burke and current Premier Peter Dowding have been having a field day. At whose expense? At the taxpayers' expense. </PARA>
<PARA> Yet Senator Robert Ray said here the other day that the Government would always look after the needy. Who are the needy? In Labor terms, the needy are the Abeleses, the Harrises, the Kodaks, the Murdochs, the Packers, the Connells and the Bonds. How enlightening it was to see a report on the Four Corners program last night showing where the money is coming from for the funding of Labor Party election campaigns. It is coming from those wealthy people. What for? Why would they be donating in such huge amounts? It is not just through love, I can assure you. </PARA>
<PARA> When in government we will reduce general purpose payments to the States by $300m while expecting a saving of $600m in State Budgets through the adoption of contracting-out policies. This figure is a small proportion-11 per cent-of our total program of expenditure reduction. The approach of the Hawke Labor Government has been entirely different, forcing the States to take more than their fair share of cuts without regard to the fact that higher State charges only fuel the consumer price index and add to business costs. </PARA>
<PARA> Make no mistake: this Budget surplus is being funded by increased taxation, moving to a record taxation share of gross domestic product (GDP) of 25 per cent. The major responsibility rests with Labor's old friend, bracket creep. I am now talking about bracket creep in its literal sense and not in the way the Treasurer is often referred to. That will push up income tax receipts by 10 per cent. It has added $13.5 billion to revenue since 1982. This cost will be met by middle income earners, the people that this Government purports to care about. By July 1990 those people will lose half the July tax cuts to bracket creep as they await a contrived reduction in interest rates in time for an election. Yesterday Minister Howe talked about further tax cuts and big handouts, making a big fellow of himself. Maybe the truth came out today when the Minister for Finance tipped a bucket on Minister Howe and said that the Government simply could not afford them. Who is right and who is wrong? Talk about contradictions!</PARA>
<PARA> Since the last coalition Budget of 1982 total Federal government receipts have risen from $44 billion to $97 billion, a rise of 119 per cent. If anyone needs clarification as to whether this Government is a big taxing government, it is almost contained in that one statistic on its own. Tax on individuals is up by 123 per cent; taxation of companies has risen by 138 per cent; other taxes, such as the fringe benefits tax and that on superannuation funds, which are Labor initiatives, have risen by 133 per cent. Indirect taxes are up by 124 per cent, including a rise in sales tax of 200 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to dwell on the figures for indirect taxes and sales tax. This Government pooh-poohs any suggestion made by commentators-or anyone else, for that matter-about the possibility of a consumption tax. This Government already has a de facto consumption tax. The indirect taxes and the sales taxes constitute a consumption tax by sleight of hand, by another name. The Government says, `We would not have a consumption tax'. Not likely! They already have it in place. This litany of taxation impositions, courtesy of the Australian Taxpayers Association, shows that private business meets much of the cost of this enormous spending Government. We can almost admire the sleight of hand displayed by the Treasurer, who ruthlessly attacks the profitability of the private sector without formally raising the rate of company tax. The effect, however, will be no different. </PARA>
<PARA> There is absolutely no accident about the fact that the highest projected increases in tax receipts are from those taxes that impact most directly upon business. Company tax will be up by 10.7 per cent; the fringe benefits tax will be up by 13.2 per cent; the prescribed payments system will be up by 26 per cent; and the category including capital gains tax will be up by 20 per cent. Changes to the method of company tax collection so that 85 per cent must be remitted within a fortnight at the end of the financial year might seem to the Treasurer a very good and simple mechanism for inflating his heralded Budget surplus. What it will really mean is a reduction in profitability flowing through to smaller business and wage earners and cash flow problems that could result in the bankruptcies of major enterprises. </PARA>
<PARA> The Treasurer does not seem to care less. He comes up with smart ideas, and that is about where it ends. It has already been well stated by the Victorian Chairman of the Institute of Chartered Accountants in Australia, Mr Barr, that the construction industry is particularly vulnerable to the loss of cash flow that this Budget measure creates. I can only agree with Mr Robert Oser of Price Waterhouse that the new system is a thinly disguised tax surcharge based on the unfair comparison that, while the individual wage earner collects income evenly, company cash flows are uneven. Business costs will also rise through the requirements of remitting pay as you earn (PAYE) receipts on a fortnightly basis, prompting the announcement from Coles-Myer that this will add $67m to its annual borrowing. Once again, does the Treasurer mind that impost on the private sector? No, not at all. </PARA>
<PARA> For too long the Hawke Labor Government has posed as a friend of business. I suppose it is a friend of business-big, big business. It is a friend of the airlines. It is a friend to Kodak. It is a friend to a lot of people who might dip into their pockets at an appropriate time. Certainly Labor governments have the capacity to develop cosy relationships with individual corporations. I believe it is now time to judge the Treasurer on the effect that his policies are having on the private sector, that is, the only engine of growth that Australians have. In the majority of cases, of course, that involves small business, not huge corporations. </PARA>
<PARA> It is not in the interests of business for a government to preside over an inflation level that, since 1983, has been 1 1/2 times that of Britain, twice that of the United States of America, five times that of Germany and eight times that of Japan. It is not in the interests of business and the community to have a government that eagerly presides over a centralised wage fixing system that acts to put a floor under inflation. The coalition does give credit to the Government where it is due on the rare occasion that it can. It supports the measure of financial deregulation that has been achieved since 1983. However, reform is just one area. It does not entitle the Labor Government to acclaim that it favours and assists free enterprise. </PARA>
<PARA> The private sector can receive lasting and effective assistance from financial deregulation only if this is accompanied by other reforms so that business decisions can be made in full accordance with market realities, leading to the rise in productivity that is essential to overcome the debt crisis. The Government talks much about productivity but does nothing. I think probably the most classic and current example is that of the pilots dispute, which we and Australia know is still in existence but which the Government says is not in existence, if one can understand that. </PARA>
<PARA> Deregulation of financial markets is one thing, but it is in fact admitted by this Government's own Business Regulation Review Unit that 17,400 government employees are involved in the regulation of business, with a further 960 regulators working full time in agencies formerly outside government departments. The cost of business regulation multiplies in its effect to $47 billion or 19 per cent of GDP which is a substantial amount. In 1987, 184 Acts were passed affecting the business portfolios and 340 statutory rules imposed. While 40 of these took regulations into new ground, only seven repealed existing regulations. This has come from a Treasurer who, when he was first elected, said that he was going to make taxation simpler and easier to understand. No-one can now understand it. The accounting firms are struggling. They are capable of understanding it, but the problem is that the Treasurer keeps changing the rules; and not just changing them but adding to the problems. </PARA>
<PARA> The greatest failure of this Government is its refusal to institute truly basic reform of our regulated transport system and labour market because, once again, its political masters, the Australian Council of Trade Unions have dictated that the accord for which we are told ad nauseam we must be grateful must stay in place. Just what does this Budget do to free the labour market, to improve competitiveness and to institute reform? It does absolutely nothing; not a thing. This is the overwhelming criticism that the coalition makes of this Budget, and is entit- led to make, because we are putting forward some positive answers in our Economic Action Plan which is making an impact in the electorate. That is why the Treasurer and the Prime Minister fantasise about the mistakes that they think should be there but which they cannot find, even though they have wasted taxpayers' money by asking the Department of Finance to find and unearth those mistakes. </PARA>
<PARA> The cornerstone of our reform program is an industrial relations policy that looks to an enterprise based wages system, promising a 25 per cent increase in productivity, which is going backwards by 0.2 per cent each year under the accord. That is the record of this Government. Productivity and everything else is just going backwards. We are going to break out of our productivity malaise by giving employers and employees the right to negotiate wages and conditions, to give immediate sanctions and flexibility to the current system, to remove the dead hand of compulsory unionism and bring the wage earner into partnership through incentive schemes and wage increases based on productivity. </PARA>
<PARA> Wage increases will not be based on something that is in fairyland-that because someone in Sydney might get a pay rise, that automatically means that someone in Adelaide must get a pay rise. It will be based on productivity. Complementary to this, of course, we will free those resources tied up inefficiently within the public sector through privatisation, so that taxpayers and consumers both benefit from a higher standard of service. </PARA>
<PARA> It is interesting to note that the coalition for many years has talked about the possibility of privatisation, yet it was this Government that tried to terrify the electorate year after year, at both State and Federal elections, that privatisation was bad. At least the Government in recent years has seen the merit of our argument. We will extend privatisation to a point where the people of Australia will benefit more and more. We will attack business regulation through regulatory impact statements provided by Ministers, systematic review of existing regulations, rigorous impact assessments of new regulations and deregulation agendas for each department. </PARA>
<PARA> Coastal shipping-another classic example of where this Government has failed to make any impact at all-will be exposed progressively to competition, with manning levels brought to the levels of comparable Western nations. There must be genuine, permanent change on the waterfront based on individual enterprise so that export industries are no longer held to ransom, with a 20 per cent productivity improvement leading eventually to a $1 billion increase in GDP. </PARA>
<PARA> With telecommunications costing the average business more than $30 per week per employee, we shall deregulate a range of Telecom Australia services that will cut business costs. It is not good enough for this Government to tolerate a monopoly situation where the Industries Assistance Commission has measured Telecom as being 20 per cent less efficient than the Canadian system, which caters for similar population distribution. Look at the profits Telecom has made. Look at the way the Government is protecting that industry. Yet it says that it is going to provide greater opportunities for cost cutting in this Budget. It is simply not so. </PARA>
<PARA> The coalition will also be radically different from this tired, worn out Labor Government in its determination to maintain necessary Budget surpluses through expenditure restraint rather than higher taxation. That is the difference. We will not be taking more and more tax from the taxpayer just to provide a little goody before an election; we will actually be tightening our own belts and not those of the taxpayers. Expenditure savings of $2.7 billion reflect the necessary balance of compassion and realism, aiming at a leaner and better targeted service delivery, and giving back incentive to work that has been eroded through a social security system that relies on unemployment benefit for permanent income support and forces us out of the work force at 65. As the shadow Treasurer, Dr John Hewson, has said repeatedly, this Government has created a situation where people can leave school, go on to unemployment benefit and only come off it in time to go on to the age pension. That attitude must be turned around. </PARA>
<PARA> A small but significant part of our savings, totalling $9.5 billion, will be made at the expense of the partisan misuse of public money that Labor is unable to resist-the postage rort of taxpayer funded direct mail advertising, Government feel-good type propaganda advertising campaigns and the National Media Liaison Service, which supplies the Australian Labor Party media tactics at taxpayer expense. Our taxation commitments will focus on the area of greatest need-the beleaguered Australian family-with $2 billion of rebates for spouses, children and child-care as the traditional family adapts to a pattern of increased work force participation. </PARA>
<PARA> Small business will no longer be condemned to stay small. Small business operators can look forward to reward for effort instead of being sent out of business in the way in which this Government is quite cleverly doing. When the destructive capital gains tax is replaced by a tax focusing on speculative gains, people will be prepared to invest their money, and many times to the benefit of others. For example, in the housing sector, if people are not prepared to invest money to buy homes, how can other people-those who cannot afford under the policies of this Labor Government to buy their own home-rent them? How can they afford $1,600 mortgage repayments per month on an average home?</PARA>
<PARA> In the months ahead, aiming for a soft landing for a May election, if not sooner, we will be encouraged to forget the candid remarks by Senator Button on 14 July, when he described the Keating J-curve theory of economic recovery as `forgotten and unlamented' and that in reducing real incomes it was `a painful approach that impacts unequally on the community'. At least Senator Button on that occasion may have got it right. Unfortunately, the National Media Liaison Service, which controls the media of this country, is not prepared to be honest enough with the public to say that the Treasurer has got it wrong and is getting it more wrong by the week. Month in and month out we see the figures which show that we are going further and further down the Argentinean road. We have to turn it around now or pay the price forever more. Clearly, Senator Button has been unable to convince the Treasurer of the self-evident truth of Senator Button's remarks. Australia has a Budget designed to win an election and nothing else. That design provides, of course, for the manipulation of interest rates while continuing to ignore our massive and continuing structural problems. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In this debate on the Appropriation Bills this afternoon, I would like to make some remarks with respect to the coalition's Economic Action Plan. I will make those remarks in two respects. Firstly, I will state why I believe that that action plan is the appropriate course of action for this nation. It provides the right direction, the one we should be taking. Secondly, I will refer to the Government's response or, rather, lack thereof, to this plan. As Senator Knowles pointed out in her speech, no one could suggest that the Australian economy is healthy. That is a bad thing in a variety of ways. We have an unproductive economy at the moment. We have a record level of foreign debt and record interest rates. It is a disastrous situation. People cannot afford to buy their own homes. They cannot afford to keep paying the interest bills on loans they have taken out in order to start a small business. Things are going very badly.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is just not possible to imagine that the schoolchildren who are present in the gallery are taught that our economy is better than, for example, Japan's. The reason that they are not taught that is that their teachers do not lie to them. We do not have an economy that is better than Japan's. The trouble is that we do not have one that is better than West Germany's, either. I could refer to the extensive list of Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development countries which have a better and stronger economy than ours. That means they have better opportunities to offer schoolchildren when they leave school to seek jobs, and better opportunities for business people. Sure, private enterprise wants to make money. This seems to upset Government members. They forget, of course, that when private enterprise makes money it generates jobs for people who can then be independent of the welfare system, earning a salary and making decisions about their lives. That is a good thing.</PARA>
<PARA> The coalition's economic policy does two things on which I want to concentrate. Firstly, it outlines comprehensively $2.7 billion worth of expenditure cuts. We say that it is about time that the Federal Government realised that while everybody is told that they must tighten their belts, the Federal Government has not been doing that. It is about time that Canberra cut its cloth just as every Australian family and small business have had to do. The coalition has done that. We have put our cards on the table and said, `These are the cuts we have to make, these are the areas that they will come from'. This allows people to assess whether we have made the right decision. </PARA>
<PARA> That is not what the Government has done. We do not hear much from it about what it will do, unless the August Budget is about to be handed down, or one of its now regular mini-Budgets, to try to fix the mess that it made the year before, is handed down. It does not tell us in advance what will happen, for example, in the May mini-Budget next year, which will undoubtedly be presented if we do not have an election before then. The Government is not putting its cards on the table, but we have done so. I think it is a good thing that the Opposition is prepared to put its cards on the table, to stand by the decisions that it must make in order to have better government. It gives the media, the people in the press gallery, the opportunity to go to the Government and say, `What about it? These people have now said where they will make their expenditure cuts'. We have done that so that there can be a full and proper debate on the course of action that we will take when we win government. </PARA>
<PARA> There will be no surprises when we win government at the next election. People will not be able to say, `We didn't know you were going to do that'. There will be no surprises at all. We have laid on the table, fair and square, where the cuts will be made so that everybody knows, and so that there is plenty of opportunity to debate that matter beforehand. As I say, I think it is a good thing that a Commonwealth government is prepared to cut its cloth in the way in which it demands everybody else should cut their cloth-in the way in which families, small business and the States do. </PARA>
<PARA> The second aspect of the coalition's Economic Action Plan on which I want to concentrate is the family tax package. It represents a very substantial change in direction from what this Government is doing. Finally, after many years, there is an acknowledgment of the changing pattern of women in the work force-something that this Government has not sufficiently acknowledged. We have done that in two ways. We have indicated that we will institute a new program of child tax rebates, because families with children necessarily have more costs. If families have more children, there will be more Australians, and that is obviously a good thing for us. Families have extra costs and we should acknowledge those costs and make a contribution to them. A family with one child does not have anything like the costs of a family with four, five or six children. So under our program a family will receive more money if it has more children. I think that is a good thing. </PARA>
<PARA> The other aspect of our family tax package is a program of child-care tax rebates, varying between $10 and $20 per child. It is in this area that we separate ourselves from the path that the Government has chosen to take. Basically, the Government says that people whose children are attending some sort of child-care facility that receives Commonwealth funding can have some help from the Commonwealth, but if they do not choose that course of action for their children, if they choose to put their kids into a private child care facility, the Commonwealth says, `Forget it, you don't need any help'. That is rubbish. Our commitment is to families with children. We say that they need more help than families without children. We say that the more children they have, the more help they need. </PARA>
<PARA> We acknowledge the changing pattern of women's involvement in the work force. There are now far more two-income families than there were many years ago. There has been a progressive increase in the number of married women entering the work force and, therefore, a progressive increase in the number of two-income families. That necessarily means that there is a demand for more child care. Not everybody will choose to use government based child-care facilities. We think it is unfair that people get help only if they choose government funded child care. We think that two-income families should get some assistance for child-care costs, irrespective of what choice they make. The Liberal Party is about, among other things, individuals making choices for themselves. Big brother in Canberra should not decide where the next community child-care centre will be built and how much people will pay. We say that parents should decide where they want their kids to be looked after. It is a very good thing that the child-care tax rebates will be available irrespective of whether children are placed in a government or private child care centre. </PARA>
<PARA> That has produced a quite dramatic response from the Government. It knows that although it has made some gain in the past decade with regard to the women's vote, it is not losing it. It has been losing it for the last couple of elections, but it will record a massive loss in the women's vote at the next election. The reason is that the Government is still saying to women with children, `If you go to a government centre you can have some help'. It is saying to all the other women with children, who need child-care assistance in order to continue their career, `You can get lost'. On the other hand the coalition is saying, `We acknowledge that you may now be choosing to work; we acknowledge that some women are working now because they have to as a result of the parlous state of the economy and the fall in the standard of living'. What we are saying is fundamentally different from what the Government is saying. We are saying, `You choose where you want your kids looked after and we will give you some assistance irrespective of your choice'. So the women who have had the door slammed in their face by this Government, the women who have been left out in the cold, will vote for the Liberal and National parties. There will be a huge reduction in the support that women have given to the Australian Labor Party at the next election. I think that is a good thing. That means that we will be in government very soon. </PARA>
<PARA> The second aspect I want to address in relation to the coalition's Economic Action Plan is the Government's response to it, or lack thereof. You may remember, Mr Acting Deputy President, that in the weeks leading up to the announcement of this plan there was a big brouhaha in the press gallery and through the media generally as to how Mr Keating, the Treasurer, was like a cobra waiting to strike. We were to put up an action plan and Mr Keating would demolish it. That afternoon a major flaw would be found in our policy, Keating would be the victor and we would look pretty stupid. We released our action plan and we waited for the cobra to strike. As Senator Stone pointed out in this chamber recently, the cobra became a carpet snake and could not find a major flaw in our policy. The Government could not find where to cut $2.7 billion off its programs and it certainly was not prepared to make the commitment to Australian families with children that the coalition has been prepared to make. So, for about 24 or 48 hours we had a deathly silence from the Labor Party. Panic was setting in. </PARA>
<PARA> But the Government has now changed tack and it has realised that it has to try to demolish this action plan one way or the other: it has chosen the other. It has chosen to criticise the plan by saying that it is nothing other than what the Liberal Party of Australia Federal President, John Elliott, has dictated. We have heard Senator Walsh in this chamber, we have read in the media, and we have no doubt heard over the airwaves and in the television comments that we are simply doing what John Elliott wants: we want to make the rich richer. That really is a case of the pot calling the kettle black. </PARA>
<PARA> I was listening to Senator Knowles's speech earlier this afternoon when she was referring to the very big mates that this Government has and what it has done in relation to, say, media broadcasting for its big mates. As to the compensation being paid to the airlines, we all know that Sir Peter Abeles is a very close friend of the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke). His company is able to weather the storm of an industrial dispute because we, the taxpayers, are funding it. That does not happen to every business in Australia. I think it is the first time it has happened. But because Sir Peter Abeles and the Prime Minister are big mates, the Government is happy to pay that money to allow airlines to weather the storm a bit longer. I say to the Government that it should not judge everyone by its own standards. Just because the Government is running a government for rich mates by rich mates, there is no reason to assume that everybody else will do that. As I say, what the Government has done in the last term of office about media legislation and compensation to the airlines is a good example of that. </PARA>
<PARA> The specific aspect of our Economic Action Plan that the Government has chosen to concentrate on and to portray as being a neat trick to give more money to John Elliott is our promise to remove the Labor Government's capital gains tax and to replace that with a speculative gains tax. All honourable senators in this chamber will have heard on various occasions what one might call a bucket job being done on this particular policy. The inference is that because it is perceived that Elliott will have a gain that he otherwise would not have, as a consequence of this policy being introduced, that is the reason it has been done. As I say, just because Labor thinks that way, that is no reason to think that is the way we think. What the Government has done is totally turn its mind away from the very positive aspects of our policy. </PARA>
<PARA> There is no question that we will get rid of Labor's capital gains tax. It is a complicated tax. It works against investment in production and encourages over-investment in the family home because the family home is exempt. It denies incentive and, in that sense, reduces reward for effort. People who have operated small business know that. They put their life blood into a business, they build it up to try to get some capital gain out of it and take that capital gain and build further to make a bigger and better business. Labor would have it that that is a bad thing. I say that is a good thing because when business is taking more opportunities it is generally creating more jobs. Sure, opportunities sometimes will be taken and lost; and in those circumstances, jobs will not be created. But at the same time people who have made the investment will lose their home and any other capital that they have put at risk. Sure, they did this in order to get some profit for themselves but at the same time they were creating jobs. </PARA>
<PARA> The complaint is made by honourable senators on the other side that it is totally inappropriate that capital gain made at any time-whether it is three, four or five years-become tax free. Frequently the Government uses as an example that pay as you earn (PAYE) taxpayers cannot do that. They work for five years and do not get any reduction in the tax that they pay. The reason is that small business people are putting capital at risk. They probably have a second mortgage on their house. They put everything they have on the line and risk it for that business. The people they employ as PAYE employees do not do that. Why should they get the same reward? The PAYE employee is not creating jobs. That is what we need in this country: jobs created. We have to build an economic environment where the entrepreneurs will get out there and do their thing, where there will be more entrepreneurial activity; therefore, more productivity; therefore, hopefully, more profit. As business grows, employment grows and with that individual wealth grows, dependency on welfare reduces and individuals can make more choices for themselves. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me repeat some remarks in relation to our decision to remove Labor's capital gains tax. The coalition's policy will provide major assistance to small businesses by recognising that capital gains on their investment often provide the superannuation for men and women who run Australia's small business enterprises. Our policy encourages long term investment by removing a tax penalty. Our policy removes the bias to invest in domestic residences which at the moment are free of capital gains tax but rather to investment in plant and equipment which can now be subject to a capital gains tax. Our policy, naturally, will direct investment funds into more productive activity. Our policy also removes a major impediment to the formation of a dynamic venture capital market for risk investment services. </PARA>
<PARA> In conclusion, I wish to refer to three people and their comments in relation to these policies. Firstly, the well known independent tax expert, Mr Eric Risstrom, has indicated that:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . even the Treasurer Paul Keating must concede that the law is too complex to continue as now. </PARA>
<PARA>So we have the former president-I think he was-of the Australian Taxpayers Association indicating that the current tax is just too complicated. If we turn our minds back to the tax summit that was held in the old Parliament House, one of the key points made by the Treasurer was that a tax system needs to be simple. Clearly, the capital gains section of this Government's tax system is not a simple one. It is just far too complicated. As Government members take their daily opportunities to rubbish our policy, let me remind them that, in the 1983 election that saw many honourable senators on the other side come into Parliament, Mr Hawke said that there would be no new capital gains tax. In September 1985 the promise was broken. On that basis we need not put too much credibility on what the Government says about capital gains taxes or speculative gains taxes. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Keating says that the loss in Government tax revenue as a result of removing the capital gains tax is estimated at $450m a year, and that is based on an estimate made by Mr Keating as recently as August 1989. The remark has been made that we cannot afford to make the change we are making. I draw the attention of the Senate to the $2.7 billion worth of cuts that have been outlined. </PARA>
<PARA> In summary, I think the coalition's Economic Action Plan is a good one, because it does two very important things. It cuts the Commonwealth's cloth by $2.7 billion, and that is a good thing. It offers massive assistance to families and acknowledges the changing pattern of women's involvement in the work force by giving child-care tax rebates to those women, and that is a good thing. The final thing I want to say is that, the sooner that plan is implemented via the coalition being elected to government so that we can get the Australian economy back on track, the better. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The debate on the Appropriation (Parliamentary Departments) Bill 1989-90 and cognate Bills has centred on the contest between the Government's economic policy and the Opposition's Economic Action Plan. That is a good thing. It is some time since we have had an opportunity to debate two such plans. We have often taken the Opposition to task about its failure to produce a plan, and finally it has done so. It is entitled Economic Action Plan-The Liberal-National Parties' Economic and Tax Policy, October 1989. The people of Australia can now properly compare the policies put forward by the Government with those put forward by the Opposition.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Throughout this debate honourable senators from both sides of the chamber have contested mightily the question of which is the best plan-and quite properly so. I shall follow the lead of other speakers in the debate and refer first to the Economic Action Plan. Obviously, I cannot go through the document page by page, paragraph by paragraph, but various matters deserve specific comment. </PARA>
<PARA> On page 7 there is a reference to `The Looming Crisis'. On page 8 there is a chart about external debt. According to the chart, Australia's external debt is such as to bring this country in third after Brazil and Mexico. The source of this data is the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development. The proposition is that Australia is up there with Brazil and Mexico, that things are grim, and that therefore it follows that the Opposition's Economic Action Plan will succeed-or I suppose a better way of putting it is that it ought to succeed. </PARA>
<PARA> However, what is not in this document, on this page and on many others, is an analysis of where that external debt has been created and what it means. I understand that the Economic Action Plan put forward by the Liberals and the Nationals was costed by a group called Access Economics Pty Ltd. That concern purports to have expertise in economics, such that the Opposition has embraced Access Economics Pty Ltd as worthy costers of its Economic Action Plan. </PARA>
<PARA> In considering Australia's external debt, about which the Opposition takes the Government to task, what better authority could we go to to see what that means than Access Economics Pty Ltd, the very body that has put pins and stays under the Liberal and National parties' Economic Action Plan? I refer to the Access Economics Investment Monitor, published in October 1989, the very month in which the Economic Action Plan of the Liberal and National parties was published. The Access Economics Investment Monitor is described as follows:</PARA>
<PARA>A unique listing by sector and State of 500 investment projects worth over $5m each, under construction, committed, or under consideration, in mining, manufacturing, tourism and public sector investment related to foreign exchange earnings. </PARA>
<PARA>It ought to be emphasised that this is investment related to foreign exchange earnings, the sort of investment which down the years will bring foreign exchange earnings to Australia. We are talking about not only investments which will produce income in Australia but investments which will bring Australia's foreign exchange earnings up. That is what we are talking about. This is what Access Economics Pty Ltd says about the projects which will earn us foreign exchange income in the future:</PARA>
<PARA> Projects listed have a total value of over $90 billion. </PARA>
<PARA> As a proportion of total investment tourism represents 34 per cent, manufacturing 30.5 per cent, the public sector 21 per cent and mining 14.5 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA>Access Economics says further:</PARA>
<PARA>We have included projects in mining, manufacturing and tourism as major sectors with the potential to earn foreign exchange. </PARA>
<PARA>It is a pretty happy picture. When one looks at the next chart provided, `Table 1-Investment by Industry', one sees that there are vast investments in the manufacturing, mining and tourism sectors. In the manufacturing sector, for example, there is investment in food, textiles, wood, paper and printing, chemicals, non-metallic minerals, basic metals, transport, other machinery and miscellaneous areas-and so it goes on. At page 4 of the Access Economics Investment Monitor the following statement is made:</PARA>
<PARA>This picture-</PARA>
<PARA>the picture presented by Access Economics-</PARA>
<PARA>is in sharp contrast with the resources boom when projects were heavily concentrated in mining and basic metal products. For example, the June 1982 official survey of investment projects-</PARA>
<PARA>during the time of the previous Fraser Government-</PARA>
<PARA>had $28 billion out of $32 billion (or 87 per cent) of investment at the committed or final feasibility stage in mining and basic metals. Even within these areas there was a heavy concentration in iron ore, coal, alumina and aluminium. </PARA>
<PARA>Access Economics contrasts that situation with the situation that has arisen under the present Government, where there has been a wide diversity of and a great increase in investment, that investment having been in projects which will ultimately earn income for this country from overseas. The point must be made that, no matter who is in government in the 1990s, Australia will benefit considerably from the efforts that have been made under this Government in getting Australia to a situation where overseas earnings will come from a wide variety of industries, providing a basis for Australia to go on to greater and greater things economically. </PARA>
<PARA> It is not good enough to say simply that overseas debt does not embrace the issue. The issue is what sorts of things have been done with the money that Australia has been borrowing, what sorts of things will that bring about in years to come, and what will be the result of that investment? The Economic Action Plan does not undertake a proper analysis of where the money is going. It should because the very people who played a major part in producing the Economic Action Plan at the same time were producing the Investment Monitor which analysed very clearly where that money was going. It is interesting to note that our overseas debt is mainly a private sector debt. The private sector is using that money to fuel the economic boom that will come in the 1990s in the way I have already described. Page 25 of the Economic Action Plan states:</PARA>
<PARA> The Australian economy is about to enter its most difficult period since the Second World War. </PARA>
<PARA>That is the sort of statement we expect in a document that is the basis for a coming campaign in a Federal election. As we would expect it says that doomsday will come under this Government and the parousia is coming from the Opposition. As we expected, that is a bit of a pup as is the next statement which reads:</PARA>
<PARA> The economic mismanagement of the Hawke/Keating Government has left Australia with a legacy of debt, the servicing of which has already mortgaged the future of the next generation of Australians. </PARA>
<PARA>Again, that is another statement which is to be expected in the political context. The next statement in the document is a bit naughty because of the way it is put. It reads:</PARA>
<PARA> Much of the money has not gone into productive investment and exports which would serve that debt; it has been frittered away to try to artificially prop up the living standards. </PARA>
<PARA>That is a very neat way of getting around the embarrassing fact that most of the money, as I have said, has gone into investments. The document says:</PARA>
<PARA>Much of the money has not gone into productive investment . . . </PARA>
<PARA>The positive statement is that much of the money has gone into productive investment which will service that debt. The Economic Action Plan is a political document in so far as it tries to embrace an embarrassing situation. As Access Economics must have advised, the embarrassing situation is that this debt is debt created for the building up of economic infrastructure of this country. The Opposition realises this. How can it get over that embarrassment? It attempts to get over it in a negative way by saying, `True enough. Much of the money has gone into productive investment. We cannot contradict that fact, but we will not put it into this document. We will say that much of the money has gone into productive investment'. However, the Opposition does not bother to say how much has been frittered away in trying to artificially prop up living standards. That is very interesting. If that money has gone into artificially propping up the living standards, why does the Opposition-and I will come to this point-go on wanting to prop up the living standards of people in Australia who are better able to afford the economic rigours than are others? The Opposition cannot have it both ways. If it does not want the living standards of Australians built up, why does it not say so?</PARA>
<PARA> My next point has been commented upon again and again but I think it is worth a further comment. It refers to the unemployment relief plan which is set out on page 35 of the document. It says that if the Opposition ever came into government it would slash unemployment benefits by $1,500m. On page 36 it says that it would increase special benefits by $835m. That is a saving of something like $600m to $700m. The surprising thing about this is that the unemployed are picked out as the people to suffer the lashes of economic restraint. Of course it would not touch the age pensioner group. It would allow them to keep their property. They would be allowed to own their property, have their children work their land and get the old age pension as well. Nobody could cavil with that if there were enough money to go around. The Opposition purports in this document to save the money by taking on the unemployed. It is interesting that the weaker section of the community should be attacked. </PARA>

<PARA>I was told that the Privileged and the People formed Two Nations. Two nations, between whom there is no intercourse and no sympathy; who are as ignorant of each other's habits, thoughts, and feelings as if they were dwellers in different zones, or inhabitants of different planets; who are informed by a different breeding, are fed by different food, are ordered by different manners, and are not governed by the same laws . . . </PARA>
<PARA>That is the approach the honourable senator takes. I have an extract from the data of the Department of Social Security quarterly survey of August 1989 which says that there are 159,600 long term unemployment benefit recipients who will now be cut off without compunction and who have 88,300 children who will be similarly cut off in order to benefit people who, as I have said, are already well off. In July 1974, Mr Robert Ellicott, a member of the then Opposition, took to task the proposals of the Whitlam Government which was giving money to those better off sections of the community at the expense, as Mr Ellicott saw it, of the poor. He said:</PARA>
<PARA>Who will come first-the poor or the affluent? Have we the courage now in this country to express in a material way the humanity which we have so often expressed through our lips?</PARA>
<PARA>He went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA>What does the average Australian who is not poor require in times of economic stability by way of social welfare of his Government?</PARA>
<PARA>He went on to criticise that approach. </PARA>
<PARA> Fifteen years later the members of Mr Ellicott's party forget or ignore-whichever is the right word-the warning he gave then. He then warned against exactly what they now embrace. Mr Ellicott quoted from President Roosevelt who, in 1937, said:</PARA>
<PARA>The test of our progress is not whether we add more to the abundance of those who have much-it is whether we provide enough for those who have too little. </PARA>
<PARA>The present Pope, John Paul II, said that the quality of a society and a civilisation is measured by the respect shown to the weakest of its members. If the Opposition comes into power, what will happen to the people about whom Benjamin Disraeli, Robert Ellicott and the Pope are concerned? On 1 November 1977 in a speech on the individual in need, Senator Peter Baume, one of the most outstanding senators on the Opposition benches, quoted Alfred Deakin who, in 1885, gave an address entitled, `What is Liberalism?'. He said:</PARA>
<PARA>The reconstructive element in Liberalism must in future come to the front. In political economy, having induced politicians to discard the old program `The Devil take the Hindmost' Liberalism would now indicate a new teaching with regard to the poorest in the community, that all should have what was their due. By fixing a minimum rate of wages and wise factory legislation, wealth would be prevented from taking unfair advantage of the needy. The latter would be saved from leading wretched and imperfect lives . . . </PARA>
<PARA>That was said almost 100 years ago, but with the Economic Action Plan it will all be thrown out. The Liberal and National parties, if they got into power, would immediately take away unemployment benefits from almost 160,000 people with over 88,000 dependent children. They would do so not on the basis of any test or investigation, but simply on the basis of an arbitrary declaration that anyone who has been on unemployment benefits for nine months or more is somehow an evil blot on the community. It is all right if such people have been on unemployment benefits for eight months, or even eight months and three weeks, but if they have been on that benefit for eight months and four or five weeks they turn from being reasonable people whom society will support to being evil people who can be thrown in the trash can, have the lid put on them and then cast into the outer darkness. </PARA>

<PARA> Nobody could approve of people ripping off the system, whether it be a workers' compensation system, a Commonwealth system or a pension system.

The Opposition's idea is to take us from heaven to hell and back again, not on the basis of any sort of test other than that of time periods. It is considered that someone who is 64 years 11 months and three weeks old is fit for nothing but the refuse heap of society. If that person lives another month, he is suddenly brought back and given a pension. His children are allowed to work his land and earn money and he becomes a hero.

That is the scheme. In any event, whether from grub to butterfly, butterfly to grub, refuse heap to parousia, heaven to hell, the Opposition believes that the process must be good because it will save $600m.

An invalid pensioner is totally and permanently incapacitated, but under the coalition scheme, even if an invalid pensioner is permanently incapacitated, he will be required to undergo an annual check.

A paraplegic with terrible spinal cord injuries who cannot move his feet or his legs will have to be wheeled in every 12 months to be examined by a doctor. When asked what is wrong with him, he may not be able to answer because he may have brain damage. That process is devoted towards the end of saving $150m. Who will pay for the paraplegic, quadriplegic and brain-damaged invalid pensioner to be wheeled in every 12 months to be examined by a doctor? Somebody might answer that question for me.</PARA>
<PARA> Finally, I talk about privatisation. On page 15 of the Economic Action Plan it is stated:</PARA>
<PARA>The Coalition has already decided on a number of bodies to be privatised when we are elected:</PARA>
<PARA>They include Australian Airlines, Qantas Airways Ltd, the airport terminals, the Australian Industry Development Corporation, Overseas Telecommunications Commission, Aussat, Medibank Private, the Pipeline Authority, and the Commonwealth Bank. </PARA>
<PARA> The document said that this would save, or introduce, millions of dollars for the good of the Australian people. The reality is that that will probably only add to our external debt.

Quite often in this place, we sit and listen to Senator Cooney with rapt attention as he tells us in an entertaining manner about the faults of plans such as ours. However, we could not have done so today. We had to sit in absolute horror as we listened to his total misrepresentation and misunderstanding of the policies of the Liberal and National parties. He had to quote from Benjamin Disraeli to throw back at us the issues that have been raised in our action plan. That really does beggar description. Firstly, let me pick up on one point that Senator Cooney made. He was trying, as he always does, in such a plausible barrister fashion, to tell us--</PARA></TALK.START>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Senator Walsh" NAMEID="TJ4">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="TJ4">Senator Walsh</NAME></TALKER>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="9I4">Senator MESSNER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, he would suit that role very well indeed. Senator Cooney was trying to tell us that the Liberal and National parties stand for privatising Telecom Australia, which is absolutely untrue. We do not intend to privatise Telecom. We plan to deregulate those sections of Telecom that should be and are subject to competition from the private sector. Those things are totally divorced from the basic telephone network. The objective, the plan and the policy of the Liberal and National parties is to maintain that basic network in the hands of the public sector. Please, Senator Cooney, do not continue to misrepresent our position.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Let me pick up on one other point that Senator Cooney mentioned. He kept emphasising how all of those people who are unemployed for nine months will be suddenly thrown into the trash can and the lid will be bolted down tight. Senator Cooney failed to mention that our policy will provide that those individuals who are in that unfortunate situation and who are unable to find employment will be endowed with support for training and new jobs. Alternatively, they will be able to apply for special benefits under the present criteria. There is nothing unfair about that. It means simply a change from one category of benefit to another. I can see Senator Walsh nodding in approval of that kind of approach, because he knows that our proposal would lead to a far more effective saving. As a result, the taxpayer would save money. </PARA>
<PARA> I return now to Telecom. As part of the Budget debate I would like to draw attention to the report of Telecom which was released yesterday. We were all interested to learn that Telecom's profit for the last financial year was just short of $1,000m, which is a very considerable profit compared with the $776m of the previous year. During the past four years, Telecom's profit has increased from $464.6m to this year's figure of $973m. </PARA>
<PARA> The point to which I wish to draw the attention of the Senate is that, during that period, the rate of return on Telecom's capital assets has increased from approximately 10.8 per cent to something like 13.8 per cent. In terms of profit, that is a creditable performance. However, that means that, from every dollar that is invested in Telecom's operations, we-the Government or the taxpayer-make 13.8c, which is not a huge return by today's high interest rate standards. For instance, people know that they can invest their money with a building society or a friendly society and obtain an interest rate of 17.5 per cent. Yet Telecom is investing its money at about 13.8 per cent, which is somewhat less than 17.5 per cent. Telecom's performance is still a long way short of what might be expected in money markets generally. </PARA>
<PARA> The point from the financial statements to which I really wish to draw the Senate's attention is that, in each of the past two years, there has been a special deduction from profits-$187m last year-for special depreciation. That constitutes an unusual picture because it is not classified as ordinary depreciation on plant and equipment but rather is described as being `as a result of Service Life Changes'. I suppose that means that there has been a reassessment of equipment. Indeed, because of today's fast-changing technology, one can understand that the cost of replacement of equipment is rising. Therefore, one would expect higher depreciation claims in respect of equipment replacement. That has another connotation. It seems that, if that figure were added to the profit of $973m which has been disclosed, Telecom's profit, as adjusted, would be of the order of $1,160m, which is very much more than what has been disclosed in the accounts. </PARA>
<PARA> Today in the Senate, Senator Alston asked the relevant Minister about Telecom's community service obligations. Senator Alston asked when information about that was going to be provided, there being a report that is in the course of examination by the Minister. However, the Minister could not provide an answer about that even though he has had that report for six weeks. That report is totally relevant to the issue of Telecom's profits. If we are to rely on Telecom's argument that it needs to make profits of such a substantial order, something over $1 billion, in order to fund its obligations to the community-for example, such people as farmers in isolated areas who need special subsidy for their telephone services-we need to know as soon as possible what those costs are. Today Senator Alston made the point that it could be as low as $100m. Therefore, if it is only that amount, we have to ask: Why is it necessary for Telecom to earn a profit like $1,160m? The numbers do not stack up. Therefore, the arguments are not entirely straightforward. I should like to hear from the Government as soon as possible about the result of its inquiries into this matter. Quite clearly, the reason for Telecom's high profits being argued in that fashion may not be strictly correct. Certainly, we in the Liberal and National parties would like to hear the answers to that. </PARA>
<PARA> I will now refer to one or two other relevant points about Telecom. We note that, during this next financial year, there will be a revaluation of all the assets; that is, the land and the buildings, of Telecom. It is anticipated that that could add some $2.5 billion to the asset base. That will change considerably the return on assets of the profit, which means that, in order to maintain the same level of return as it had in the last financial year, Telecom will be looking for even a far greater profit, perhaps to the extent of as much as a third of what it presently is, in the next financial year. That could mean a profit in the years ahead of something like $1.5 billion. These figures are very rough and are arrived at only on the basis of inadequate information provided by the financial statements for the year. But it does indicate that Telecom will have to either make greater efficiencies or obtain far greater throughput of its traffic in order to generate that kind of profit level in the future. </PARA>
<PARA> It is interesting that some of the areas of Telecom's activities are growing very quickly. One wonders why the Government does not let Telecom off the leash and allow it to become totally deregulated so that it can get into new areas. Take, for instance, the cellular mobile telephone services that are now operating. I see that, in the past financial year, the number of services multiplied by 300 per cent. The figure went from 31,000 to 94,000 in one year. That is an enormous rate of growth which suggests an enormous opportunity for future profit growth for Telecom. Obviously, as it is such a strong growth area, there ought to be deregulation of the cellular network immediately and the introduction of a second cellular network, perhaps in private hands, to compete with Telecom and to provide even cheaper services than are being provided by present operators for mobile telephones. Obviously, this is the way of the future and it is time that the Government let Telecom off the leash so that other enterprises can compete with it on a fully competitive basis in the new areas of technological development. In turn, that would generate greater taxes for the revenue, improve telecommunications and efficiency and productivity in the economy generally. </PARA>
<PARA> While I am on the subject of infrastructure, I point out that one of the areas of which I am sure many honourable senators have become aware in recent times is the problem relating to the condition of roads in this country. If they had driven recently between Canberra and Adelaide the number of times that I have, they would have noted the standard of the Sturt Highway. Very clearly, there is a need to examine such infrastructure questions. </PARA>
<PARA> This leads to the whole question of how we in this country should go about the funding of infrastructure development in the years ahead. It is certainly coming up very quickly now as a major priority for government action at State and Federal levels. We are seeing in the United Kingdom the continuing privatisation of major infrastructure developments such as water supply and electricity. Those things are leading to more effective and efficient operations, but at the same time, although there are some extra costs to consumers involved, they are improving and will continue to improve and update their facilities so as to provide better and cheaper operating facilities in the future. </PARA>
<PARA> We have to take a new approach to infrastructure development in this country. It is certainly something that needs to be developed in conjunction with the various States. We have had the recent example of the problems of the sewerage in Sydney. Those problems are a classic example of the lack of expenditure on infrastructure development. Consequently, they will need to be attacked by State and Federal governments in the years ahead. Any problem can be solved in engineering terms, so long as we have the money and the commitment to do it. Therefore, that will be one of the great challenges that we face in the years ahead. </PARA>
<PARA> One area in the Budget that is of very great concern to the private sector and about which I am receiving a great number of petitions, as no doubt other senators are, is the change in the system by which company tax will be collected during the next financial year. This will affect companies differently according to the balance dates that they individually have. But on the assumption that companies balance on 30 June each year, under this new government provision, they will be required to pay 85 per cent of their tax due on a notional income calculation no later than 15 days after the end of the financial year. That is an outrageous proposition. </PARA>
<PARA> The first question that many accountants will have to address, of course, is how on earth can a person calculate for every company in Australia the exact amount of the taxable income of the company within that short period at the end of the financial year. Within 15 days the profit of a company will have to be determined. That is a practical impossibility. </PARA>
<PARA> That will lead to very great pressures, certainly in the accounting fraternity, and obviously will lead to enormous problems unless the Government adopts a very flexible attitude. It will impact mostly, of course, on small businesses. I note that the Government has included very substantial penalties that will apply if companies that have to pay this tax do not get the number right. If they are but more than 10 per cent out from the estimate, they will have to face extra penalties which, under the law, are very substantial. It is unfair and unreasonable. The Government should rethink this proposition, because it will be taking out of the business community almost $900m. That will have to be funded from within the general banking system and consequently it will have a great impact upon the liquidity of small business. </PARA>
<PARA> On top of that, although the Government claims that by this measure it will save enormous amounts in public debt interest, it also means that the equivalent amount of money will be put as an extra cost on small businesses at a time when they are seeking to restrain expenditure and to keep the cost of operations to a minimum so as to meet the great competition and the effects of high interest rates. I fear that this ill-thought out measure will cost business greatly and, unless it is modified, it will create enormous employment problems in the small business sector. One would hope that the Government has enough heart to consider the situation and think it through in the months ahead. We have noted that the Treasurer (Mr Keating) has said that he is prepared to look at the question of small business. We have had no commitment from him at all at this stage, it being now some 2 1/2 months since the Budget was announced, as to whether or not a change is made. I implore him to consider that measure as soon as possible. </PARA>
<PARA> It is interesting that in the Estimates Committee, when we sought to ask the departmental officers what consultations had been undertaken with business to find out just what the effects of this measure would be, it was quite clear from the statements from those officers that there was no precise estimate of the impact of this tax on companies; that very little work was done to try to assess how it would affect business and its liquidity. Along with that point, it is quite clear that, broadly, in the context of the recent reduction of the company tax rate from 49 per cent to 39 per cent which the Government announced about 12 months ago, it was expected that this was some kind of trade-off; that because companies now had the benefit of that tax reduction which was supposed to stimulate investment, some of that reduction has to be clawed back by virtue of these new arrangements. That is unreasonable, and quite clearly has not taken account of all the other costs that have been ripped off small business in recent times, such as the fringe benefits tax, the capital gains tax and the 3 per cent superannuation increases. </PARA>
<PARA> I notice that, since the Budget, the Government has made an announcement about the Commonwealth superannuation scheme for its own employees. The measures that have been announced by the Ministers generally are acceptable and certainly are welcome, but I am concerned that the allowance for public servants to take lump sums rather than pensions will lead to a considerable amount of money being left in the hands of managers. That, along with a number of other measures announced in the Budget for ordinary taxpayers and superannuants, will mean a huge rise in the demand for annuities being provided by various investment agencies in the community. If that occurs, one can imagine a situation where there is simply a shortage of things in which to invest, where it will be difficult for investment managers to be able to generate sufficient returns, sufficient income from their investments, to ensure that the people who have made those investments get an adequate annuity upon retirement. </PARA>
<PARA> That may or may not transpire-it would certainly take many years before the full impact could be properly assessed-but it raises the question of whether or not the pressure for investment paper and various investments in the community would lead either to an increase in the cost of annuities that would be charged to superannuants, or to a lower amount in the annuities than people might expect to get as a result of their investment. Overall, that would mean that people would have to put in more money to get the same return as they might have otherwise got or, alternatively, would not get as much upon retirement and, therefore, would not have the security in retirement that they expect. That is a consequence of very great effect and importance, and I hope that the Government will examine it properly in the course of its continuing examination of the superannuation system as it applies to its public servants.</PARA>
<PARA> Another superannuation measure announced in the Budget is the new arrangements and tax incentives for people outside the Public Service arrangements to take annuities rather than lump sums. It was predicted by the Treasurer in his statement that $60 billion per year could be going into superannuation by the year 2000. The incentives are such that obviously they will attract enormous amounts of money from those individuals who want to put money away for their own purposes, but where will it come from? We hope that it will come from consumption spending-that is, savings forced on people, from money that they would otherwise fritter away on things such as entertainment. </PARA>
<PARA> My worry is that, in the event of that occurring, and annuities becoming more and more popular and attracting more and more money because of the tax incentives, it may well cause people to worry less about owning their own homes. They may well think it wiser, because of the tax advantages, to contribute to superannuation rather than to pay off a mortgage. As a result, we could end up with a situation where fewer and fewer people own their own homes, and the average rate of home ownership-which has always been around 70 per cent-may fall. That would obviously be a bad thing for the Australian community because it would change one of the basic values of all people in this country-that people want to own their own homes. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that there is a danger in the Government's policy of having a tax incentive for superannuation and none for housing, because that kind of proposition could grow over time and people could end up being permanent tenants rather than permanent owners of their own homes. In that situation, we would become like some of the European nations, where there is a heavy emphasis on home tenancy and a reliance on pension income in retirement rather than the model we have had in this country, where people have developed their independence by owning their own houses, by paying off a mortgage during their working lives so that in retirement they have their home plus the capital stock it represents and, on top of that, access to considerable lump sums through superannuation. That is just one of the consequences that may develop, and it is certainly one that would be undesirable if it got out of hand. </PARA>
<PARA> A number of issues in the Budget concerning superannuation may have unintended consequences as far as the Government is concerned. The piecemeal approach that the Government has adopted since 1983 has lead to this mishmash or morass of superannuation legislation and regulation, which may well lead us down the wrong track in terms of trying to provide genuine retirement income for Australians. It may take us away from the basic objective of providing Australians with the means to become independent and to provide for themselves in retirement rather than the reverse. That would appear to be one of the most likely outcomes of the Government's policy. </PARA>
<PARA> I refer to the cost of housing. A report from the Housing Industry Association which I received recently, and which all senators would have received, on the affordability index for Australian cities, is quite scary. We find that, compared with a year ago, the so-called affordability index-which I think everybody understands these days-has dropped from something like 104.4 to 85.7. The report suggests that in Sydney, for instance, people have to put away 41 per cent of their income to meet mortgage payments. This is outrageous. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, a peasant economy. We are forcing people to live off the smell of an oily rag to meet their repayments. In many cases, no doubt, they have to sell up their houses because they cannot continue with these repayments. This is a direct effect of the Government's high interest rates policy. We have known for the past 15 months that interest rates are destroying not only the building industry generally and the home building industry and the ordinary people trying to pay off mortgages, but also businesses employing people. The interest rate policies that this Government has adopted are wrong. It is time for a change. The Liberal and National parties' Economic Action Plan must be put in place, firstly, to take the pressure off families and to provide them with extra money to stay alive and meet the very heavy imposts that they are suffering under the Government and, secondly, to ensure that the economic policies of the Government get a new direction towards improving the productivity of Australian industry, thereby improving our performance compared with the rest of the world and providing a more secure and prosperous future for all Australians. That is what the Liberal and National parties stand for, what the recently announced Economic Action Plan is all about and why the people of Australia are embracing it so warmly. They know that this Government, the Hawke-Keating Government, has failed Australians and is failing Australians every day. The policies are not working. The circumstances of Australian families are not improving; they are getting worse. Every day that goes by, taxes are getting higher through bracket creep and we are even seeing the imposition of new taxes as I described during my speech earlier. It is time for a change. We look warmly to the day of the next election and immediately thereafter the implementation of a new plan to change Australia's direction.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We are debating, at considerable distance, the introduction of the Budget, the Appropriation (Parliamentary Departments) Bill 1989-90 and cognate Bills, Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 1989-90 and Appropriation Bill (No. 2)  1989-90, which constitute the Government's Budget for 1989-90. The Budget was introduced on 15 August, more than two months ago. That is about the normal time span before the Senate debates the Budget but what is more significant this year than in most other years is that this Budget, barely two months old, is already way off course, out of date, irrelevant to the needs of the Australian economy and provides no answers whatsoever to the fundamental economic problems facing Australia, problems which it is no exaggeration to say are of a crisis nature.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Indeed, in most respects the Hawke-Keating Budget of 1989 suffered from all these deficiencies right from the very outset. There was no way in which the parameters on which the Budget was based could have been met. That should have been known at the time of the formulation of the Budget and certainly at the time of its introduction. The economic statistics and other events that have occurred in the period of just over two months since the Budget was introduced have confirmed that in no uncertain manner. One has only to look at the situation on the external account where the balance of payments deficit-a cumulative deficit-just for this quarter alone, the September quarter, is $5.8 billion, which is almost $2 billion on average per month, seemingly with no prospect in sight for major change other than one that may be induced by a major slowdown in the Australian economy in the first half of the calendar year 1990 or by the middle of that year. </PARA>
<PARA> There is also the risk of an improvement in imports induced by an economic slowdown being offset by problems on the export front for us. For example, some people estimate that wheat export prices are set to dive. Some people predict a fall of nearly 25 per cent in the next year. Other commodity prices are under some pressure as well. The outlook for the balance of payments, so far as the exports side of the account is concerned, is not highly promising by any means. Even if the Government achieves some result in terms of imports by a slowdown in the economy, that by no means guarantees that there will be a net improvement in the balance of payments. </PARA>
<PARA> Whether there is a net improvement or not, the fact is that the balance of payments is in an appalling state. It is in an unsustainable position which is, and is increasingly seen to be, of the gravest concern to the future of the living standards of all Australians. The balance of payments accumulating deficit is being accompanied by a continuing massive increase in Australia's foreign debt, a figure which, by the end of June this year, totalled a net $108 billion-that is $108,000m -which compares with $23.4 billion at the time that this Government came to office. In other words, the debt now is approximately five times greater than it was in March 1983 when the Hawke Government was elected. It is not true to say, as the Government has said, that the bulk of our external balance of payments problem is due to capital imports which will suddenly lead to a great burst in productivity increases which will set this country straight and on a more competitive route. Even making a generous allowance for imports of capital equipment in recent times, we go nowhere near meeting the huge and increasing gap in our balance of payments. </PARA>
<PARA> The consumer price index again is a figure which was grossly misforecast at the time of the Budget. We have just seen the figure for the September quarter come in at 2.3 per cent, giving an inflation figure of 8.3 per cent for the 12 months to September this year. If one had believed the Treasurer (Mr Keating) when he introduced his 1988 Budget, instead of looking at a figure now of 8.3 per cent we would have been looking at a figure less than half of that. In August 1988 Treasurer Keating predicted that by this time in 1989-90 the figure would be between 3 per cent and 4 per cent. The Treasurer got his inflation forecasts as wrong as he has got his balance of payments figures. </PARA>
<PARA> Since the Budget-indeed, this came out at about the time of the Budget, in the week that the Budget was introduced-we have had a very severe criticism of the Government's economic performance. It was the most overtly severe criticism I have ever seen by the Reserve Bank of Australia. If ever one needed an indication of how little the Reserve Bank or the central bank of a country thought about the policies of the government of the day and how concerned it was about those policies, one only needs to read the annual report of the Reserve Bank. That point has been made and debated considerably in this chamber over the period since it came out a couple of months ago. </PARA>
<PARA> We do not have to look just at our internal sources of criticism, though. The markets have also judged us accordingly, as have the international credit rating agencies. Both Moody's Investors Service and Standard and Poor's have downgraded our international credit rating, a downgrading which is not just symbolic but which has very significant physical implications. For a start, it means that many of the Australian commercial borrowers overseas have to pay more for their borrowings than would otherwise be the case. It also has a progressive erosion in the confidence of the Australian economy and the Australian currency. That in turn puts further pressure on the exchange rate, which in turn puts further upwards pressure on interest rates if the Government is seeking to maintain the exchange rate without letting it fall too much. So we have had a further indictment of the Government's policies, really, by the international marketplace and those who judge and watch carefully developments in Australia on the economic front. </PARA>
<PARA> The implications of these developments have been very severe indeed. Of all sections of the Australian community that have suffered, I believe that two stand out. The first is the Australian family, and particularly the single income family with young children. I believe that never in the history of this country has economic policy so adversely impacted upon families in this country. I will come back to that later on in my remarks, because one of the essential thrusts of the alternative policy proposals that the coalition is putting to the Australian people, and will be putting shortly at the forthcoming election, is a policy which recognises the fundamental role, significance and importance of the family in Australian life and also recognises the way in which families have been bled dry by the policies of this Government-not just in a direct sense but also in the flow-on impact of the policies themselves. I believe the family has been the sector in our community that has been most adversely affected by the policies and actions of this Government. </PARA>
<PARA> Running that section of the community a very close second-and the two are often interrelated, of course-is the small business sector. The 750,000 small businesses in Australia constitute its economic lifeblood. Many small businesses are now paying well in excess of 20 per cent for their borrowed funds. Indeed, the prime rate for business interest rates is now 20.5 per cent. For most small businesses, the actual rate that they would be paying is considerably higher than that. That is an absolutely crippling burden when one takes into account that, for many of them, business is increasingly slow and, therefore, they are left with higher stock levels that have to be financed. That is added to by the lower sales which are occurring for many of them. </PARA>
<PARA> It is not just the less well managed small businesses that are being hit to leg by the interest rate policy; it is also the excessive concentration by this Government on monetary policy to the exclusion of everything else. The reason for that is that the Government has not got the courage or fortitude to take the necessary decisions in relation to budgetary policy. It is the puppet of the trade union movement in relation to wages policy. Therefore, the Government is trying to fight the economic management battle with 1 1/2 arms tied behind its back. That is the fundamental problem and failure of this Government in terms of not only economic and wages policy but also all those other areas of micro-economic reform that need to be put in place if this country is going to become more productive and competitive, which is the sine qua non of any further increase in living standards in this country. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government is not prepared, able or willing, or allowed by its masters in either the trade union movement or elsewhere, to take the necessary steps. That lack of ability to take the necessary micro-economic reforms and macro-economic policy decisions which will allow this country to grow and be more productive is having an enormous impact on small business. As I said, it is not just the less well managed small businesses that are suffering. Most small businesses are highly leveraged. The very nature of small businesses means that they have to be normally highly geared. Because they need the money for expansion, they do not have the same calling on an equity base that larger companies have. So they need money for expansion, including in an expansionary phase new plant and equipment, even if it is leased, increased stock levels and the like. </PARA>
<PARA> I thought it was ominous that today a spokesman for the Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Ltd, in charge of lending for small business, quite unequivocally said that if interest rates continue at their present level it is inevitable that there will be many small business bankruptcies over the next six months. Those small business bankruptcies will be laid inevitably, indisputably and unarguably at the door and the feet of this Government. </PARA>
<PARA> The problems facing Australia are not new, but they are getting worse. They are not unknown: we have known them for a long time. Some of them are outlined very succinctly in what I believe is a very important report that was presented in July to the Government by a committee reviewing the export market development assistance scheme, commonly known as the Hughes report after Professor Helen Hughes, who was the chairman of the committee. As we know, she is Professor of Economics at the Australian National University. Without by any means endorsing her committee's prescriptions for the future, I believe that some things that that committee has said about the problems facing Australia are very important. I will read into the record of this debate some of those matters. The summary of the report initially points out:</PARA>
<PARA>The growth of Australia's external trade has accelerated since the late 1970s, but except for two years following the depreciation of the Australian dollar in 1985 and 1986, imports have exceeded exports. </PARA>
<PARA>. . . </PARA>
<PARA> The gap between imports and exports (and the even larger difference in the current account) has been financed by capital inflows with a consequent growth of external debt and debt servicing liabilities. Growing trade deficits in 1989, despite high commodity prices, culminating in a large trade deficit-</PARA>
<PARA>not current account deficit-</PARA>
<PARA>of nearly $1 billion in May 1989-</PARA>
<PARA>and that figure has remained at that sort of magnitude-</PARA>
<PARA>(with a current account deficit of $1.8 billion)-</PARA>
<PARA>again, we have had that; indeed, in some recent months we have been doing well if we have had a deficit of only $1.8 billion, which is unbelievable-</PARA>
<PARA>have brought balance of payments issues to the forefront of the political debate. </PARA>
<PARA>The report then goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA> The trade and current account deficits, and the ensuing level of external debt are not, however, the critical issues. A country as potentially wealthy as Australia can afford to use capital inflows, provided it does so by design and for productive purposes. This has not been the case. The growing external debt reflects our unwillingness to take the measures that would enable us to export as much as we need to cover the imports the economy requires for a high standard of living. It also reflects Australia's low propensity to save. </PARA>
<PARA>The report then goes on to talk about the relationship between macro-economic policies and micro-economic measures in changing a community's propensity to export and to save. It makes what I believe is a very important statement because, whilst micro-economic reform is very important, we are running the risk in this country of giving it publicity and attention to the exclusion of the dreadful macro-economic performance that is occurring under this Government. The Hughes report says:</PARA>
<PARA> Macroeconomic policies are as important as microeconomic measures in changing a community's propensity to export and to save. Macroeconomic management is the principal influence on the price of foreign exchange. The price of foreign exchange is in turn the main policy determinant of the level of exports for all but a handful of specialized exporters whose sales are little affected by price. Australian macroeconomic policy needs major changes to stimulate exports and savings. </PARA>
<PARA>Subsequently it states:</PARA>
<PARA> Macroeconomic policies are by far the most important determinants of exports. The rate of exchange dominates the profitability of exports but, except in the short run, the rate of exchange is largely the outcome of all of a country's principal policies-fiscal, monetary, trade, and income-and how they mesh together. </PARA>
<PARA>The whole tenor of that report is that we are not doing too well on either the macro or micro side. Treasurer Keating, though, was going to be the great micro-economic reformer. He had a bitter fight, we all recall, with Senator Button over who was going to control the Industries Assistance Commission (IAC). He saw it as his power base to lead him to becoming king of micro-economic reform. That was two years ago. What has happened in those two years? Absolutely nothing. To my knowledge, the Treasurer has not taken one initiative through the IAC in the last two years to fulfil his commitment to do something about micro-economic reform. </PARA>
<PARA> The IAC has been left virtually to rot, with temporary appointments at the last legal moment to vacant commissioner positions. We are now told in this Budget that the IAC is to be totally revamped. Some other commissions and committees are to be incorporated into it. The Treasurer has now made five references to the IAC, but he has not even drafted the legislation to revamp the IAC in the way in which he said in the Budget that he would do. There are some real indications that the Government is having considerable problems in drafting that necessary legislation, particularly in so far as it relates to the bringing into a new industries commission, the revamped body, of the Inter-State Commission. </PARA>
<PARA> That is another example of the shoddiness of Government decision making. Decisions are being taken on the run. They are being made without any careful analysis, not only of the concepts behind the decisions, but of the particularity of their implementation. We have a classic example at the moment of a government in disarray-I believe a government in decay-and certainly a government that has run off the rails in its decision making and which does not know where to go. </PARA>
<PARA> If ever we wanted an example of that, we need only look at the decision today by the Government to provide $36m-$12m a year over a three-year period-to Kodak (Australasia) Pty Ltd in the form of a production bounty. I believe that there is no conceivable justification for that decision. Indeed, I believe that Senator Button feels the same way because, in Question Time today, in response to questions about this matter, he made some quite extraordinary statements. He admitted that the Kodak decision was not consistent with the Government's overall industry policy. He said that it was different from other industry assistance decisions and it was different from the initial proposals that the Government had in mind earlier. When he attempted to explain why it was different, he made such points as the fact that Kodak (Australasia) has a marketing franchise from Eastman Kodak for the Asian area and that if this decision were not taken in the way that the Government had taken it, we would lose corporate tax, Asian markets, personnel and exports. </PARA>
<PARA> He said that there was no other Australian company in a similar position. That is simply incorrect. Many Australian companies have the capacity, skills and technology to increase exports. If they have problems doing that, I wonder whether the Government will be as generous to those companies as it is to Kodak. Of course, the answer is no, it will not. Why was this decision made in regard to Kodak? I believe there is only one answer, that is, that Kodak until very recently was in the electorate of Wills, the electorate of the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke). Most of the employees of Kodak live in that electorate. </PARA>
<PARA> The Kodak decision today is a classic example of all the worst features of bad government decision-making. It fits in an in- creasing series. The handling of the pilots dispute has been nothing short of criminal. The pay-out to the airlines to keep them running is really a sop, firstly, to the Australian Council of Trade Unions, in a desperate attempt to keep the accord intact-an accord which has been at great cost to the Australian community-and, secondly, to keep in with the Prime Minister's great mate, Sir Peter Abeles. Those decisions are beyond the comprehension of most Australians. Similarly, I refer to the Government's decision regarding the Reserve Bank's deal with the major trading banks in order to keep down housing interest rates. The banks have been bribed to do that by way of a pay-out to them of, in effect, $150m to $200m. </PARA>
<PARA> We have seen the unbelievable, incomprehensible decision in relation to Coronation Hill. Virtually no commentator in the land has not picked up the idiocy of the Government's Coronation Hill decision, in light of our balance of payments problems. This area is said to be worth about $7 billion in potential mineral export income. The Broken Hill Proprietary Co. Ltd (BHP) mined the area during the 1950s and 1960s and it wishes to mine it again, mainly for gold, but for other minerals as well. That would provide us with a major increase in additional export income. The Government has taken a decision not to allow that to go ahead, despite a promise by the Prime Minister not to vary the arrangements which were decided by the Government in 1986, when the Prime Minister wrote to the Managing Director of BHP, Mr Brian Loton, in the following terms:</PARA>
<PARA>I can assure you there has been no change in Government policy on the conservation zone concept or in relation to Coronation Hill. </PARA>
<PARA>He broke that promise. Only 12 months ago the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories, Senator Richardson, said that the mine would go ahead. He said:</PARA>
<PARA>There's not much point speculating about Coronation Hill not getting the go ahead. At this stage of the game I'd have thought most people in the Government see it going ahead . . .</PARA>
<PARA>As recently as July this year Senator Richardson, the responsible Minister, said that the odds were several million to one that the project would go ahead. Then, during August-September, all of that turned around. The Government broke a major promise to BHP and it broke promises and commitments to a range of other people. It took a decision which was of the most cynical, opportunistic, vote-buying, political nature that one could imagine. Even the Prime Minister was forced to admit the political nature of that decision. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to draw the Senate's attention to an estimated amount of $11.5m which is to be expended as part of the Commonwealth-Tasmania forest industry compensation package under the Department of Primary Industries and Energy. My fellow senators may or may not recall that a total package of some $50m was committed by the Federal Government to Tasmania. This amount was actually divided into four parts.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The first was $30m towards the establishment of plantations and was payable over five years or $6m per annum. The second was $5m committed to training programs for forest industries, also payable over five years or $1m per annum. The third part was $7m in the form of compensation payable directly to sawmills and veneer mills. This amount is payable over three years giving an amount of $2.3m per annum. The fourth part-and this is the interesting one-was an amount of $8m payable to the Forestry Commission to cover its sunk costs for such things as roads built into the southern forests area. This amount was immediately payable and was, indeed, expended in the last financial year. </PARA>
<PARA> What happened to that $8m? That $8m was paid to the State Government which promptly put it into the Consolidated Revenue Fund rather than writing off some of the Forestry Commission debt. It is interesting because this debt has been a subject of some discussion and debate by conservationists who frequently pointed out that this debt surely should be the basis for increased forestry royalties. What has the Government done? It has taken this money and used it for ordinary purposes of government. I wonder whether that sort of behaviour could jeopardise future Commonwealth payments to Tasmania for specific purposes. </PARA>
<PARA> While we consider that the greening of Australia's Government is costing the taxpayer a lot of money, it is interesting to note that the financial assistance for the management of the Tasmanian World Heritage areas is estimated to cost $5.471m this financial year, which is more than twice the amount expended last year. </PARA>
<PARA> If we look at the general Budget surplus estimated by the Treasurer (Mr Keating), we see that this will be severely diminished as a result of a number of recent events or unbudgeted payments. We now have new items, a payment to Kodak (Australasia) Pty Ltd of $36m and to the airline industry of $100m plus, depending on the duration of the strike. We are told that the strike is over but that the compensation is still continuing. An amount of $41m is to be paid to the pharmacists. All of these payments will whittle away the estimated Budget surplus and we are not even half way through the financial year. A further number of companies have friends in the Federal Government and some companies could find themselves in financial difficulty this year and seek Federal Government compensation. </PARA>
<PARA> Less than two years ago we saw the situation of Christopher Skase appealing to the Federal Government for increased television coverage legislation. The Federal Government agreed to his request and had it not been for the combined effect of the Opposition and the Australian Democrats that wider coverage would now have been law. This raises another interesting point. This Federal Government has been very slow to pick up many of the misdemeanours that have been highlighted as a result of the decline in some share prices and some notable crashes recently. I draw the Senate's attention to the need for urgent action by the Commonwealth and by the States, for example, to amend the law in relation to unpaid premiums on company shares. Considerable doubt exists in the legal fraternity as to whether an unpaid premium could be claimable in the event of a liquidation. The Herscu-Hooker fiasco has raised some doubt in the legal fraternity's mind as to whether the uncalled or unpaid capital is available to creditors in the event of a liquidation. These issues must certainly be remedied at an early opportunity. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government should be moving also in the area of interest payments. The Government is well aware of the reason for the massive increase in our overseas debt. Much of that has been to finance company takeovers. Had we a simple corporate law that required for any major acquisition that there be a 1 : 1 debt equity ratio-or 100 per cent-there would be less reliance on highly geared companies borrowing money. There would be less of the Hooker and Skase types of fiascos in Australia. A simple amendment, a logical amendment, a prudential amendment is all that is required. But this Government is not interested in the prudential safety and security of Australian companies. It is only interested in looking after its mates and in making political points. I just mentioned those as a number of neglected areas that I think are a disgrace to this Senate, to this Parliament and to other parliaments around the States in that they continue to ignore the unsavoury happenings in the commercial world and are blind to their consequences. They refuse to take adequate measures to stop these sorts of practices, practices that tend to limit our exposure to foreign debt problems. </PARA>
<PARA> Australian businesses are our only economic hope. Yet the Federal Government seems determined to make life as difficult as possible for them. The Federal Government has shown a complete lack of understanding of business operations. In fact, when the Government introduced its 85 per cent company tax payable within 15 days of the close of the financial year there had been a complete absence of preconsultation with industry on these matters. We are told that the Government regularly consults before embarking on such massive issues of tax change. True, it has a tax consultative committee. It was not consulted. It is also understood that only a minimum of consultation with Treasury and the finance Department or even with the Australian Taxation Office or the Reserve Bank of Australia took place on the implications of those proposed changes. In other words, a small group or clique have gone in on their own, in their own way, without adequate background or knowledge of how business operates. It is not surprising that this Government has displayed a complete lack of understanding of business operations. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me now dwell on this 85 per cent of the tax bill to be paid within 15 days of the close of the financial year. We have been given a hint-I will say no more than that-that there could be changes to the definition of small companies, that they may not qualify for this very tight payment of 85 per cent within 15 days. But unless the Government gets the appropriate legislation up very quickly it has forgotten the implications of the effect of substituted accounting periods. The operative date will not be 15 July; it will be very much earlier. </PARA>
<PARA> However, the Government has forgotten about the implications of substituted accounting periods and just assumes that the operative date will be 15 July. If the Government had an ounce of accounting sense and had consulted Mr Boucher or anyone else in the Australian Taxation Office it would have known that many companies have substituted accounting periods, which will bring forward very dramatically the effect of that payment. Yet, there is no legislation to cover this and no definition of a small company. The Government is bereft of any understanding of the implications of the laws that it intends to pass. It is about time it consulted with and took advice from people in its own offices, its own departments, or even in the professions. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us consider this requirement of companies having to pay 85 per cent of their tax bill within 15 days of the close of the financial year. For many, having paid their final 1988-89 tax instalment, two years will virtually be pulled into one. This applies to those companies which are not on a substituted accounting period. This will have the effect of increasing the corporate tax rate almost back to 47 per cent. I find this quite strange because the Government recently reduced the company tax rate, and got a lot of glorification for what it had done. However, the effect of this at a time when the Government is trying to reduce excess demand was to increase consumer spending. Yet, by this measure, requiring companies to pay 85 per cent of their tax bill within 15 days, company investment will be reduced on the part of the corporate sector. </PARA>
<PARA> These measures are quite inconsistent and it demonstrates very vividly to those people who are analysing Government policy that there is no consistency or logic in the way the Government goes about its planning of tax effects on companies. The results of one action are nullified by another, and the nullification has a long term adverse impact on future investment, which is not good for a future recovery. </PARA>
<PARA> This measure was dreamt up by a fairly junior Treasury official, we understand, to increase the Budget surplus by a mere $2 billion, from $11 billion to $13 billion. Of course, as I have frequently pointed out to Senator Button, small businesses will be the hardest hit, as their capacity to pay is limited, especially with the disastrous effects of the pilots dispute. The flexibility of business will be severely affected as a result of the restricted cash flow that will occur at this time. </PARA>
<PARA> Another Bill before the Senate, the Income Tax Assessment Amendment Bill, will impinge rather sadly on public hospitals which face deficit budgeting and rely on overdraft accommodation, since their interest bills will be significantly increased as a result of having to meet two instalment deductions a month because their group tax payments are over $5m annually. The effect on these public bodies-that is, the impact of the double payment of pay as you earn taxation on all group employers whose group deductions exceed $5m-has not been properly thought out. Surely it would have been reasonable to exempt public benevolent institutions from these sorts of provisions. Again, where is the humanity, where is the reasonableness and where is the straight thinking in relation to this?</PARA>
<PARA> I refer again to this 85 per cent, 15 day problem. Large companies will be able to draw their lines of credit in such a way as to escape a formality that small companies will not get away with. The Australian Taxation Office has indicated its preparedness to seek out those firms and deny them a tax deduction for the interest paid on money to pay their taxes. The large companies will be able to go out into the marketplace and establish lines of credit long before, say, 15 July, and they will get off. The small companies which borrow the money a few days before 15 July will get caught by this penalty of not being able to write off their tax bill. </PARA>
<PARA> Again, small companies are getting caught while the large companies will get paid. For the smaller highly geared companies in particular, borrowing may not be an option. They will also be faced with a tax problem when they are denied the opportunity to write off the interest as a tax deduction. The only fair way to deal with this will be to allow tax deductions right across the board for all operations. In effect, that is what the Commissioner for Taxation is now doing, although in law he should not be allowing those write-offs as a tax deduction. </PARA>
<PARA> The impact of all these measures on business and the economy will be quite dramatic, and severe pressure will be placed both on corporations and on the wider financial markets. Not only will the financially weaker companies find it difficult to raise money but the extreme pressure for funds in such a restricted time interval will put added pressure on interest rates-a factor which the Government has neglected. Again, there is the problem of small businesses not being able to find qualified accounting personnel in public practice for their external auditors, to get the necessary statements finalised and the tax paid within such a small time interval. </PARA>
<PARA> I repeat my earlier claim about this complete lack of a plan or a program to get the whole business taxation measure into a sophisticated plan which is understood. I also draw attention to the lack of pre-consultation with industry and the lack of pre-consultation with senior Treasury and Department of Finance officers, and even the Australian Taxation Office and the Reserve Bank of Australia. All these measures signify that we have a tired government which is grasping at straws and grabbing every extra marginal dollar it possibly can from the taxpayer. After all, the last package of superannuation Bills was primarily about getting an extra $1 billion into the Budget-and it was very successful. Very few people realised the wider implications of that, because we got caught in all the hype about the different types of funds and the consequences flowing from pre-1985 profits and so on. Australia is in a dangerous position. We are on a knife edge so far as our international reputation is concerned in relation to borrowing. Yet this Government, through its recent enactments, has shown a complete inability to plan, to direct and to consult. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The 1989-90 Budget details a number of programs for women. I want to take the opportunity in this debate on the Appropriation (Parliamentary Departments) Bill 1989-90 and cognate Bills to discuss the status of women in our society in general and, as a specific aspect of this, the matter of child-care provision and the threat that that is under from the Opposition's cynical vote-grabbing exercise whereby promises are being made but commitment is lacking. I will come in a minute to the question of trying to disentangle from the mass of confused promises or threats from Opposition spokesmen what their policy really is. It is a difficult process, requiring a clear head and a steady nerve-and I think I have both of those tonight.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I would like to talk about the issue of child-care and its place on the national political agenda. I do not want to make this another `my promises are bigger than your promises' speech; I would rather talk about the basic philosophies underlying the Government's approach and the Opposition's approach. I have been made very apprehensive by the whole attitude of the Opposition to child-care provision. I can only hope that those opposite never have the chance to get their hands on our children's services program. If they ever had the chance to change it, I believe the changes they would make would bear little resemblance to the promises being thrown around now. </PARA>
<PARA> Child-care would be a very low priority for a coalition government. What it would do with child-care would relate partly to the low priority it would give it within its overall economic program once the election was over and it was safe from the army of women voters. Equally, it would be dictated by its whole philosophically conservative approach to women and the work force. In other words, its treatment of child-care would be ideologically motivated, just as the Government's treatment of child-care has been ideologically motivated. But what a difference in ideology and what a different view of the place women have in the Australian society. Child-care is not an isolated issue. It means little to consider it in isolation from a consideration of the general position of women in our society. I do not believe that it is possible to have a proper commitment to child-care if a proper commitment to the rights of women does not exist. As far as I can see, this commitment to the rights of women does not exist within the Opposition parties. </PARA>
<PARA> Women have always worked outside the home. Women worked before the Industrial Revolution, during it and since it. From time to time during wars-most recently during the Second World War-they carried a large part of the burden of keeping the economy going in industry and agriculture. What is changing now is that at last there is some official recognition of the role that women play in our society. There is some formalising of that role. In the bad old days women were expected to carry the responsibility, but at the same time they were expected to be invisible while doing it, to fill gaps in the work force and to withdraw when required, as happened after the war. </PARA>
<PARA> Members of the National Party, in particular, still have a view of the role of women which was formed after the war when heavy propaganda was directed at women to force them out of the work force. Their perception is stuck in the 1950s. They have a misty-eyed vision of a mother in a faded but crisp print dress, waiting by the white picket fence, with her rosy-faced children clustered around her, for father to get home from a busy day doing men's work. Mother puts the tea on the table and the family sits down together. Mother says, `And how was your day, dear?', and all is right with the world. To the Nationals, any deviation from this picture is the result of some sort of conspiracy either from dreaded leftists or from even more dreaded feminists. Their view of the world is not only dated but also Anglo-Celtic. It does not accommodate the Vietnamese women working the night shift on the assembly line, the Lebanese couple working long hours in their corner shop, or a sole parent who might be supporting two or three children. This view of the world is not only not true now; it never has been true. It is a peculiarly protected middle class view of the world. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I say to the honourable senator that the feeling I have been left with since I came into the Senate in April is that those opposite have no commitment to the role of Australian women in the work force. The Liberals espouse conservative values which firmly place Australian women in the home, whether the family can afford it or not, whether the women want to be there or not. Only by understanding the Opposition's attitudes to women and their so-called rightful place can we know what value to place on what it says about child-care. Only by understanding the attitudes of Opposition members can we see the real place of child-care and other women's issues in their overall plans for our society. `Back to the Future' rules okay in the Opposition's world and women should remember this when they look at the siren's song of Opposition promises.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Child-care has not been an issue that I have heard spring readily to the lips of Opposition senators, at least not when there was not an election in the offing. Suddenly, the Liberal Party's opinion pollsters tell them the big news: Australian women care about child-care. That is wonderful. `Let us offer them something', say the Liberals. No wonder what they have offered has developed such cracks when the policies were developed from a position of expediency and cynicism-opinion poll driven politics again from the Liberals. Normally from Opposition senators we hear about issues such as income splitting to enable women to stay home where they belong and where, according to the Opposition, they really long to be. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am interested in the honourable senator's view because in this debate she spoke about what she saw as the Labor Government's social agenda and what it had led to. I do not want to, and I would not, denigrate the honourable senator in any way because I believe that she has a view of the world which is relatively benign and well meant, if, I might say, in my view-and, I am sure, in the view of the vast majority of senators-a little quaint. I think her view of the world is sociologically interesting and worth repeating. Senator Bjelke-Petersen believes that governments set social mores rather than reflect the reality of our society. In her speech, she said that Labor had directly undermined traditional family values, further threatening the stability of marriage and family life. The honourable senator believes that we have done this through equating de facto relationships with married relationships, through somehow encouraging homosexuality through government programs-although I am not sure what programs she was referring to-and by that dreaded old chestnut of discriminating against single income families in the tax system, forcing both parents in an increasing number of families out to work.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I wish that members of the Opposition would get out and talk to women about why they are in the work force. Certainly, some of them are there for financial reasons. They are in the work force because they must work to make ends meet or because modern community expectations mean that they want certain things for their families that would be unobtainable on one income. I do not think it is productive to try to separate the two motivations. We certainly do not seem to be able to retreat from this level of expectation. What does not seem to be genuinely in the Opposition's consciousness, though, is that many women-in fact, an ever-increasing number of women-work as a chosen lifestyle. They actually enjoy work. They believe that they have a contribution to make in their chosen area. They are not the flotsam and jetsam tossed around by the tide of economic events, as the Opposition would paint it. They have made a conscious choice about their lifestyle. It is the role of government to respond to this necessity or choice and to do its best to ensure as far as possible that women are not forced to make a choice between children and participating in the work force. The Labor Government has recognised this responsibility and has tackled it in a number of ways. </PARA>
<PARA> Child-care is not the only issue involved. Traditionally, women have been clustered in the lower end of the pay scale in jobs with no prospects and discriminated against in promotions and job classifications. The presumption on which employers felt entitled to act was that women were temporary and interchangeable employees; that they had jobs rather than careers; and that they could be treated in this light. What distinguishes the Government from the Opposition and what makes the Government's programs work is that a carefully constructed and cohesive social justice strategy has been put in place right across the wide range of issues that affect women. Child-care is one of those. This is why the Government has vigorously tackled issues of equal employment opportunity and affirmative action programs. We have moved to end institutionalised discrimination against women in the work force, both in the Commonwealth sphere and in cooperation with Labor State governments. </PARA>
<PARA> We have moved to increase skill levels and work force participation for women. This process started early in the life of the Labor Government with the community employment program. The community employment program successfully reintroduced many women to the work force. The main criticism that could be made of it was the lack of a formalised training component. However, our programs have gone from strength to strength and the current programs, including Newstart and jobs, education and training (JET), have assisted many women, including older women, back to a proper place in the work force. Important beneficiaries of these programs are and will continue to be women raising families on their own who, until now, have been in the social security net with the desire to get out but with no assistance to do so. </PARA>
<PARA> An important element of the Government's program for women is the retirement income measures contained in the Budget and the retirement income policy statement which implement the Government's objectives for superannuation for women, as outlined in the National Agenda for Women. These measures will significantly increase both the number of women who will have superannuation coverage and the adequacy of that coverage. For the first time, allowances will be made for the fact that women have to take time off for childbearing and often work part time for periods when they have young children. This is the way that the Government sees its responsibility to women. I contrast that with the way the Opposition sees its responsibility to women, as outlined in its so-called Fair Go for Women statement. With respect to the statement, the National Women's Consultative Council said:</PARA>
<PARA>The statement does not give any recognition to implementation of the National Agenda for Women . . . </PARA>
<PARA>Specifically on child-care, the Council said:</PARA>
<PARA>The rebate of $20 per week falls far short of any realistic recognition of the costs of child care but it will be sued to lessen government commitment to the children's services program. </PARA>
<PARA>If we read what Mr Connolly, the Opposition spokesman for social security, had to say in what could be described as a remarkably frank and honest interview in the Sydney Morning Herald of 23 October, we see that these concerns are very well-founded. I will quote a little from the article that was so embarrassing for the Opposition which does not want any of these matters to surface before the election. The first quote reads:</PARA>
<PARA>These funding measures, which will effectively privatise child care except for the needy, are certain to be strongly opposed by the child care lobby and women's groups. </PARA>
<PARA>The article points out that these measures were not outlined when the Opposition officially outlined its family package. Of course, they were not! I ask what honourable senators think about the next quote from the article, which reads:</PARA>
<PARA>Mr Connolly also revealed that under a coalition government middle income families would not be allowed into government child care centres. </PARA>
<PARA>What a surprise! How about the next quote for size? With respect to Liberal Government spending, Mr Connolly was reported to have said:</PARA>
<PARA>There will be no more money spent. It's a case of rejigging the system. </PARA>
<PARA>Of course, Mr Connolly was told off by the current Leader of the Liberal Party, his current boss, for his statements, but whom do we believe? There is a certain warped logic and cohesiveness to what Mr Connolly said that gives it the ring of truth. I go back to the National Women's Consultative Council's assessment of the Fair Go for Women statement. On the dependent spouse rebate, it points out that the Opposition plans to re-allocate money that the Government gives to the primary care giver. It said:</PARA>
<PARA>By increasing the eligibility threshold for the dependent spouse rebate, a payment primarily to men, the Economic Action Plan gives little recognition to the numbers of women re-entering the workforce and the costs incurred by them in doing so. </PARA>
<PARA>Mr Braithwaite, the Opposition spokesman for child-care, then also fouled it up. He promised that a coalition government would extend fee relief in private child-care centres. The proposition was never costed, or even promised or proposed in the original Opposition plan and Mr Peacock has had to beat a very hasty retreat on that one also. As to whether and how we have to factor in the Connolly and Braithwaite contributions-be they mark 1, mark 2, mark 3 or mark whatever, it is still very hard to tell. I see from the Sydney Morning Herald as recently as last Friday that the Leader of the Opposition's office was still telling the press that there was nothing in writing. I think that is a very wise move on the part of the Liberal Party to muddy the water because the more the water clears the more exposed the Opposition will be. On the other hand, the Government's children's services program is here and operating for all to see with all its glories and its faults. I would not pretend that it is perfect yet. One would like to see improvements to it and even more places than those achieved and those that have been promised. I do not want to see low and middle income earners disadvantaged in relation to fee relief when they just cannot get a place in a government funded child-care centre. </PARA>
<PARA> Despite those improvements that are still to come, the Government has a coherent policy that looks at the way in which women need child-care to be provided. As a consequence, it provides a range of services, namely, work related care consisting of centre-based day care, family day care, outside school hours and vacation care and multifunctional centres that are now operating in rural areas on a pilot basis. It provides occasional care and special services for a range of children with special needs, such as Aboriginal children, children of non-English speaking background or disabled children. It is a policy which, by the end of next year, will have seen the creation of approximately 100,000 new child-care places. It is a policy that aims at a good quality of child-care. </PARA>
<PARA> In the Age newspaper of 13 October, Dr Don Edgar of the Australian Institute of Family Studies was quoted as saying:</PARA>
<PARA>Overseas research on the effects of child care on children shows that those in quality day-care are `superior' in school performance, social competence and interaction to many who stay at home with friends or relatives. </PARA>
<PARA>I wonder about the Opposition's commitment to quality care when the Opposition spokesman on community services, Mr Braithwaite, has said that a wide range of informal child-care arrangements would attract the Opposition's tax rebate. The approach of the Government to women's issues and the pathetic approach of the Opposition to women's issues are out in the light of day. On the one hand, the Government has adopted a careful and systematic approach to removing inequities to women in our society in general and in the work force in particular. On the other hand, the Opposition has a haphazard grab bag of opportunistic and fragmented policies that hark back to the bad old days of the fist full of dollars. </PARA>
<PARA> I can only say to women who are making up their minds on the relative approaches of the Government and the Opposition that they should look at this Government's record and then look back to the record of the previous coalition government and examine the coalition's new promises in the light of its old record and lack of commitment to women. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Some months ago I was asked about what I regarded as my major political objectives. The following was my answer: to use the opportunities that are afforded by being in government to restore basic Liberal values; to redraw the boundary between what the Government should do and what people can do best for themselves, and thus foster values such as individual freedom, responsibility, excellence, respect for others and the duty to care for the genuinely needy.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I did not arrive at that statement of my beliefs in an idle moment. They were the culmination of my previous experience and my two years in this place during which I travelled the length and breath of my home State of Victoria and during which time I spent many hours talking to the old, the young and the in-between. One of the things that I learnt during all of that travel and all of that talk was that people are unhappy with this Labor Government because of the things that are set out in the Appropriation Bills now before the Senate. These Bills are the statement of the beliefs of the Hawke Government. They are not just numbers plucked out of the air; they are the costings, put by the Public Service, on the programs which this Labor Government has implemented. This is the burden of my argument-of the political objectives that I set as my goal. </PARA>
<PARA> The Hawke Government has become obsessed with a notion of managerial efficiency which finds its expression in programs and in program budgeting. In its obsession with efficiency, the Hawke Government has lost sight of the people-those ordinary people who want to be left to get on with the business of their lives without the Government poking its nose into their business. The Hawke Government has lost sight also of the people who genuinely need help. It has become so fixed with the elegance of its centrally applied solution to all problems and with what it mistakenly calls equity that it has forgotten-if it ever knew-that the person in Burnie is not the same as the person in Broome; that the needs and resources of Melbourne are not those of Merino or Mallacoota. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me cite some examples of how people are being let down by the Government's obsession with programs. One of the goals of this Government is to establish a ratio of nursing homes to hostels-of 40 nursing homes to 60 hostels per 1,000 head of population aged over 70-which is to be applied across Australia. The Hawke Government has introduced funding arrangements that have been named care aggregated module and standard aggregated module. That formula and the formula for funding have been applied across Australia. Without opposition from this side of the chamber and particular pushing by Victorian senators, the individual needs of small rural nursing homes and of bush nursing hospitals would never have been addressed. With calls from the Opposition, and from me in particular, the Government has come up with the idea of a multipurpose centre. However, that was not done until the Government was pressed into looking at the individual needs and the regional needs of people and into looking at the fact that centrally controlled programs do not meet the needs of those individuals or regions. </PARA>
<PARA> In their goal to set up a formula, a group of 8,000 older people in Victoria are caring for themselves in special accommodation houses. A similar group of people does not exist anywhere else in Australia. Those people receive only pension and rent assistance. They are deprived of any form of service. This Government has not addressed that issue. Home and community care funding is another issue that illustrates the point that I am trying to make. The Canberra Times of 11 June of this year carried a story that should have wrenched at the heart of every member of parliament. That was a story about a woman who was paralysed from the armpits down as a result of multiple sclerosis. Her husband, who also has multiple sclerosis, is confined to a wheelchair. He is being cared for by the woman's 76-year-old mother. The woman who has multiple sclerosis was taken to hospital. Her 76-year-old mother became ill as a result of caring for her daughter and son-in-law. As well, two younger children in the family-a 14-year-old and a 20-year-old-were pitching in to help. When the woman went to hospital she became very anxious that, when she returned home, she would be helpless and unable to care for herself because her husband would be unable to help her mother and her. That woman said:</PARA>
<PARA>I was told I did not qualify for attendant care under the Home and Community Care program until I had been in a nursing home for 100 days. </PARA>
<PARA>That says something about the flexibility and the caring of this Government. Because that woman did not fit into some sort of program, goals or whatever else, she was going to be left at home without any sort of assistance. </PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Council for Rehabilitation of Disabled (ACROD) is an organisation that is concerned about that group of people that Labor so quickly tells us it looks after and that the Opposition neglects. In the title article of its newsletter of April-May 1989, ACROD said:</PARA>
<PARA>What happened to flexibility under the DSA?</PARA>
<PARA>In reply to the questions that consumers ask, ACROD went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA>What happened to the flexibility Don Grimes promised us so often? What happened to the emphasis on consumer outcomes rather than processes?</PARA>
<PARA>In relation to the Government's guidelines, it went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . are too restrictive in scope as they indicate that only two models would be considered eligible for funding as new services-individual jobs in open employment and small businesses. </PARA>
<PARA>I wonder whether some of my Victorian colleagues have visited the Horsham wool factory, which is a perfect example of a program that would not be funded under the new arrangements. It is a creative, innovative program in which young people are learning a tremendous number of skills. That factory is setting itself up in such a way that, one day, it may in fact be self-sustaining. However, at the moment it does not qualify under those two categories. </PARA>
<PARA> We read about homelessness, a major issue of the Burdekin report. What does Mr Burdekin have to say about Government programs and Government outcomes? He said:</PARA>
<PARA>The Inquiry found that the most successful models for assisting homeless children are those where the community is involved. Programs which retain children and young people in their local communities-rather than warehousing them in refuges in places like Kings Cross-offer the best chance for family reconciliation, for continuing with education and training and for avoiding the all too common slide into prostitution, crime and drugs. It was also very clear to the Inquiry that the community-with proper resourcing, co-ordination and standard-setting from government-can provide young people with a degree of personal support which State institutions seem simply unable to deliver. The inquiry, therefore, did not propose a bureaucratic `big government' model, but one in which the government offers more effective encouragement and assistance to the community to take responsibility. </PARA>
<PARA>I heard Burdekin speak at the Liberal Party policy assembly. Given what I think his political views were, I am sure that he has been confronted in this report, that he had to stand and look at whether government had the solutions or whether the community might have the solutions. I believe the answer to some of the soul-searching that Mr Burdekin had to come up with lies in that statement I have just quoted. </PARA>
<PARA> The House of Representatives committee report on the Department of Social Security, which is entitled `Fairness, Courtesy and Efficiency' talks about some of the problems that were found when a review of this area was conducted. Page 3 of that report states:</PARA>
<PARA>It is clear that agencies often act as a substitute-</PARA>
<PARA>when the report talks about agencies it refers in the main to voluntary agencies-</PARA>
<PARA>for the Department where problems arise. A substantial proportion of the workload of the agencies consists of assistance to DSS clients who are concerned to maintain or obtain their entitlements. </PARA>
<PARA>Just as I am talking about that, it struck me and my staff, when we saw an advertisement in the newspaper from the Smith Family, that the very thing that was being spoken of in the Burdekin report, or one of the reasons why local community groups could deliver the service better than maybe some Government departments, was answered in an advertisement in which the Smith Family was calling for funds. The advertisement states:</PARA>
<PARA>But in our long experience, the families who most need our help are often the ones who are most reluctant to ask for it. That's why each application we receive is carefully assessed on its individual merits by trained, full-time staff. </PARA>
<PARA> It's their responsibility to ensure not only that the need is genuine, but also that the help is constructive. </PARA>
<PARA> I was fascinated by this advertisement, so fascinated that I went down to meet the people at the Smith Family. The Smith Family has been operating a lot longer in New South Wales than it has in Victoria. I believed that if the Smith Family was trying to convince the public to give money and it was using as an argument that it assessed each family and that was a reason for giving the money-it was making sure it was going to those in genuine need-that was maybe what the taxpayer ought to be demanding, if the taxpayer is giving money for those in genuine need. If an organisation such as that, flat chat for funds, thinks it is worthwhile to do that sort of evaluation and it is effective in delivering a service, then I think it behoves us to look at whether organisations such as the Smith Family are the sorts of organisations that are better able to deliver the service at grassroots. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not want to stay on social security and welfare type issues. I want to deal with another area indicated to me in which these programs do not always work. Sometimes when the Government puts into place some fancy formula, it does not always meet the needs of individuals. I have talked a number of times in this place about the problems that the specialty cheese industry in Vic- toria-I speak only about the industry in Victoria, because I know about it-is facing with regulations that may be suitable for large exporters of cheese but are totally unacceptable and inhibit the export of specialty cheese, which is in fact an example of the very thing Australia needs-import replacement and exports. That is another example of an overall policy, a government, centrally controlled policy, that does not meet the needs at a regional level. </PARA>
<PARA> How did we arrive at this situation? The source of much of this failure of policy and programs to deliver effective services to those in need can be found in the restructuring of the public sector under the Hawke Government. `Managerialism' has become the administrative buzz word. To paraphrase one commentator: `efficiency and effectiveness' have replaced responsiveness and accountability. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like to quote the words of Jack Waterford, who said in the Australian Public Policy newsletter No. 3 of 1988:</PARA>
<PARA>Although the Department of Finance, in particular talks about being output oriented, it is in fact the most input oriented of all. Better management to it means nothing more than achieving the same result with less administrative resources-less inputs. Almost all of the newly developed management tools are very good at telling one the cost per head or administrative unit of providing a service; what they are far less efficient at doing is telling one whether one is getting value for money; whether the service is worthwhile anyway, or whether it ought to be improved. Efficiency, in short, is not the same as effectiveness; still less, I would argue, is it necessarily about public interest. </PARA>
<PARA>One explanation for this focus on managerialism has been given by Terry Carney, the associate professor of law at Monash University and the chairperson of the National Advisory Council on Social Welfare. In reviewing the effectiveness of judicial review of decisions on their merits by specialist administrative tribunals, Professor Carney has contended that `they simply put an acceptable face on the harsh content of the substantive law; a content which is shaped by the pressures of fiscal responsibility, technological convenience, and considerations of preservation of bureaucratic power.' He goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA>The point [is] that rule-based remedies may do more harm than good . . . It becomes clear that rules are an especially attractive way of restricting rights in the interests of achieving fiscal restraint. The compensation recoupment saga testifies to that. </PARA>
<PARA>Let me give another example. I think Senator Reynolds will remember this one because I asked her about it in the Estimates committee. It relates to rights restricted in the interests of achieving fiscal restraint. Family allowances have been cut to people who live out of the country for more than three years. One group that has been particularly affected-and this group could most probably be numbered on a couple of pairs of hands, if not two hands-is a group comprising aid workers who work overseas on programs partly funded by government organisations. I can cite the instance of one family that I know of with four children who were working overseas on a medical aid program, a program which was funded by the Australian International Development Assistance Bureau. The family's income is $12,000 per annum, paid out of Australia. They pay Australian taxes. That family is deprived of its family allowance. The only way in which that can be remedied is by changing the law. When I asked about it, it seemed to me that the Government really did not care. Its attitude seemed to be that it does not matter about the individual, as long as the overall program works: they are not going to vote for us, anyway. They are only a handful, so let us not worry about them. It is about the service not being delivered to meet the individual needs. That is the theme of my speech tonight. </PARA>
<PARA> I will refer to Carney again. He goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA>But it may not have been so obvious that technological convenience presses inexorably in the same direction. This is because computerisation is perceived to be the means by which to satisfy the otherwise divergent goals of promoting bureaucratic uniformity of administration, while at the same time also achieving speedier, cheaper and more efficient decision-making. Personal judgments and individual assessments of circumstances are driven out-</PARA>
<PARA>that is right: driven out like the people working in Nepal-</PARA>
<PARA>in the rush to fashion legislation which can, in the main, be routinised (and `run' on the DSS computer). To this end the search is for the least complex formulae, based on easily established non-subjective variables; once located it is legislated into force, even if violence is done to the pre-existing rationale for that aspect of the welfare state. </PARA>
<PARA>Let me tell the chamber that the elderly of Victoria-that is the group that I can speak of-know what he is talking about. Even the bureaucracy is belatedly coming to recognise the faults that Professor Carney has recognised. </PARA>
<PARA> I quote from the Canberra Times an article called `Putting humanity back into programs', dated 14 March 1989. I thought, `This is fascinating; I must find out what this is all about'. I was interested in the theme of programs versus people and had been collecting information on it for six months. I read that a review had been done, and a document called Towards a fairer Australia-Social justice and program management: A guide had been produced to tell us how to put humanity back into programs. Is that not wonderful! The Government has printed a little book to tell us how to put humanity back into programs. I could tell it how to do it: get the service delivered and decided closer to the grassroots. The guide tells us how to find out how good is the service provided by the program. It tells us that one thing we can do is to consult, to get client feedback. I thought that was very interesting. </PARA>
<PARA> Only today there came into my office a paper called From Policy to Practice, by Adam Graycar, Commissioner for the Ageing. He says:</PARA>
<PARA>I seem to get a steady run of representations about government operating unilaterally and with insufficient consultation. </PARA>
<PARA>Here we have the Government telling its departments to consult and to find out how to improve the program by consulting the clients, yet the Commissioner for the Ageing is telling us that he finds that they are operating unilaterally and with insufficient consultation. He says:</PARA>
<PARA>Although governments try hard to consult and to be seen as consulting well, their efforts are often not treated as genuine. People with whom the government is consulting say `sure, they hold meetings, but they're not to listen, but to tell us what they believe and how things should be. Then they go and tell their Minister they've consulted.'</PARA>
<PARA>Those people must have been at a few of the consultations that I have been at. He says:</PARA>
<PARA>There is a great danger that consultation could become a one way affair, an exercise in window dressing and futility. This can happen if the authorities see their place in the Westminster system as sacrosanct, take insufficient note of the practice base, and become reluctant to share information. </PARA>
<PARA>I give another example: in New South Wales, under an enlightened Liberal government, the Water Board has gone even further than the Federal Government and has asked charities and community groups to help distribute $800,000 from a new hardship fund for those who genuinely need help to pay their water and sewerage bills. In so doing, the Government recognised the failure of its previous assistance schemes to get to the people who really needed help. </PARA>
<PARA> Amazingly, Labor Government Ministers are finally admitting that they have got things wrong. The Minister for Housing and Aged Care (Mr Staples), when introducing the Supported Accommodation Assistance Bill in 1989, told the House of Representatives:</PARA>
<PARA>The SAAP review found that the current SAAP subprograms have played an important role in the establishment phase of SAAP but suggested that the subprogram focus had created unnecessary complexity, led to restrictions which disadvantaged certain high need groups-for example, single homeless women and families-and hampered flexibility in planning and referral. It recommended the replacement of subprograms with target groups. Accordingly, under the new program, funds will be allocated within States each year according to priority target groups, rather than some subprograms. </PARA>
<PARA>He might have seen the light on that, but he has a long way to go yet before he sees the light fully. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister for Social Security (Mr Howe) is quoted in the Australian Financial Review of 24 July this year as saying that the present Government has learnt from the mistakes of its predecessor, the Whitlam Government, and would not put money into building bureaucracies to oversee social initiatives. He says that an important emphasis in the new phase of policy is to design programs to fit clients better, and particularly to encourage greater flexibility in work patterns, retirement, education and training. I only wish he had extended his list to include the residents of nursing homes and aged persons hostels, who are suffering from the rigidities of the present programs in that area. </PARA>
<PARA> How would the coalition do things better? I give two examples from the coalition's Economic Action Plan which show how we propose in government to change the focus back to people, back to the grassroots. Taking unemployment as an example, media commentary on the unemployment policy has centred entirely on people going off the dole after nine months. I have read in the press some interviews with school children who have said how hard it would be for them to register for the dole. What sort of an attitude has the Labor Government inculcated into our young students in schools that they think like this? The Victorian Government has produced a pamphlet advising school leavers on how to register for the dole; not on how to go about getting a job and recognising the virtue of honest labour, but on how to register for the dole. Not a word about work. No wonder we have kids with that attitude. </PARA>
<PARA> The commentators have not bothered to read the assessment of labour market training programs in the supplementary notes on expenditure, which review the effectiveness of existing programs and their failure to achieve the objective of putting Australians to work. These schemes have been criticised by the Auditor-General, by industry groups and even by those whom one would normally expect to be Government sympathisers. The Social Welfare Research Centre at the University of New South Wales in February 1989 discussed the employment of people with disabilities. It said, in the report it produced:</PARA>
<PARA>One of the difficulties is that the employment market is dynamic and many of the schemes developed by governments are based on arrangements which do not reflect market conditions. For example, something like 50 per cent of the jobs created in the last decade have been part-time, yet most employment creation schemes are predicated on the notion of full-time employment. Both the market and society value part-time employment. It is respectable and it pays. It is also a form of employment which meets the needs of many people. </PARA>
<PARA>This is not a Liberal government saying this; this is the Social Welfare Research Centre of the University of New South Wales. It says:</PARA>
<PARA>Recognising the importance of part-time work in no way indicates that people aren't entitled to full-time work but it does suggest a more flexible approach for many. </PARA>
<PARA>The Brotherhood of St Laurence issued a study of the Government's job training scheme. Veronica Sheen, speaking on behalf of the Brotherhood, said:</PARA>
<PARA>The Government's programs are too simplistic and too short-sighted. They are not recognising the very severe levels of disadvantage among long-term unemployed people who vary from homeless teenagers to single mothers and older sole parents who have not worked and are very nervous about it. </PARA>
<PARA>The coalition plan quite clearly indicates that those schemes which have proved to be effective will be retained and supported. People without jobs will be expected to undertake training to make them employable. Even more importantly, delivery of the training and employment schemes will be handed back to where it can be most effective. I quote from the Economic Action Plan:</PARA>
<PARA>Of particular importance in making these schemes more relevant will be the ability to permit state governments and community groups to manage them, to allow privatisation in contracting out, and the implementation of our community service for unemployment benefits program. Job creation schemes, as distinct from genuine training programs, will be curtailed. </PARA>
<PARA>Child-care is another area where we will see greater flexibility, despite what Senator Faulkner said this evening. Under the current Government schemes, families with an income of up to around $38,000 are entitled to a sliding scale of fee relief for child-care. Coalition policy will not change this. Of course, under this Government, if parents use private child-care centres or informal arrangements, there is no fee relief. To be eligible for fee relief, in other words, families must accept that the style of care for which the Government provides a subsidy is a style appropriate to their child or children; there is no choice. All children have different needs-each child can have different needs at different times of his or her life-and parents are the best people to make the judgment of what a child needs, not the Government. Coalition policy will provide the flexibility to allow parents to make these choices in the best interests of the family. </PARA>
<PARA> Informal child-care arrangements that qualify for child-care rebates would include any arrangement which is legal. For instance, any private arrangements which comply with State law would qualify where a parent requires child-care to enable her or him to work. It is interesting, in the light of the Government's criticism of the coalition's policy as giving to those who are not in need, to go back to the interview with Social Security Minister Howe in the Australian Financial Review last July. Mr Howe is quoted as supporting a strengthened welfare state. The report says that his idea is that the Government does not merely provide income and services for low income earners, but that all people have a right to some level of government service and program to counteract their family problems. It said that Mr Howe recognised that the new phase of social policy would have to be within the Government's tight budgetary framework, but he believed that politically now was the time to offer the electorate a bit more hope for the future. That is exactly what the coalition's Economic Action Plan is doing with its child-care package. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us look at the values the Government has established in the economic and social program being funded through these appropriations. The Government's values are those of a nanny state-of making someone else take the responsibility for our lives and how we live them; of stifling excellence in the name of equity; of fostering dull uniformity rather than rejoicing in diversity; of devaluing others, especially those who voluntarily service their families and communities; of offloading onto the taxpayer much of our individual responsibility to help those less well off than ourselves. We must turn to the question of why the coalition's action plan has been so well received. It is because the community in its broadest sense feels that it is time to restore the basic values I outlined at the beginning of my remarks, that it is time to redraw the boundaries between what government can and should do and what people can do best for themselves. It is time once more to foster values such as individual freedom, responsibility, excellence, respect for others and the duty to care for the genuinely needy. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In this debate on the Appropriation (Parliamentary Departments) Bill 1989-90 and cognate Bills I propose to talk mostly about the areas of industrial relations and wealth creation. This Budget is impressive indeed when measured against Budgets brought down by previous Liberal-National Party governments. It has for its purpose the short term goal of maintaining living standards, at least to the extent possible, with particular emphasis, as in the past, on the needs of the disadvantaged, the lower paid workers and those on fixed incomes. This is achieved through an enhanced social wage, a universal health scheme, increased pensions, more and better training and education for the semi-skilled, increased minimum wages in awards and new career path opportunities. No civilised society can ignore its disadvantaged people and not seek to uplift them, to provide for them the opportunity to play a more important and a more constructive role in society.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> All of us in this place, on both sides, want to see a happy, fulfilled society-well educated, healthy, trained and involved in productive work or at a productive calling. It is true that we have different ideas as to how we as a nation should go about this task and the goals we should set ourselves on the road to that achievement. But there can be no argument with any validity which does not recognise that we must create wealth in the form of commodities and services to provide for community needs. Without such community wealth it is not possible to finance education, health, communications, transport, social security payments and other services which must be financed from our national product. That is not to say that the Government has to provide them but they must be provided from our national product. However, I believe that the Government has a role to provide those services. </PARA>
<PARA> This Government has a clear attitude and a record which demonstrates that it differs greatly from the Opposition on the questions of the method of wealth creation and the division of that wealth amongst the Australian people. Past coalition governments have presided over periods of the `lucky country' syndrome, the era of confrontation between capital and labour expressed popularly as `them and us'. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The people Senator Panizza represents established that-the servant and master relationship and the use of the Army and the troops against the shearers in 1890 in Barcaldine. They put people in gaol for sticking up for their rights and wanting to belong to a union and have decent wages. The people Senator Panizza represents-the Liberal and National parties-are responsible.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This Labor Government, when in opposition, set about making an agreement with the organised trade union movement to provide for rationalisation of industrial relations, wages stability, industrial safety and health, plans to encourage higher productivity, and the opportunity for workers through their trade unions to achieve greater equity in the work environment. Building on this firm base, when the Australian Labor Party came to office it activated plans to assist important industries such as steel. The Broken Hill Proprietary Co. Ltd (BHP) threatened to get out of steel because it said it was getting a return of 2 per cent. In car manufacturing there were far too many models and manufacturers. Even they have now come to that conclusion and have consolidated in many ways. We can look also at the heavy engineering package and the textiles, clothing and footwear package. </PARA>
<PARA> In the process of assisting these industries the previously agreed position of the trade unions was most important-the transfer of wages to profit to ensure finance for companies which should then have invested such profits in modern machinery, research and development in Australia. I repeat that there was an agreement, and unions accepted depressed wages to allow more profits to accrue to employers to allow for increased investment. More work and greater prosperity in the community would have followed. Some employers took the opportunity and made those investments; other employers did not. It some cases employers invested their money overseas and imported the products of other countries. There was a clear breach of faith by some. </PARA>
<PARA> The trade unions did not take their bat and ball home but persevered. The trade unions, in the knowledge that Australia was no longer a lucky country but in the different and difficult position of a small economy in a large world economy, saw the need to become efficient in a way that we had not done before. Interest in management policy and direction was very important to them. In the past unions had allowed management to run its own race. If it wanted to be in-efficient and closed, workers got other jobs under the old lucky country syndrome. This was no longer possible under the changed circumstances, and trade unions began to take an interest in the way that factories and workplaces were run, because if the workplace or factory closed workers lost their jobs and their ability to provide in the best way they could for their families. </PARA>
<PARA> A demonstration of the good faith of the trade unions and the efficient way in which they went about their work was the heavy engineering package. Workers were very keen to talk to employers and with the Heavy Engineering Board which was carrying out the process to convince employers to upgrade their machinery, to look at changed work methods and to become more efficient. But in many cases employers were not knowledgeable enough-in some cases it appeared to border on stupidity-to be able to take advantage or seek to take advantage of that package. Others did take advantage of it and sought to use it as a prop for inefficiencies of the past and the present. </PARA>
<PARA> The trade unions were not interested in such a proposal and neither was this Labor Government. The Labor Government did everything it could in that area. As I recall, it provided a package at that time of $130m. I think some $30m was not spent because the employers were so ineffective and so inefficient that they were not able to make use of it. The trade union movement is often accused of being bloody-minded and it is often said that the Labor Party panders to the trade union movement, but let me go back to the steel package. A lot of new technology was introduced by BHP. In fact, its agreement to invest in machinery and change work methods was far exceeded as it progressed down the path. BHP invested many millions of dollars more than it had intended to. The bottom line is that its profit, according to its information, has gone from 2 per cent to in the area of 15 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA> What, on the other hand, has occurred in the trade union movement, the ranks of the workers in that industry? Tens of thousands of workers have lost their jobs. Were they happy? No, they were not; they were very unhappy. There was some industrial disputation about the matter but finally they have accepted the position that at least there are still many thousands of jobs in the steel industry, a very virile and good industry which contributes to the local economy by way of manufactured goods that are also import replacements and also by getting into the export trade. </PARA>
<PARA> To my knowledge, BHP has been one of the worst companies in terms of industrial relations. However, I was in a state of shock when I talked to people from the company on one occasion in one of our Caucus committees and found that they had changed their whole attitude and that they were seeking to develop better work relationships. It appears that in many cases they have been able to achieve that: industrial relations have improved. To show the importance of the package that has been put together by the trade unions and the Labor Government with regard to training, I point out that on the occasion of the visit to BHP the management said to us that in one of the rolling mills it needed to reduce its staff from 20-odd people down to four or five as a result of increased technology and the use of computers. Management said that it very much wanted to give the opportunity of continued employment to people in that particular section but it was not able to because the people had not been given the type of education that would allow them to be retrained. So management had to bring in new people and retrench the total work force in that area, which was something that it did not want to do. I make that point to emphasise the importance of the policy of the Labor Government with regard to training. </PARA>
<PARA> If one looks at what is contained in the Budget and what the Government is seeking to do, we find that $12m has been allocated to the workplace reform program in the area of restructuring. This program will help with the process of change within the workplace. Specifically, the program will establish a network of workplace resource centres to provide expertise on a range of issues involved with bringing about award restructuring; provide work change assistance for projects bringing about award restructuring; and provide work training to enlarge the pool of specialists skilled in industrial relations and workplace participation and practice. The Government is not just saying to companies, `Get off your backside and train people. You change your work practices and upgrade your management skills'. The Government is saying, `You should do these things, but we will help you', and it has provided $12m in the Budget for that. The program is a good example of the Government's tripartite approach to bringing about micro-economic change. Government, workers and management are developing specific strategies and processes for change. </PARA>
<PARA> The Affirmative Action Agency, which was covered to some extent by Senator Faulkner, has received $1.643m. The Agency will continue to carry out the affirmative action program. Worksafe Australia has received, in round figures, $20m to achieve a healthy and safe working environment. The total operating budget for the Department of Industrial Relations is $43.6m with key initiatives being the extension of workplace reform programs. It will encompass the establishment of a network of workplace resource centres where expertise in human resource management, industrial relations and production planning and design will be available on a commercial basis for enterprises involved in improving efficiency and competitiveness through the award restructuring process. Five centres are due to open shortly. Again, that is a very clear demonstration that the Government is not just saying, `Look, you do that, we are not going to help. We think it is up to you'. The Government is weighing in with this sort of money to assist employers to come to the realisation that, by acquiring the skills to bring about those changes in the workplace and in work restructuring, the whole of our community will benefit. </PARA>
<PARA> Recently, the Minister for Industrial Relations, Mr Peter Morris, addressed the Australian Council of Trade Unions Congress. He made the point that the programs were designed to help achieve a competitive, efficient and flexible labour market. No honourable senator on the other side of the chamber could argue with that. I think that is what they want; I have heard them talk about it. The Minister also made the point that the programs were designed to provide and maintain an industrial relations system which is fair to all parties. I would hope that that is what honourable senators on the other side of the chamber want. I am not encouraged to believe that, hearing some of the utterances. The Minister said that the programs were designed to promote fair wages and conditions for all workers while assisting Australia's economic performance and to fulfil the Government's responsibilities as an employer to ensure fair and responsible treatment of its work force. The Minister went on to say that 1.5 million new jobs had been created. Over half of those have been filled by women, largely because of the discipline of trade unionists who realise that the biggest improvement to people's living standards can be achieved only through useful and productive work. I have heard honourable senators on the other side of the House talk about useful and productive work. It sounds like some sort of a compromise government, does it not?</PARA>
<PARA> The Minister said that inflation had been cut significantly under the Government as a result of restraint and responsibility exercised by trade unionists. The Minister made the point that the Government's social justice strategy had helped the low paid and those outside the official work force to cope with the difficult period of economic adjustment. We have increased family assistance and cut taxes to ensure that those less well off in our community have improved protection-that is, that the tax cuts went to the lower paid workers. The spread of superannuation in Australia has improved people's security during retirement. The Minister said that for the first time, men and women in the work force were entitled to superannuation benefits with a contribution from their employer and that this had particularly helped the lower paid worker. </PARA>
<PARA> Even though there have been superannuation schemes in existence in this country for many years, most of them were designed in such a way that either the workers never got anything out of them and the fund could legally be used by the employer and was retained in his possession or people, when they transferred from one job to another, were not able to take with them the benefits of that superannuation scheme, beyond that which they may have contributed themselves. Of course, under the policy of this Labor Government, in cooperation with the trade unions, that has changed and now there is good portability where people can go from one job to another and maintain their superannuation rights and not lose their entitlements. The vesting is there to protect people. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister went on to say that great emphasis had been placed on education and training and that this had led to a vast expansion of training opportunities since 1983, especially for young people. The new training guarantee scheme is designed to keep up the momentum and ensure that industry pays its fair share. My experience over many years in the trade union movement was that I found a number of employers were excellent trainers and had a great conviction about the need to have trained and skilled people in the work force coming on so that industry could be well served and people were proud of the skills that they developed and were able to use. But there are lousy employers who are only in business to maximise their profits. They always waited until someone was trained by another employer and then stole those employees by offering a bit of additional money. In many cases, they did not keep them very long because of their employment record. The Government's proposition is that those who do not want to train are not forced to, but they should contribute to those who do. Those people who finance training in an equitable way would not be required to spend any more than they do at the current time. It could well be less. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister also made the point that sex discrimination and affirmative action legislation has given new and greater opportunity to women in the work force. The legislation has now been given real substance with new skills and career paths. The legislation makes it very clear that the restructuring of awards takes into account the right of women to be trained and to take up positions in the work-place as they desire and wish. The establishment of Worksafe Australia has led to national standards for occupational health and safety. One of the things that one can look at to really understand the need that has existed for so many years is the way in which asbestos was considered to be no threat to health but is now realised to have caused the deaths of many people, the most famous case, of course, being Wittenoom Gorge where the asbestos was actually put on the school ground. I am not suggesting for one moment that some of those people really understood what they were doing. I know what they were told, and I have seen the evidence. So there is a need for Worksafe Australia, and it plays a very important role. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister said that the 1984 termination, change and redundancy decision protected and involved workers in changes affecting them at the workplace. It was a decision which brought Australia into one of the most advanced democratic societies. Of course, if people must lose their jobs and become redundant, and it is to the benefit of society, as a result of possibly cheaper commodities and a more efficient industry, they should not bear the total brunt. If it is of benefit to the community, the community should be prepared to contribute to the payment of compensation for those lost jobs and opportunities. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, the Minister pointed out that the rate of industrial dispute was less than half the level of the previous Government. In 1982, the time lost per 1,000 workers throughout Australia was 2.2 days. In the financial year 1986-87, it was 1.1 days per 1,000 workers. The Government supports the centralised wage fixing system and equity for workers, while at the same time using whatever legitimate means are available to increase productivity and community wealth. However, in the Opposition's policy paper on award restructuring, issued by Mr Reith, it is stated:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . changes to traditional notions of standard hours . . . over periods such as a month or a year, rather than a week, with a high degree of flexibility in allocating work hours within the stated period . . . </PARA>
<PARA>Under the proposal, one would live only in order to work, with the employer deciding when one is going to work. Those sorts of conditions will never be accepted by workers who, in the main, are gregarious and like to work together within certain hours and play sport, and pursue social activities together, in their leisure time. They do not want a system in which half of them are at work and half are at home. They do not want their leisure time or time in which they can use education facilities dictated to them in that way. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Reith suggests that the work force, the people in the community, subject themselves to these arrangements in the best interests of employers. He suggests that employers introduce specialist weekend shifts, with employee consent provisions as part of the package. Of course, that consent will not be forthcoming. He also suggests the removal of the eight hour a day limit on ordinary working hours which may be worked. This would allow, for example, 12-hour shifts. This flies in the face of all industrial relations experience at the workplace. It would take us back to the early part of the century when mining companies expected people to work for 50 hours a week. They found that if they reduced that to 44 hours a week, they got just as much production out of them because people had a higher rate of productivity. If one wants to read about such experiences, one needs only to look at Australia's . . . Awakening written by W. G. Spence in which he outlines his experiences at a mine in Victoria. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes. The Opposition's proposal flies in the face of all our experiences. It suggests a return to the situation that prevailed earlier in the century. Mr Reith may have forgotten to include one point: he may want to put the children back in the mines. He must have made a mistake when he omitted that. He refers in his paper to the spread of hours. Already, trade unions have agreed to some increase in the spread of hours. I think the figure they have agreed to is an extra two hours, from 6 a.m. to 6 p.m., whereas the agreed spread of hours used to be from 7 a.m. to 5.30 p.m. So at least they have accommodated that suggestion. The organised trade union movement is looking at a number of other possibilities that will accommodate the needs of employers and of the community, but not in a way which will penalise those people who are required to work certain hours.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We hear the suggestion that trade unions should not be in existence. Only today I heard an employer state that the ideal situation for employers would be for trade unions to cease to exist. That man is having a foolish dream. There will always be a recognised role for labour and for capital. That is not to say that trade unions will always play a confrontationist role. Certain stages of history have required such a role to be played because of the terrible way in which employers exploited workers, so that they were forced to take such confrontationist action. Unions have changed their attitude and are seeking, in an equitable way, to cooperate with employers in order to create, as I say, a higher level of productivity in the interests of the community. Not all unions have had the ability or the resources to work this out and to put forward ideas which, when looked at in conjunction with employers' ideas, can ensure that a final compromise can be reached. </PARA>
<PARA> Those people who see unionists as bogy people should look at the trade union movement as a group of citizens who are represented through a formal structure who could well be convinced, in an equitable situation, to cooperate more and more with those employers who have a reasonable attitude to their community responsibilities and to the people who work for them. Of course, this does not require the creation of enterprise unions. Certainly, I agree that the amalgamation of trade unions is vitally important to the future of this country and to our prosperity. There should be one union in each workplace. But that same union should be nationwide in order to provide facilities so that workers will be able to negotiate with employers in an enterprise situation. </PARA>
<PARA> In answer to a question I asked during an Estimates committee hearing the other night, one of the officers from the Department of Industrial Relations made it very clear that even within the current Act there is provision for voluntary agreements-agreements that can be mutually agreed between the employer and the union or unions. A number of those are already registered. They are virtually enterprise agreements which have the award as a base and which include some other agreements. In some cases they move away from the award and become enterprise agreements. There is no problem under the current industrial relations system, the current union structure and the current employers structure. But the development of enterprise unions would take away the right of workers to be properly represented, to have made available to them the expert advice they need to negotiate their wages and conditions properly, to look at better ways of managing enterprises and to assert their democratic right to have a say at the workplace. </PARA>
<PARA> Trade unions introduced the idea of the 4 per cent trade-off. It gave a wage increase which was mutually acceptable to unions and employers. Recently they also developed the proposal for a 6 per cent increase in exchange for award restructuring. There is no doubt that the award restructuring will be beneficial to this country. I make it clear that my understanding is that there will not be trade-offs in relation to that restructuring. That restructuring will provide the sort of award structure that will give the opportunity for the best possible, efficient use of labour in an industry or enterprise, which will reduce labour costs and which will also enable people to produce quality products on time, which is very important to this country. </PARA>
<PARA> The sort of goodwill and trust that can be developed in this process is worth hundreds of millions of dollars to industry. Employers would be selling themselves short if they suggest that there should be trade-offs, if they try to destroy some of the hard-won gains that the trade union movement has made. Those gains are considered to represent the standard in this country and in other countries. Award restructuring is vitally important and it should not be sabotaged by unthinking, foolish employers who seek too much as a short term trade-off instead of looking for good faith, trust and a fairly efficient development of better working practices. </PARA>
<PARA> In conclusion, I mention that the Trade Union Training Authority has been playing a very important role in restructuring. It has been of concern to some Opposition members and some people in the community that employers do not have the opportunity to talk to trade unionists in order to put their side of the case, particularly in regard to restructuring. I know that when there was talk of a need to change the approach taken in certain industries, employers were invited to lecture trade union officials, shop stewards and opinion leaders in trade unions to explain what they were about, what they hoped to achieve and what they were prepared to agree to in terms of workers' reward, and what employers needed in terms of profits and financing in order to invest in research and development, new machinery and better technology. We need a balanced view. I think such consultations help to create it. </PARA>
<PARA> Those in the trade union movement need clearly to understand the meaning of equity. We need to accommodate the workers' right to strike while gradually working towards the elimination of the reasons for friction. Trust is vitally important. So long as wealth is created, there will be disputes. It is the manner in which such disputes are resolved that is important. All Australians want to have access to health care, education, excellent transport and communications systems, decent living standards, a continually improving social wage and the provision of assistance to other countries that are worse off than ourselves-that is, foreign aid. They want Australia to play a role in international forums and seek to reach a state of genuine world peace, without which it is not possible for anybody in this country, be they involved in the labour or capital areas, to reach the sorts of goals that we mutually want to achieve, and some goals about which there may be some conflict in the community. </PARA>

Here we stand now with a 17 per cent-if not higher-housing interest rate and with a 21 per cent business rate. We stand here with a foreign debt at a record level of $108 billion, up from $23 billion at the end of the Fraser era. We stand here with an inflation rate of 8.3 per cent and rising.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Has Senator Cook finished interjecting? This country used to be regarded as a land of opportunities, the lucky country, as Senator Burns told us, rich in natural resources. Those resources were developed during the Liberal governments of the 1950s and 1960s and the benefits were reaped in the 1970s and 1980s. The benefits from those resources started to run down badly with the advent of this Government. What are the reasons for this decline? Amongst other things, it is because this Government has allowed the decline in incentive for Australians to work and progress. It is one thing to work but it is another to progress. The Government has brought about this decline in many ways including a too heavy taxation regime which punishes endeavour by bracket creep, the slaughter of the small business group by the imposition of capital gains tax and by having to take on more and more load from high interest rates and charges, the continuation of work practices such as those involved with coastal shipping and the waterfront which have put costs beyond all reason, and the heavier reliance on social security as an option to working.</PARA></TALK.START>

These are issues that we will deal with when we come to government. They are spelt out in our Economic Action Plan. Let us look at some of these aspects and where they have led us. Let us look at the issues of the waterfront and coastal shipping. As I said, I listened quite intently to Senator Burns earlier. I have listened intently to what this Government has had to say in the last few weeks when it has been acting in the pilots strike. Yet we have the continuing rorts and rip-offs of the waterfront. I happen to be in an industry that cops the end cost of those rorts.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="JI4">Senator PANIZZA</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There might not have been quite so much going on at the time. The actions on the waterfront have certainly been encouraged by the Government. This Government, despite the report of the Inter-State Commission, has done nothing to smash the outmoded work practices that exist. The only promise that the Government has made to date has been to saddle the Australian taxpayer with an expense of $600m to pay off waterside workers who have abused the situation perpetually.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> A few weeks ago during the pilots dispute a remark came from an honourable senator on the other side of the Senate-I wish I could remember who made it-that we are only interested in people earning over $50,000 a year. I remember that I too made a remark at the time that that figure applies to the grain handlers in Newcastle who earn $70,000 a year for a 25-hour working week, even though they probably do not actually work those hours. Coastal shipping is in exactly the same position. Nothing has been done to encourage competition in that area. The Government is talking about putting competition into the airlines system and taking action to smash the Australian Federation of Air Pilots. Yet it will allow the coastal shipping situation to remain exactly the same as it has been for years. </PARA>
<PARA> I refer to rail transport. There has been some improvement in this direction especially in the State of Western Australia. I believe there has also been improvement in rail transport in the eastern States but nowhere near enough to bring the efficiency level to where it should be. This Government's policies have maintained the inefficient waterfront system with record costs to ship grain out or to handle other products being shipped into Australia and the inefficiency of the rail system to enable the transport of goods in a fast and efficient method and at a reasonable cost across Australia. What has the Government done to address these issues? The only mode of transport that has achieved any efficiency of late has been the road transport system saddled, as it may be, with certain penalties under this Government. In its own way that situation has led to the fiasco of the volume of freight carriers on our main roads at the moment. Because of the inefficient coastal shipping system and the inefficient rail system, our road systems are being overloaded. With the distances in Australia-after all, the distance from one side of Australia to the other is further than that from London to Moscow-there should be no way in the world, no way imaginable, that road transport should be able to compete with rail. Yet at present it does and it beats it hands down. That is the reason that there are more and more transporters on the road. </PARA>
<PARA> I know the road transport industry pretty well, as I have been involved in it for most of my life. The road transport system should principally be used in areas where there are no rail facilities. Also, coastal shipping could be used to transport goods. Of course, road transport must operate between Alice Springs and Darwin, and there is the Perth to the Pilbara route, although in that case coastal shipping should be able to help. However, even though other modes of transport are available the tendency is to transport more and more by road. There is no way in the world that so many trucks should be crossing the Nullarbor as they do and we should not have so many trucks driving between Sydney and Melbourne. I understand that this involves some 400 trucks a night.</PARA>
<PARA> The trucks are not speeding any more now than they were five years ago. From my own experience I believe that they have slowed down in the past five years. However, the number of accidents continues to increase. This is occurring for two reasons. As I have already pointed out, a number of vehicles have increased loadings. Also, through the natural progression of an affluent society the number of cars on the road is building up. The number of trucks is also increasing and the two do not mix very well. </PARA>
<PARA> Another reason why roads are becoming unsafe is that they are being increasingly pounded with the increased number of trucks driving on them every night and every day. The level of road funding provided by the Government is not sufficient, having regard to the increasing volume of road traffic over so many years. Accepting that we have these inefficient transport systems in relation to coastal shipping and rail transport, with the emphasis going back onto roads, one would think that the Government would increase the level of road funding. However, what has the Government done? In the past nearly five years the Government has kept road funding quite static, which means in real terms that road funding has decreased by some 36 per cent. Certain figures have been thrown around, but I believe it is between 36 per cent and 40 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> I know the roads in Western Australia pretty well, and I know that the standard is decreasing. The Great Eastern Highway, the Great Northern Highway and the Albany Highway have taken a pounding in the past few years. About three weeks ago I was stuck in Canberra for a weekend and rather than spend it in the city I decided to hire a car and I went out and had a look at some of the agricultural areas of New South Wales and also parts of Victoria. The state of the roads in New South Wales is unbelievable and this is also the case in parts of northern Victoria. </PARA>
<PARA> They are in such a state that one would have to say that the Western Australian roads are very good, if one compared them on that basis. I am talking about miles and miles of main highways in New South Wales and Victoria. The off-highways do not get so much of a pounding. One finds corrugations in the bitumen and in many cases one comes across a square of about 10 metres by 3 metres-say, half the road-which has been simply carved out with a front-end loader, filled with gravel and rolled to the best extent possible. With the present funding program I cannot see how we will ever catch up with proper road maintenance. </PARA>
<PARA> The increased number of road transports on the roads, due to the inefficiency of the other transport systems, is the reason why Australian roads are becoming more dangerous by the day. I believe that road transports should be used only where other bulk transport is not available. Containerisation has been with us now for at least 25 years, and with the modern rail linkages, carriages and locomotives there is no reason at all for the present amount of road transport traffic between the capital cities. </PARA>
<PARA> I can see no reason why we cannot have even faster trains. They could probably use double-decker containers, even though the second container might have to be a special one for heights. These sorts of facilities could be used for goods that have to be transported between two cities or two destinations in a hurry. For goods that have to be transported from one side of the country to another in not such a hurry we could make a lot better use of coastal shipping facilities of some sort, using containerisation. I am afraid that we have missed our opportunity there because of what has happened in relation to coastal shipping and on the waterfront. </PARA>
<PARA> As I have said, in looking at the costings in relation to the various modes of transport, there is no way in the world that road transport should be able to compete. Further, the rougher roads mean that transporters are faced with increasing costs for the upkeep of their vehicles. These costs relate to the sorts of roads that vehicles must travel on, even bitumen roads. With the increasing costs of upkeep of their vehicles, road transporters have to do more and more trips in a shorter and shorter time to enable them to meet those costs. The result is an overloading of the roads such as we have at present and this has resulted in the recent spate of road accidents. </PARA>
<PARA> I now refer to the Government's propensity to close up resources. We used to be the lucky country, the land of opportunities, where everyone could do well provided that they worked. Today we need even more export income, but what is the Government doing? Why are we closing more and more avenues of resources? Mining at Coronation Hill, in Kakadu, has been postponed for a very expedient reason. However, following the election we will be in government and things will be different. Further, there has been the removal of logging in certain parts of Australia, in Queensland and Tasmania, particularly. About 18 months ago I asked the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories (Senator Richardson) a question about Shark Bay, and he denied that there was ever any idea of locking up pastoral ground in that area. Of course, we know what happened to that. So, more and more resource areas have been closed off, while in other cases more and more obstructions are being put in the way of production. </PARA>
<PARA> Australians must be given an incentive to work and prosper. This Government is doing everything in reverse. We have bracket creep, capital gains tax and tax on superannuation. I heard a Government senator talk about what this Government has done with superannuation. I will tell the Senate what this Government has done with superannuation: it has found another milking cow. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, it has learnt how to milk the superannuation scheme. The capital gains tax is now five years old. And it is starting to bite. Many businesses start off as husband and wife shows. They develop trade in order to sell the business to enable them to move into something else. Under this Government's capital gains tax, which will be reversed as soon as we are in government, if a roadhouse or a sandwich bar is sold, 49 per cent of the gain from the effort is paid to the Government's coffers, with the result that many such business people are not able to move on to a bigger business or have to borrow the money to do so. It is time that Australians recognised their business men and women in the way they recognise their sports stars and did not treat them as speculators, which is exactly what is done by this Government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Several weeks ago there was an article in one of the Sydney papers about the New South Wales Government bringing in a Bill to require members of the State Parliament to disclose their interests. I have no beef about members of parliament or senators disclosing their interests. I wish I had kept the paper but from memory the headline said that the whistle had been blown on members of parliament because, by having to disclose what had been accumulated, a member of parliament had been found to have three houses. Is that a criminal offence in the eyes of the average Australian these days? The particular member that the paper referred to happened to be an independent member. The newspaper lauded the fact that members of parliament would have to disclose their interests. The newspaper made out that to own property was something to be ashamed of. </PARA>
<PARA> While I was lying on my back last week I had time to reflect on things, including whether I was going to get back here eventually. I read Senator Macklin's proposal for senators and members to declare what they have. As I said, I have no beef about declaring interests. Senator Macklin said, `Fancy anyone owning gold shares being able to vote on the gold tax issue'. Let me take the argument a little further. Let us see how many members of parliament would be left if we excluded all those who had interests. I presume Senator Macklin has children in tertiary education. If they are in line for a tertiary allowance, or whatever it is called these days, Senator Macklin should not be allowed to vote on that issue. If members of parliament have a car and drive for reward or pleasure, they should not be able to vote on road funding. If we take the argument through to its conclusion-and this Government is trying to paint the picture that it is a criminal offence to accumulate property-nobody here will be able to vote on anything. </PARA>
<PARA> I now refer to the incentives for people to work in Australia. I am talking about those who are capable of working but who choose not to. I respect the wishes of those people who do not wish to work but, if they wish to spend their time on the beach in Broome, or in the Margaret River area, or on Bondi Beach, or if they wish to travel with their girlfriends to Bali or hitch-hike across Australia, that is their prerogative; but they should not expect us to pay for them. That is something we will change when we are in government. Our policy will weed out the friends of this Government-the social security cheats. At the end of nine months on the dole they will be assessed to see whether they belong to a special category and, if they do not they had better start looking for a job. Looking for work means looking for work where there is work, not looking where there is no work. Senator Cooney earlier said-and I respect what he has to say-something about old people and people on invalid pensions. We are not after the old person; we are after the young and able bludger. Anyone genuinely on an invalid pension-if a person has permanent brain damage, for instance-will continue to receive assistance. As the Senate knows, I am in the building game. I personally know dozens of people who are on the invalid pension but who are still working under the subcontract system. Under our leadership they will be weeded out. If they do not fill the bill, they will be made to accept their responsibilities. </PARA>
<PARA> There are many unemployed people in the cities, in the beach resorts and in the surfing spots while at the same time jobs cannot be filled in the countryside, where 85 per cent of Australia's export income comes from. They are not heavy jobs. There are jobs as shire clerks, as ordinary clerks in shires, as shop assistants, as teachers, and as swimming pool operators. Those jobs cannot be filled, yet the bludgers are on the beaches. I will give the Senate the small example of a migrant couple who run a roadhouse in my home town. They have not been in Australia very long. They have been able to educate their two children in tertiary institutions. They were looking for an assistant to help them in their cafeteria. They approached a girl in the town who they knew had been on the dole for a long time. They said, `Would you like to work for us?'. The girl's answer was: `Do you think I will give up my dole to work in your greasy cafeteria?'. When one lodges a job with the Commonwealth Employment Service for, say, machinery operators, one immediately gets 10 phone calls. A bloke is picked to start and then he will find all the excuses not to start. He simply uses that to enable him to put it down as a place where he looked for work but could not get it. </PARA>
<PARA> Country people provide export income and pay tax to keep the dole bludgers in their comforts. Australians need to get their priorities right and recognise what people in the countryside do. There are many things that the Government could do in the immediate future to get things moving. Senator Richardson, in his latest outburst in the Land, said he intended to depopulate marginal areas. I hope he has plenty of money ready because he has many people to buy out just in the areas of Western Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> I finish on the note that, when the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) said that no child need live in poverty by 1990, it was a twist on what he actually said which was that no child would live in poverty by 1990. It will no doubt surprise you, Mr Acting Deputy President, that I agree with the Prime Minister, but it is not by his machinations that we have come to that situation. There has been no need for any child in Australia to live in poverty since the end of the Great Depression. It is only because the Government has let the country run down that we have even to talk in terms of having no child living in poverty by 1990. Let us get back to the priorities of Australia and get Australia moving again. That is what we will do when we come to government in the next few months. </PARA>

<PARA> Tonight I will address my remarks to the problems of pharmacists. It is now one and three-quarter hours before midnight-literally and metaphorically-as it is one and three-quarter hours before the demise of Australia's pharmacists and chemists. It is appropriate today to address some of the problems, including the inevitable bankruptcies, that are facing a great many of them. Tomorrow morning, something like a third of Australia's chemists will be facing ruin, devastation. The Government is removing $30m from the pharmaceutical benefits scheme. In every State in Australia the pharmacists will not sleep tonight. They will be worried about their futures, that of their families and how they will meet their commitments and keep their children in school. They will have a sleepless night tonight as they toss and turn, wondering what they have done to offend the Government and why it should seek to make such a massive attack on them. </PARA>
<PARA> A number of pharmacists in Queensland will face ruin. About 80 country towns have only one pharmacist. If those pharmacies fail in those towns, whole towns will be ruined because a town without a pharmacy is incomplete. People will do their shopping in bigger towns and we will see the death of many Queensland rural towns. I refer to towns like Goomeri, Blackwater and a number of others. It is not only the pharmacies that have been put at risk; whole towns have been put at risk because when a major sector of trade, such as a pharmacy, is removed from a town which has one butcher, one pub, and one garage, people will bypass that town. Purchasers will do their business in another area. </PARA>
<PARA> The Federal Government has admitted that it wants to shut down one-third of Australia's 5,600 pharmacies. Since January 1988 there has been a sustained attack on and systematic destruction of the community pharmacy by severely reducing incomes. This has not just come on in the last week or the last two months. It has been happening since January 1988. In January last year the wholesaler margin was reduced by 5 per cent from 15 per cent to 10 per cent. That was designed to lower the wholesaler's profit. Of course, it never did so. It just cut off the margin of the pharmacist. The wholesalers passed on their increased costs to the pharmacists. Pharmaceuticals that used to cost $100 now cost the chemist $105. </PARA>
<PARA> Six months after that, the pharmacists were advised to double the number of items included in a standard prescription. It could quite genuinely be argued that that was a cost saving, but it also had a massive effect on pharmacists. They now prescribe half the number of prescriptions they prescribed previously and their shop trade has been affected. I do not think that Senator Tate would understand that people picking up their pharmaceutical requirements from a pharmacist generally also buy something in the merchandise area. So that has had another effect on the incomes of Australian pharmacists. </PARA>
<PARA> In January this year the Pharmaceutical Benefits Remuneration Tribunal recommended that the handling fee for pharmaceutical benefits scheme drugs be reduced by 10c from $2.64 to $2.54. The pharmacists took that recommendation to court and won the case. Subsequently, the decision was challenged and their win was reduced. But the most devastating blow delivered to pharmacists by the Government was its acceptance of the Remuneration Tribunal's decision to abolish the 25 per cent mark-up. While the rest of Australian workers have received a 6 per cent pay increase, Australian pharmacists have had their incomes reduced by 23 per cent, which represents an average loss of approximately $27,000. </PARA>
<PARA> I fail to understand, and I fail to see how anyone of average intelligence can understand, how the Labor Party Government can expect people to trade with no mark-up. Senator Tate and Senator McKiernan are reasonable people. They should understand that it is quite impossible for a trader-whether it be a chemist, a hardware store, a grocery store or any other merchandiser-to purchase a product at a certain price, wholesale it at the same price and continue to stay in business. It is so elementary that everyone in the Labor Party-whether or not he or she has ever been in business or in any other industry-should find it easy to understand. It is just not possible to run a shop, to pay the rent on that shop, to pay the insurance on the shop, to pay the wages for the employees of the shop and to pay all of the other sundry expenses that retailers incur and sell products for exactly the same prices at which they were bought. I challenge anyone in the Labor Party to give me an intelligent explanation of how it is possible to survive when one is buying a product and selling it at exactly the same price. </PARA>
<PARA> I would have thought that a reasonable gesture on behalf of the Labor Party would have been to go to the chemists-if this is the course that it wanted to pursue-and to say to them, `We are going to reduce your mark-up and we are going to pay you a small service fee on the products you sell'. It would have been reasonable for the Government to go to the chemists, and offer to buy their stock and then sell it back to them on consignment. In other words, if a pharmacy carried $70,000 or $80,000 worth of pharmaceutical benefits stock, the Government could purchase that stock and sell it back on invoice, paying the pharmacists a small fee. That would have been within the realms of possibility to allow the pharmacists to survive, but the Government has not done that. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has expected pharmacists to pay 23 per cent interest rates. That is what small businesses are paying. It is no wonder that people in small business are going out backwards. Pharmacists are taking a risk when they buy stock because they are outlaying the money that they have earned. If drugs remain on pharmacy shelves past their expiry date, pharmacists lose that stock. Alternatively, a doctor who is prescribing a particular drug may have a change of heart and will prescribe another drug for the same type of ailment, thereby making the first stock redundant. The risk is all the pharmacists' and none of the Government's. </PARA>
<PARA> The expenses of retailers are increasing dramatically. The pharmacist is unable to meet those expenses. As a result, he is going to be even less likely to be able to meet his commitments. During the past two or three months I have spoken to many pharmacists-I have been on the phone to them continually-who are frantically trying to obtain some sort of a decision, some sort of a turnaround, from the Government. Their pleas are falling on deaf ears and they are receiving no satisfaction. I cannot understand why the Government is determined to adopt this course of action. The pharmacists are frantic. They are not used to dealing with people such as those in the Labor Government; they are used to dealing with old ladies, weighing babies and talking to people. All of a sudden they have become involved in a confrontation with the Government. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government knows that pharmacists have a high social rating and great credibility in the community. The Government has set out on an orchestrated campaign to discredit the community perception of pharmacists. It has been a sustained and cleverly mounted attack, obviously undertaken with the benefit of research. I can imagine Australian Nationwide Opinion Polls Pty Ltd polling Australian citizens on how they regard pharmacists and then coming back to the Government and saying, `Look, you have a problem there. These people are held in high regard. The only way you are going to survive is to discredit them'. We see the mean Labor machine going into attack against those innocent victims-people who are not used to bloody, dirty, political fighting. </PARA>

However, the Budget Papers indicate that the total expenditure on pharmaceutical benefits is around $120,000. Obviously, there is a discrepancy in that brochure of about $130m.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to speak tonight about the historic endorsement of Mr Ray Leslie as the Australian Labor Party (ALP) candidate for the seat of Parkes in the House of Representatives. I believe that Mr Leslie's endorsement means that he is the first Aboriginal candidate to contest a House of Representatives seat on behalf of a major Australian political party.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I have also been moved to speak in this adjournment debate because of a range of misleading newspaper articles which have appeared regarding Mr Bob Liddle, who is the recently dumped Country Liberal Party (CLP) candidate for the seat of the Northern Territory. Over the past few months it has been variously claimed that Mr Liddle is the first Aborigine to gain major party pre-selection for the House of Representatives, or is the first Aborigine to contest a House of Representatives seat, or is the only Aboriginal candidate to be contesting a House of Representatives seat in the next Federal election. I believe that all these claims are wrong. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me give the Senate some examples of the more absurd claims about Mr Liddle's candidature that have been made in the press. The first comes from the Australian newspaper of 13 February 1989 in an article under the heading `CLP fields its first Aboriginal candidate'. The article states:</PARA>
<PARA>An Alice Springs businessman-</PARA>
<PARA>that is, Mr Liddle-</PARA>
<PARA>has become the first Aborigine to gain preselection by a major party for a House of Representatives seat. </PARA>
<PARA>On 18 February this year, the Melbourne Age, in an article headed `Aborigine expects to win marginal Northern Territory seat' stated:</PARA>
<PARA>An Alice Springs Aborigine is confident of winning a marginal Northern Territory seat at the next Federal election. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Bob Liddle, 48, is the first Aborigine to contest a seat in the lower house. He won preselection as the Country-Liberal Party candidate last Saturday. Mr Liddle says he went in with eight out of 47 votes and came out with a majority. </PARA>
<PARA>Then on 4 March 1989 in the Australian, in a very long article by Greg Sheridan called `The candidate with a difference', the following appeared:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . Bob Liddle has made history by becoming the first Aborigine to be preselected by a major party for a winnable seat in the House of Representatives. </PARA>
<PARA> Just two weeks ago, he was chosen by the Northern Territory Country Liberal Party (CLP) to contest the seat of the Northern Territory in the next federal election. </PARA>
<PARA>Recently, on 26 and 27 October, umpteen stories have come from Australian Associated Press. The story of 26 October is headed `CLP meeting was a ``South American court'', says Liddle'. By this time, of course, Mr Liddle had been dumped by the CLP. </PARA>

<PARA>The dumped Country Liberal Party candidate for the House of Representatives, Bob Liddle, said today he would renominate for the Northern Territory seat. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Liddle, the first Aborigine to gain major party pre-selection for the Lower House, was dumped at a special meeting of the CLP's central council last night. </PARA>
<PARA> Speaking from his Alice Springs home, the mining consultant said the meeting had been run like a `South American court' and that he had been the victim of racist elements within the party's executive management committee. </PARA>
<PARA> `There are a lot of rednecks in the management committee,` Mr Liddle said. </PARA>
<PARA>In the Weekend Australian of 28 October, under the headline ` ``Chameleon'' gets marching orders', the following appeared:</PARA>
<PARA>The only Aboriginal candidate for the forthcoming election for the House of Representatives has been dumped by the Northern Territory's ruling Country Liberal Party (CLP) . . . </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Liddle reacted bitterly to his sacking, which he blamed on `racist elements' in the CLP's executive, the management committee. </PARA>
<PARA> `Racism is not entrenched in the party,' he said, `but there are a lot of rednecks on the management committee'. </PARA>
<PARA> `The fact that I am an Aborigine has a lot to do with my dumping.'</PARA>
<PARA>Finally, I am pleased to say that, in last Monday's Australian, although it managed to receive only two column centimetres, the first retraction appeared. The article, by Patricia Crawford and James Morrison, is headed `Tuxworth Nationals exploit CLP disarray'. Right at the bottom with an asterisk is a very short retraction which states:</PARA>
<PARA>In The Weekend Australian it was reported that Mr Liddle was the only Aboriginal candidate for the forthcoming federal election. This is not correct. Mr Ray Leslie, an Aborigine, is the endorsed ALP candidate for the NSW seat of Parkes. </PARA>
<PARA>I believe it is appropriate to set the record straight on this matter. It is true that very few Aboriginal candidates have contested House of Representatives seats, but there have been some. I know of three cases. There may be others. I do not pretend that this is an exhaustive list. I recall Mr Galarrwuy Yunupingu's nomination-I am sure Senator Tambling will recall it-in the seat of the Northern Territory in 1980, when he stood as an independent and secured 5.59 per cent of the vote. I know that, in 1987, in the seat of Kalgoorlie, a Mr Frank Chulung, who was an Aboriginal candidate for the Australian Democrats, contested that seat and was successful in gaining 4.42 per cent of the vote. </PARA>
<PARA> The much commented on Mr Liddle also stood for the Northern Territory seat for the House of Representatives in the 1987 general election. Again, I am sure that Senator Tambling will recall that event. At that time, Mr Bob Liddle represented a very small political party-I think it would be fair to call it a splinter group-the Northern Territory Nationals. He received a healthier 17.08 per cent of the vote. </PARA>
<PARA> As I said, there may well be other cases of Aboriginal candidates contesting House of Representatives seats. If there are, I do not know of their candidature. I am not aware of those cases, but I certainly do not pretend tonight that the three candidates whom I have mentioned necessarily represent an exhaustive list. But there are at least those three candidates. As I say, there may be more. I think it is also fair to point out that neither the Country Liberal Party nor the Northern Territory Nationals could be described as a major political party. In fact, the CLP holds one seat in the Australian Parliament. I do not think Senator Tambling would argue with me on that point-and Senator Tambling, of course, is a senator. </PARA>

<PARA> I did not rise to speak in this debate about the very serious problems of the Country Liberal Party in the Northern Territory. I do not want to embarrass Senator Brownhill. I want to talk about the candidature of Ray Leslie, who has made history as the first Australian Aborigine to contest a House of Representatives seat on behalf of a major Australian political party. He is an outstanding candidate. </PARA>
<PARA> If Senator Brownhill wishes me to, I will contrast the problems that Mr Liddle has with the CLP organisation in the Northern Territory with the very strong and unanimous support that Mr Ray Leslie has received from ALP members in the seat of Parkes in New South Wales. There is a genuine commitment on the part of rank and file Labor Party members in that electorate to see him elected, and a real commitment on the part of the local Party organisation. It is unfortunate that Mr Liddle has described the CLP as racist and redneck. The Labor Party supporters of Parkes are very proud and supportive of Ray Leslie's candidature. He is a fine candidate. He left school at the age of 15 years and then for 15 years was a rural worker and a shearer in western New South Wales. In order to further his own and his family's education, he moved to Bathurst in 1979. In the early 1980s he worked as a social worker at Bathurst Gaol and then spent two years working for the Department of Social Security at Mount Druitt in Sydney. </PARA>
<PARA> Ray Leslie has given a lifetime of commitment to community work. He is well known for his efforts on behalf of aged people, sole parents, prisoners and their families, and Aboriginal people. One of Ray's greatest achievements was his involvement with the establishment of the Townie Hostel in Bathurst, in order to further the education of children from isolated areas. He was also elected chairperson of the Aboriginal Catholic Ministry. Ray now lives in Dubbo and works as a regional liaison officer with the home care service of New South Wales. </PARA>
<PARA> He has received great support from his family in his campaign for the seat of Parkes. His wife, Loretta, has been very supportive of his campaign. In fact, Loretta is a much easier person to contact than Ray these days, as he spends most of his spare time out on the campaign trail, which is something that most of us in this place know about. He has three adult children, all of whom are pursuing successful professional careers of their own, and are also supportive of Ray's future political career. I am personally very proud to be associated with Ray Leslie's historic campaign for the seat of Parkes. I have a particular interest in that electorate as I am its duty Labor senator, and I will be very glad to relinquish that responsibility when Ray Leslie wins that seat on behalf of the Australian Labor Party at the next election and becomes the first Aboriginal member of the House of Representatives. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Senate will recall that last Wednesday there was a very vocal demonstration outside Parliament House, and there was considerable debate on the issues relating to pharmacies when a number of us spoke in the Parliament. It has been brought to my attention also that a letter was allegedly circulated by the Minister for Housing and Aged Care, Mr Peter Staples, to Australian Labor Party electorate offices which has described pharmacists as `greedy and stupid with an inflated idea of their worth'. I am sure that pharmacists throughout Australia find that particular type of statement and attack on them totally out of all relevance to their industry. The pharmacists in the Northern Territory, of course, have a particular problem. They have met in recent days and have made a very worthwhile statement with regard to the particular examples and circumstances that apply to the Northern Territory. I seek leave of the Senate to incorporate in Hansard the statement issued by the 20 pharmacists who comprise the Retail Pharmacists Association of the Northern Territory.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The statement read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA>Retail Pharmacists Association of the Northern Territory</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA>1. INTRODUCTION</PARA>
<PARA>Pharmacists are one of the most respected ethical professionals in the community and have a reputation as being law abiding, honest and conservative. We are not politicians, we are not radicals, we are not a militant group and we are not out to grab more money or power in the industrial scene. We object to the mud slinging tactics the government (Minister Staples in particular) is using to try to discredit our fine profession. </PARA>
<PARA>This dispute was initiated and exacerbated by the Federal Government. It is now reaching a stage where a confrontation will occur. Pharmacists have been very patient and rational in their approach, relying on common sense to prevail. We now realise that this will not happen and we have been forced to take a stand. </PARA>
<PARA>The government used the Pharmaceutical Benefits Remuneration Tribunal to decide on how much to cut income of Pharmacists. Other tribunals deal with extent of increase of incomes. The prime examples are MPs and Judges. </PARA>
<PARA>A cut in income is unheard of in Australia. All industrial action in Australia has been based on increasing the standard of living. This action by the Government is aimed on reducing the standard of living. It will reduce the standard of living initially of the individual Pharmacists, then as pharmacies close down the retrenched shop assistants will be affected, then as pharmaceutical services are reduced the sick and elderly will be affected and it will eventually reduce the standard of health service for all Australians. </PARA>
<PARA>2. THE FACTS</PARA>
<PARA>Percentage mark up is fundamental to all businesses, there are none that function without it. </PARA>
<PARA>The Federal Government is trying to take this percentage mark up away from pharmacies. </PARA>
<PARA>If the 25% mark up on pharmaceuticals is reduced to zero, pharmacies will go into liquidation and close down. </PARA>
<PARA>This sort of government intervention to wilfully destroy a sector of the small business community has never before happened in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA>Pharmacists have not asked for a rise in income, we ask not to be reduced. </PARA>
<PARA>The cost of a prescription on average is less than half what it is in the United States or England. </PARA>
<PARA>The average price of a prescription has dropped from 6.5% of average weekly earnings in 1955 to around 2% of average weekly earnings in 1989. </PARA>
<PARA>3. OUR ACTION</PARA>
<PARA> We cannot let our businesses and our profession being destroyed. We will use every means available to keep our businesses viable. If this means being forced out of the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme we will do so. </PARA>
<PARA> All the retail pharmacists of the Northern Territory stand 100% united on this point. </PARA>
<PARA> The implications of such action would be drastic. The whole community especially pensioners and people on social security of any form will be immediately affected. All prescriptions would have to be paid in full by the patient or dispensed at the hospital. This would be chaos for the community and the government not to mention the hospital dispensary. </PARA>
<PARA> As it stands now we continue to be part of the P.B.S. for as long as possible. </PARA>
<PARA> If the government reduces our mark up to 0% then at that time we will start charging a professional fee of 35 cents extra per prescription which is the equivalent of our reduction. </PARA>
<PARA> We will be adding this fee to concession prescriptions on November 1. This will make the cost of a concessional prescription (now $2.50) become $2.85. The extra 35 cents will be treated as a separate fee and the patient will be informed as to why they are being charged extra. </PARA>
<PARA> Pensioner prescriptions and finally veterans affairs prescriptions, will have the same fee added in the following months if the government does not reconsider. This is not action that we want to take but if we are forced to we will. </PARA>
<PARA> We are gaining more and more support as we explain to our customers what is happening, and our efforts are increasing in intensity and the general community is where the support is coming from. The action against the pharmacist that the government is engaging in, is so blatantly wrong, that we are more than confident that the government will have to reconsider. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I bring to the attention of the Senate a serious problem which I believe does little to enhance the standing and reputation of this chamber in the eyes of the community. I have become increasingly concerned over the past months at the use, or perhaps more appropriately the misuse, that some honourable senators are making of parliamentary privilege. Two recent issues are particularly of concern to me. Neither of them affects me directly, and while they concern members of the National Party of Australia, I do not believe that either issue has much political application to me.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The first is the constant practice of Ministers such as Senator Walsh of attacking the families of honourable senators, and I refer particularly to Senator Lady Bjelke-Petersen. I think she, probably more than any other honourable senator in this place, has been forced to listen to more abuse and personal invasion of her private family life than any other honourable senator, certainly more than any in this current Parliament. She has tried on many occasions to put the record straight on various allegations made as a cheap shot. Most people are not interested to learn the truth, they just want the gossip. One of the most frequently raised issues is that of Senator Bjelke-Petersen's son and his property the Ten Mile. If half of what Senator Walsh has to say were true, one would believe the property has four-lane highways through its entirety and the equivalent of Sydney Harbour dammed at the back door of the house for personal use. </PARA>
<PARA> On that subject I recently received a statutory declaration from a Queensland citizen, equally incensed as Senator Bjelke-Petersen at the constant false allegations surrounding the property. The person was particularly enraged about the allegations that an anabranch of the Mackenzie River had been diverted into irrigation channels for the Ten Mile at public expense and that a specially sealed road provided exclusive access for the Petersen family to the Ten Mile property. Accompanying the statutory declaration were photos that showed the natural water course of the Mackenzie River and its relation to the Ten Mile and also the unsealed road which, admittedly, provided an entry to the Ten Mile but also to other properties. The statutory declaration states that the weir, mentioned as being especially made for the Petersens, is in fact 30 miles from the property. The photographs show clearly that the roads are dirt, and much like any in Queensland and everywhere else. They are indeed similar to those around the area where I live in northern New South Wales. </PARA>
<PARA> The other issue, or misuse, of parliamentary privilege to denigrate people is the antics of some Australian Democrat senators in this place. I can understand their need for publicity, but when it is publicity at the expense of someone else's reputation, I think that is unfair and wrong. I have had some experiences with Senator Irina Dunn, the Independent senator in this place, not being quite accurate in reporting the truth on some occasions. On this occasion it involved the Port Macquarie area. Obviously she was trying to increase her vote and profile on the north coast, as well as on the south coast, by making claims about bribery and corruption in the Hastings municipal council. She achieved her objective in getting some headlines, but she has yet to match the allegations with fact. She suggested that the Hastings shire councillors were all National Party members. In fact, only one member of the council is a member of the National Party. For all I know and care, the others could be members of the Australian Labor Party, the Liberal Party of Australia, or the Australian Democrats. Their political persuasion is not really her business, nor is it my business. A little fact mixed with a great deal of innuendo and slur is great for headlines, but is not really fair on those unable to respond with the equal protection that this place provides. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Dunn has made allegations about unfair pressures being placed on environment groups, and objected to criticism of one local group which had received legal aid to fight the council on an issue. Criticism was made of that group receiving legal aid because the group's large membership consisted of fairly affluent landholders, and if the council lost the legal battle with them the ratepayers would have been forced to pay the legal cost. That was again a case of telling a bit of truth with a lot of innuendo. She attempted to paint a picture of a National Party totally opposed to conservation issues, which intended to develop at all costs. </PARA>
<PARA> The National Party has often had to bear that criticism, and I accept her right to make these allegations, but let us not always have slurs and innuendoe being regarded as anywhere near fact. But when she also attacks civil servants such as local councillors and other community organisers without any shred of proof and makes allegations which cause embarrassment for them and their local communities, I think the honourable senator brings discredit to this place. I say to Senator Dunn: by all means attack other senators and their parties if you must, but do not be such a coward as to hide behind parliamentary privilege to make allegations that would not stand up to scrutiny outside these walls. I have not made a practice of slinging mud in this place, and I do not intend to start now, but when both these incidents were brought to my attention by angry private citizens I felt ashamed for the traditions of this chamber. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 25 November last year I spoke in the adjournment debate and that day presented to the Senate a petition praying that the Senate request the Australian Government to use its diplomatic influence to cease the oppression of Albanians in Yugoslavia and to bring peace to that nation. In my speech on the adjournment on that night I spoke about the role of the Albanians in the province of Yugoslavia known as Kosovo. Ninety per cent of the population of Kosovo is made up by Albanians. It is an underdeveloped province but has been inhabited by ethnic Albanians for centuries. Indeed, as I understand it, their presence predates the arrival of the Serbs in that area in 1389.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Since I spoke on this matter in the Senate last year much more bloodshed has taken place in the very troubled province of Kosovo. It has been under martial law since earlier this year. Twenty-two Albanians have died in demonstrations when, according to reports, police have fired directly at demonstrators and tanks have been used to crush the demonstrations. Members of the regional assembly in Kosovo were forced to amend their constitution with `tanks at the doors of the Parliament' while voting, according to reports. </PARA>
<PARA> This week the trial commences of a former Albanian Communist Party chief of Kosovo province, Azem Vllasi. He is facing a possible death sentence for allegedly leading ethnic Albanian unrest. As I understand it, the problem concerning Kosovo is that, in the view of the 90 per cent of the population which is Albanian, the Serbian authorities are attempting to impose a rule of law which is taking away the rights of the ethnic Albanians in Kosovo and causing great oppression, hardship and, as I have said, bloodshed. </PARA>
<PARA> As I have said, I outlined some of these matters in my address in the adjournment debate in the Senate on 25 November 1988. Azem Vllasi is accompanied by 13 other members of the Kosovo Parliament in the trial which commences this week. Vllasi is the most senior Party official to go before the courts in Yugoslavia since the trial of Milovan Djilas, the late President Tito's designated successor, who fell into disgrace in 1954 after advocating greater democracy. Vllasi and his 13 codefendants will be tried in the northern part of Kosovo, where a state of emergency is in force after a wave of demonstrations, strikes and violence which, as I say, began last year and which has resulted in martial law being imposed since earlier this year. </PARA>
<PARA> Amnesty International, in its latest newsletter, Newsletter No. 10 of October 1989, says that Vllasi and 55 others are to be tried on charges which could result in up to 15 years imprisonment or, in some cases, the death penalty. The newsletter also describes the imprisonment of four secondary school students who had protested against the closure of classes being held in the Albanian language. Those secondary school children were sentenced to between four and six years imprisonment on charges of `association for the purpose of hostile activity' and `counter-revolutionary undermining of the social order'. Amnesty International has accepted those four students as prisoners of conscience. </PARA>
<PARA> Tomorrow in the Senate I will table a petition which, to paraphrase it, calls on the Australian Parliament, in cooperation with other Western democracies and international human rights groups, to create an international committee which will urgently visit the Albanian political prisoners in Yugoslavia and evaluate their physical, psychological and medical state and conditions in which they live in prisons. Secondly, it asks the Australian Parliament and the Government to request from the Yugoslavian and Serbian governments that all military and special police units be withdrawn from Kosovo and that the persecution and killing of Albanians in Yugoslavia be stopped immediately. Thirdly, it asks the Australian Parliament and the Government to request from the Serbian Government the release of all political prisoners and declare their imprisonment illegal and unconstitutional. </PARA>
<PARA> Fourthly, the Australian Parliament and the Australian Government are asked to request the Yugoslavian and Serbian governments to bring to an end the trial of Azem Vllasi and the other members of the Parliament of Kosovo who opposed the changes to the 1974 Constitution. It is the changes to the 1984 Constitution about which concerns have increasingly been raised in recent years in Kosovo. Finally, the petition will request that the Australian Government raise the question of Kosovo through the Australian United Nations representation and that we request a popular referendum under the auspices of the United Nations to be held in the province of Kosovo to determine its future status. </PARA>
<PARA> I have been asked by the Australian Albanian community to present to the Senate a memorandum which deals with the historical situation and the current situation in Kosovo as seen by the Albanian community. It concludes by calling on the Australian Parliament to do the things that I have mentioned will be the subject of the petition tomorrow. I seek leave to have incorporated in Hansard the memorandum that has been presented to me for presentation to the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA>HISTORY DOES REPEAT ITSELF</PARA>
<PARA> In the 1930's hundreds of thousands of innocent Jews were being herded into concentration camps by the Nazis, in preparation for the ``final solution.'' World leaders at the time chose to ignore this and stood by idly. </PARA>
<PARA> Today, fifty years since, history is repeating itself before our very eyes, again in Europe. Only this time, the victims are not the Jews but the Albanians in Yugoslavia. And the question WHY (?) begs an answer. </PARA>
<PARA> The New York Times (17/04/1983) wrote ``. . . there are many ways to kill a nation and all have been tried on Cambodia . . .''. The same applies to other nations, in particular to the Albanians who in addition to many natural disasters of famine and plague, have suffered numerous invasions and wholesale slaughters, particularly because of the expansionist paranoia of the genocidal greater-Serb chauvinists in their hegemonist quest. </PARA>
<PARA> Once again a tragic chapter in the history of the Albanian people in Yugoslavia has been written by a Government with ``. . . medieval dreams of Sebia Uber Alles . . .'' says Eric Margolis of the ``Toronto Sun'' (29/9/1988), where: ``. . . manipulation and threats were used to secure the agreement of Kosova's Regional Assembly to changes to the 1974 Yugoslav (Serbian) Constitution . . .'' (European Parliament Notes 12/04/1989, pp132-656/1.) and where members of the Regional Assembly were forced to amend the Constitution by: ``. . . voting with tanks at the doors of Parliament . . .'' wrote the French news-paper ``Le Monde'' (3/4/1989). ZERI I POPULLIT</PARA>
<PARA>During 1988 the ``Black Hand'' chieftain, Slobadan Milosevic and his ``Communist Party'' of Serbia in collaboration with the Serbian Orthodox Church and the Serbian ``Socialist Alliance'', organised numerous anti-Albanian rallies where satanic calls such as ``Death to Albanians . . .'' could be heard (Zagreb weekly ``Danas'' 10/09/1988). These calls of ``death to Albanians'', which were heard yesterday, are being put into practice to-day. </PARA>
<PARA>During these anti-Albanian rallies, in addition to calls for the death of all Albanians, calls for the death of particular people were made as well. The frenzied crowds chanted particularly often ``Death to Vllasi . . .'' (Danas 10/09/1988). To-day, Azem Vllasi and 14 other Members of the Kosova Parliament are behind bars, despite the guarantee of immunity from prosecution given to all political figures by the 1974 Constitution. </PARA>
<PARA>The same Constitution has been used to accord protection to Slobodan Milosevic (Serb), and at the same time to arrest, jail and have Azem Vllasi ``. . . charged with counter-revolution which charge carries the death penalty . . .'' (Melb. Herald 03/03/1989). </PARA>
<PARA>It is right that a people can demonstrate without fear from the police or the army in expressing legitimate concerns and making legitimate demands. And although Serbs were allowed to demonstrate throughout 1988, demanding death and slaughter of a people, when the Albanians of Kosova demonstrated to try to protect some minor rights guaranteed by the Constitution of 1974, they were crushed with tanks and untold police brutality, they were shot at ``. . . from helicopter gun-ships . . .'' wrote the Swedish reporter Anne Marie Bostrom (Hrvatski vjesnik 28/04/1989). </PARA>
<PARA>History records many instances of massacres of Albanians by greater-Serb chauvinists: ``They have massacred the Albanians in order to correct the ethnographic statistics of the population . . .'' (Kievskaya Mysl, No. 181, 03/07/1913). Nothing has changed since, the Albanians have been continuously faced with genocide the intensity of which has been steadily increasing and taking new forms. A western diplomat refusing to be named reported ``. . . Albanians in Kosova are forced to assimilate and are faced with genocide. . . . Train loads of seventy-per-cent-flour and thirty-per-cent-ground-glass mix were shipped to Kosova for human consumption, tons of sugar mixed with rat poison were shipped to Kosova . . .''. These crimes against Albanians are crimes against humanity. </PARA>
<PARA>In addition to extermination tactics, Albanians are subjected to forced emigration. ``In the last 15 years alone, 250,000 Yugoslav citizens of Albanian nationality have in one way or another been forced out of the country.'' (Danas 23/05/1989). The frequency of arrests has surpassed anything one could imagine. ``Nedjeljna Dalmacija'' (17/09/1989) writes ``From 1981 to 1988, 584,000 Albanians have been arrested and processed by the police, of those 71,000 have been sentenced to terms of up to 20 years in jail. The same publication reports on the concentration camps created to hold Albanians living in Yugoslavia: ``. . . hundreds of Albanian individuals and families have been interned and put into isolation . . .''. </PARA>
<PARA>Schools and universities are also victim of the great-Serb chauvinists. The number of Albanian students in all educational institutions from the lowest to the highest ones has been halved and many teaching staff have been imprisoned. ``Slobodna Dalmacija'' ( /05/1989) writes: ``. . . 215 Albanian intellectuals have been arrested''. A number of them have been kidnapped by the Belgrade authorities, again ``Slobodna Dalmacija ( /05/1989) writes: ``. . . 65 of them were taken by bus to an unknown destination''. </PARA>
<PARA>According to historians and old and more recent archaeological findings, Illyrian, ie Albanian, was spoken in the lands of Dardania (Kosova) at least since 2000 years before Christ. Despite such long history of Albanian settlement in these lands ``. . . it is often heard said that they (Albanians) are immigrants, or they are made to admit that they live in a foreign land'' (Prof. Bogdan Denic in ``Danas'' 20/06/1989). Prof. Denic continues in the same article: ``They (Albanians) do not live in a foreign land, they were born here, their ancestors have lived here, so what do we want from them?''</PARA>
<PARA>Today, Kosova has been turned into a concentration camp where the genocidal greater-Serbs have turned all their venom at the peace-loving Albanian people. Using the might of military and special police units trained for the purpose of ``purification of peoples'' along racial lines. They want to suffocate Kosova and eliminate the Albanian people with sadistic torture and killings. The interview given to ``Nedjeljna Dalmacija'' (08/09/1989 p. 4) by Luise Christian and Antoine Garapon, is telling of the situation to-day, or even more so that the statement of the Slovenian Party chief Milan Kucan that ``. . . Milosevic's secret police are harsher in Kosova than Hitler's Gestapo were with the Jews.''</PARA>
<PARA>Under threats of physical violence by the New Butcher of Kosovo, the Yugoslav Presidium has allowed the transport of heavy war armaments and equipment to Kosovo. The same Slobodan Milosevic has been compared to ``Josef Goebbels'' by ``The Australian'' (26.9.1988) and to ``Mussolini or Hitler'' by the Melbourne Age (15.10.1988). </PARA>
<PARA> The whole anti-Albanian campaign has the backing of Serbian academics like Vasa Cubrilovic, who wrote ``The Expulsion of Albanians'' as his thesis for his academic title, he was elected to the Serbian Academy of Science and Arts on the basis of the same work. The same Vasa Cubrilovic later was proposed as an honorary member of the Soviet Academy and received the Order of Lenin. </PARA>
<PARA> Josef Goebbels used to say: ``every person is a Jew unless proven otherwise''. The greater-Serb Milosevic and his cohorts say: ``a good Albanian is a dead Albanian''. They also try to realise as often as they can their philosophy, by massacring thousands of Albanians, as young as twelve years of age. According to the Slovene newspaper ``Mladina'', whose correspondents succeeded in entering the Morgue in Prishtina, and counting the dead. There were ``. . . 180 bodies between the ages of 12 and 25 years of age'' as reported in ``Zeri i Popullit'' (13.4.1989). </PARA>
<PARA> Swedish journalist Anne Marie Bostrom reported even more terrible persecution of Albanians. Describing the Albanian demonstrations in Prishtina she wrote: ``. . . shooting took place from helicopter-gunships . . .'', further she says: `263 demonstrators were killed'' and ``demonstrators were sprayed with scalding water from helicopters''. She then describes how ``children as young as six years were taken away by police and soldiers and placed into prison camps surrounded with barbed-wire''. (Hrvatski vjesnik'' (28.4.1989). These figures are only quoted for the provincial capital of Prishtina on the occasions of the April demonstrations. The figures for the whole of Kosovo over the last two years are much higher. However the real size of this tragedy will remain hidden for some time. </PARA>
<PARA> During his lecture at Melbourne University on 4.10.1989, a visiting Croatian intellectual was asked by a member of the audience: ``As a Christian I feel ashamed of the way the Serbian Orthodox Church has sided with the Communist Government to condone and encourage the massacres of Albanians.'' He replied that over the centuries the Serbian Orthodox church has been transformed to become one of the units of the whole of the Serbian nationalist apparatus. The chauvinist ideology has achieved the creation of a quite unique strain of ``orthodoxy'' in the Serbian Church which has succeeded in brainwashing the masses and suppressing any progressive thought, be it religious or humanitarian. In addition to that, today, any person belonging to the orthodox faith in Yugoslavia, must be identified with the Serbian Orthodox Church, therefore be a Serb, notwithstanding his nationality, language or cultural heritage. </PARA>
<PARA>During another lecture at Melbourne University, this one by Vojislav Seselj, a greater-Serbian and chetnik, he claimed that: ``Kosovo and most lands of present day Yugoslavia, parts of Romania, Bulgaria and Albania (proper) are and shall remain Serbian lands, except that some are still to be reclaimed and they must all be cleaned up of non-Serbs (see the map Seselj produced at his lecture). According to Seselj and his ilk: today Kosovo, tomorrow the Holy See!</PARA>
<PARA>We plead with the Australian Parliament to do its utmost to help save the Albanians of Kosova from Genocide. </PARA>
<PARA>We suggest that the Australian Parliament forms a Committee and in co-operation with other Western democracies and international human rights organisations creates an international committee which will urgently visit the Albanian political prisoners in Yugoslavia and evaluate their physical, psychological and medical state and conditions in which they live in prison. </PARA>
<PARA>Also, that the Australian Parliament and Government request the Yugoslav and Serbian Governments to withdraw all military and special police units from Kosova and to stop immediately the persecution and killing of Albanians in Yugoslavia. </PARA>
<PARA>Further, that the Australian Parliament and the Government request the Serbian Government to release all political prisoners and declare their imprisonment illegal and unconstitutional. Especially to request an immediate withdrawal of all charges against Adem Vllasi and 14 other members of parliament of Kosovo who opposed the changes to the 1974 Constitution. </PARA>
<PARA>Finally, we plead with the Australian Parliament and Government to raise the question of Kosova through the Australian representatives at the United Nations and to request a popular referendum under the auspices of the UN to be held in that province to determine its future status. </PARA>
<PARA>We seek assistance in the name of those in Kosova who have no right to speak for themselves, who do not have the right to live in the land of their forebears. We seek assistance in the name of humanity. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the Senate and particularly the Minister for Justice (Senator Tate), who is at the table. Here in Australia it is of the gravest importance that we do all that we can to prevent the development of the practice of ethnic groups of whatever nationality bringing to Australia and having played out here the problems of the countries from which they have come. Equally, I think that we have a responsibility as Australians and as a nation to do what we can to support the peaceful resolution of difficulties that occur in other countries without imposing into the internal politics of other countries.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Albanian community in Australia feels very strongly about this matter. It is a matter that concerns them greatly. Therefore, for that reason, I bring this matter to the Senate in the hope that in the forums of the world in which Australia has a voice to be heard-and, I believe, a voice which is well respected in the various councils of the world-we will do what we can in our right and proper role to help bring solutions or help bring a voice of reason to the problems that face ethnic minorities in different countries. In particular, the problems of Kosovo are attracting increasing world attention, the attention of Amnesty International and other national groups concerned with human rights. It is a very important issue. I hope that the petition that will be read to the Senate tomorrow will be looked at by the Government with a view to a sympathetic and positive response to the very concerned requests of the Albanian community in Australia. </PARA>

<PARA> The Australian Customs Service is unable to answer parts (2), (3) and (4) of the question, as it is not responsible for undertaking further investigations or the arrest and prosecution of offenders. Almost invariably drugs seized are handed over to the Australian Federal Police who then perform those tasks in accordance with the agreement between the two agencies.</PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Federal Police advised the ACS that it is unable at this time to provide the details requested in respect of Customs seizures separately from its general statistics. However, in the current financial year, the ACS is attempting to compile arrest and prosecution results by following up all seizures individually with the AFP.</PARA>
