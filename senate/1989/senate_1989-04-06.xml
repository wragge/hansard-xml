<PARA>To the Honourable the President of the Senate and members of the Senate in Parliament assembled:</PARA>
<PARA> The petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth, that:</PARA>
<PARA> We are concerned about the increase in violent television programmes for children and particularly those programmes promoting violent toys that are available for sale in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA> Your petitioners therefore humbly pray;</PARA>
<PARA> That you support the Broadcasting (Prohibition of Violent Programmes for Children) Act 1988 which has been presented by WA Independent Senator for Nuclear Disarmament, Jo Vallentine. This act aims to prohibit the broadcasting of children's TV programmes that are violent and that promote toys modelled on characters, weapons or other war accessories which are also available for sale in Australia.</PARA>

<TITLE>X-rated and Violent Video Material</TITLE>
<PARA>To the Honourable the President and members of the Senate in Parliament assembled.</PARA>
<PARA> The humble petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth that:</PARA>
<PARA> The Parliamentary Joint Select Committee on Video Material has concluded that ``Adverse effects upon people, and especially upon children, of exposure to material containing various degrees of violence, pornography or obscenity have been demonstrated''.</PARA>
<PARA> The majority of the Select Committee strongly opposed the proposition for a new NVE (non-violent erotica) category, which would have entrenched X-rated video pornography.</PARA>
<PARA> All six State Governments have, through their Attorney-General, expressed unanimous opposition to the circulation of X-rated videos.</PARA>
<PARA> We consider the continuing distribution of X-rated videos from the A.C.T. to be reprehensible and to be contrary to the wellbeing of the Australian community in general.</PARA>
<PARA> We strongly request urgent Government action to prohibit the distribution of X-rated and excessively violent video material.</PARA>

<TITLE>Home Ownership</TITLE>
<PARA>To the Honourable the President and members of the Senate in Parliament assembled. The petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth that:-</PARA>
<PARA> Recent huge rises in mortgage interest rates have pushed the cost of buying their own home beyond the reach of most Australian families.</PARA>
<PARA> Those Australians already paying off home mortgages are now suffering severely and unfairly through increased mortgage payments or longer repayment times so that many will never pay off their mortgage and go further and further into debt unless interest rates fall substantially.</PARA>
<PARA> Now, therefore, your petitioners request that the Senate in Parliament assembled require the Hawke-Keating government to cease its excessive reliance on high interest rates as its major economic policy weapon and instead to use other measures which would allow interest rates to return to levels that do not force most Australian home-seekers out of the housing market-and many Australians out of their homes-so that the traditional right of home ownership is returned to average Australian families.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yesterday, at the conclusion of Question Time, the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Senator Gareth Evans, came into this chamber and provided a supplementary answer to a question that I had asked without notice on the day before with regard to a meeting in Darwin between the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) and members of the Fretilin rebel movement. It was claimed that I had asserted that the Prime Minister, by participating in that function in Darwin, had snubbed Indonesia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Yesterday Senator Evans said that he believed that I was implying that there was some sort of shadowy gathering of insurgents in Australia's far north. This is a misrepresentation of the facts. The function on Saturday night in Darwin was held at the club rooms, as Senator Evans quite correctly said in his answer, of the Lafaek Club in Darwin. This is a Timorese organisation whose membership is broadly based but which also includes members of Fretilin. Senator Evans also said that the invitations had been quite widely extended, both by Senator Collins and by Mr Snowdon, MHR--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Evans claimed that I had attempted to imply that this was a meeting only of Fretilin and the Prime Minister. Senator Evans listed a number of other organisations invited to the function. Last night I checked with those organisations and ascertained that whilst some of them did receive an invitation from Mr Snowdon, none of those that I contacted attended. The important point that I wish to make is that Mr Snowdon at no time mentioned the Fretilin function in his newspaper column of 26 March.</PARA></TALK.START>

I did not intervene earlier, even when you did, Mr President, because I could see that Senator Tambling was explaining how he was personally misrepresented and that he was laying some general groundwork. But for him to start a series on Mr Snowdon definitely is getting away from a personal explanation. I do not recall Senator Evans mentioning Mr Snowdon yesterday. Senator Tambling is entitled to show where he has been misrepresented. He has adduced some evidence-he thinks, at least-for that. That is fine; but he is now going, as most people do in personal explanations, into a new area.</PARA></TALK.START>

He is entitled to explain where he has been misrepresented and why that misrepresentation is not correct. I believe that Senator Tambling is in the process of explaining how Senator Evans misled the Senate in relation to his answer yesterday over the matter that Senator Tambling had questioned him about, and how Mr Snowdon has also in some way or other misrepresented him.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr President, I was in no way taking issue with your ruling on this matter; rather, I was taking issue with the interjections and points raised by those opposite. Senator Evans, of course, sought to broaden, in the supplementary answer that he gave yesterday, the question that I had raised the day before. The issue that I wanted to restate very clearly was that I had ascertained, and had quite rightly said, that the Prime Minister had met with members of the Fretilin movement. In fact, that was correct. At the function hosted by the Labor Party, for which proceeds did go to the Lafaek Club, a submission was made very directly in the form of a letter to the Prime Minister. That was outlined in further detail on a radio program yesterday in Darwin by a Fretilin representative.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The point that I stress at this time is that the Prime Minister did meet with members of the Fretilin organisation. He did receive submissions. It is very interesting to note that, despite Senator Evans's point that the function on Saturday night in Darwin, was jointly hosted by Mr Snowdon and Senator Collins, Senator Collins had the very good sense to stay at home because of family priorities rather than attend. </PARA>

<PARA> That this Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>I seek leave to have the second reading speech incorporated in Hansard. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The speech read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA> The purpose of the Bill is to authorise the Treasurer, on behalf of the Commonwealth, to guarantee the repayment of loans and interest on funds raised by Qantas to purchase three Boeing 747-400 aircraft and associated spare parts and equipment. </PARA>
<PARA> The Boeing 747-400 is a new series aircraft offering improved operating efficiency and engine technology. A new technology cockpit enables the aircraft potentially to be crewed by two people, and its strategic value lies in the flexibility and competitive advantage inherent in its extra long-range capability. </PARA>
<PARA> Qantas needs the flexibility that these aircraft will provide in order to meet the requirements of the rapidly growing inbound tourist market. Inbound tourism, as measured by Short-term Visitor Arrivals, reached almost 2.2 million in the year ending October 1988, an increase of almost 28 per cent over the previous 12 month period. The Bureau of Tourism Research estimates that overseas tourists visiting Australia will reach two and a half million in 1990. </PARA>
<PARA> Other carriers serving Australia will also introduce B747-400s in 1989, and Qantas is likely to lose a significant share of the inbound tourism market if it is not able to operate similar aircraft. </PARA>
<PARA> Qantas will use the aircraft primarily to provide services between Australia's East Coast and London via Singapore (the Kangaroo Route), as well as additional Sydney/Los Angeles services, two of Australia's major markets. Deliveries of the aircraft are currently scheduled to commence in July. </PARA>
<PARA> The three aircraft that the Bill deals with are only the first of twenty that the company plans to acquire over the five years to 1992/93. In view of the magnitude of this program, Qantas's current capital structure is currently being examined by the Government, with the aim of ensuring its adequacy to underpin such a program. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill limits the guarantee of borrowings by Qantas for the three aircraft to $US385m, or its equivalent in foreign currencies, which represent 85 per cent of the total project cost for the three aircraft. The guarantee does not involve the Government in any cash outlay, but does create a contingent liability for the Commonwealth. </PARA>
<PARA> While the Board of Qantas has yet to evaluate all the options, Qantas has advised that it wishes to enter again into so-called Japanese `cross-border' leases, to reduce the financing costs of these aircraft. Such arrangements, which were the subject of criticism by the Opposition during the debate on the Qantas loan guarantee legislation last year, allow Qantas to finance new aircraft at a significantly cheaper rate than would otherwise be available. </PARA>
<PARA> Such arrangements are common-place within the aviation industry, and I am advised that the National Tax Administration of Japan has published very tight regulatory guidelines, with which all leases of aircraft to foreign airlines must comply. </PARA>
<PARA> As regards the Australian tax position, I made it clear during the last debate that the Tax Office ruling, which Opposition members were concerned about, did not apply to this type of arrangements, which are tax neutral from the Australian Government's point of view. </PARA>
<PARA> Similarly, confirmation was obtained from the Government that its proposed legislation to overcome `double-dipping' schemes, was to be directed at schemes that operated to the detriment of the Australian revenue . As I have stated before, the Qantas arrangements are not of this nature. </PARA>
<PARA> I also indicated in the debate on the previous Qantas loan guarantee legislation that the appropriateness of guarantees for future Qantas aircraft is currently under review as part of the process of implementing the May 1988 reform package for Qantas. </PARA>
<PARA> I commend this Bill to the Senate and I present the explanatory memorandum to this Bill. </PARA>

<PARA> That this Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>I seek leave to have the second reading speech incorporated in Hansard. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The speech read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA> This Bill proposes amendments to the Customs Tariff (Coal Export Duty) Act 1975 to continue an existing exemption from export duty in respect of certain coal, where that exempt coal is blended with other coal. </PARA>
<PARA> By way of background, the Act was introduced in 1975 to impose a revenue duty to channel to the community a proportion of the windfall profits then being made by coal export producers. Since then, our coal exporters have experienced intense com- petition on the international scene for their coal markets, and the Act has been amended on several occasions to introduce exemptions to the Customs duty, in order to maintain a competitive edge for our coal exports. </PARA>
<PARA> At present, the only coal which remains dutiable under the Act is high quality coking coal mined from depths no greater than 60 metres in open-cut mines in production before 1 July 1980-but even here there are exemptions to the export duty; in practice, duty is currently paid on production from six mines in Queensland. </PARA>
<PARA> Against this background, in 1983 the Government received representation from CSR and Theiss Dampier Mitsui for relief from the export duty on production from the Moura and South Blackwater mines located in the Bowen Basin in Queensland. Both mines must blend significant quantities of higher quality coal from their underground operations with coal from their underground operations with coal from their open-cuts in order to obtain a product of a quality suitable to meet export contract specifications. The addition of higher cost underground product to their open-cut coal increased costs to the point where the imposition of the export duty on the open-cut coal in the exported product was having a significant impact on the rate of return to the producers. </PARA>
<PARA> In order to assist the viability of these operations, the Government decided to exempt from duty open-cut production provided it contained a minimum 15 per cent underground coal, and was all produced from the same mine. This was effected by amendments to the Act in 1984. The 1984 amendments however were framed in such a way that Moura and South Blackwater coal blends would be exempt from coal export duty if exported as single blends, but would lose the exemption if they were further blended with coal from other mines before export. It now transpires that such further blending is indeed commercially advantageous and commercially possible, following recent corporate restructuring in the affected mines. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government is therefore proposing in clause 3 of the Bill that exempt coal from the mines mentioned will not lose its exempt status by reason of being blended with other coal. </PARA>
<PARA> This decision reflects the Government's commitment to the maintenance of underground operations in the Bowen Basin, in order to retain skills which will ultimately be of benefit to the industry as a whole in that region. It also demonstrates the Government's concern to assist employment security in the industry in the present difficult international marketing environment. </PARA>
<PARA>Financial Impact Statement</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> This measure has no direct financial implications, as its sole purpose is to maintain an existing exemption from liability to pay customs duty. There will be no overall coal export duty revenue loss as a result of the proposed change. I commend the Bill to the Senate and present the explanatory memorandum to the Bill. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Senate now turns to debating cognately three Customs Bills: the Customs and Excise Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1987, the Customs and Excise Legislation Amendment Bill 1988 and the Customs Tariff Amendment Bill (No. 3) 1988. The last of those Bills is in effect a formal Bill which deals with many tariff amendments and extends to 488 pages; but in effect, it is a formality and I shall be dealing with it only briefly. Nevertheless, the Government is including that Bill in a cognate debate with the other two Bills, which are of major importance to those people who are involved in the import and export trades of this nation. The Government alleges that it is very keen to assist such people-but it is introducing procedures which are quite draconian.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Over 15 months ago, in December 1987, this Government, including the Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce (Senator Button), tried to push through this Parliament the Customs and Excise Legislation Amendment Bill 1987, which totally changed the Customs system of Australia. The coalition parties objected to the Bill being rushed through the Parliament. Industry had not had time to consider these drastic changes to the scheme, and the Parliament had had little time in which to consult industry and little time to give the consideration that these Bills needed. At the time, Senator Button attacked the Opposition. He claimed that we did not understand the issues. He argued strongly against any deferral of the debate. On 15 December 1987, I moved to defer debate on the Bill. The purpose that I put in my motion was: `to allow Customs agents and the industry time to make appropriate representations in relation to the Bill'. I said that it was disgraceful that the Government should wish to deal cognately or in haste with the complex issues involved in the Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> At the time, the Government, as I said, complained bitterly about the deferral and, in effect, claimed that it was vital to the whole Customs system and the collection of revenue that the Bill be passed so that the new system could come into operation on 1 January 1988. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Button said:</PARA>
<PARA> Any deferral of this Bill for a further three or four months, especially since the Bill includes consequential enforcement and penalty provisions to complement the reforms contained in it, could result in quite considerable Customs duty shortfall. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Button also said:</PARA>
<PARA> The current legislation, of course, deals with penalties which are a necessary corollary to taking steps to close loopholes in the legislation . . . The figure estimated for fraud in respect of Customs valuation is about $146m. The Opposition is up to its old tricks again-if the taxman cometh, let us put every obstruction in his way to stop him collecting government revenue if we can find some reason for doing so. </PARA>
<PARA>That was back in December 1987. Thanks to the support of the Australian Democrats, the Bill was deferred so that industry could consider it and make its representations. Fifteen months later, not three or four months later, Senator Button brings the legislation back into the chamber. It is clear that Senator Button misled the Senate, the Hawke Government has been grossly negligent in not bringing the Bill back in earlier or there is no purpose in the Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> If Senator Button was correct in his statement that deferral of this Bill for even three or four months could result in quite considerable customs duty shortfall, the Government has been grossly negligent in not proceeding with this legislation for another 12 to 14 months. Alternatively, there has not been a quite considerable customs shortfall, in which case Senator Button's statement was misleading and there is no requirement for this legislation. Can Senator Button explain, in the light of his own statements, why without any obstruction from the Opposition parties he and the Government have seen fit to wait nearly 16 months to reintroduce the legislation? Either Senator Button misled the Senate or he and the Government have been grossly negligent in their failure to close what they claim are loopholes with legislation which it was absolutely essential to put in place in order `to crack down on fraud and avoidance practices in the valuation of imported goods'. Where was `the Government's firm resolve to stamp out valuation avoidance practice'?</PARA>
<PARA> The Senate may recall that Senator Button, who was not present during most of the 1987 debate on this Bill and subsequently entered the chamber and petulantly made a totally unwarranted personal attack on me in which he accused me of not understanding the issues, implied that I must decide whether I support people making fraudulent and false declarations as to the value of goods. He alleged that specious grounds were advanced for deferring the legislation until February of last year. The reason for that personal attack on me was Senator Button's well known propensity for personal attacks on people whenever he is under pressure. When in difficulty Senator Button plays the man, not the ball. He was in difficulty because I had demonstrated that the Bill was badly flawed and the Customs community was genuinely concerned about it. Senator Button made that attack well knowing that both customs associations had expressed concerns about the Bill, that importers, retailers and major manufacturers were making representations about it and that the Law Council of Australia believed that it was `most desirable that consideration of this Bill by the Senate should be deferred until the autumn session of the Parliament'. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill now re-emerges almost 16 months later with 45 amendments although, as I shall demonstrate, it remains flawed and once again is to be debated cognately with other Bills-a 1988 Customs and Excise Legislation Amendment Bill and a Customs Tariff Amendment Bill of 488 pages. I question whether either the 1987 or the 1988 customs and excise legislation amendment Bills are necessary. Under the Customs Act the Comptroller-General has far-reaching powers and has not hesitated to exercise them. In 1986-87 goods to a total value of $16m were seized and about $9m was recovered in fines, reparations and additional duty demands. The 1987-88 annual report of the Australian Customs Service indicates that $40.9m was received in additional revenue as a result of quality control checks or intense auditing procedures. The same annual report reveals that the main purpose of this Bill is `to support the entry audit system', which is part of the import control program for ensuring clearance through Customs of commercial imports, taking account of revenue collection and control requirements. Yet the 1987-88 annual report suggests that the entry audit system is operating quite satisfactorily despite the absence of the Bill, which it was originally argued was essential to take effect on 1 January last year. </PARA>
<PARA> The 1987 Bill proposed a series of amendments to the principal Customs Act, which would introduce an administrative penalty regime similar to that imposed by the tax Acts. The Government now proposes to amend that Bill so that the administrative penalty regime and the offences provided for the making of a false and misleading statement are transferred to the Customs and Excise Legislation Amendment Bill 1988, and clause 16 of the Bill relating to the proposed extension to three years, for the recovery of short paid duty, is deleted. Both these moves are sensible, but unfortunately they seem to be the only sensible alterations made. The 1987 Bill will now proceed with two substantive elements only: firstly, the redraft of division 2 of part VIII of the Customs Act relating to the valuation of imported goods; and, secondly, the audit and verification of information powers and the complementary provision relating to the requirement to keep documents. </PARA>
<PARA> The Senate may recollect that on 26 November 1987 the Government announced that the Law Reform Commission would inquire into the Customs Act, the Excise Act and 11 related Acts and report to the Government by 30 September 1989. The Law Reform Commission was specifically excluded from examining this draft legislation, as the Attorney-General (Mr Lionel Bowen) specified that the review by the Commission was not to impede the progress of legislation in any way. Accordingly, the Commission is waiting for the legislation to be passed by the Parliament before examining it. So the Law Reform Commission has been waiting for over 16 months to consider the massive problems in this area which the Attorney-General has acknowledged as, and I use his words, `complex and labyrinthine'. Given the complexity of this legislative package and the concerns of Customs, it would not have been difficult for the Government to have amended the reference to embrace this proposed legislation during the 16 months. </PARA>
<PARA> The time for the Law Reform Commission's review of this legislation will now be minimal. The Government may have to extend that time. This is typical of this Government. It gives lip service to consultation but consistently leaves inadequate time for proper consultation and examination. In the intervening 16 months Customs has managed to operate efficiently and without the draconian provisions now proposed in this Bill. Furthermore, the Government appears to have taken the view that by burying the Bill for 16 months and allowing the tumult to die down the objections might disappear. They have not done so, and on 3 March this year the Law Council of Australia made a 17-page submission with 13 points of remaining contention. </PARA>
<PARA> These Bills are complex and should have been subject to review by the Law Reform Commission, which has the task of attempting to simplify the Customs and associated Acts. As I mentioned, the draconian provisions in the 1987 Bill adopt the same attitude towards revenue raising provisions in the Customs Act as those that apply in the taxation Act. These provisions have been taken out of the 1987 Bill and transferred to the 1988 Bill, so that all the penalty regime and offences provisions are within that Bill, which I will deal with later. </PARA>
<PARA> Clause 12 of the 1987 Bill, which deals with the valuation of imported goods, is intended to rearrange the various provisions in division 2 of part VIII of the Customs Act into a more logical and easy to follow sequence. It highlights the various types of costs, charges and agreements relating to goods which are to be included or excluded for assessing the customs value of goods. The Government claims that clause 12 is designed to give effect to Australia's obligation under an agreement on implementation of article 7 of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT). A number of different organisations have made representatives and expressed serious misgivings about this clause. The Law Council of Australia believes that this technical and complex legislation is conducive neither to good administration nor to fairness to users of the customs systems, particularly given the new self-assessment burdens imposed on them. The legislation in that regard is in line with the Government's taxation legislation which imposes severe penalties for any mistakes in self-assessed burdens in the returns. </PARA>
<PARA> Customs agents say that this is not commercial reality in their industry because agents are under such enormous pressure to document imports in great haste when an aircraft lands or a ship berths, whereas tax agents have time to check and recheck returns and assessments. Customs agents support more modern systems to improve the assessment system but argue that the result of these amendments will be to clog the system, as they, the agents, introduce double checks for their own personal protection. Their arguments in this regard seem valid to me. </PARA>
<PARA> The valuation provisions occupy about 38 pages, in marked contrast to Canada's Customs Act, which is far shorter. The interpretations section proposed by this Bill occupies over 18 printed pages and contains 56 definitions, many of which have composite parts. The complicated definitions require cross-referencing to other sections of the legislation. There is concern about the number of definitions and the negative impact they could have on users of the system. </PARA>
<PARA> I now turn to the duty on foreign freight and insurance in new subsection 154 (1) as proposed by clause 12. The inclusion of foreign inland freight and insurance in the customs value of imported goods will have the effect of increasing the duty imposed on some or many imported goods and can also discriminate against import manufacturers on geographic grounds. For example, if a United States manufacturer is located inland and we purchase goods from that manufacturer, more duty will be imposed on those goods than if the manufacturer was located at a seaport, unless the product is actually packed in the inland factory in some sort of sea container and transported in that sea container. Is that not absolute nonsense?</PARA>
<PARA> This provision also discriminates against small business. Full container load (FCL) shippers-shippers of goods packed at the factory-gain an advantage over small shippers where goods are packed at coastal container depots to make up an FCL. We have a particular example in Australia with regard to ACI. That company transports pulp bulk soda ash from Wyoming to United States ports. Duty will now be imposed on the freight cost of that soda ash because it is not packed in a sea container. It is shipped, I presume, in open rail trucks. Because of that, duty will have to be paid on that freight cost. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is quite crazy, as Senator Boswell said. The Government has said that importers and others who consider they may suffer hardship because of the provision will be invited to put their case to the Government or the Industries Assistance Commission (IAC) with a view to reduction of the duty on their goods. Why then impose it in the first place? Industry does not consider this offer to be satisfactory due to the time element and discrimination involved.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I turn to the civil liberties implications. I previously voiced concern that this legislation gives the Australian Customs Service wide powers of entry, search and inquiry. All officers of the Customs Service will have the power to enter premises and inspect and copy documents without warrant. The Government argues that these powers are necessary to facilitate verification as part of the process of allowing quick clearance of goods. The Law Council considers these provisions may infringe Article 17 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, which provides that no person shall be subjected to arbitrary or unlawful interference with his privacy or correspondence and everyone has the right to the protection of the law against such interference. The Comptroller or a collector can make application for a search warrant by radio, telephone or other means of communication. This amendment has resulted from the Government agreeing not to include justices of the peace in the definition of `magistrate' for the purposes of issuing of warrants for the new audit powers. There are at least two Acts containing provisions allowing officials to obtain warrants be telephone-the Telecommunications (Interception) Amendment Act 1987 and the National Crimes Authority Act 1984. However, these Acts stipulate that the telephone warrant can be issued only by a judge. </PARA>
<PARA> There are also extensive discretionary powers. There are 84 discretions in the valuation provisions of the legislation. Naturally, the Law Council is gravely concerned about the nature and extent of the discretionary powers contained in the legislation. The discretions granted to the collector or his delegate are vast and require him to be satisfied as to so many matters that it is very difficult for users of the system to predict the result of the use of the discretion. But we must understand that what is proposed is a self-assessing system, and yet the collector has these vast discretionary powers. How then can importers self-assess when they do not really know how the collector will apply his discretion? Importers will be required to guess as to how the legislation will be exercised in estimating duty payable. I put to the Senate that this is commercially unsound and legally unsatisfactory. The Law Council advises that the Canadian valuation provisions do not give the collector or authorities any discretion in relation to any matter. </PARA>
<PARA> The main problems with the 1987 Bill remain. The civil liberties ramifications are simply not acceptable. The discretion given to Customs officials is too vast. The legislation is far too complex, the inland freight costs will simply increase business costs, and the Government gave the Law Reform Commission the task of reviewing and simplifying a complex and over-amended customs Bill. This amendment Bill does nothing to advance that clause and could, in fact, delay that much-needed review. Accordingly, the Opposition will be voting against the 1987 Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn now to the Customs and Excise Legislation Amendment Bill 1988. This is an omnibus Bill which was introduced late last year proposing miscellaneous amendments to the Customs Act 1901 and the Excise Act 1901. The Bill is to have added to it the administrative penalty regime from the 1987 Bill which I dealt with previously. This new Customs regime imposed in this Bill is quite different from what has been acceptable in the past. It takes the user of the system away from the protection of the courts and the Customs Service in effect becomes informant, judge and executioner. However, as sugar coating on a poisonous pill, forfeiture is to be restricted as a sanction for a false or misleading statement to cases where a guilty mind is proven or reckless indifference can be established to the satisfaction of the comptroller. This erosion of people's rights is a feature of this Government and, in particular, this Government's administration in the tax collection areas. The scheme proposed is certainly not the way that I would go. But I recognise that the Government is entitled to choose its own path and to cut its own throat. Accordingly, we will not be opposing this Bill, but we will be monitoring this new regime very carefully. </PARA>
<PARA> The coalition is, however, strongly opposed to the Government's words `or otherwise' in proposed section 243T, which provides, `that where a person knowingly, recklessly or otherwise makes a false statement or misleading statement to a customs officer' et cetera, certain penalties apply. The words `or otherwise' are a catch-all provision and offer no protection for unintentional errors. The Scrutiny of Bills Committee, in Alert Digest No. 16 of 1988, drew attention to the fact that clause 26 would insert these new clauses which would:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) give to a Collector a power normally reserved to a court, of determining whether a statement is false or misleading in a material particular, and then imposing a penalty for that falsity; and</PARA>
<PARA> (b) impose that penalty on a person, even though the latter was completely innocent of any intention to mislead. </PARA>
<PARA>I continue quoting from the Scrutiny of Bills Committee:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . this may be compared with the normal situation in the criminal law, in which a person may be convicted only if he or she has a guilty mind or guilty intent. </PARA>
<PARA>Although the penalty provisions, when you read them as a layman, appear to be quite mild, in fact agents talk in terms of penalties of tens of thousands of dollars under the `twice excess' provision. They argue that the clause gives too much discretion to the bureaucrats and that in the thousands of documents cleared on the run, particularly with air freight, genuine mistakes occur which should not expose them to the proposed penalty and time consuming appeal provisions. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government claims that it has introduced a fast track system for the clearance of goods and that there should be an incentive for importers to ensure that their documentation is accurate. But the Government's penalties for inaccuracy are such that its fast track system will slow down rapidly as agents cross t's and dot i's to ensure that they do not incur these crippling penalties. </PARA>
<PARA> An important amendment is section 243U which allows section 243T not to apply in certain cases. But to gain benefit to this exemption the information about which one is uncertain must be declared and the reason for uncertainty must be included. When there is uncertainty the goods go into limbo until there is a determination. Because of the inclusion of the words `or otherwise', the penalty for innocent error is outrageous. Customs have acknowledged the complexity of the customs tariff. I recollect being given examples of where different subcollectors have given different interpretations for the same or similar goods. Customs recognise and acknowledge that it is sometimes difficult to correctly classify the goods. Labor's solution is to transfer the onus for correct classification to the user and, whether this error is genuine or not, to penalise him if his or her interpretation is incorrect. It is all very well to say that the Australian Customs Service and the Administrative Appeals Tribunal have a discretion to remit the penalty, but the cost of going to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal is a penalty in itself and the ACS is left with enormous discretion in determining what is and what is not unintentional error. </PARA>
<PARA> Meanwhile, the importer has three alternatives: he can take the goods out of the fast track and seek a determination from Customs, thus delaying clearance. Alternatively, under section 243u, he can seek an exemption from section 243t, but the reason for uncertainty must be declared and it would, therefore, be imprudent to sell the goods until the issue was resolved. Finally, he could take the risk that his own determination is correct and expose himself to the risk of crippling penalty if his judgment is wrong. Many importers rely on fast turnover of imported goods for either fashion or seasonal reasons. Delays cost money, particularly under the Hawke Government's high interest rate regime. This legislation leaves the importers of these goods with Hobson's choice. In the committee stage I will be moving an amendment to delete the words `or otherwise' and insert the word `or' between the words `knowingly' and `recklessly'. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill also covers a number of minor provisions such as the manner in which the quantity of beer produced is measured for the purpose of assessing both customs and excise duty. It also covers controls pertaining to prohibited goods so as to permit the Minister for Defence to suspend licences. It will also extend the duty free entry to the Australian mainland of goods from Christmas Island to those goods from CI which were 50 per cent produced on the island. The Opposition supports the remainder of the Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn finally to the Customs Tariff Amendment Bill (No. 3) 1988. This Bill is a machinery Bill which includes seven schedules and enacts a range of changes to the Customs Tariff Act 1987 which imposes customs duty on the importation of goods. It covers 488 pages. Customs have consolidated the changes to ensure reference to only the one volume. There is merit in this procedure. This amending Bill illustrates the complexity and the continuously changing nature of the harmonised tariff and the difficulties to which customs agents are exposed. It implements tariff proposals made during parliamentary recess and includes decisions in regard to tariff reductions announced in the May economic statement together with tariffs that are already phasing the changes to the passenger motor vehicle plan and the textile, clothing and footwear sectoral policy. </PARA>
<PARA> This Bill also makes two amendments: first, it amends the operative date for changes relating to vinyl wallpaper as from 1 January 1989 to seven days after royal assent; and, secondly, it deletes the proposed new Customs duties for certain sugar products and restores the current duty arrangements as effected by the Government's announcement in the 1987 May economic statement. My colleague Senator Boswell will have some words to say about the sugar proposals. </PARA>
<PARA> The Primary Industry and Energy Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2), which is due to be debated on Friday, if passed unamended, would leave our sugar industry unprotected. However, I am assured that this will not take place. I understand that the Government is prepared to undertake that the sugar embargo will not be repealed until after the current Senate inquiry. I ask the Minister to give this undertaking in his response to the Senate in due course. The list of Government amendments in the two legislation Bills significantly altered both Bills. The Scrutiny of Bills Committee therefore re-examined both Bills and made certain comments. The Senate ought to examine the Scrutiny of Bills Committee report on this matter which was tabled today. It raised certain matters of great importance that should have been addressed by the Government. The Opposition will not be opposing the Customs Tariff Amendment Bill (No. 3) 1988. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Perhaps the degree of complexity of the Customs and Excise Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1987, the Customs and Excise Legislation Amendment Bill 1988 and the Customs Tariff Amendment Bill (No. 3) 1988 is indicated by Senator Lewis's reference on several occasions to `243U' when in fact he should have referred to `243V'. Let us begin, as Senator Lewis did, by going back to December 1987. As he indicated, the Bill then before us was the Customs Tariff Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1987 which, at that stage, was recognised by both the Opposition and the Australian Democrats as both a complex Bill and one whose provisions had not been adequately put to the Customs agents, importers and others involved in the Customs business. Therefore, it was strongly opposed. We believed it had significant flaws which could have been corrected. At that stage, the Democrats supported the Opposition in moving for deferral of the legislation despite the fact that the Government indicated that the Bill was to become an Act and, if I recall, operative from 1 January.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Bill again emerged during the closing stages of the 1988 autumn session. I was approached by the Minister for Science, Customs and Small Business, Mr Barry Jones, with what he said was the Government's response to the objections raised by Customs agents, importers and others involved in this industry. The Minister gave me a quite thick document which gave the response of the Department to a number of issues and indicated to me that he wished the legislation to proceed very quickly. He asked me to get in touch with those that had been lobbying me and see whether they were satisfied with these suggested changes to the legislation. I said there was a lot to communicate and it would take some time. He pressed me-and I am rather amused now at this fact-to get on the telephone and ring these people up. There were dozens of people with this document which, as I recall, was about 25 pages long. We were in the middle of a very heavy legislative program. Of course, it was quite impossible for me to do anything over the next few days. As a consequence of that, I photocopied this document and sent it to the various interested parties when I got back to Adelaide at the end of that week. I understand that they were extremely grateful because, again, this was one of the first imitations that they claimed that they had had from the Department in relation to this very complex matter and the changes which the Government was making. </PARA>
<PARA> As a consequence of that process, further representations were made to the Department. As a consequence of that, some of the material that was in that Bill was shifted to the 1988 Bill. There has been a further round of amendments and some more recent amendments have just hit the deck. So we are dealing with a very complex area. We are dealing with an amending Bill which itself has been amended. There are more recent amendments and, on top of that, the Opposition has foreshadowed amendments. In recent days I have made a couple of minor suggestions to the Department regarding further amendments. So we are dealing with a very complicated piece of legislative change. </PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Customs Service is attempting, through this legislation, to change to a fast tracking system which will be to the advantage of importers and those involved in any way with the necessary payment of duty. It is proposed under this system that approximately 90 per cent of goods will be fast tracked. It is intended that those goods will be cleared through Customs within approximately four hours. It seems to me that it must follow that for that system to work, and for agents and importers to be honest and diligent in their preparation of documents, one needs a comprehensive and discouraging set of penalties which will adequately protect the revenue of the country. </PARA>
<PARA> We are looking at an activity which is second only to taxation as a source of income for the Government. Under the system now in place approximately only 10 per cent of imports are routinely checked. This is similar to the sort of thing that happens at international airports. There will always be the suspicion that the documentation, the declaration of the type of goods and so on in respect of the goods that have not been checked, will have been done incorrectly or perhaps fraudulently. That is the background to the set of amendments at which we are now looking. So there is a need to buttress the system with adequate provisions and penalties to ensure that the system works well and so that the government revenue does not suffer. It can be seen, then, that the system is complex. Indeed, some people are opposing the legislation on the grounds of its complexity. But it seems to me that part of that complexity arises out of the intention by the Government and the Department to offer this speeded-up system. </PARA>
<PARA> I have indicated already that we have amendments, on amendments, on amendments, to the legislation. The Government has now included as many as 45 amendments to the original December 1987 Bill. So, I think one can fairly say that at this stage, although perhaps the Government and the Department have been a little bit tardy in communicating to those affected what they had in mind, we have a piece of legislation which goes a long way towards meeting the objections which were mounted at an early stage and, again, in May and June last year. </PARA>
<PARA> Objections to this legislation are still being voiced. Some of the objections which I have heard in recent days relate to the fact that the most recent amendments have not been communicated to those affected. There has been quite a flurry of activity in the last couple of days. Faxed copies of the most recent amendments have been sent to various affected people. By and large, one can say that it seems that, while they are not particularly happy with all of the provisions, nonetheless there is a willingness to accept that in many respects the earlier objections have been met. For instance, one of the strong early objections related to the period during which the Department could go back and make a claim for wrongly declared duty. This has been picked up in these amendments so that there is now a limitation of 12 months. That would seem to me to meet the objection which was originally made to that area. </PARA>
<PARA> The Department, nonetheless, is insisting that documents relevant to the declaration of customs be kept for a period of five years. There is still some objection to that on the ground that if penalties can be exacted only for up to 12 months why is there a necessity to keep documents for five years? It seems to me to be perfectly fair that in cases where declarations may have been wrongly made, for whatever reason, and there is a consistent pattern, the Department should have access to documents extending over a longer period. Even though the penalties may be exacted only with respect to those breaches which have occurred in the last 12 months, nonetheless the evidence that a person has been consistently under-declaring or wrongly declaring particular goods is surely relevant to the sort of penalties which should be exacted. In the case of the Australian Taxation Office, my understanding is that documents should be retained for seven years. I would not have thought that it was particularly arduous to retain the relevant documents for a period of five years. I see no conflict between that requirement and the limitation which has now been placed on the Department that legal action can be taken only for a period of up to 12 months. </PARA>
<PARA> There is still concern in relation to the issuing of warrants and whether the Department can go on fishing expeditions to importers' premises or customs agents' premises. Senator Lewis indicated that in the initial legislation, the 1987 legislation, it was suggested that justices of the peace be able to issue warrants and that that was objected to. We now have the requirement that only a magistrate can issue such a warrant, but that that warrant can be issued over the telephone. There seems to be some difference of opinion as to whether the Law Council or the Law Institute of Victoria originally made that suggestion. Somebody, apparently, made a suggestion, at the time that the objection was made about justices of the peace, that a quid pro quo for upgrading the quality of the warrants by requiring magistrates to issue them might be a provision that they could be issued over the telephone. </PARA>
<PARA> Objection is now made that, in the case of such a warrant, a person might be faced with a request to examine certain documents, and that that request may be legally refused. The Customs officer may then ring a magistrate, obtain a warrant, return with a warrant made out in the handwriting of the Customs officer, show it to the occupier, demand entry and legally gain entry. It is argued that that is objectionable on the grounds that the occupier of the premises need not necessarily know that the warrant is genuine. The provisions in the legislation at the moment allow for the verification of the warrant through a process which involves the agent writing out verbatim the instruction which the magistrate gives over the telephone and eventually sending that copy of the warrant back to the magistrate. The magistrate compares that warrant with the warrant which he made out and ensures that they are the same. </PARA>
<PARA> I have suggested-and I hope that the Government considers the suggestion-that as a further guarantee the officer should provide to the occupier of the premises the name and telephone number of the magistrate, invite the occupier to ring the magistrate and confirm that the warrant was correctly issued, and invite the occupier to make a photocopy of the warrant so that that copy can also be sent back to the magistrate and married with the original warrant made out by the magistrate. If that additional check were provided for, the complaints which are still being made regarding the issuing of telephone warrants would largely disappear. </PARA>
<PARA> An alternative approach, which is now available with modern technology, is to operate a fax machine from a 12-volt system in a car. It would be possible for Customs officers who have a fax machine in the car to get a warrant over the telephone and actually print a hard copy which could be shown to the occupier of the premises. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;With the price of stereos these days, fax machines might be cheaper. Another complaint is about how a Customs officer, once he has gained access to the premises, where he can only look for documents which are relevant to a particular entry, knows where those documents are. Can the officer not then go on a fishing expedition? It seems to me that that depends very much on the cooperation of the person whose premises are being searched. If the standard documents associated with the entry are asked for and presented, it seems to me that that should complete the matter. If, on the other hand, the person whose premises are being searched is uncooperative, quite clearly the officer would need to go on some sort of fishing expedition to find the relevant documents. As I say, it seems to me that with the provision of the surety over the genuineness of the warrant those matters are adequately covered in this legislation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator Lewis referred to the penalty provisions under section 243t. He did not draw attention to the provisions relating to section 234d. I think it is worth drawing attention to the fact that the legislation makes a clear distinction between declarations which are wrong and which are made knowingly and recklessly, without any further qualification-those covered by section 234d-and those covered under section 243t, which contains the extra qualification that the declaration is made knowingly, recklessly or otherwise.</PARA>
<PARA> I think it is necessary to point out that there is now a 12-month limitation under section 243t, so that issue has been picked up. In cases of uncertainty-something that Senator Lewis referred to, but referred to incorrectly as section 243u-under 243v it is possible that if there is uncertainty as to any aspect related to the nature of the goods or the duty payable, the agent or importer can nominate that information as information of which the owner or agent is uncertain and set out the reasons for that uncertainty, and where the owner or agent does so, no penalty shall be imposed under section 243t in relation to that information. If one takes that together with the ability to get an indication from the Department before import of what duty should be payable on particular goods, it seems to me that that provision under section 243v adequately covers the situation with respect to the words `or otherwise'. In most cases one is dealing with people who hold themselves out as professional operators, people who are supposed to be expert in the area of importing goods, in the procedures and the duties and so on that are payable. Despite the complexity, they operate as professional people in an area no more and no less complex than many other professional areas, and one expects-quite rightly-a very high degree of professionalism from those people. There should be very few errors. </PARA>
<PARA> Section 234d, to which I referred a moment ago, quite clearly is a declaration which in every respect is far more serious than what is envisaged under section 243t. Section 234 says `knowingly or recklessly'. In other words, there is a much higher degree of proof required that the person concerned quite deliberately, or in quite serious disregard of the law, made out certain declarations which were incorrect. In that case as well as there being a higher level of proof required, the penalties also are much higher. The penalties in that case are a penalty not exceeding $5,000 and twice the amount of the total duty payable on the goods-a very significant penalty. I do not think anybody so far has said that that penalty is in any way excessive. However, there are situations in which one cannot achieve that level of certainty in a case against an importer, a level of proof which requires that the Department establish that the information was wrong `knowingly or recklessly', and the other provision under 243t covers the case where, although that level of seriousness is not involved, nonetheless information was wrongly set down. It seems to me that cases grade from the most trivial through to those cases which fall just short of those which would come under section 234. Then the penalties which are exactable are much less; a penalty of $20 or twice the difference between the duty which was payable and the amount which should have been paid, whichever is the greater. There is in section 243u provision for the remission of those penalties, and there are a series of clauses which set out the mechanisms and the factors which must be taken into account by the Comptroller of Customs in relation to remitting the whole or part of those penalties. Again, it seems to me that, remembering that in most cases one is dealing with professional people, people who hold themselves out as professionals, those provisions are indeed adequate. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally on that section, there has been a claim that there should be an upper limit on the penalty so that if one is importing a very large volume of goods even that penalty under 243t could be excessive. I think the answer to that, quite simply, is that if one is importing a large amount of goods with a large value on which the duty payable could be extremely large, the duty of care to ensure that the documentation is correct becomes even higher, and that therefore the penalties are appropriate. Honourable senators should bear in mind again the provisions in 243v, which presumably apply even though the value of the goods may be very high. </PARA>
<PARA> Another issue which has been raised-I think by Senator Lewis-is the duty on foreign inland freight. It seems that in this legislation the Government is attempting to clarify the situation. Essentially, it has said that the duty payable should be on the value of the goods free on board. The problem of containerised goods, to use and an absolutely horrible term, arises under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), that is that goods which are containerised are deemed to have been exported from the time they go into the container, even though the container may be packed inland. It seems that there are considerable advantages in clarifying the situation, of adopting the free on board convention and, of course, adopting the GATT convention with regard to containerised goods. </PARA>
<PARA> Whatever convention one adopts, that may have in certain instances-and Senator Lewis gave one example-certain disadvantages for particular goods. My understanding is that the Government has given an undertaking to refer instances in which this change will cause substantial changes to the protective duty to the Industries Assistance Commission (IAC) and that those changes can be looked at. It is interesting that there is a contrast between what those people who have made representations on this matter are saying with respect to the possible disadvantage of small importers who, because they are importing only small amounts of material, do not have the material packed into containers inland in the country of export, and the claims that in relation to the exchange rate, the large importers can use forward exchange rates whereas the small importers cannot. One cannot help but contrast the arguments, which run in opposite directions. </PARA>
<PARA> Going back briefly to the matter of inland freight, there is a situation which is in every way comparable to the payment of local council rates, where the absolute amount one pays is arrived at by multiplying the valuation on the property by the rate. One might have a high valuation and a low rate or a low valuation and a high rate, but one may pay exactly the same local council rates. In this case, if the payment of duty on that element of foreign inland freight pushes up the value of the goods, it may be appropriate in certain circumstances to reduce the rate of duty payable, which would then bring the total amount paid, which is what the importers are interested in, back to the amount which is now being paid. </PARA>
<PARA> The claim has been made that the discretions which are included are excessive. Again it seems to me that on the one hand those who are complaining about this package of Bills are saying that the legislation should be simpler and more precise. It seems to me that there is a conflict of aims. If they want simpler legislation, it must necessarily include more discretionary powers. If they want the legislation to be more precise, it will be more complex. They also object to the complexity of the legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> I would briefly point out that section 8 of the 1988 Bill will be addressed by my colleague Senator McLean. In the brief time that remains to me in this debate, I shall refer briefly to the Customs Tariff Amendment Bill (No. 3) and draw attention to two matters. One is that the schedule still includes the importation of worked ivory. I understand that the importation of ivory into Australia is illegal. If it is not an illegal import in all circumstances, it certainly is in respect of certain sources of ivory. I understand that there is considerable illegal trade in ivory in African countries between dealers in South Africa and some of the other African countries. This is leading to illegal and continuous predation on African elephants. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, I shall be moving an amendment to the Customs Tariff Amendment Bill (No. 3) which will relate to solar cells. The technology has moved on to a great extent and it would considerably benefit Australia to allow the importation of solar cells without duty. There are considerable advantages to the wider adoption of that technology in this country. The price of these items is coming down and they are now becoming quite competitive with centrally generated electricity. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Senate is now dealing with Customs and Excise Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) and Customs Tariff Amendment Bill (No. 3). I wish to confine my remarks to the Customs and Excise Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 3) and to sugar. Before I continue with my contribution, I wish to express my concern about and offer my best wishes to the sugarcane growers who have had their crops flattened and their houses destroyed by Cyclone Aivu, and also to the many mill workers who have suffered at the hands of the cyclone. I know that all honourable senators will echo my remarks.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Government in its May statement announced that it would remove the sugar embargo. The customs legislation which is now before the House originally introduced a tariff structure to give the industry some type of protection if the embargo is lifted. But because of the advent of an inquiry to be conducted the Senate Standing Committee on Industry, Science and Technology inquiry-it was referred to the Committee by the Opposition and the Australian Democrats-the proposal to remove the tariff is no longer contained in this amending legislation. If the legislation were passed to remove the embargo, as could happen by means of legislation that is about to come before the House in the form of the Primary Industries and Energy Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2)-it is listed for consideration on Friday-the sugar industry would suffer and would have no protection at all. I ask Senator Bolkus whether he can give an assurance that the primary industry Bill will not be proceeded with, or if it does proceed that that part of the Bill which refers to sugar will be removed. I have sought an assurance from Senator Macklin-perhaps I should have sought it from Senator Coulter-and I have been assured that the Democrats will join us in blocking that Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> I am disappointed with the standard of representation given by Labor members, particularly Mr Courtice and Mr Gayler, who represent sugar seats. I believe that they have not looked after the best interests of the industry. They have ignored the industry to an extent. It is not unusual in Australian Labor Party circles to ignore farmers, but it is unusual that they should ignore the mill workers and those who give them traditional support. The Australian Workers Union (AWU) has made a submission to the Senate inquiry and that inquiry is now struggling to deal with some of the concerns expressed by the AWU. </PARA>
<PARA> The Labor Party is in disarray over the sugar industry and the lifting of the embargo. Mr Courtice, the member for Hinkler, and Mr Gayler, the member for Leichhardt, are toadying to the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Kerin) in full support of his statement to lift the embargo and to bring down a tariff structure of 35 per cent on raw sugar and 25 per cent on refined sugar. In 1992 the tariff on new sugar will fall to 15 per cent. The State opposition spokesman on primary industry says that he will call for a reversal of the decision to lift the embargo. He said in a statement he issued to the Daily Mercury on 21 March 1989 that there should be no action in respect of an embargo on the sugar industry. It is very confusing when the Minister, Mr Kerin, is saying one thing, Mr Courtice and Mr Gayler are backing him up, the AWU is saying something totally different, and Mr Casey is saying that it will cause immense political damage to the Australian Labor Party. Mr Casey has done his sums-they are set out in the article I mentioned-and he says that the sugar industry plays an important role in 19 or 20 State parliamentary seats and in up to nine seats in the Federal sphere. At least Mr Casey can do his political arithmetic. </PARA>
<PARA> The tariff recommended on raw sugar is 35 per cent, phasing down to 15 per cent in 1992. On raw sugar the tariff becomes an effective tariff of 30 per cent phasing down to 10 per cent. In case of Fiji and some of the smaller developing nations, sugar will be allowed to come into Australia tariff-free. Mr Kerin claims in his submission to the Senate inquiry that that will not happen initially, but gives no guarantee that it will not happen in the long term. He has given no commitment into the future. The Minister also claims that if subsidised, dumped beet sugar were imported at a 10 per cent tariff, the Government would act. These vague promises by the Minister are not good enough. We are talking about legislation and tariff structures that will give some protection to an industry-not vague promises that if certain things happen the Minister might take certain steps if he feels like doing so. That is not the way to legislate and it gives no standing to an industry which provides many jobs and many export dollars. One cannot run a business, a farm or a sugar industry on promises. People want to know what is in the legislation so that they can plan for it. </PARA>
<PARA> The sugar industry and I believe that the tariff structure of 35 per cent phasing down to 15 per cent is not good enough in times of extremely low prices. The industry is climbing out of the worst sugar price slump in history, when prices fell to as low as 2.3c and averaged about 4c a pound from 1982 to 1985. What is the use of a tariff of 15 per cent on 4c a pound? The present tariff on a pound of sugar is 0.6. That is not going to stop dumped sugar, subsidised sugar and corrupt sugar, which affect world prices, from entering Australia. It is not going to stop countries that are desperately seeking hard Australian currency selling sugar at any price. They will almost give it away so that they can come up with some hard currency. Only a month ago Cuba made considerable sales to New Zealand at almost give away prices so that it could get hard currency. Most of Cuba's sugar is sold to the Eastern bloc countries on contra deals and, if it can get access to markets just to attain hard currency, it will place its sugar in those markets. </PARA>
<PARA> These are the things that I do not believe this Government has considered. It is cheaper to ship to Australia sugar from places like Cuba, Mauritius and Fiji than it is to send sugar around the coast of Australia. It is cheaper to bring sugar in on ships from overseas than it is to put raw sugar on a boat and send it around to Western Australia for refining. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government is always gung ho in making farmers bear the cost of the wharf charges and shipping costs and it is always up front in removing any benefits from the rural community. We have seen that over the six years of this Government. It has really stuck the knife right into the heart of rural industries in Australia, and this is yet another example. If it is fair dinkum about wanting deregulation, it must bring it in uniformly right across Australia; then it will not have any opposition from this side of the Parliament. It has to address the problems on the wharves. We heard a lot about that yesterday. It also has to address the problems in shipping and rail. But it must not pick out just one sector of the community and take the stick to it because it does not vote for the Government, because then it is being discriminatory and is catching in the net a lot of people who do vote for it, as a lot of AWU members work in the sugar mills. Probably all sections of the union movement are represented in the mills. These are the people that the Government is inflicting these proposals on. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Kerin's proposed tariff may be effective and reasonable when sugar is around 11c a pound, as it is now. Not a lot of tariff is required then. But we do not legislate only for the good times; we do not legislate when sugar is 11c a pound. Sugar is the most corrupted and subsidised commodity in the world. We have had prices as low as 2.3c a pound and it is now hovering at 11c and could go as high as 15c. The devastation caused by the cyclone will probably lift prices. But Mr Kerin cannot guarantee these high prices; no one can. If sugar prices fall to the previous low of around 5c a pound, and they will as surely as night follows day, the refining industry in Australia will be able to bring in sugar at 5c a pound, with a tariff as low as 10 to 15 per cent in 1992. It would be delighted to pay even 10 to 15 per cent tariff, which would bring the cost of sugar up to a little under 6c a pound. That is what the refining industry will be able to purchase sugar for if the corrupt prices on the world fall. We will see imported sugar setting the bench mark for Australian sugar sold on the domestic market. In effect, the Australian refineries will tell the Australian sugar producers-and they are the most efficient producers in the world-that they can buy raw sugar from Thailand, Cuba, Fiji, or some nation that is dumping or subsidising sugar, for about 5c a pound. The refineries will say that is what they are going to pay the sugar producers and the millers of raw sugar in Queensland and northern New South Wales. </PARA>
<PARA> The price for domestic sugar will be forced down so that we can compete with countries that are subsidised by governments or countries that will sell at any price to get foreign currency. We have been caught right in the cross-fire of the biggest trade war in the history of the world, and there is no sign of that trade war lessening. Some of the headlines that we are seeing daily in the newspapers are: `Our future imperilled by US-EC trade war', `Alerting America to the dangers of subsidies', `Australia to seek a way out of subsidies', `Scepticism over talks of free trade', and `Hooked on subsidy fixes'. Mr Duffy, the Minister for Trade Negotiations, is becoming very despondent. He cannot see any progress at all against the trade wars, the subsidies and the corrupt world markets. I am a realist in politics. I have always believed that politics is the art of the possible. I understand the problems of the embargo, but surely this is not the time when we should be looking at lifting the embargo. </PARA>
<PARA> I have mentioned that the price of domestic sugar will be forced down so that we can compete with countries which are subsidised by governments or countries that will sell at any price. If the Australian Labor Party believes that the refiners will pass the savings onto the public, it believes in the tooth fairy. It will not happen. The savings will go into the general revenue of that company because there is effectively only one refiner in Australia. It will not have to meet competition in the marketplace to keep the price of sugar down at the retail level. What is in it for that company?</PARA>
<PARA> The proposed tariff system will transfer $80m from the farmer to the refiner, at current prices. That is a $80m loss if prices fall. I ask the Minister to look at the worst scenario. I have been accused by Mr Courtice, Mr Gayler and the Minister of making whacky and wild statements that the industry could lose up to $300m a year. I do not retreat from those statements. My statement about the loss of $300m to the industry was made on the worst possible scenario. Having been in politics for six years, I am a great believer in Murphy's law: the worst thing will happen at the worst possible time. If the price falls to 1985 levels of around 4c a pound-that is, the world parity-plus a tariff of 10 to 15 per cent, that will then set the price that the refiner will pay to the sugar mills. That is when a loss of $300m becomes possible. If the refiners were able to import sugar at 5c a pound and then say to the industry, `We can bring it in from all over the world at 5c a pound. That is the world price and that is what we are going to pay you' that will result in a loss of $300m. The Minister and his two backbenchers Mr Courtice and Mr Gayler know very well that if the price of sugar falls to 1985 levels and refiners set those world parity prices as domestic prices for raw sugar a loss of $300m will result and thousands of unionists will join the dole queue. It is no good for Mr Kerin and his two handmaidens Mr Courtice and Mr Gayler to rubbish me in the press and in speeches, saying that it cannot happen. It can happen; it has happened.</PARA>
<PARA> The only thing that held the sugar industry together was that it had a reasonable domestic price. The Government is not prepared to guarantee the price, and we are not calling on it to do that. The Government cannot do that. Nobody can guarantee a price in the corrupt world market. The Minister knows it can happen. So does Mr Courtice if he is in any way realistic. He was a sugarcane grower. He should know these things can happen. The AWU is telling him that it can happen, the farmers are telling him that it will happen, but he is not prepared to accept the representations from his electorate. Mr Gayler has already stood by with his hands in his pockets and seen 2,500 jobs destroyed in the timber industry in his electorate. </PARA>

<PARA> Not content with that, Mr Gayler is now prepared to back the Minister's statement and not stand up for the mill workers in his electorate. Mr Casey, in a press release, disagreed violently with him. At least he has the courage or the political sense to do that because he knows members of parliament must represent their electorates if they are going to survive. He has been around a long time and he is prepared to make a statement supporting the sugarcane growers and the sugar industry workers. It is a pity that Mr Courtice and Mr Gayler do not follow suit. </PARA>
<PARA> A set ad valorem tariff cannot and will not work on a commodity that can fluctuate from 2.3c to 15c a pound in two years. That is a fluctuation of over 550 per cent. The price can fall just as quickly. There is a need to have some sort of value tariff on sugar. Many minds on both sides of this Parliament are struggling with that question at the moment. Senator Childs and Senator Burns are on a committee that is investigating that question. I am not going to set up any proposal because I know that these matters are exercising the minds of these particular senators as well as senators on this side of the House. Senator Brownhill and Senator Coulter are also trying to propose something that will give some form of equity. Some protection is needed when prices fall as low as 2c a pound. We are caught in a crossfire of two giant nations warring on subsidies. </PARA>
<PARA> I was extremely disappointed by Mr Kerin's submission to the Senate inquiry. He said he was giving up on the sugar industry. Those are the words of a tired Minister and a Minister that wants to get out, give it away. I say to Mr Kerin that, if he wants to be relieved of duties, he should go to the Prime Minister and say, `I have had enough'. I know the 150,000 farmers in Australia who still remain would share the relief. He has lost the fire in his belly. He should do what Senator Walsh did and say that he wants to be relieved. </PARA>
<PARA> Apart from generally bagging the National Party for having the support of the sugar industry, Mr Kerin pointed out that there were between 6,000 and 6,500 cane growers and that only a hundred of those went out when the price was down as low as 2.3c per pound. He asked why cane growers would not survive when they received 15 per cent tariff on 2.3c to 5c a pound. Mr Kerin misses the whole point, the whole crux of the argument. Cane growers survived on domestic prices. When they were selling sugar overseas at 2c per pound they had a domestic price that underpinned their industry. These domestic prices were not corrupted by trade wars or subsidies. Cane growers also survived on a few long term sugar contracts and by sending their wives out to make beds in hotels and motels, by applying for family allowances, by living off their land, growing their own food, running up gigantic overdrafts and by hanging on with their fingernails until better times came. </PARA>
<PARA> That is the way most rural producers live. In a drought they hope that every day that goes by is a day closer to rain. They hope that every day there are low prices is a day closer to price rises. When rural producers get better prices they run into 18 per cent interest rates. But one thing that sugar farmers never did was to stop planting. They always provided jobs for their AWU mates. They never lost faith with the people in the mills. Mill workers received full pay. Even at times when it was uneconomical to plant sugar the farmers kept planting. They kept faith with the industry; they kept the mills running even when it became unprofitable for them. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Courtice made mention in his speech that the embargo has cost the sugar industry a lot of money. I suppose that argument could be advanced if world prices were way up, high in the sky. The sugar industry said, `We will share with the Australian community and we will not go for world prices'. When times were good overseas the Australian sugar industry shared those good times. But in bad times-and we have good and bad times in rural industries-we have got to give some sort of protection against dumped sugar and corrupt prices, which are now widespread. Every day we see statements in the papers about corrupt world markets. Mr Duffy is spending months of his time overseas trying to straighten out the international trade situation but he is making no progress. We have got to give some sort of protection in bad times. </PARA>
<PARA> Australian sugar growers are prepared to go out and meet the world market price of 2.3c a pound. Even as low as that, they will meet the world markets. The sugar industry is worth $700m to the Australian economy. But sugar growers have got to have a stable domestic price to underpin their industry. Domestic sales represent 20 per cent of sugar grown in Australia. Eighty per cent of sugar grown is exported. Australia's share of the world market is 3 per cent. If the industry cannot get the commitment of a stable price for domestic sales then the next sugar catastrophe-and there are always catastrophes-will do immense damage to the industry and will cause the loss of the jobs of many unionists working in the sugar mills throughout Queensland and northern New South Wales. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Senate is debating cognately the Customs and Excise Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1987, which the Opposition will be opposing, the Customs and Excise Legislation Amendment Bill 1988-I have much pleasure in supporting the amendment moved by Senator Lewis to the motion for the second reading of that Bill-and the Customs Tariff Amendment Bill (No. 3) 1988. I do not wish to cover the points that have already been covered very well by speakers on this side of the chamber. We are quite opposed to the second Bill. In essence, it lumps crooks and honest people together and makes the penalties for both classes the same. It is the old Labor syndrome of the very ethos of its political life-that is, to trust no-one. The Government certainly does not trust the Customs agents in Australia. I will go on to that in more detail in a moment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Customs and Excise Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1987 has as its purpose to combat the practice of understating the value of imported goods so as to minimise or avoid Customs duty. We support the Bill's intention but we do not think the procedures that it lays down are acceptable. The Bill amends the Customs Act 1901 and the Excise Act 1901. The main provisions of the Bill, in clause 12, deal with the valuation of imported goods. The value can be determined in a number of ways-the transaction value, which is the simplest method, the identical goods value, the deductive contemporary sales value, the deductive later sales value, the deductive derived goods sale value, the computed value and the fall back value. The owners are to be advised of the determined value of goods and can request information on the method used to calculate the value. It strengthens the powers of officers to inspect documents and requires documentation to be kept for five years. One of the underlying things that Senator Lewis mentioned is the belief that Customs officers are to be given exactly the same powers as the taxation officers. While they are both taxing functions in a way, the way the taxes are collected is quite different in practice. They really demand different methods, and not what the Government is trying to do in this case: to transfer some of the more stand and deliver highwayman tactics of Messrs Boucher and company of the Australian Taxation Office into the Customs Department, where they are really quite inappropriate. </PARA>
<PARA> Our objection centres to a large degree on the penalties for false statements. I will go into that in some detail in a moment. This is a reasonably complex piece of legislation and, as Senator Lewis has said, it has had a long delay. It first saw the light of day in 1987. It has only now come back to the Parliament. There have been serious points raised by the Law Council of Australia, a responsible body representing the National Council of Lawyers. It has written several times on this matter. Its first letter puts the matter quite succinctly where it says:</PARA>
<PARA>The Bill is extremely complicated as evidenced by the somewhat tortuous and often extensive definitions contained in the Bill which are almost certain to cause great uncertainty and concern to ordinary users of the Customs system. The fact that the draftsman has resorted to setting out hypothetical examples in order to illustrate the operation of some of the provisions of the legislation is evidence enough of the complexity of many of the provisions and the difficulties likely to be experienced in their practical operation. </PARA>
<PARA>Although the Bill has been amended since the Law Council wrote that letter in December 1987, the generality of its claims still apply. Its points of criticism have not been met. </PARA>
<PARA> The second area of concern has come from the Australian Customs Agents Federation, which is a responsible body: it is a national body supporting customs agents. In a letter of 8 February 1988 from the Executive Director of that body, protest is made about the way the debate was carried out in the Parliament, when some members of the House of Representatives attacked the standing of Customs agents. The Executive Director points out in the second paragraph of his letter to Senator Button:</PARA>
<PARA>In the first instance we reiterate, our members do not support duty evasion. It is neither morally acceptable to us or commercially sound. We take strong exception to the temperate and false accusations made in the parliament reflecting on the honesty and integrity of Customs Agents. It may be worthy of note that while barristers, solicitors, magistrates, accountants, politicians and customs officers are at this moment serving criminal sentences, not one licensed customs agent is in gaol nor to the best of our knowledge has one been gaoled. For people who individually handle millions of dollars of other peoples funds we believe that this is a fair testimony for our professional integrity. </PARA>
<PARA>I certainly support the Customs Agents Federation in its claim that customs agents have an enviable record of integrity in the discharge of their duties. It is very wrong for the Government-Senator Button and some speakers in the other place-to attack the integrity of the customs agents of Australia, saying that they are conspiring to defraud the Commonwealth of its due charges. The letter goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA>We, like any other professionals providing commercial advice, have a duty to our clients not only to pay the correct duty but to ensure that it is the minimum amount payable under the law. If the law is so poorly framed that it allows different interpretations which require courts to settle disputes, it is quite improper to label as ``shonky'' those who take advantage, quite legally, of its existing format. </PARA>
<PARA>That is a statement of fact. If the law is the governing thing and if it is badly drafted and there are loopholes in it, we should correct the loopholes in a practical way. Let us not impute dishonesty to people who still act within the letter of the law. That is not the central point of this matter. The central point of the objection to this legislation relates to the fact that it lumps honest people who genuinely make mistakes with those who set out to intentionally defraud. </PARA>
<PARA> I have had some experience of the practical side of Customs Acts over 20 years now. I have imported a considerable number of items for my personal use that have required Customs clearances. There are international customs declarations and all the other rigmarole must be gone through. There are certain thresholds. It used to be up to $80 worth of goods which came in duty free. Between that and about $200 there was one form to fill in and beyond that there was another one. From all of those clearances I did myself I have some insight into the enormous complexities of the by-laws that cover importation into this country. It annoys me that a private citizen who is prepared to take an interest in what should be an elementary procedure finds that Customs officers on many occasions will not give any help. On some occasions they will. I suspect that they are far more ready to give me help now that they know I am a senator-not that I tell them; the goods come in directed to `Senator MacGibbon'. I find that on the rare occasion I import things now, there is always a courteous Customs officer available to tell me what the by-law numbers are. But for 10 or 15 years before that I used to do it as a private individual, and it is very difficult because there are thousands and thousands of Customs categories that we have to fit in with. We make a declaration and the relevant duty is paid on that basis. It is really a complex and arcane process. The possibility, even with the best of care and intention, that a genuine mistake will be made is very high. </PARA>
<PARA> It is always part of our law that we differentiate between those who, in a premeditated way, set out to defraud and break the law and those who make genuine mistakes. Beyond that is the doctrine of being able to pay for our crimes, but that takes me down another pathway again. It is quite wrong to impose, as this legislation does, those draconian penalties on those people who genuinely make mistakes, particularly in the nature of modern customs clearances. </PARA>
<PARA> A lot of the things that come in that attract high duty are high value components. They are important to the purchaser or the end user in Australia. For that reason, they often come in by air. For example, an aircraft might have a component failure or it might be in for maintenance and a part is required. The owner of the aircraft rings up the parts supplier in the United Kingdom or United States. Although the part supplier is phoned on the same day as the part is required and he promises immediate delivery, it could be 10 or 15 days before that package is actually made up on an aircraft coming into Australia. Someone may have an aircraft or a piece of equipment that costs half a million dollars or several million dollars. It is down for two or three weeks. When that part comes in it is wanted straight away because, quite naturally, the operator wants that equipment back in service to get its revenue earning potential. So the pressure is on the customs agent to get that package out of Customs and into the workshop straight away. It will not be only one case; the customs agent might have 10 or 20 cases to clear in a hurry. He does his best but, inevitably, there is a high probability that the wrong tariff section will be named. </PARA>
<PARA> The present legislation says that the duty that is short paid shall be paid, which is fair enough, but it also says that the short paid duty will be doubled. The net effect of that is that there is a tripling of the amount short paid. It might not matter if it was only for $4 or $5, but some of these things can run into many thousands of dollars. The only thing that the customs agent can do in these circumstances is to pay under duress and then appeal to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. Anyone who has dealt with the Administrative Appeals Tribunal knows that there is a fair bit of time involved. Of course, there is a big economic penalty on the interest in the money forgone which has probably been incorrectly charged. It is also an unwieldy and unreasonable process to go through where someone has made a genuine mistake. I am advised that if one looks at the history of appeals to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal, one finds that the break down is fifty-fifty. In other words, the Administrative Appeals Tribunal finds that in about 50 per cent of the cases the Australian Customs Service was correct but that in the other 50 per cent of cases the customs agents were correct. So it looks as if the error rate lies pretty close to the midline. But even if that does not sway us, the fact that the figure is about 5 per cent in favour of the customs agents is highly significant. It is on those grounds that we oppose this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> I now move to the Customs and Excise Legislation Amendment Bill 1988. I have much pleasure in supporting Senator Lewis's amendment. This amends the Customs Act 1901 and the Excise Act 1901. It contains a range of amendments relating to beer, the measurement of volumes, defence exports, goods from Christmas Island, offence provisions, the imposition of excise duties on Government instrumentalities and other minor, technical amendments. Most of those have been covered by other speakers, and I do not wish to take up the time of the Senate on them, except to make reference to clause 8 which relates to licensing procedures for the export of military and dual-use technology goods, that is, goods that have both a commercial and military application. As I said in the Senate some weeks ago, I very much support the move to increase Australia's exports of defence equipment. It is long overdue and there is no simple fix, but the Government is to be applauded for the legislative steps it has taken, principally in another Act and not this legislation, to increase our ability to export military equipment. </PARA>
<PARA> Clause 8 provides licensing powers for exporters and details the way that those powers can be withdrawn in times of need. Without entering into a protracted debate on the value of military exports to Australia, I would make two very brief points: first of all, if we develop our own production facilities for military equipment, it will lead us to having more appropriate equipment for the Australian defence forces. Secondly, there is some good economics in it. Most of the equipment that the Australian defence forces use is developed for the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation forces. That means that it is optimised for cool, temperate climates in Europe. While some of it works very well there, it does not necessarily work as well in conditions of very high temperature, and sometimes very high humidity and dust as we have in Australia. It is also designed for very high threat scenarios where there are always a great number of countermeasures for any piece of equipment. So the inherent cost of that equipment is always very high. I believe that there is scope to develop military equipment that is suitable for the tropical, subtropical and dry areas of Australia. It can often be simpler and more effective in that particular environment than a great deal of the material we import. For us to do that, it is important that we have access to bigger markets than those of the Australian defence forces. </PARA>
<PARA> That leads me to the second point which is the economics of it. To develop any sort of effective weapons system at all requires very big expenditure on research and development. We simply cannot justify it on the short order runs that we have. A third point that occurs to me as I say this is the matter of self-sufficiency. The Fraser Government in its White Paper on defence set out the premise that we ought to move to be as reliant as we can in our defence needs. That was picked up by this Government in a 1987 defence of Australia White Paper and reinforced. If we are going to be self-sufficient, then we have to have our own production capability to the extent that it is possible to do that. Of course, the bigger the market that we have through export sales the easier it will be for us to bring that about. It is one of the very great tragedies that the defence of this country has been completely reduced to impotence through diminished defence financial votes under this Labor Government and through extremely poor leadership from defence Ministers. One of the real tragedies, quite apart from the resignation rate and all the rest of it, is that we have no reserve weapons, ammunition and stores in this country that we will need in an emergency. In fact, we do not even have enough weapons for training in many cases. I would instance the fitting of the Pave-Tack to the F111s. We do not have any GBU15s, which is the precision guided munition that has been designed to optimise the Pave-Tack. For a small country like Australia, we have to go down a high technology path to get the force multiplier effect that high technology brings to give us, as a small nation, a credible Defence Force. We just do not have any reserve weapons stock to train with, let alone use in an emergency. The development of our own industries within Australia is crucial if we are going to overcome those difficulties. </PARA>
<PARA> The third Bill before us is the Customs Tariff Amendment Bill (No. 3) 1988. My understanding is that the Senate has agreed to delete the reference to sugar. I will have quite a bit to say about sugar in what I think is the proper place for a debate on that, which is the Primary Industries and Energy Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) which, I am assured, will come on for debate after the Senate inquiry. This final Bill before us contains a number of amendments including seven schedules to the Customs Tariff Act 1987. The amendments to schedules 1 and 2 deal with walnuts, large machines, deerskin leather garments and paper cutting machines. Schedule 3 deals with the import embargo on certain raw and refined sugar, which we will deal with later when the Senate inquiry report is considered. Importantly, it deals with the reduction of duty rate applicable to kerosene for use in aircraft. The other schedules relate to various imports which are technical matters that I do not propose to discuss this afternoon. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to say a few words about the removal of the excise duty on avtur. This is one of the great mistakes that this Government has made in its management of aviation in Australia. For some years now, we have had the user pays doctrine applying in aviation. No other section of the Australian community is subject to the user pays principle. Within the transport field, the road transport users-the people driving all those semi-trailers around Australia-however much they might complain about what they are paying for diesel fuel, road tax and road licences, do not have to meet full cost recovery. </PARA>
<PARA> A member of the Australian Democrats pointed out earlier in the year that there was, through the courtesy of the Australian taxpayer, an effective subsidy of, I think, about $30,000 or $40,000 a year on each prime mover and semi-trailer. No other area of Government activity in the Australian community-education, health and all the other services that the Government provides-is subjected to the user pays principle. This is quite properly so because there is a wider community benefit. After all, the reason why we pay personal income tax and company tax and why the Government raises taxation generally is to pay for services that it provides that have a community benefit as opposed to a personal benefit. </PARA>
<PARA> I argue very strongly that the aviation industry definitely provides a community benefit. It is not confined to those people who fly between Sydney and Melbourne every day to clinch big business deals. The benefits relate to the whole community. Nevertheless, putting that aside, we have the user pays doctrine with 100 per cent cost recovery applied to the aviation industry. The aviation industry is prepared to accept that. </PARA>
<PARA> Up until the introduction of the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) and the Federal Airports Corporation (FAC) those costs were recovered in a number of ways by the former Department of Civil Aviation. This Government set up the Bosch Independent Inquiry into Aviation Cost Recovery two or three years ago. The Bosch Committee recommended that, provided efficiencies were introduced into the administration of the Department, it would be correct to go for 100 per cent cost recovery from the aviation industry within five years. This Government, in true style and in its rapacious way, did nothing to correct, one iota, the inefficiencies. It went to 107 per cent cost recovery within 14 months of receiving the Bosch report-a pretty fair achievement. There were a few cries from the aviation industry. Nevertheless, the aviation industry accepted that. One of the ways this was done was by putting an excise levy on fuel: avgas, the petroleum used in reciprocating engines, and avtur, used in jet and prop jet aircraft. </PARA>
<PARA> I am glad that the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade (Senator Gareth Evans) has come in here because, as Minister for Transport and Communications, he would have had a hand in it. This Government, in a burst of ideological insanity, decided that it would transfer the whole of the aviation world off budget because it was all too hard for the Government to manage. In this ideological purity concept, it would have no part of collecting any levy through avtur or avgas for the CAA or the FAC. The consequence of that is the reason why we have this inquiry today before the Senate into the organisation and management of the CAA and the FAC. The whole of the aviation industry is now in revolt. That Committee has received 99 submissions. This is one of the biggest responses to a public advertisement that any committee of the Parliament has ever had and reflects the great unrest in the community. The whole of the economic base on which cost recovery was grounded has been cut from underneath it. </PARA>
<PARA> It is not correct for the Government to claim that, because the CAA and the FAC are statutory authorities, they cannot collect the money; of course they can. They are collecting billions of dollars through personal tax and other levies which they are paying to the State governments. It is quite competent for the Government, without perjuring one iota of its ideological purity, to go back to collecting avtur and avgas levies. The industry will support these imposts. </PARA>
<PARA> If one believes in the false ideology of the user pays doctrine, the levy on fuel is the fairest way of doing it. If one does not fly, one does not use the facilities and one does not burn fuel. If one does fly, one does burn fuel. There is a direct relationship between the user and the charge. The great difficulty with the user pays doctrine is that organisations such as the CAA and the FAC have direct access to the cheque books of users. It is all very well to say that if one uses something one should pay for it. But, in the aviation industry, the users-the people who own and operate aircraft or use air services-are never consulted by the FAC or the CAA in any meaningful way as to what they require. </PARA>
<PARA> There is now a great imbalance because the great airfield developments at the primary city airports are a consequence of the operation of civil transport passenger aircraft. For safe operations, those facilities are required. The greatest amount of flying in Australia-three or four times or maybe 10 times the number of hours and traffic-is done by the general aviation sector. The general aviation sector does not need the massive facilities that we must have for commercial airline traffic. Under the present system the general aviation sector is being taxed increasingly unfairly to support facilities that it does not need. Most importantly it has no say in whether it needs them. </PARA>
<PARA> I come back to the virtue of the fuel tax. It is a direct user pays system. If one flies, one pays. If one stays on the ground, one does not pay at all. Of course, if a plane is sitting on the ground, it is not costing anyone anything for services. The other great advantage of it is that there is no cost to the Government. We do not need Customs officers and bureaucrats because the oil companies supply the fuel. They pump it in; they do the invoicing. At the end of the month, they pay the Government whatever the levy is for the amount of fuel they have sold. There are no administrative costs to government. There are no bad debts. More than anything else, I emphasise that this concept is accepted by the industry. The way the Government has gone back to the old system of eliminating the levy on fuel, which was so efficient in paying for the aviation services in this country, is one of the elements I find objectionable about this Bill. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise as the Australian Democrats spokesperson on defence to address only one of the three Bills-the Customs and Excise Legislation Amendment Bill 1988-that we are debating cognately. Honourable senators will be aware that this Government seeks to implement its new policy in relation to military exports through this Bill. Indeed, clause 8 of that Bill is the instrument of the Government's intention to become one of the grubby producers and exporters of arms and join a select club of countries that choose to use arms exports, as Senator MacGibbon said, to seek certain economic advantage. To our way of thinking that is a little bit along the same lines as saying, `There's money to be made from the export of heroin. Why don't we get into that business. In fact, why don't we treble or quadruple the number of acres in Tasmania where we are currently growing poppies to produce heroin for medical use?'.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That same rationale and mentality are applied by this Bill to our entry into the arms race. We might as well say, `Let's be producers and exporters of drugs as well because it will put money into our depleted coffers'. Indeed, the Australian Democrats are disgusted by the Government's position in relation to the production and export of arms which it will attempt to implement through clause 8 of the Bill. We believe that it appears to have no ethical basis whatsoever. In a previous debate on an urgency motion several weeks ago, we stated that it stands in absolute contradiction to the statements made by the Government in global forums in relation to arms production and exports. </PARA>
<PARA> Australia has made many statements recently in the United Nations and elsewhere, calling for the curtailment of the international arms trade. In those statements it has acknowledged the link between military expenditure and social hardship, particularly in developing countries. In fact, it has urged nations to embrace non-military approaches to guaranteeing their security. Of course, those statements completely contradict the principles which the Government has enunciated as its new policy on military production and export. Despite this, the Government has now announced a policy of targeting developing countries for arms sales; a policy of reducing controls on the sale of Australian arms and commercial explosives; a policy of defining whole categories of products and services as defensive, irrespective of the military position of the purchasing country; and a policy of making the presumption that we will export to any country to which our allies export and that exports to our allies will be unrestricted. </PARA>
<PARA> The Democrats are disgusted by the Government's stand on this issue. We will push for parliamentary scrutiny of Australian arms exports. Details of military exports are currently not reported to Parliament. We will push that the necessity for approvals for arms exports be the subject of joint decisions by the Minister for Defence and the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade. Above all, we will seek that these departments implement the completely new policy that the paramount consideration in Australian military exports be an ethical one rather than the current, purely mercenary one. I will focus specifically on clause 8 of one of the three Bills before us because it is the instrument by which the Government intends to implement its new policy; a policy which contradicts and compromises numerous recent Government statements in United Nations for a policy which defines whole categories of exported goods differently from the way in which they have been defined previously. </PARA>
<PARA> The specific provisions of clause 8 of the Customs and Excise Legislation Amendment Bill warrant our attention. We argue that the clause cannot be assessed in isolation from the regulations which will use the power that it creates. In other words, the Senate is being asked to make judgments about the implications of the clause without having any insight into the nature of the regulations which will be the instrument of its application. </PARA>
<PARA> The Senate may not agree with the Government's definition, which is not yet clear, of lethal non-military goods. We already know that the Government is having great difficulty in arriving at such definitions. We argue that clause 8 of the Bill opens the door to the export of social violence through the use of firearms by private individuals. The Bill increases the risk that Australian arms and explosives will reach the black market and become available for non-government terrorism, particularly when one considers that real controls over re-export or unforeseen use are non-existent. It creates a power, which the Government already exercises, by allowing Customs to approve small shipments of sporting firearms to specified countries. Clause 8 creates a false illusion of parliamentary control. Its inclusion in an omnibus Bill is a cynical attempt to minimise the political damage associated with legislation that enacts the Government's policy of arms production and export. </PARA>
<PARA> One can only wonder at the position in which Australia's new Ambassador for Disarmament, Mr David Rees, finds himself when he is confronted with a Government policy which flies in the face of statements made by his predecessor in overseas forums in recent times. One would anticipate, therefore, that in future the Foreign Minister will be unable to make such statements in international forums. Let me refer to some of those recent statements by our previous Ambassador for Disarmament, Mr Richard Butler. It is an interesting contrast that the title includes the word `Disarmament' yet this piece of legislation will put us into the club of countries that produce and export arms. He stated:</PARA>
<PARA>It is becoming clearer than ever before that excessive outlays on military goods weakens national economies and distorts wider patterns of economic cooperation and potential beneficial interdependence. The disturbing factor has been the nature and growth in international arms transfers, with the consequent negative impact on regional security situations and the potential for improvement in the standards of living. </PARA>
<PARA>We constantly hear the Minister for Defence (Mr Beazley) and the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade (Senator Gareth Evans) refer to the need for us to be vigilant about security in our region, yet the very processes that are enabled by one specific clause in this piece of legislation allows us to proceed along lines of action which our former Ambassador for Disarmament says render our region insecure and run contrary to our efforts in relation to the development and promotion of economic cooperation. It is interesting to look at statements that have been made by a former Minister for Foreign Affairs, Mr Bill Hayden. He said:</PARA>
<PARA>Arms transfers must not become a new cash crop. It should be recognised, especially by those whose development needs are great, that the purchase of arms is at the cost of the purchasers of the investment goods essential to the creation of employment and economic growth. </PARA>
<PARA>In other words, he is saying that if one encourages underdeveloped countries to expend their limited resources on arms one is discouraging them from expending those limited resources on far more valid requirements. This was stated by a recent Minister for Foreign Affairs. Yet the Government of the day, several months after those statements were made, is using one of the three pieces of legislation before us today as the means of implementation of policies which are contrary to those enunciated by the former Minister for Foreign Affairs. </PARA>
<PARA> What is the current system? Let us see how it will be varied by clause 8 of the Customs and Excise Legislation Amendment Bill 1988. Under section 112 of the Customs Act 1901 the customs Minister can make regulations to prohibit the export of goods from Australia. Those regulations can allow for export licences or permissions to be granted, made subject to conditions, varied or revoked. A licence allows for exports by its holder, over a specified period; permission applies to a particular shipment only. A subsequent shipment of the same goods can only take place if permission has been given anew. So they are very exclusive provisions. In fact, they are provisions which were designed to ensure that Australians are inhibited in their ability to take part in the sort of activity that is being promoted by the new policy-namely, the production and export of arms. </PARA>
<PARA> What are the effects, therefore, of the proposed changes. The Customs and Excise Legislation Amendment Bill, which was introduced by the Hon. Barry Jones in the other House on 7 November, includes a specific clause, clause 8, which of course throws all that aside and enables, surreptitiously, the Minister for Defence to issue regulations which allow us to become the producers and exporters of arms, despite the quotations I have given from our Ambassador for Disarmament and our Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade. </PARA>
<PARA> The remainder of the Bill relates to the duty on beer, the duty-free status of goods from Christmas Island, Customs offences, and excise on government instrumentalities. Hidden in that Bill relating to beer, exports from Christmas Island, et cetera, is this clause which is the legislative base upon which the Minister, under regulation, can create possibly the most abhorrent industry that Australia could become involved in. Clause 8 allows the Minister for Defence to suspend arms export licences and permissions if he or she judges that they will be `contrary to the national interests'. What an extraordinary phrase under which to hide or legitimise this process. Licences to export arms to country A can be suspended if `a situation' in that country means that the exports will threaten Australia's interests. It can also be applied to countries B and C if there is a `reasonable likelihood' that goods exported to B and C will then be re-exported to A, et cetera. But regulations to be issued after the Bill passes will give the Minister for Defence the power to issue export licences for potentially `lethal non-military goods' such as sporting firearms and commercial explosives. According to the Minister for Science, Customs and Small Business (Mr Barry Jones), each such export currently requires case by case ministerial permission. However, there are anomalies built into the provisions of those regulations. Even though Minister Jones claims that the Minister for Defence currently vets each proposal to export lethal non-military goods, an instruction issued by the capital procurement organisation in 1985 claims otherwise. The instruction, for use by departmental officers, states:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . commercial explosives, sporting firearms, and ammunition . . . is not normally subject to export control as applied to defence arms and ammunition. Controllers of Customs are authorised to permit export of such items except to certain specified countries. </PARA>
<PARA>If this is true, Minister Jones has inadvertently misled Parliament, and the Bill is giving the Defence Minister a power he already exercises. In a phone conversation in November 1988 Olin (Aust) Ltd-the Winchester Division-said that it seeks ministerial approval for each shipment of firearms except where five or less are being shipped, and in such cases Customs is authorised to let them through to approved destinations. In other words, it is only a matter of how the things are packaged as to whether they can be legally exported under the provision of the regulations. </PARA>
<PARA> Customs is now consulting Defence and other departments about new regulations which will follow this legislation. It appears that those regulations will purge all non-lethal goods from schedule 13, hence from export controls-presumably including training equipment, communication equipment, uniforms, et cetera. It appears that those regulations will divide schedule 13 into two parts, with part 1 containing lethal military goods and part 2 containing lethal non-military goods. It appears that those regulations will allow the Minister for Defence to issue export licences for goods in part 2, with goods in part 1 still requiring shipment-by-shipment permission. </PARA>
<PARA> In essence, the Australian Democrats say that clause 8 of the Customs and Excise Legislation Amendment Bill 1988 is, in fact, the instrument by which the Government will be committing this nation, through regulations of the Minister for Defence, to the club that produces and exports goods overseas, in the pursuit essentially of very limited economic returns, which flies in the face of statements made by our Ambassador for Disarmament, our Ministers for Foreign Affairs and our Prime Minister (Mr Hawke)-as he did recently on his visit to India-in relation to the impact of the production and export of goods on underdeveloped countries. In fact, the Democrats say that the Government has been fundamentally hypocritical in its position in that it is trotting around the world saying that it is prepared to lead disarmament discussions focusing on chemical arms, and it is making statements and pontificating about the need for limiting the sale and transfer of arms from one country to another, particularly between underdeveloped countries, yet it is hiding and burying within an omnibus package of legislation, which is currently before the Senate, the powers by which it intends to pursue the production and export of arms. We say that that is not only being logically contradictory but also is unethical and hypocritical. We oppose clause 8 of the Bill. If clause 8 is not struck from the Bill, we will be opposing the whole of the Customs and Excise Legislation Amendment Bill 1988. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It had not been my intention to speak on this cognate legislation that is before the Senate this afternoon, but I have been encouraged to do so by the contribution made this morning by Senator Boswell. I am very disappointed in Senator Boswell's contribution, in the sense that he used this debate on customs legislation to canvass his views on assistance to the sugar industry. He mentioned that the Senate Standing Committee on Industry, Science and Technology is undertaking an inquiry into assistance to the sugar industry. It was Senator Boswell, on 14 December last year, who proposed that the Committee conduct that inquiry.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I am a member of that Committee, as you are, Mr Acting Deputy President. The Committee has been working long and hard to come to grips with that industry and to come to an understanding of it-particularly for my own part, as a Western Australian senator, because it is an industry which has no impact on or connection with my home State. We have worked very long and hard to reach an understanding of the problems besetting that industry and problems that may occur if the Government's plans for deregulation go through. I recognise Senator Boswell's interest in the industry and I take no umbrage at his expressing that interest. But during the time the Committee has been working and investigating, he has not seen fit to inform the Committee of his views on assistance to the industry. From his contribution this morning, he obviously holds fairly strong views; but even though he felt the need for the Committee to inquire into the assistance, he did not feel it important enough that he should express his views to the Committee so that it might in turn take his views into consideration when formulating a final recommendation to the Parliament and to the Minister. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Boswell had ample opportunity to do so. He was fully aware that the Committee was undertaking this investigation. He has been in contact with the Secretariat of the Committee. He has actually attended one public hearing of the Committee-the hearing during the last sitting of the Parliament three or four weeks ago when the Committee heard evidence from the Minister. He did not attend any of the public hearings that we conducted on two separate visits to Queensland. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I intend to address my remarks in this debate to the Customs and Excise Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1987 and the Customs and Excise Legislation Amendment Bill 1988. Specifically, I want to deal with three aspects of those Bills: the question of warrants, the question of inland freight and the question of penalties. Firstly, there is a great concern within the Opposition parties about the question of warrants. There is a concern that the power being given to Custom's officers is an infringement of civil liberties and, indeed, that this is setting a new precedent which outstrips powers that are given, perhaps, in respect of more serious areas.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Under the proposed legislation, although justices of the peace have been excluded from the definition of `magistrate', magistrates are still empowered to give warrants to enable officers to enter premises and to search for documents. It is proposed that their warrants be given by telephone. There is precedent for telephone warrants under the Telecommunications (Interception) Act and the National Crimes Authority legislation. But in both those cases the telephone warrants are required to be given by a judge, and not by a magistrate. </PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Customs Service says that it needs speedy and easy access to warrants and, therefore, it needs to have telephone access to a magistrate. However, I do not find that argument convincing. I would have thought that this would leave the way open for fishing expeditions to be conducted. There are no safeguards. Even if the occupier is cooperative with the agent and says, `Look, these are the documents that you wish to have', there is no restraint upon the agent saying, `Well, I think there are more, you have not given them all to me, and I propose to search for them'. The Law Council of Australia is very concerned about this initiative. I think it is a very serious matter which the Government ought to reconsider. </PARA>
<PARA> On the question of penalties, although the three-year retrospective period during which records can be overseen and penalties imposed has been brought down to one year, many concerns still remain. The requirement that documents have to be maintained for five years does not seem to be in line with the proposal to reduce the review period to one year. But we are more concerned about proposed new sections 243t and 234d of the Customs and Excise Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1987. It is interesting to note that although one of the provisions is supposed to deal with matters that are more serious than the other, the penalty in what is seen to be the lesser category can in fact end up being greater than the penalty imposed under the so-called more serious provision. Proposed new section 243t, which uses the words, `knowingly, recklessly or otherwise', and attempts to impose a strict liability, provides for a penalty of $20, or twice the difference of the duty paid and payable, but has no limit at all. I heard Senator Coulter in his address deal with this question. He simply thought that if an importer were dealing with a large amount of goods of considerable value, that therefore somehow imposed a greater duty of care. He argued that the need for accuracy was greater simply because the value of goods was greater. I did not really find much logic in that argument. </PARA>
<PARA> We are also concerned about the way in which penalties seem to be dealt with-indeed, this applies to much of the rest of the legislation-in that the expertise of the people who draft taxation legislation seems to have been borrowed. With 84 discretions in the legislation, we are again seeing the law rendered more and more uncertain. The Australian Taxation Office takes the view of shifting the onus of proof to the taxpayer and these pieces of legislation are again using that technique of shifting the onus. The method of saying that one can be liable without intent is a very serious innovation in this area of the law. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to deal with the question of inland freight and the intent of the Government to clarify what is meant by value. The Customs (Valuations) Amendment Bill 1981, which was introduced by the Fraser Government, specifically omitted any inland freight or inland insurance unless they were paid or payable directly or indirectly by the purchaser to or for the benefit of the vendor. The intention of that legislation was quite clear. It was a specific interpretation by the then Government of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade definition of values set out in the multilateral code of conduct entitled Agreement on Implementation of Article 7 of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. A paper produced by the then Government stated:</PARA>
<PARA>The Code seeks to achieve its main aim by basing the Customs value (value for duty) on imported goods as far as possible on the transaction value of the goods'. </PARA>
<PARA>There was no uncertainty about the intent of the law. Article 1 of the code of conduct describes the transaction value as:</PARA>
<PARA>The price actually paid or payable for the goods when sold for export to the country of importation adjusted in accordance with the provisions of Article 8'. </PARA>
<PARA>Article 8 makes it clear that the matter of the inclusion or exclusion from the Customs value of freight, insurance and other associated charges is entirely a decision for the signatory country itself, depending on the manner in which the goods were sold and the country's national legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government, in its present legislation, takes advantage of that article in dealing with `other associated charges' when it specifically exempts advertising and warranty costs from dutiable value. It is quite at liberty to do so with regard to inland freight as well. But it is simply not true to claim that the Government has introduced this provision on the basis that it is complying with the GATT agreement. In 1981, when the legislation was framed, the then Government said quite specifically that Australian authorities had canvassed the community and for many reasons, including the enormous increase in protection that would result if a c.i.f. system were adopted, it decided to exclude freight costs. So the intention of the law has been quite clear. </PARA>
<PARA> When the Australian Customs Service began to examine this situation in 1986, it started to talk about abuses of the system by people who were trying to avoid paying duty which they properly ought to pay. But to say that people abused the inland freight exemption is to besmirch the reputation of companies which do use it in a bona fide way. Indeed, if the law goes through as it is presently proposed, we could very well see large increases in manufacturing costs. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Smoking is one of the major health issues of our time. Indeed, the United States Surgeon General, Dr Koop, has announced the goal of making the United States of America a smoke-free society by the year 2000. In his most recent report he points out that biomedical researchers, physicians and public health authorities in more than 80 countries have generated over 50,000 studies on smoking and health. About 2,000 more are added every year. The overwhelming majority of these studies conclude that cigarette smoking is either a contributing or primary cause of illness or death. Dr Koop says that while the major emphasis to date has been on research into the health risks of people who smoke-that is, mainstream smoking-the dangers of `sidestream' smoking-that is, cigarette smoke that is inhaled by non-smokers-have been increasingly documented.</PARA></TALK.START>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="2I4">Senator MACKLIN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is right. Presently in the United States there are 53 million smokers and some interesting research has pointed out the types of costs to that society. In particular, Larry White points out in his book entitled Merchants of Death, that five health economists led by Dr Dorothy Rice of the University of California at San Francisco made an estimate that the cost of cigarette smoking to the United States was $53.7 billion in health care costs and income lost by smokers. Direct medical costs for smokers were found to be $23.3 billion more than for non-smokers. Those costs included hospital and nursing care outlays, doctors bills and drug charges. Salary losses attributable to smoking by people who were sick with smoke related diseases totalled $9.3 billion and lifetime earning loss was put at $21.1 billion. The authors of that study said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>A total of 270,269 deaths in 1980 were due to smoking, resulting in 3.9 million person years lost. </PARA>
<PARA>They go on to say:</PARA>
<PARA>Our estimates are conservative for several reasons. We have not taken into account the adverse affects of passive smoking, risks of abortions, stillbirths and neo-natal deaths, or deaths under age 20 that might be associated with smoking. </PARA>
<PARA>Other estimates of the costs have put this exercise far higher. </PARA>
<PARA> In terms of the Australian material there was an interesting study released in October 1987 by the Health Department of Western Australia indicated that the costs to Australia were of the order of $2.5 billion dollars a year. The study by the Department's epidemiological branch concentrated on 1984 data for which death and hospital material were readily available from all States. There were 19,000 deaths attributable to smoking. The total cost, as I said, was $2.5 billion nationally, of which New South Wales contributed $941m, Victoria $708m, Queensland $411m, and so on. Direct health costs were put at $877m a year Australia wide. </PARA>
<PARA> A study undertaking by Kate McAllister of the Victorian Smoking and Health Project found that it was difficult to do a cost-benefit analysis because of the lack of data but stated that many points were clear: first, smoking results in productivity losses; secondly, there are hospital costs; and thirdly, deaths are the major cost of smoking. It is extraordinary that, whereas each year in Australia smoking is responsible for between 16,000 to 19,000 deaths, alcohol is the cause of about 3,000 deaths and all other drugs, both illegal and prescribed, are the cause of less than 1,000 deaths, the hypocrisy in the community still allows advertising for these lethal drugs. </PARA>
<PARA> The survey found that smoking caused productivity losses of about $670m. It put direct hospital or medical costs at $276m. Other costs, such as fire damage, which were directly attributable to smoking amounted to $95m. Anti-smoking education cost $8m. These costs are on the loss side. What about the benefits to society? As recently as this morning, the Tobacco Institute of Australia was talking about the enormous benefits to the revenue that flow from the tobacco industry, somehow or other suggesting that this was a reason for the industry being allowed to continue. Presumably, the amount of revenue would be greater if all of the drug industries were allowed to advertise their products. </PARA>
<PARA> The problem here, of course, is that there is a great deal of conflicting evidence. The Tobacco Institute, for example, makes outrageous claims with regard to the number of jobs that have been created-it started at 30,000 and I think this morning a figure of something like 68,000 was mentioned. In terms of a more reasonable estimate, I think that the figure would have to be far lower. McAllister was able to pinpoint only 5,244 people directly employed in the industry at the end of 1988. But, of course, one must in fairness say that there are downstream jobs, certainly in terms of distribution and in the retail sector. At the end of the exercise McAllister found that there is a monetary benefit of some $1.4 billion as against the cost of something like $1.1 billion. However, in that study no account was taken of the types of non-monetary losses, such as losses that result from death. But, in any event, it seems to me quite extraordinary that we should have now got ourselves into a situation where, on the one hand, we are able to contemplate allowing the advertising of two legal drugs-that is, tobacco and alcohol-to continue although they are responsible for the deaths each year of over 20,000 Australians, and yet, on the other hand, we not only ban the advertising of other drugs but declare them illegal. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that while one can certainly point, as was done in a recent document, to the links between alcohol and crime, there is no conclusive evidence that the advertising of alcohol necessarily increases the number of consumers. Likewise, it is somewhat difficult to get conclusive evidence with regard to tobacco. But I believe that in making it permissible to advertise those two drugs, we are in fact creating an environment in which people will believe that by consuming drugs they will become richer, healthier, happier or whatever else. I would include in this category not only tobacco and alcohol but all sorts of other drugs. For example, people are told that if they pop a few dieting pills they will suddenly become attractive on the beach; if they take some other drug they will suddenly overcome a problem and be able to work twice as fast. In other words, we allow advertising which suggests directly to the community that popping a pill is a way of overcoming a problem. We are then sanctimonious about the fact that our young people-and it is largely our young people-become addicted to lethal drugs such as speed, crack-thank goodness at the moment there is very little of this drug, but it is starting to come in-and heroin, which is the mainstay of illegal drugs in this country. I believe that at some stage the community really has to confront this issue. I do not believe that it is any longer reasonable or permissible for us to allow tobacco and alcohol advertising. </PARA>
<PARA> I am particularly concerned about the shift in the consumption of tobacco. While there has been a drop in consumption overall, unfortunately the female consumption rate has risen dramatically, particularly amongst young women. An extremely interesting study entitled What will we tell the public, deals with cigarette smoking advertising by Australian magazines. The nine publications surveyed were the Women's Weekly, Cleo, Cosmopolitan, Family Circle, People, Women's Day, New Idea, Playboy and Penthouse. Two publications which are not advertisers of cigarettes-that is, Reader's Digest and Dolly-were surveyed. The survey found that of the 11 magazines five did not run feature articles on smoking. In other words, they did not publish articles putting an opposing case. Of the 10 articles in the remaining magazines, only two articles could, in any circumstance, be classified as anti-smoking. The remaining eight articles out of the 10 were either `pro-smoking'-that is, either generally favourable to smoking and its proponents-or `not anti-smoking', that is, non-committal, neutral or equivocal. Reader's Digest, on the other hand, which does not take cigarette advertising, ran five articles during the same period advertising the dangers of smoking. I think this certainly puts this publication in the category of the most responsible of the magazines. </PARA>
<PARA> I am worried because the vast bulk of this material is, in fact, in women's magazines. I think it is not beyond the wit of anybody to work out that the increase in smoking and, in fact, the increase in the consumption of alcohol by young women might be traced to the influence of these magazines and the way they tend to present information as distinct from the way they present their advertising. The report concluded:</PARA>
<PARA>Australian readers of magazines, young and old, deserve to be given the full information on this clear and present danger of cigarette smoking, but under current conditions they are likely to receive very little . . . The challenge for Australian magazines, particularly women's magazines, is to face up to this issue conscientiously. If they can find a way of giving due attention to the health aspects of cigarette smoking, they can have a major impact on the well-being and survival of millions of Australians. </PARA>
<PARA>I believe that if those magazines wish to be held to be responsible, they ought to be involved in this vital campaign. We have to do all that we can in terms of this pernicious drug, tobacco, which has dramatic and terrible effects on our society every year. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to give to the Senate a brief report on the recent Inter-Parliamentary Union (IPU) delegation to Budapest, of which I was a member. That delegation was led by Mr Tom Uren. The deputy leader was Mr Roger Shipton and the other members were Steve Dubois, Michael Cobb and Senator Walters. The IPU visit to Budapest was interesting enough in itself, particularly for a person like me who had not been to eastern Europe before. On some other occasion I will say something about my impressions of my visit to eastern Europe, to the changes that I think are occurring in Hungary and to the palpable nature of those changes. Even a visitor like me could hardly fail to notice at least some emerging optimism for the future of that country by its people. I suppose that was best evidenced by a demonstration on the 15 March, a very important day for Hungarian people. It was reported in the newspapers that over 500,000 Hungarians marched and demonstrated on that day for the changes I think that they would like to see happening in Hungary. I also had the opportunity to visit Prague and I will say a few words about that shortly. Again, I would like to compare and contrast the impressions that I got from visiting Hungary and Czechoslovakia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In particular I want to thank those people who assisted the delegation. We were ably assisted by Mr Fred Peppinck from the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade; Mr Rob Diamond from the Senate, who was Secretary to the delegation; and Mr Russell Howard who came from the Australian Embassy in Vienna to provide assistance. As well as that we were assisted by Mr Townsend, our Ambassador in Hungary. I also enjoyed the assistance of our ambassadorial people in both Prague and Vienna. </PARA>
<PARA> On the Sunday before the conference started I was able to attend the meeting of the IPU women. Women are now turning up to the IPU conference in ever increasing numbers and it was interesting to hear the history of the emergence of an informal women's committee that is associated with the IPU. I cannot tell the Senate how many women were delegates to the IPU, but some 60 or so attended the meeting on that Sunday. I think there is the prospect of considerable interest in issues of particular concern to women and of the women's perspective on all issues being debated at the IPU. I would say, though, that it is very rare for the same delegates from countries to attend different IPU meetings. So the IPU and delegates have to contend with the challenge of dealing with a lack of continuity. </PARA>
<PARA> I had the opportunity to speak at the conference on item 5 entitled `The protection of the rights of children'. I want to take the opportunity to read my speech today into the Senate. Dying children seem not to be the same worry as pollution of the air, water and land and other questions of the environment or the recent worldwide interest in protecting our ozone layer. Is this because dead children are bio-degradable and if not renewable, at least easily replaced? For many years now international forums like the League of Nations, the United Nations, the IPU and others, have addressed the rights of the child. Thousands of words have been written and many resolutions passed, yet children throughout the world still starve to death each year, sleep with no coverings or shelter, have no education, cannot read or write, suffer awful ill-health, disease and deformity and have a limited life expectancy and very limited opportunity. While clearly the facts and figures vary from country to country, no-one and no one country can take comfort in his or her own country's record. There is room for improvement across the world in all countries. </PARA>
<PARA> In my own country, Australia, the infant mortality and the under-five child mortality rate is very low but these figures mask the Aboriginal figures which are quite unacceptably high. Recent figures show that Aboriginal babies were five times more likely to die at birth than non-Aboriginal Australians. To its credit, Australia not only recognises the problem-it acknowledges it and is addressing it. A recent government document Women's Work reports the extensive consultation by and with Aboriginal women around Australia and includes recommendations for addressing not only children's health but also women's health so necessary for children's health. As well our Prime Minister, Mr Bob Hawke, has set as a goal for Australia the challenge that no child shall live in poverty by 1990 and we have committed dollars and programs to that goal. Each year in our world 500,000 women die from childbirth and related maternal causes. Each year in our world over 13 million children under five die of starvation and easily preventable causes. Nothing exotic kills them, simply appalling priorities of governments that spend hugely on arms and minutely on food supplies, food production and basic health care and education. </PARA>
<PARA> Page 18 of the recent United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) publication, The State of the World's Children, contains a chart showing that the developing world spends approximately 30 per cent more on the military than on health and education combined and that recent cuts in spending have fallen more heavily on health and education than on the military. The source for that is from the World Development report 1988, World Bank, Washington D.C. </PARA>
<PARA> The deaths of 500,000 women each year is not only an appalling loss of human life; it also leaves over one million children motherless. I do not believe that we can go on ignoring or disregarding such horrific statistics, reflecting as they do such human misery, pain and loss; nor can we salve our consciences or justify our concern by updating the statistics each year. This data is a measure of our failure to this point and our appalling priorities but it is also the base and the basis for future action. When we add these figures to the latest estimate of the numbers of people who are absolutely poor, now totalling over one billion men, women and children, that future action is huge, daunting and imperative. </PARA>
<PARA> However, the changing arms build-up and some lessening of regional tensions may make possible the transfer of dollars from arms to assistance. The following statement is made at page 69 of the UNICEF 1989 report:</PARA>
<PARA> The transfer of only 5 per cent of today's total military spending of over one trillion dollars a year by developing in industrialised countries could release the 50 billion dollars a year that would be enough to overcome the worst aspects of absolute poverty on this planet by the year 2000. </PARA>
<PARA>Further, the World Bank President, Barber Conable, said in September 1988:</PARA>
<PARA> Poverty on today's scale prevents a billion people from having even having minimally acceptable standards of living. to allow every fifth human being on our planet to suffer such an existence is a moral outrage. It is more: it is bad economics, a terrible waste of previous development resources.. </PARA>
<PARA>Now that there is a clear understanding of the dollar costs of this poverty and death, perhaps we can hope for action. </PARA>
<PARA> I said at the outset that many words have been written and many proper attitudes expressed. None of them has fed the starving. No longer can we afford the comfort and complacency of correct moral attitudes. I challenge every country here present to return to the eighty-second IPU conference in London later this year with the hard evidence of budgetary commitments to health and education for our children, preferably by taking from defence budgets. Let us return in this centenary year of the IPU with the news that commitment to our children is in dollars, not words. We do not have to wait for the adoption of the draft convention by the United Nations General Assembly; we can begin by anticipating it. </PARA>
<PARA> Another important, indeed vital, way that this problem of absolute poverty can be addressed is to involve women in the process. At every stage-at the local level, district and state levels, country and international forums-women must be heard. They have a particular need and a special contribution to make towards the solution. Often they are not able to contribute because of insufficient education or opportunity, often because of persistent and pervasive sexism and discrimination. In turning our attention to children, let us not use this as an excuse to forget or ignore the continuing struggle for women and women's rights. And let us acknowledge that much of the suffering and injustice experienced by our children is directly due to the suffering and injustice experienced by our women, closed out of any real opportunities to contribute to their communities or manage their own lives. </PARA>
<PARA> I am impressed by world action that has been mobilised so quickly along with the huge commitment of dollars to combat the acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS). The same mobilisation of a worldwide campaign, backed by adequate funds from both domestic budgets of member states, especially defence budgets, and aid allocations, to reduce maternal mortality, would have a dramatic effect not only on women but also on the world's children. It would lend substance to our recommendations. Some say we must hasten slowly but we were not slow to respond to the AIDS problem. I want to know that our commitment to the weak and the poor and hungry at least matches our commitment to the rich and the powerful. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to raise one point about the rights of children in the United Nations (UN) draft convention. Article 4, headed `Non discrimination', refers to the state's obligation to protect children from any form of discrimination. The obligation of the states in this matter should cover all concerns about discrimination as it affects children. However, I am concerned that still in this world being born a girl is often a serious disadvantage. I know of no justifiable reason to support any discrimination against our girls, where they be denied food, or even given less; where they are not able to expect an education at all or a comparable education; where they cannot expect to read or to grow up and to vote; and where they can expect to work harder at a younger age and for less pay or none. If article 4 addresses protection from these and all other discrimination for our daughters-our girls-then my concern is needless. If not, then it will need amendment to address discrimination within the family or within a culture. </PARA>
<PARA> I acknowledge the efforts over the years of men and women who have fought for these same issues against far greater odds and hardships, whether of distance, ignorance or lack of support and finance. In urging a new focus on an immediate world campaign for women and children I believe we can solve the problem and provide a memorial for those who have battled before us. </PARA>
<PARA> That was the contribution I would have made if I had had sufficient time. I made most of it at the IPU but the IPU is fraught with the challenge of many speakers and a very tight time constraint. </PARA>
<PARA> I wish to make a few points in my closing remarks about the opportunity I had to visit Prague and meet there a very splendid man, Father Vaclav Maly. He is a human rights worker and I benefited very much from meeting with him and talking with him over about four hours about the challenge of human rights facing Czechoslovakian people. Indeed I raised yesterday in the Senate the name of a person he brought to my attention, and I hope that that person, and all those others currently languishing in gaol, still many of them without trial, can be summarily dealt with in Czechoslovakia. As I said earlier, though, my impression of Czechoslovakia was that one would not have the same optimism as one might have about Hungary, and I think that was reflected somewhat in the people that I saw and met in Prague. </PARA>
<PARA> I did want to mention Father Maly. I think he is one of those countless people around the world who could be called unsung heroes or heroines. He has already done time in gaol in defence of human rights and I would be concerned if my mentioning his name in this Parliament should in any way be held to account against him or further disadvantage his campaign for human rights, along with the campaign of all those other people who are championing the cause of human rights in Czechoslovakia. I made the point to him that in some ways, though, he is lucky; his issue is very clear. Human rights in Czechoslovakia is a black and white issue. </PARA>
<PARA> I appreciate that many people in this country have their own struggle for human rights. I am referring to the domestic violence problem in this country. In April we have a campaign against domestic violence in this country, and I hope as a result of our campaign against domestic violence we will see a different focus on the rights of women in this country. In some ways, women who live in a domestically violent situation have their own struggle for human rights. They live, if you like, in a gaol; they may not speak freely; they do not have access to the same opportunities of income or education; they are not unlike the victims of the infringement of human rights in Czechoslovakia. But because they are living in a so-called free society their human rights are often missed or overlooked. It is sometimes said that a man's home is his castle and that of course he is free to do what he likes within the castle. I think one of the challenges for our society, particularly associated with the campaign against domestic violence, is the taking of the civil liberties and human rights arguments inside the walls of the castle. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In the remaining minutes I would like to draw the Senate's attention to a matter which I raised at a press conference on Monday in the context of banking. On Monday, I alerted the public and, therefore, the Senate informally or indirectly to the fact that there have been opinions of senior lawyers, respected QCs and others, that there are anomalies within the taxation practices of banks whereby they are in fact in breach of the Income Tax Assessment Act by collecting withholding tax in relation to some foreign currency borrowings that are backed by mortgages. I was alerted by senior lawyers to this illegality which is being practised by some banks. They attended the press conference with me. We, in fact, presented the proposition publicly and I will seek leave shortly to table, for the perusal of the Senate, legal opinion to the effect that some banks are acting illegally within the Income Tax Assessment Act. I will simply explain what is occurring.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Honourable senators will be aware that between 1984 and 1985 approximately 1,500 Australians borrowed foreign currency and, as a result, with the movement of the exchange rates against them, they incurred great financial loss. Many of them have subsequently become bankrupt. This was known as the foreign currency loans or the Swiss bank fiasco and is acknowledged by banks themselves as having been an extremely unfortunate development on the banking scene. In that process of obtaining foreign currency loans, many of the loans were secured by mortgage. I am advised by legal advisers that somewhere in the vicinity of 90 per cent of such loans were secured by mortgage. </PARA>
<PARA> The minimum loan that was normally advanced by banks who were acting as agents for the foreign lenders was in the order of half a million dollars. Because the loans were being made by overseas agencies, usually Swiss banks, and because they were being made through Australian banks, who were acting as their agents, to Australians, who were the borrowers, those loans incurred withholding tax in the order of 10 per cent. Those taxes were paid, so there was no question of taxes being avoided-the taxes were in fact paid by the banks as the agents of the foreign lenders-but almost all banks passed that withholding tax on to the borrower. The legal advice I have, and it is from eminent Queen's Counsel, is that is prohibited under section 261 (1) of the Income Tax Assessment Act in the case where those loans are secured by mortgage. </PARA>
<PARA> The proposition that has been advanced to me by the Queen's Counsel who has advised me in this matter is that those taxes will have to be repaid to the borrowers. The taxes will not be collected back from the Department of Taxation because they are legitimate taxes. It was the passing on that was illegal and it will now be the responsibility of the banks to reimburse those payments to the borrowers. That is the legal opinion that has been offered to me. That is a very complex and very complicated development in this process. If we do the sums they are quite extraordinary. If we take a borrower who borrowed the minimum sum of half a million dollars and paid the overseas lenders the average interest of 6 per cent, which was the going rate, and who then paid 10 per cent of that in withholding tax. We are talking about their having paid to the bank $32,000 that they should not have paid and which they should now be entitled to receive back. </PARA>
<PARA> The majority of those people are now bankrupt. Many of them have been sold out by the banks because of the circumstances into which they were drawn. They are people to whom $32,000-I do not say that $32,000 is not a significant sum to almost anybody-is particularly significant. So we have a potentially very complicated situation on our hands. It is complicated because of, it is argued to me at least, the breach of the Income Tax Assessment Act. </PARA>
<PARA> Some borrowings were in the order of millions, and I know of one borrowing that was $14m. We are therefore looking at withholding tax on that loan, of 28 times $32,000. I have not done that sum but it is a very substantial sum of money. When we consider that 1,500 people made such borrowings, we see that banks have in fact collected and passed onto the Australian Taxation Office, which should have received it, withholding tax possibly in the order of hundreds of millions of dollars. Those hundreds of millions of dollars should in fact be passed back to borrowers who should not have been required to pay it. </PARA>
<PARA> I am simply alerting the Senate to the fact that legal counsel, eminent Queen's Counsel, has drawn my attention-I in turn am now drawing the Senate's attention-to the fact that this set of circumstances exists. It has been disputed by the Australian Bankers Association which has a separate body of legal opinion which says that this was all legal. But that will probably now have to be resolved in a court of law and the courts will have to determine which of these two interpretations prevails. Yet again, and I will be doing this on a regular basis, I will continue to build what I believe is an irrefutable case for there to be eventually some form of public inquiry into not only the specific aspects of banking which I have cited over a period of five consecutive weeks but also into numerous other aspects of banking. </PARA>
<PARA> As was pointed out in the debate that occurred here yesterday, there has been no inquiry into banking in this country since 1935 and yet we have had profound developments which necessitate such a requirement. I have cited only two of them on previous occasions. Since the deregulation of banking in 1985 onwards, there have been extraordinary changes in the ethos of banking in this country. Of course, there have been dramatic increases in the levels of personal indebtedness. Some authorities say that personal indebtedness has increased sevenfold in the last decade. We all know that we are all in debt-there are very few people who are not in debt up to their necks. Most of us incur some degree of substantial indebtedness regularly. In the case of many families, that indebtedness is in excess of $100,000 which renders them extremely vulnerable because debt means vulnerability and vulnerability means opportunity for sharp operators. Whether those sharp operators are corrupt bank officers or corrupt officers within finance companies is beside the point. The generalisation still stands that most Australians are vulnerable because of indebtedness and that vulnerability presents opportunity to ruthless operators. </PARA>
<PARA> The proposition I have been advancing to the Senate and which was denied yesterday-unwisely I believe-by the Government, with the support of the Opposition, is that this problem has reached crisis proportions and warrants a major public inquiry. Today I wish to table further evidence of that. I therefore seek the leave of the Senate to table six affidavits in relation to the matters of Patricia Poulos v. Elders Pacific Ltd; Barbara Hunt v. Westpac; Adrian William Batten v. the Commonwealth Bank; Dr Terry Gavagan v. the Commonwealth Bank; Mr David Wallander v. Westpac and Edward Bride v. Elders and the Australian Bank Ltd. When I say `versus', these cases are not all in courts, some of them have not been to court; I am simply saying that there is a point of dispute between the parties named and that these are sworn affidavits in relation to those disputes. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to take the opportunity afforded by this debate on matters of public interest to refer to certain issues in the pharmaceutical benefits area. Increasingly, we are finding interference by the bureaucracy in the prescribing of medication by a doctor for a patient. At the same time we are also seeing the withdrawal of certain medication and its replacement with substitutes. This is causing a lot of concern to patients, particularly the elderly. They become stabilised on certain drugs and prescriptions and become used to the size, colour and shape of pills. I wonder what has happened to the previous bipartisan policy on prescription medication.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Over the past year in particular, especially since the establishment of the super Department of Community Services and Health, we have seen an increasing socialisation of medicine, particularly prescription medication. I, for one, have had numerous letters, visits and telephone calls from people who have for long periods received medication under the pharmaceutical benefits scheme (PBS) and who now have to be told that, due to the deliberate policy of the Hawke Labor Government, certain drugs have been removed from the PBS scheme. Dr Blewett and his Minister responsible for the scheme, Mr Staples, have repeatedly said-and quite erroneously-that no medication has been removed from availability; only brand names have been restricted. This is not the case as in several cases similar but not identical drugs have been removed from the PBS and only one drug for that complaint has been retained. </PARA>
<PARA> Recently, my colleague, Senator Reid, asked in this chamber whether or not people develop a psychological dependence on a brand name, apart from the physiological reliance on the drug itself. Senator Cook, the Minister who replied, gave this question a cursory dismissal. Perhaps Senator Cook's office has not been swamped, as have the offices of other honourable senators, with distressed people who have been taking a particular drug for sometimes up to 30 or 40 years, only to find that it is now not currently available. Elderly people, in particular, have become very concerned when drug A, which they have been taking twice daily for many years and which they know is a little round white tablet, suddenly becomes drug B which is orange and, say, diamond-shaped. </PARA>
<PARA> Although five years on, George Orwell's book 1984 seems to be the manual used by the Federal Government in relation to health policy. What we are witnessing at the present time is an insidious restriction on the confidentiality of the patient-doctor-pharmacist relationship. It is not for Dr Blewett, Mr Staples or anyone in the Commonwealth bureaucracy to decide which medication suits a particular individual. This must solely be the responsibility of the particular patient's doctor. Each person is different in physical, psychological and physiological characteristics and the short-sighted restriction on the PBS schedule does not take into account this individuality. I think it is appropriate in the light of the growing and very strongly justified concern in the community that these grave concerns be raised in this debate and in this chamber here today. </PARA>
<PARA> Tasmanian pharmacists recently held a strike-the first ever in the history of the profession-and every chemist shop in the State, except I think four, closed to deliver a very strong protest message to Dr Blewett and to Mr Staples. I strongly implore the Government to heed the thousands of pharmacists and doctors, and the millions of Australians who are dependent on regular medication and restore the removed drugs to the PBS list. </PARA>
<PARA> Pharmacists have another cause for concern. This Government encouraged pharmacists around Australia to move into expensive computer networks in order to raise their productivity. There is nothing wrong with that; it is something that we all endorse. This challenge was taken up by the pharmacists themselves. But we now find that they have been penalised by this Government, by the tribunal, with a reduction in their national health scheme (NHS) fee. This reduction is quite contrary to the philosophy in the second-tier wage negotiations which were supposed to reward productivity gains. I ask the question: why has a segment of Australian society, the pharmaceutical chemists, been singled out for special treatment-not for an increase but actually for a reduction in their fee? This is quite a discriminatory act by the Government on a segment of society that performs a valuable service. I deplore the action of the Government on two scores-the removal of certain prescribed drugs from the list and its reduction of the NHS fee. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am unable to say whether an officer of the Attorney-General's Department was involved in briefing Mr Friedrich in relation to the matters canvassed in Senator Newman's question which, I take it, basically concerns counter-terrorism measures. The fact is that the document which the Opposition alleges was found in the possession of the former Director of the National Safety Council of Australia (NSCA) appears to be part of a report prepared by Mr Holdich, the Deputy Secretary to the Department of the Special Minister of State, of a review of counter-terrorism activities in Australia. Senators will know that Mr Mick Young, who was then Special Minister of State, on 17 October made a ministerial statement in the Parliament in which he gave an extensive summary of the contents of that report. Indeed, quite fortuitously, in answer to a question from Senator Archer earlier this week, I drew on the recommendations of that report in regard to uniform policing at airports. If that report, which was allegedly found on the desk of the former Director of the NSCA, is the report to which Senator Newman is referring or has in mind and is of that status, it was not a classified operational manual, but a report relating to the structure and a review of counter-terrorist capabilities in Australia. Those arrangements were reviewed and certain recommendations were made.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That is the only document I know of which might in any way fill the description indicated in Senator Newman's question. I have no reason to believe that that particular document was made available to Mr Friedrich from an officer of the Attorney-General's Department. Clearly, I am unable to know how that document came to be on Mr Friedrich's desk at this time. The document was widely circulated and I think that it has already been indicated that it was made available to many Commonwealth and State agencies which had a need to know about its findings.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4F4">Senator BUTTON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The export performance under the car plan is not particularly good, but it is a lot better than it used to be. I welcome the announcement in Adelaide by Mitsubishi about its export contracts for automotive components to Japan which are projected to be worth $14m a year. That development is of importance to South Australia and Senator Foreman takes a keen interest in the industrial welfare of the State from which he comes. South Australia has established a significant automotive manufacturing base with two car manufacturing plants and a number of major export oriented automotive component producers. The new Mitsubishi component contract involved the creation of some 70 new jobs and an investment of $2.5m. The Magna plant has a stated aim of achieving export of $100m by 1992. That is consistent with the objectives of the passenger motor vehicle plan.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I would make the point that automotive exports by the industry have doubled since the plan was introduced in 1985. This success is expected to continue with projected exports of $1.2 billion by 1992-I add that those are the industry projections, not mine. The importance of these exports is that they are evidence that the industry is adopting a more refreshing approach to pursuing export markets. This is helping the structural change process within the industry.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="UI4">Senator ROBERT RAY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think that rather than 6 March I would have taken 3 March as the date when I expressed my view in this chamber, and I expected as of that moment that that should be the cut-off point. That was not necessarily translated into action, but I take that as the cut-off point when I answered a question in this chamber-not 6 March. It means that any fee collected between 3 March and 7 March will be refunded on my direction. I believe that the moment one makes a public announcement on these things one intends them to come in from that moment. It reinforces Senator Short's point a little further-it is not just from 6 to 7 March but it will be from 3 March.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator Short said that the Opposition had warned the Government. There is, of course, a difference between statutory fees and administrative fees, and that is where the distinction is. There was not a view in my Department, nor by me as Minister, that these fees were illegal in any sense, until I received correspondence from the Attorney- General on 12 December-correspondence that I initiated on 24 October. I remind Senator Short that we had a legal opinion from Michael Black, QC-certainly no dummy if he is on the short list any time High Court appointments are in the air-that argued that the fee was legal. Other legal opinions were sought later.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have made no such decision. At no stage have I ever stated that the fee is unlawful. People have quoted me to that effect, inaccurately. The most substantive next piece of legal opinion came between the time that I wrote to the Attorney-General and before the Attorney-General wrote back to me. So I do not believe that my attitude or that of my Department was unreasonable at any stage up until 12 December, when we were entitled to believe that the legal opinion by Michael Black, QC, was sustainable. Probably the key argument thereafter is: What is our view from 12 December onwards? That is something I will be discussing in just on an hour's time with the Ombudsman. So I will not canvass that matter further here.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Generally, I might point out also the positive side of the review fee; it is not all negative. The time for review has been reduced from an average of 12 months to five months. The massive backlog has been reduced. In summary, in answer to the three parts of the honourable senator's question, no, in that period up until 12 December we did not have the opinion that the fee was illegal. Secondly, anyone who paid the fee between 3 March and 7 March certainly will have it refunded, because I regard my public announcement as the cut-off point. In respect of any other matters relating to that, I will obviously be making some public pronouncement after having discussed the matter with the Ombudsman today.</PARA>

That twilight zone-the time from 3 March until the regulations come into effect, which will not be longer than a week away; it could be shorter because I have already signed them and they await only Executive Council approval-will not be taken into account.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am aware of the Science Show report. The submarine referred to is I-124, which I think as far back as 1977 was declared a historic wreck under the Historic Shipwrecks Act. It is a Japanese war grave and has been respected as such by the Australian Government. However, the question of mercury in the ballast is another matter. As yet we have been unable to ascertain all of the facts. I cannot confirm that mercury has been used as ballast in that submarine.

I refer to the problem of excessive dependence on highly bleached paper, including by the Government, and the environmental consequences of chlorine discharge in the course of its manufacture. Does he agree that not all the paper we use needs to be whiter than white? Do manufacturers in Australia produce unbleached paper of suitable quality for general office use? Could it be made in sufficient quantity if the demand for it was created? Is recycled paper a feasible alternative for some of the Commonwealth's paper requirements? Finally, will the Minister discuss with the Minister for Administrative Services, in the interests of environmental safety, whether the Commonwealth, with its major purchasing power, could set an example by substituting at least some of its orders with ones for paper made by methods which are less polluting?</PARA></TALK.START>

I do not think it is a matter that the Government has yet concentrated on to the degree that Senator Coates would like. But as he has drawn it to my attention, I will certainly pass it on to the Minister for Administrative Services to get a full response. It is possible, as we already know, to substitute a whole variety of paper to get the unbleached results. These days toilet paper is unbleached. It is something we will have to look at seriously. I would have thought that, from a cost perspective, in the long term it would be a lot cheaper to use unbleached rather than bleached paper. It follows the old conundrum, as honourable senators know. Conservationists write to me about the misuse of various processes and another thousand trees have to be chopped down for them to do so. In this case I hope that will not be the case and that we can expedite this matter without a lot of correspondence. I will certainly draw all of this to the attention of the Minister for Administrative Services.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am aware of the sort of criticism to which Senator Giles has referred. The publication of the December quarter national accounts this week did show very strong growth in private domestic demand in the second half of 1988, which has led to some commentators, with the benefit of perfect hindsight, arguing that the Government should have moved to tighten monetary policy much earlier than the autumn of last year.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I want to make three points about that. Firstly, hindsight is always the most valuable analytic tool in economics. The Government recognised earlier than most other governments that the stock market crash had not sparked off a major international recession, and therefore tightened monetary policy in the autumn of 1988 rather than the spring of 1988, as most other governments did. To argue that we should have done it earlier, I repeat, relies entirely on the wisdom of hindsight. On Tuesday morning of this week on the local Australian Broadcasting Corporation program John Howard was asked this question:</PARA>
<PARA>But isn't the real problem that everybody predicted, post the stock market crash, that growth wouldn't be as high as it is-the real problem is that we under-estimated growth?</PARA>
<PARA>Mr Howard did not give a straight answer to that question. But I can, however, refer to one fairly well-known economic and political commentator who wrote this on 28 October 1987, with his usual convictions or implicit assertions of infallibility:</PARA>
<PARA> It is true that the detailed consequences of recent events cannot yet be fully foreseen. Their general consequences, however, already are perfectly plain: 1988 now will see a world recession . . .</PARA>

Is the Minister aware of the formation of the Hill River Power Development Co. by CRA Ltd and Barrack House Resources for the purpose of building a private coal fired power station? Is he also aware that the two companies involved have formed a special promotion unit to procure the necessary market for such a venture? Is the Minister aware that the coal fired power station proposal is based on mining coal from the Hill River area, better known by the Australian Academy of Science and the Western Australian Environmental Protection Authority as the proposed Mount Lesueur National Park, because it is the prime conservation area for terrestrial fauna of the northern sandplains? Can the Minister assure the chamber that this proposal, which poses major costs to conservation values in Western Australia, and the greenhouse effect in general, will be given high priority for examination by the National Energy Consultative Council? Finally, can the Minister assure the chamber that details of the process and the results of such an examination will be made available to conservation groups in Western Australia?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RF4">Senator COOK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am pleased to see that the honourable senator follows the National Energy Consultative Council report. It is true that, at its first meeting last year, we spent a long session on the greenhouse effect and, as a consequence, published a discussion paper on that subject, which I am happy to supply to the honourable senator. The Council undertook, through the States, to compile an inventory of measures being taken at State level to combat the greenhouse effect.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I am aware, not by official advice but through general publicity, that CRA proposes to develop a new coal fired power station in Western Australia as a private enterprise operation, and I understand that the State Energy Commission of Western Australia is open to such a development-it has not ruled the development out; in fact, it may have even encouraged it-and it proposes to do so to meet a rising demand for power in the State of Western Australia. As I recall, CRA is proposing a feasibility study which will include an examination of techniques of mining, of coal burning, of coal fired generation, a sociological and economic impact statement, an environmental impact statement and, I think, a regional study on the local economy as well. Those steps have been announced as steps to be taken in the lead-up to forming the final proposal. Again, that is not official advice; that is as I read my briefs on the matter.</PARA>
<PARA> In relation to the general comment the honourable senator has made about whether we will intervene in terms of the specific regional Mount Lesueur National Park, I have to say that yesterday in answer to a question from Senator Dunn I tried to make a distinction between Commonwealth and State powers on these things. There is a broader view that the Commonwealth has absolute powers. The Constitution suggests a contrary view. We do not. This type of operation is entirely State based and is not something over which the Commonwealth has any powers; therefore it is not for us to intervene and interfere with the States' obligations on that subject.</PARA>
<PARA> The final two questions asked whether we would take the matter up on the National Energy Consultative Council. I do not think it is appropriate to do so because it is entirely a State matter. The National Energy Consultative Council, as its name implies, is a body that looks at national energy policy. The States are represented on the Council but I think that the day the States all vote together that the Commonwealth shall take an interest in a peculiarly and uniquely State operation will be the day that Parliament House is clouded over as a squadron of pigs flies past.</PARA>

I wonder whether, in the event of CRA and Barrack House Resources getting to the stage of building their coal fired power station, the matter will come back to the Minister's attention as a Federal matter if export licences are requested. Would it not be fair to these companies now to signal, in line with the Government's often stated policy to take into account possible problems in relation to the greenhouse effect, that such export licences would not in future be granted? Do I also take it that it is up to the State Ministers who are part of the National Energy Consultative Council to bring this forward to that Council on a State basis?</PARA></TALK.START>

We do not export energy in that sense-unless it is argued that aluminium is frozen energy, but that is a different matter entirely. If the companies concerned were to export coal, obviously they would wish to apply for a coal export licence. In that case the matter would properly come before my colleague Mr Kerin for approval. The NECC is not a State ministerial representative body; it is a State departmental or operational representative body. As I say, I do not believe State Ministers would in any way approve of the Council dealing with a specific State matter, and I do not think it is appropriate that I initiate that either.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The final question refers to the greenhouse effect. I think it is drawing a long bow indeed to identify what is a prospective development as influencing the greenhouse effect when, as I have said in this chamber and elsewhere, the CO2 is only half the total number of greenhouse gases and the amount of CO2 contributed by coal fired power generation is a much smaller component of that and is not the main offender. It is drawing a long bow to focus all of that down on a specific project in Western Australia.</PARA>

I think perhaps the most successful example of that would be the Williamstown Naval Dockyard, but there are others.

That Bill will propose deregulating the domestic marketing arrangements for wheat in Australia. It will terminate the compulsory acquisition of crops and the administration of pricing arrangements. We believe it will create a more competitive domestic market. It will cause more market efficiencies and will ensure that returns to growers more accurately reflect the value of their product. As far as the international wheat market is concerned, we will not be removing the monopoly from the Australian Wheat Board (AWB) on milling and industrial wheat. That will be left intact, although feed wheat, which is internationally a different market, will be deregulated.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Bill will provide a strengthening of the commercial capabilities of the Australian Wheat Board by allowing it to buy wheat for cash to trade in other grains and to operate more flexible pooling and payment arrangements. It will continue AWB control of exports of milling and industrial wheat. It will provide changes to the structure of the Board membership to assist its commercial competitiveness. There will be a Government guarantee on borrowings to fund initial advances for wheat being marketed through the Board's pooling operation to begin at 90 per cent of expected annual returns, phasing down to 80 per cent of expected annual returns over five years. There will be a Government guarantee of $100m to help finance the Board's commercial activity, the guarantee to be dependent on the industry introducing a levy to establish a wheat industry fund to help finance the Board's commercial activities.</PARA>
<PARA> I hope the Australian Democrats find it in their souls to support the Government on this matter. One of the positive arguments the Democrats have put forward in this debate has been to espouse the concerns of organic wheat growers.

That strategy, as developed by the Inter-State Commission, will be published very shortly. It will then be a matter, of course, for the relevant interested parties-business, trade unions and the Government itself-to consider in detail the strategy there outlined and to respond to it. I am not going to jump the gun on that, except to say that I think the elements of a solution are quite possibly at hand with this long awaited strategy. Certainly we will be making every endeavour to put in place reform of the waterfront which will make it impossible in the future to draw attention to the sorts of issues that Senator Panizza has been able to draw attention to today.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade. In view of the announcement by the Vietnamese Government that it will withdraw all its troops from Kampuchea by September 1989, will the Government restore bilateral aid to Vietnam from September 1989, will the Australian Government establish some form of representation in Kampuchea from September 1989 and will the Australian Government respond favourably to any request to provide observers and/or a peacekeeping force to assist in the establishment of a united and peaceful Kampuchea?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator GARETH EVANS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Government certainly welcomes the announcement yesterday that Vietnamese troops would be withdrawn from Cambodia by September 1989. We have consistently called for the withdrawal of all Vietnamese troops from that country as a necessary precondition for any settlement of the Cambodian problem, and we certainly hope that that withdrawal will be completed within the stated time frame. Of course, the announcement adds urgency to other aspects of the Cambodian problem, including the cessation of military assistance to the various Khmer factions. During my visit to east Asia earlier this year, I was assured that once all Vietnamese forces had been withdrawn from Cambodia military assistance to the factions would cease. I hope and expect that that will occur, not least because the statement makes clear that a Vietnamese return to Cambodia cannot be ruled out if that cessation of external support to the other factions does not occur.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The announcement also underlines the importance of agreement among the factions for a peaceful and durable internal settlement. In this respect, the Australian Government welcomes the apparent agreement between Prince Sihanouk and the People's Republic of Kampuchea's Prime Minister Hun Sen to meet again. I also understand that the four factions are expected to meet in Paris later this month. We all hope that significant progress can be achieved at these meetings.</PARA>
<PARA> The proposal to reactivate the 1954 International Control Commission, augmented by Indonesia as chairman of the Jakarta Informal Meeting or JIM process and a personal representative of the United Nations, is new. Australia welcomes this as a possible step towards finding a suitable international control mechanism to oversee the withdrawal of Vietnamese troops and prevent outside interference in Cambodian affairs. Whether the 1954 ICC model will prove to be the most satisfactory one for such a mechanism remains to be seen. One is entitled to be somewhat sceptical. The 1954 mechanism is not the most successful international exercise in averting violence that the world has seen. Nonetheless, it does provide a foundation on which further institutional arrangements could perhaps be developed. In that respect, Australia stands ready, as the Prime Minister and I have made clear on a number of occasions, to consider any requests that might be made for us to participate in some appropriate control mechanism.</PARA>
<PARA> As to the question of aid, once the terms of an overall settlement were agreed, I could certainly foresee a need for a coordinated international effort to provide reconstruction assistance to Cambodia. Australia would play its part in any such effort. We already provide aid for humanitarian purposes to the Cambodian people through multilateral agencies and through Australian non-government organisations, both inside Cambodia and in civilian camps on the Thai-Cambodian border.</PARA>
<PARA> The question of aid to Vietnam was specifically adverted to in Senator Schacht's question. The situation there is that, because of Vietnam's military occupation of Cambodia, bilateral assistance to Vietnam has been suspended since 1979, although some Australian aid is still delivered to Vietnam through multilateral agencies. We would certainly sympathetically consider the resumption of a program of bilateral aid when Vietnamese troops were withdrawn. A number of questions would need to be considered in that context, not only the question of the availability of money in our aid budget but also considerations, for example, as to whether Australian resumption of a full bilateral program might or might not compromise the achievement of an overall settlement if by that stage an overall settlement has not been accomplished. So those are matters that would have to be considered, but the withdrawal of Vietnamese troops would certainly trigger a reconsideration by Australia of its position on that subject.</PARA>
<PARA> The final question I was asked was about the diplomatic representation in Phnom Penh. That is a further issue which obviously arises in the context of the moves towards a settlement. Equally obviously, it is too soon today to define with any precision what would be the appropriate timing and level at which we should restore such representation. That very much depends on the character of the internal settlement that is reached, when it is reached, how and in what circumstances. All of those matters will be kept under close review.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;One could not imagine that. The sequence of demands made were either irrelevant, undeliverable or very expensive. The first demand is that the Opposition will support the legislation subject to progress being made in the deregulation in the transport handling, storage and waterfront areas. Most of those matters are under the control of a State government. The Commonwealth can deliver absolutely nothing on most of those matters. If Senator Boswell and Senator Stone are so keen on deregulation, why do they not get to work on the National Party Government in Queensland with its rail monopoly?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I was asked directly what was the likely cost of the Government caving in to the National Party's blackmail, to which the Liberal Party has already caved in. This cannot be assessed with any precision. But I can tell the Senate what the second demand for a 95 per cent underwriting would have cost in the 1986-87 wheat season, when the estimated returns on wheat were some $20 per tonne greater than the price which was ultimately likely to be realised. If those conditions were to be repeated the cost would be about $190m. That is the cost to the taxpayers if the Government were to cave in to the National Party's blackmail, to which the Liberal Party has already caved in.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yesterday I was asked a question by Senator Patterson in my capacity as Minister representing the Minister for Community Services and Health. I now have further details that I can give on that question asked by Senator Patterson. The answer to part one is yes. The answer to part two is yes.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The answer to part three is: the comprehensive fee to cover pre-natal and post-natal care and the delivery of the baby was introduced on medical advice that it was in the best interests of both mother and child. It was unanimously recommended by the Medicare Benefits Advisory Committee, two of whose five members were senior nominees of the Australian Medical Association (AMA), after extensive consultation with the Royal Australian College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists and the Federal AMA Coordinating Committee of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists.</PARA>
<PARA> The answer to part four is: this Government never interferes with the clinical judgments made by any medical practitioner. The `all-inclusive' fee recommended by the Committee is designed to remove the financial incentives for `inappropriate use of discretionary obstetric procedures'; in other words, for unnecessary birth intervention such as surgical induction or caesarean section. Thus it certainly is the intention of the Federal Government to promote good medical practice.</PARA>
<PARA> The answer to part five is: the new fee level was achieved by adding the average of all the additional fees to the new fee and did not result in any savings to the Government. The new fee is considered fair and reasonable, with more complicated deliveries being compensated for by the higher average fee for less complicated cases. The Government makes no apologies for acting on the best medical advice available to reduce unnecessary intervention in what, as far as possible, should be the natural process of childbirth. For obstetricians to charge patients above the schedule fee is totally unreasonable, given that obstetricians' gross Medicare only earnings have increased by 30 per cent, to an average of $220,000, since 1984-85. This is in a period when average wage earners have been expected to show economic restraint. Consumers are placed in a difficult position by the often outrageous charging practices of many obstetricians. To avoid being faced with substantial out of pocket expenses, consumers should discuss the cost of treatment with their doctor and shop around for a different doctor if they are not satisfied.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There would be little doubt around Australia that the collapse of the National Safety Council of Australia (NSCA) is a matter of considerable public importance. It is likely that many Australians would not have been aware of the significance of that organisation prior to its collapse over the recent dramatic weeks. But the collapse has been so dramatic and the ramifications of it so wide that I think it is fair to say that for the first time for a very long time there has been a substantial distraction from the economic woes of Australia and that, temporarily at least, people's attention was focused, not on our extraordinary and difficult international debt, not on the enormous economic risks facing us as a nation, but on what appears to be a massive series of failures on the part of governments and government agencies to find out what is going on and to understand what is happening in an organisation which is performing major functions in the Australian community.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="EF4">Senator CHANEY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is a point that I intend to make later. The Minister intervenes that it is the Victorian Division. That is an important intervention because, of course, the National Safety Council of Australia in other State divisions is principally concerned with the sort of work that the name implies-namely, the promotion of industrial and other safety. That work is continuing and it is work for which I have had high regard. Indeed, a few months ago at Harbour Lights Mining Ltd at Leonora, I presented a safety award to that mine, which had completed yet another year in absolute safety. That award was promoted by the National Safety Council. It is interesting that that positive side of its work, of course, received little or no publicity.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is a collapse which has extraordinary wide ramifications. For a start, it is a major commercial collapse. In Victoria, a major State institution, the State Bank of Victoria, is involved. It is described in early reports as the largest single creditor, with the Victorian Division of the Safety Council owing it $103m in loans. But the liabilities extend interstate. The State Bank of South Australia is reported to have a $30m debt at risk and was responsible for appointing receivers to the Council. The Elders Finance Group Ltd is believed to have an exposure of $15m to $20m. So very substantial public bodies have committed very large amounts of funds to this organisation. Substantial commercial questions arise as to how those loans came to be made to an organisation which, clearly now, did not have the commercial capacity to deal with them-not in some minor way; not in the course of some gradual reduction in its earning capacity; it would appear that at no stage did the National Safety Council Victorian Division have the capacity to service the sorts of loans which were provided. </PARA>
<PARA> We have seen the involvement of State instrumentalities. Questions have been raised about the operations of the corporate affairs authorities in Victoria. Allegations have been made about the adequacy or otherwise of the audits which were carried out. I heard a very spirited defence of the audit by the accountants involved, who made the point that they had issued successive warnings about the accounts of the organisation and that no action had been taken by the Board. That leads us to say that questions arise about the liabilities of the Board. These are issues which may well have legal ramifications and which I suspect would not be a proper subject for debate in the Senate or, indeed, in the House of Representatives. I make the point, because it is relevant to this debate, that a series of areas is involved in this collapse-areas which in our view require very careful examination. </PARA>
<PARA> There is wide public interest in the fact that this organisation is concerned with essential humanitarian services. Again, it perhaps comes as a surprise to many observers to find that in a very substantial part of Australia essential search and rescue operations have been dependent upon the contracted services of this organisation, the Victorian Division of the National Safety Council, and that widespread rescue operations have been dependent upon its successful operation. We find that there is a defence component. The Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) made one of his public relations trips to the north to visit Tindal. We are told that the operations at Tindal are in part dependent upon search and rescue facilities which are being provided by this same organisation. We find the involvement of security authorities at some point because complaints have been received. We find that the members of the organisation are able to move in and out of Australia under a special permit because of the humanitarian work that they do. Possible criminal charges are now involved, with the arrest of the missing principal. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not think one could quarrel that there has been the widest possible government involvement in this extraordinary organisation. When one looks at the spread of locations and functions, one finds that that is not surprising. We find that the organisation is engaged at Townsville in search and rescue, emergency medical evacuations, including in the South Pacific area, and in repatriation flights from Papua New Guinea. It is involved at Coolangatta in pilot training, a search and rescue base and medical evacuation operations. It is involved at Williamtown, Newcastle, in work with the Royal Australian Air Force and in search and rescue for post-assembly testing of the Black Hawk helicopter. It is involved in search and rescue training at Richmond, which is another Air Force base. It is involved in para-rescue; in Sydney, in the treatment of civilian and military personnel suffering from decompression problems. It is involved in the Illawarra and at West Sale with much the same list of functions, although it is also involved in those places with fire bombing, and it is involved in the servicing and manufacture of safety equipment. In the Latrobe Valley it is involved in search and rescue and aircraft maintenance; and so it goes on. It is involved in activities at Morwell, Welshpool, Melbourne, Benalla, Fiskville, Adelaide, Perth and Pearce in Western Australia, Darwin, Tindal, and so on. It is a most extraordinary national network of operations which is very much a matter of public interest.</PARA>
<PARA> In terms of Federal Government involvement, we really do not have any sort of exhaustive list of the extent to which the Commonwealth is involved, but we get some hint of the breadth of involvement from the Prime Minister's words yesterday when he said:</PARA>
<PARA>But I wrote on Monday to about seven or eight Ministers who could, in some way or another, through their departments or agencies for which they are responsible, have some connection with the NSC, and asked them to meet together and their Departments so that we can have a full understanding of what involvement there is at the national level with any of the operations of the NSC. </PARA>
<PARA>In other words, the Prime Minister has found it necessary to bring together seven or eight Ministers just to deal with Federal Government, and potential Federal Government, implications and involvement with this organisation. Again, if one wants an illustration of the depth as well as the breadth of Commonwealth concern and involvement, one need go no further than to look at what Ministers have said in the Senate when the matter was raised during Question Time on the first sitting day this week, Tuesday. Questions were asked by Senator Hill and Senator Short. Senator Hill raised with the Minister for Justice (Senator Tate) the involvement of the National Crime Authority and the Australian Federal Police (AFP). It is worth reading the answer from the Minister. I say to the Minister that on this occasion I quote him, not to chastise him for his answer, but merely to show that his answer discloses the substantial involvement of Commonwealth authorities for which he is responsible. In response to Senator Hill, a Liberal senator from South Australia, Senator Tate replied that a series of allegations and complaints had been made to Commonwealth authorities. He referred to the involvement of the Australian Federal Police. I quote:</PARA>
<PARA>Those sorts of allegations were taken extremely seriously by the intelligence division of the AFP over the period October 1987 to March 1988 but nothing was found to substantiate those particular allegations. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister says that he did not have his Australia Card. So we can see from the Minister's confusion that we need an inquiry. He is not quite sure what citizens are required to have. My main concern, and the point I wish to make, is that there are a great range of Commonwealth agencies which have already been involved. We can see that the seven or eight Ministers who were written to by the Prime Minister would presumably have included the Minister for Defence (Mr Beazley), the Attorney-General (Mr Lionel Bowen), the Minister for Justice, the Minister for Administrative Services (Mr West), the Minister for Transport and Communications (Mr Willis), probably the Minister for Community Services and Health (Dr Blewett), and who knows which others. At the State level there is the clear involvement of the State Attorney-General, the Treasury, the police, the health authorities and, again, probably others. The minimum facts that we face at the moment are that there have been very large commercial losses, essential services have been put at risk and there has been a failure to respond to alarms by both State and Federal governments when multiple agencies have had difficulties drawn to their attention. It is in those circumstances that the Opposition raises the need for the Government to appoint a royal commission, preferably in conjunction with the Government of Victoria, to inquire into these matters. We raise and assert this because we believe that it is the only effective means of unravelling the enormous problems which this collapse discloses. It is the only way that we are going to learn all the lessons that need to be learnt from it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We have already seen that the attempted activation of the Commonwealth Government's own agencies has been tried and has failed. The very people that the Prime Minister is now writing to have had these matters drawn to their attention and they have found nothing and, as a result, they have done nothing. We find that even Labor members of parliament are concerned at the capacity of any single agency, without an Australia-wide reach, getting to the bottom of this matter. We find, for example, that the Labor backbencher, Mr Peter Cleeland, who is Chairman of the parliamentary committee which oversees the National Crime Authority, tells the world that he is writing to Mr Lionel Bowen seeking an urgent meeting of the intergovernmental committee which refers operational cases to the NCA. What Mr Cleeland had to say is that the collapse had implications beyond Victoria, that the Victoria Police would have jurisdictional problems investigating its funding activities across State borders and that the NCA already had coercive powers and well-established experts capable of investigating the scam. They were Mr Cleeland's words, not mine. The key thing is that we are at present facing the prospect that there will be a series of individual, ad hoc inquiries into the involvement of individual agencies and departments in this matter when in truth what that almost guarantees is that each agency and department will seek to justify its position. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="EF4">Senator CHANEY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, they will pass the buck. It is of the nature of an inquiry of the sort which is being put in train by the Commonwealth Government that each agency will, as best it can, justify its previous behaviour and, in the absence of some overall examination of what has happened, there is a real risk that we will never unravel this matter properly and, even more importantly, we will not learn the necessary lessons to ensure that this sort of thing cannot happen again.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Opposition's approach to these matters is quite clear. We do not believe that the best means of dealing with a serious and complex issue of this sort, which crosses Commonwealth and State jurisdictions and which deals with a whole lot of different areas and arms of government, is by some form of parliamentary inquiry. It may well be that in the end that will be the only option that we have left to us. But we would ask the Government to consider the proposition that the important thing is to have some objective inquiry-not a political inquiry-that can get through the complexity of this matter. It should not be fragmented where people have a vested interest in trying to ensure that the blame does not rest with them. The Opposition is perfectly prepared to support an inquiry by a parliamentary committee but, consistent with the view that we adopted with respect to the Murphy matter, we believe that there are more accurate and appropriate ways of going about this and that the Executive Government is peculiarly well placed to do it. We believe that the appropriate agency would be by way of a royal commission which could have the necessary overview to ensure that this matter is satisfactorily dealt with. </PARA>
<PARA> The alternative that the Government has to consider is that we send this matter to a parliamentary committee. As in other cases, if the Government will not act responsibly, we will act through the Parliament to do what we can. It is my understanding-and no doubt this will be made clear by the Australian Democrat speaker, Senator Macklin-that the Australian Democrats would be sympathetic to that approach. Our first priority, the first suggestion we make to the Government, is that it should appoint a royal commission. We believe that such a commission with its powers and with its non-political character, provided it has satisfactory terms of reference, is the best option for dealing with this matter in an orderly and satisfactory way. We will not tolerate a situation where the Government simply tries to disperse this matter by sending it off into eight, nine, 10 or a dozen ad hoc inquiries so that the matter is never properly dealt with. If the Government does not respond in a sensible and responsible way to our call for a royal commission, we stand ready to take the final step. </PARA>
<PARA> It really is a matter for the Government to consider what its real options are. It is not a realistic option for the Government to seek to bury this matter in the way that I think it is currently trying to do with letters from the Prime Minister to Ministers and a series of self-justifying reports from departments and agencies, many of which will presumably not be disclosed by this Government which shows far less enthusiasm for disclosure than it did when it was in Opposition. That is not a satisfactory outcome in this extraordinary and scandalous collapse of an organisation which was carrying out such important functions in Australia. The choices the Government have are these: it may have a royal commission with an appointment made by it and, we would hope, by the Victorian Government so that there is a full coverage of both Commonwealth and State issues; it can have a set of terms of reference which are set down by it but which will be regarded as satisfactory by the Opposition only if it enables the royal commissioner to inquire into all aspects of this matter; or it can have a parliamentary inquiry. The Opposition is making it quite clear that it is very happy to see the former course followed by the Government. We think that would be appropriate, but we will not tolerate the approach which the Government has presently adopted. I ask the Government to consider the point which has been raised by the Opposition and to respond to it before the end of this current period of sittings. If the Government fails to respond in a positive manner we will bring forward a motion for a reference of this matter to a parliamentary committee. The people of Australia are entitled to have the full story told. It is a story which is set out so clearly by Paul Malone's article in the Canberra Times last Saturday. It is a record which demonstrates that internal inquiry by the Government is simply never going to get to the bottom of this matter. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Senate is discussing a matter of public importance which amounts to the claimed need for the Government to appoint a royal commission to inquire into all aspects of the collapse of the Victorian Division of the National Safety Council of Australia. It is a matter of great concern in the community-and it is shared in this chamber which, of course, is representative of the community-that such an organisation, which did undertake very important tasks on behalf not only of the Victorian community but also of various jurisdictions around Australia, has been brought to the point of collapse. It has collapsed apparently due to the activities of its then director.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That being said and the public concern being well understood, the question is, nevertheless, whether a royal commission into that collapse is justified at this point. There has been nothing revealed in Senator Chaney's remarks, apart from his misgivings and supposed cynicism about the good faith of the Government, to indicate that there has been anything but what is the case, namely, a determination on behalf of all elements of the Federal Government to make proper inquiries within the various portfolios to determine the course of activity between those various elements of all the portfolios and the Victorian Division of the National Safety Council of Australia with a view, not of trying to cover up or somehow displace proper gaze from the activities of various elements of the agencies in a sort of protective attempt to ensure that one's own turf is not embarrassed by some revelation of not dealing with the matter properly, but of aiding the Victorian Government and the relevant Victorian authorities, mainly the Victorian police, in the conduct of their inquiries into this particular collapse. This is the main purpose of the inquiry being undertaken at the request of the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke). </PARA>
<PARA> It is worth emphasising at the outset that we are dealing with a Victorian company incorporated under Victorian law and subject to Victorian regulation. The Commonwealth had no part to play in the creation of this company, the National Safety Council of Australia, Victorian Division, nor did it have a real role in the oversight of its operations. The fact is, as is well known, that perhaps one of the causes for the sorry state to which this division of the National Safety Council of Australia has been brought is the fact that it had an exemption from lodging its accounts. That exemption was granted because it had been incorporated and licensed under section 66 of the Victorian companies code, which enabled it not to have to comply with the normal requirement that accounts and certain other documents be lodged. That particular provision under the Victorian company law shows squarely that perhaps the major reason for the failure of relevant authorities to know of the parlous state of this organisation rests in responsibilities which are those of the Victorian Commissioner of Corporate Affairs as the delegate of the National Companies and Securities Commission in relation to that type of entity in the Victorian jurisdiction. Basically we are dealing with a Victorian entity which has come to this sorry state with its collapse. The question of the liability of the board was properly touched upon by Senator Chaney and will need to be explored and, as he said, no doubt probably will be explored in the courts. I shall return in a moment to a comment he made about that. </PARA>
<PARA> We know that a receiver has been appointed as mortgagee in possession, a provisional liquidator has been appointed by the creditors in accordance with the Victorian companies code. One already has a series of properly constituted responses to this collapse in the appointment of a receiver as mortgagee in possession and the appointment of a provisional liquidator by the creditors. Therefore, a Victorian procedure is quite properly already in operation, designed to expose what has led to this collapse. In so far as the entity is Victorian one can see good reason for a royal commission being unnecessary while those procedures are being undertaken and are moving to the resolution of the responsibilities of the receiver and the provisional liquidator. </PARA>
<PARA> I made a note of what Senator Chaney said when talking about the board and its responsibilities in this matter. He cautioned us and said, `It is not proper to canvass the liabilities of the board'-I think he said in this chamber or in the House of Representatives-`because of the possibility of legal proceedings'. I think that is a very salient and correct point, but it should be applied even more vigorously and with greater force to the question of the establishment of a royal commission. Only late yesterday, as we understand it, Mr Friedrich was arrested in Western Australia. I am not in a position to say whether he has been charged under the relevant Victorian legislation. I understand that he has been charged under Western Australian legislation with being suspected of having committed an indictable offence in another jurisdiction, which I take it to be some sort of charge that is put in place while officers of the Victorian fraud squad get over there and commence the application for extradition back to Victoria. </PARA>
<PARA> The point I am trying to make is that the man known as John Friedrich is about to face, I can say with almost absolute certainty, very serious charges. One could imagine that he will then be subject to committal proceedings before a magistrate, and if the magistrate commits him to trial he will be up before a jury of 12 men and women drawn from Victoria in order to determine whether he is guilty of the various charges that are preferred against him. They will be making their assessment on his appearance in the court and will have to determine whether he is guilty on the usual criterion, beyond reasonable doubt. I say `his appearance in the court' because when one is talking about a trial as opposed to a royal commission it is worth remembering that Mr Friedrich need say nothing. He need say nothing to the police who arrest him and charge him and ask him certain questions. He need say nothing in the Magistrates Court when committal proceedings are being undertaken. He need say nothing at his criminal trial. In our system of justice it is up to the prosecution to prove all the elements of the offence beyond reasonable doubt. The accused person cannot be required to say anything, whether during the police inquiries, during the committal proceedings undertaken by the magistrate or during the trial. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Chaney seems to be proposing that we have a royal commission where inevitably John Friedrich would be the star witness. He would be called before that royal commission. I have the provisions of the Royal Commissions Act 1902 before me. Section 6 provides as follows:</PARA>
<PARA>If any person appearing as a witness before the Commission refuses to be sworn or to make an affirmation or to answer any question relevant to the inquiry put to him by any of the Commissioners he shall be guilty of an offence. </PARA>
<PARA>The penalty is:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . a fine not exceeding $1,000 or imprisonment for a period not exceeding 6 months. </PARA>
<PARA>Under the subheading `Self-incrimination' section 6a of the Act provides:</PARA>
<PARA>It is not a reasonable excuse for the purposes of sub-section 3 (2) for a person to refuse or fail to produce a document or other thing that he was required to produce at a hearing before a Commission that the production of the document or other thing might tend to incriminate him. </PARA>
<PARA>Subsection (2) reads:</PARA>
<PARA>A person is not entitled to refuse or fail to answer a question that he is required to answer by a member of a Commission on the ground that the answer to the question might tend to incriminate him. </PARA>
<PARA>There one has a completely different public procedure whereby John Friedrich could be called before a royal commission and required to give answers even though they may incriminate him. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Chaney says that it does not matter. A person may be arrested, charged and enabled at common law to remain silent at the time of police questioning, before the magistrate and before the jury and judge at a trial. Senator Chaney is saying that it does not matter if a royal commission requiring that person to give answers, even though they could be self-incriminating, is conducted at the same time, or before, or contemporaneously, or currently or whatever. I do not believe that we are at the stage where a royal commission, which would have that inevitable impact on a person who has been, as I understand it, arrested and charged in Western Australia in relation to a Western Australian offence, should be given those powers. Such a proposal seems extraordinary to me. It is even more extraordinary in the light of Senator Chaney's statement that we should be very careful in this chamber not to say anything about the liability of boards of directors for fear of prejudicing a fair trial if any legal proceedings are brought in relation to that liability.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I have had many discussions in this respect with senators, and possibly discussions even in the chamber-and certainly relating to war crimes legislation and to the Rothwells matter. I believe I had an interchange with Senator Chaney about the publicity that attended the arrest of Mr Laurie Connell. I am not absolutely sure of that, but certainly we had private conversations. The fact is that all that sort of pre-trial publicity, which would inevitably poison the wells and fountains of justice, would be exacerbated. Perhaps to some extent it has already occurred, but it would be exacerbated beyond measure by the holding of a royal commission of the kind Senator Chaney has in mind. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Chaney says, `Not much'. I am pleased to say that Peter White, the shadow spokesman for defence matters, does not share Senator Chaney's cynicism. He telephoned me this morning on two matters relating to this particular inquiry, seeking my assistance in relation to the activities of the Australian Federal Police (AFP). After this debate I will be able to reply to Mr White in relation to one matter that he required me to inquire into. In fact, I think I can make it known now. He asked me:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Was information relating to the NSCA Victorian Division rescue ship Blue Nobilia and its possible involvement in military training and mercenary operations brought to the attention of the AFP's Sydney office in March 1988? If yes, what action was taken on that information?</PARA>
<PARA>I am now able to tell honourable senators that information of the nature described was provided by an informant. It was part of the investigation based on material originally provided by the National Crime Authority. It was commenced in October 1987 and concluded in March 1988. In my answer to Senator Hill earlier this week I made the Senate aware of this. As the Parliament has been previously advised, the AFP found nothing to substantiate any of the allegations, including the specific matters referred to in the question. </PARA>
<PARA> So Mr White had enough confidence to telephone me and ask me to provide an answer to that question, which I have now placed on the record but which I will also give to him personally. He also asked me to arrange with Commissioner McAulay for somebody from the Commissioner's office to act so as to receive certain documents which Mr White said may be of interest. Indeed, I rang Commissioner McAulay and have arranged that. I would say that Mr White believes that the AFP, as at least one of the Commonwealth agencies involved, is acting in good faith in its disclosure both to the relevant authorities, including the Victoria Police, and to this Parliament, of the matters that have occurred up to this point and is well placed to assist those Victorian authorities in the further considerations of any material that is brought to our attention. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that this proposal, if it were a motion, ought to be rejected. The fact is it would perhaps jeopardise the fair trial of a person if we proceeded with a royal commission at this stage. I do not believe that there is any ground for thinking that the wider issues beyond the possible criminal liability of Mr Friedrich will not be addressed by governments. As I say, the fact is that the Prime Minister has required that all relevant Ministers undertake a review of what has occurred to this point. In so far as any material arising from that review leads either to a change in particular practices or to the need to inform Victorian authorities particularly, whether it be Corporate Affairs or the Victorian Police, of particular matters, that will be done. There is no attempt by this Government in any sense to cover up its activities in relation to this very sorry saga. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We are debating a matter of public importance brought forward by the Opposition urging:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The need for the Government to appoint a royal commission, preferably in conjunction with the Government of Victoria, to inquire into all aspects of the collapse of the Victorian Division of the National Safety Council of Australia with particular reference to that organisation's links and dealings with all government departments and authorities, including security and intelligence authorities. </PARA>
<PARA>The Australian Democrats' view is that it would be inappropriate for a royal commission to be appointed at this time. I wish to suggest what we believe is the correct course to take now. First of all, we believe that the Federal Government should seek, through the Parliament, to refer the operational aspects of the activities of the Victorian Division of the National Safety Council of Australia to the Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade. Following the collapse, I, along with the Minister for Land Transport and Shipping Support, Mr Robert Brown, and most Australians, was astounded to find out some of the functions which were undertaken by the National Safety Council. Indeed, I must admit that I thought the Victorian Division of the National Safety Council was the same as the one in Queensland, which issues posters to people to ask them not to fall over ladders and so forth. Obviously in Victoria it is an entirely different kettle of fish. That is something of which I, for one, was completely unaware. </PARA>
<PARA> I therefore believe that it is appropriate that the Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade be involved in this. I refer to a speech made by my colleague Senator Paul McLean on 28 November last year. Speaking on a matter of public importance he said, on behalf of the Democrats:</PARA>
<PARA>We must move towards new integrated models of defence based upon both civil and military defence thinking, models which would provide for increased and substantially improved morale within the Services by making their tasks more relevant and visible. Many Western European countries employ their defence forces in non-military tasks. One example is Austria, which employs her defence forces in mountain and air-sea rescue, as frontier police, for disaster relief, as police reinforcements and for fire control reinforcement. Similar undertakings are typical of the Belgian civil military defence forces. In Denmark they undertake mountain and air-sea rescue, coastguard work, and disaster relief. In Finland they undertake mountain and air-sea rescue, coastguard work, frontier police work, disaster relief, and reinforce police and fire control authorities. </PARA>
<PARA>From our point of view we should look at whether the type of activities undertaken by the National Safety Council indeed ought to have been undertaken by it or whether they ought to have been undertaken by other organisations. We believe they ought to have been undertaken by the defence forces of this country. </PARA>
<PARA> Also, we believe the Federal Government should seek from the Parliament a reference of the security aspects of the National Safety Council's activities to a committee. We believe that that reference would be most properly made to the Joint Committee on the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation. Section 92c of the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation Act set up a parliamentary committee. Under subsection 92c (2) of that Act, it is permissible for the Minister to refer a particular aspect of the activities of the organisation to the Committee for review. We believe that sufficient material is now on the public record to warrant such a reference and to look at a review of security information. That committee has already been set up by the Parliament to deal with such matters. This joint committee, on which all parties are represented is, we believe, under its statutory authority, the appropriate body to deal with that particular matter. Another reason I think it is the relevant body is that many other items in the Act refer to the way that committee is to be conducted, the type of security arrangements it is to meet under, and the type of security arrangements which are available to members of that committee that are not available to other senators and members. In other words, that Committee already has in place the security that is necessary to undertake such an inquiry. No other committee would have those security arrangements in place. For example, when that Committee meets, it meets only in a place to which the Director of the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation has agreed and which has already been made secure by a number of procedures. There is a whole host of protections already in place to make sure of the security of information that the Committee receives. There are aspects of this matter, which have been brought forward by the Opposition in the House of Representatives debate, that could very well be referred to that Committee. </PARA>
<PARA> There is a third matter that I believe ought to be referred to a committee, specifically to the Joint Select Committee on Corporations Legislation. That is the matter of section 66 organisations, of which the National Safety Council of Victoria was one. Under the legislation currently in this place, which is being reviewed by the Joint Select Committee on Corporations Legislation, they would become section 383 organisations. The matter may very well have been fixed up, but I believe it would be as well for that Committee to be given a specific reference to make sure that was the case. The simplest way to explain this matter is probably for me to read from the explanatory memorandum. Paragraph 1365 of the explanatory memorandum of the corporations legislation package states:</PARA>
<PARA> This clause-</PARA>
<PARA>that is, clause 383-</PARA>
<PARA>differs from . . . s. 66 in that it will no longer be possible for companies licensed under Bill cl. 383 to be exempted from lodging annual returns and returns of directors, principal executive officers and secretaries. </PARA>
<PARA>When one thinks of the current available material with regard to the National Safety Council, it is fairly obvious that the methods by which it was able to operate as a charity were quite different from those which it would have had to operate under if it had been an incorporated company. I believe this move, to seek annual returns from charities, would go at least part of the way to correcting the problem. Possibly there are more items involved in this, but I believe the relevant body to refer it to would be the Joint Select Committee on Corporations Legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> Apart from that item, I do not think it would be correct for the Parliament to deal with any other items at this time. Incorporated in this whole exercise there are, of course, other matters. I draw attention in particular to the adequacy of the freedom of information legislation at Commonwealth and State levels to be able to deal with the activities and the collapse of the National Safety Council. For example, if the Freedom of Information Act in Victoria or federally operated in a way which allowed people to have access to a range of documents, I am quite sure that those people who have already displayed an interest over a number of years in this matter would have been in a far better position to make noises long before now. But, as we saw recently, with the Opposition's support of the Government to make the expense of gaining access under freedom of information legislation almost prohibitive to ordinary citizens, those particular pieces of legislation are not much use in these areas. </PARA>
<PARA> The only other comment I make is to echo points which have already been made. I believe that, as one of the principals involved has been arrested, it is important that no other statements are made at this time, in the public or parliamentary arena, which would impede the possibility of a fair trial for any persons who may be charged with offences, be they the person already arrested or other people who might be connected with the collapse of that organisation. I do not believe that the current situation would lead one to be very sanguine about the possibilities of fair trials, even at the moment. It seems that people in this country have been quite happy to try in the media various people without going to the point of putting in front of what they have been saying `alleged to have' or `allegations that'. It seems now that we are happy to say that people have committed crimes, without those people having a chance to answer in their own names. I believe this chamber should not involve itself in that aspect and neither do I believe that any inquiry of this place should involve itself in that aspect. </PARA>
<PARA> In other words, I believe that we need to put aside any of those legal aspects of the collapse of that branch of the National Safety Council which are more properly the concerns of the courts. I think that is the correct course to follow, so that those aspects which are not involved with it, but the operational, security or corporate aspects, over which a legislature has control and quite a specific interest in terms of making sure about the organisation of those safety or security elements or the way our corporate legislation is drafted, are legitimate aspects for inquiry. We should be involved and it should be our first concern. But, beyond that, I believe that this matter should be left to the courts. It may very well be that, after the courts have completed their inquiry, residual elements could be looked at by a further inquiry. However, I do not agree that we should do so prior to the operations of the courts. I doubt whether any senator here would like that type of operation to occur to them. I think it then behoves us to look at, for whatever reason whether political or otherwise, moving in between that person and that person's right, in our society at least, to a fair trial. </PARA>
<PARA> The other matters that I mentioned as references would not in any way impinge on these legal matters. They would deal with policy items on which policy recommendations could be made. For example, on the security or defence elements, we could look at whether a private organisation should have been dealing with rescues. That may be a matter for our Air Force. They are matters of policy and they are quite outside whether the National Safety Council had or had not collapsed, and therefore are legitimate aspects for immediate inquiry. Since the call was for a royal commission into all aspects, it seems to me that those aspects would also be those ones which are properly the concern of the court. I for one could not support such an exercise. </PARA>

That is what the Government wants us to believe. It says, `Leave it to the fraud squad; let the courts sort this mess out'. But it is a lot more than that. In the most simple terms we have a private, non-profit organisation that is based in Victoria but has offices throughout Australia and overseas with various subsidiary and associated companies throughout Australia. It employs hundreds of people and its budget runs into millions of dollars. It is not the local run of the mill charitable organisation or group; it is, in every sense of the word, a big business-but with some additional privileges. It enjoys the privileges of paying no tax and of being able to receive donations. </PARA>
<PARA> Just let us look behind the facade. We see a company that has remarkable access to various government departments, close links with public servants, politicians, bankers, defence personnel and businessmen. It has special freedoms not afforded the average business and contacts with foreign governments. If we dig a little deeper, little bells of warning start to ring out around the place. We see a little irregularity here, some suspect accounting there. Questions of safety standards being breached start appearing. Government departments are shown to be less than efficient in their dealings with the NSCA. What started as an apparently straightforward case of company fraud has developed into a scam involving various government departments. Questions of incompetence start to arise; questions of national security appear. Still the Government is telling us that it is none of our concern. </PARA>
<PARA> We then start to look at the man himself, and more questions go unanswered. As I see it, there are three levels to this whole incident. There is the company fraud angle-and, indeed, that is for the courts, quite rightly, to deal with. Whether the final figure is $100m, $200m or even more, it is a major financial scam. There are two other aspects of this case which the Government has not yet addressed in any meaningful level and which cannot be allowed to go unanswered. They are not for the courts to sort out; only a royal commission will have the ability and the flexibility to produce the answers. </PARA>
<PARA> The first is that of bureaucratic incompetence. How can one man for so long con so many senior government officials and industry leaders? It was seemingly easy-frighteningly so. I will come back to that in a short while. The third level of inquiry must surely be the man himself, John Friedrich. Just who is he? Why does the Government not know? The Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs (Senator Robert Ray) told the Senate quite unashamedly on Tuesday:</PARA>
<PARA>We have found no evidence that Mr Friedrich was an Australian citizen. As I understand it he was not on the electoral roll and did not have a driver's licence or a passport . . . we will not know, until Mr Friedrich is apprehended, how he arrived in the country. </PARA>
<PARA>This is not some miscellaneous factory hand we are talking about here; we are talking about the head of a multi-million dollar business, a council with access to government agencies and leading industry bankers, a company which, by any description, enjoyed privileges not given to other companies in Australia. The head of this company is known to governments throughout Australia and overseas. He is on first-name terms with half of the business community. Yet the Minister for Immigration tells us that the Government does not know who he is, where he came from or how he got here. </PARA>
<PARA> I find it somewhat extraordinary that in this age of computer files, tax file numbers and Customs records this man can even apply for a job, much less get one, without some sort of check being made as to who he was. How did he get married if he did not supply a birth certificate? How did he drive a car-and get all the way to Western Australia-without a licence? How was he able to operate bank accounts and pay loans without someone somewhere asking a few basic questions? It is so extraordinary that it is quite bizarre. When the Department of Immigration can run down with a passion the proverbial little old lady overstaying her visitor's visa, I find it quite stunning that its officers have no information on such a high profile person and even more amazing that the Minister can say, with no apparent difficulty, that no-one has a clue. This is the first question that must be answered. </PARA>
<PARA> On the question of bureaucratic incompetence, one is at a loss to know where to start. We have heard evidence in this chamber of attempts by various people, including the media, to force the State Government in Victoria and the Federal Government to investigate allegations of incompetence, of cover-ups, of possible breaches of national security and financial mismanagement. All have fallen on deaf ears. The Minister for Defence (Mr Beazley) said basically, `Well, we had a look at it but really couldn't come up with anything; so we ignored the complaint'. The Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) said similar things in the House the other day. I know, however, that he has now asked eight Ministers to prepare briefs on the issue, as Senator Chaney has mentioned already, so at last the Prime Minister is beginning to smell some trouble. It is not before time even though he claimed yesterday that it is a State matter. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us go through some of the allegations of bureaucratic bungling and the Public Service blind eye, deaf ear syndrome. First, there are allegations of arms deals with Third World connections by the National Safety Council of Australia in Victoria and associated companies. There are allegations that people associated with the NSCA were involved in trying to buy bomber parts from Canberra for sale to an overseas government. There are allegations of purchases of weapons and other defence equipment. We learn that the NSCA had an enviable supply of special halo parachutes, the sort used by Army experts. There are allegations that the Special Air Service Regiment (SAS) in fact wanted to use the NSCA equipment because it was absolutely state of the art stuff and better than its own. There are allegations of purchases of Boeing 727 aircraft for overseas sale. There are allegations of involvement in arms deals with Third World countries and other unlawful conduct. These allegations were made to the National Crime Authority as early as October 1987. Nothing came of them. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us turn to the Department of Aviation. It had an involvement at a number of levels with the NSCA. Indeed, one of its senior officers had close ties with the NSCA. He has said:</PARA>
<PARA>I know things don't add up at the NSCA but I'm just along for the ride. </PARA>
<PARA>Here was a public servant who knew things were wrong but, for whatever reason, chose to do nothing about it. </PARA>
<PARA> It is important to remember the extent of the role of the NSCA. It had an enormous fleet of fixed and rotary wing aircraft at its disposal. These craft were equipped with the latest navigational aids, long distance fuel tanks, various searchlight and radar equipment, winches and fully trained 24-hour crews. These aircraft were a significant part of aviation activity in Australia. The NSCA ran its own pilot training facility and had air bases and operations in several States. The Council sent its aircraft and crews to fight fires in France, Spain and Canada. This was all done during our winter here. There are allegations that one of the NSCA planes was damaged in an air traffic incident but, despite suffering tail wing damage, the incident was never reported for airworthiness testing. In fact, many such regulations were waived or ignored when it came to NSCA aircraft. There have been allegations of death threats against people who criticised the NSCA and threats against pilots who asked questions. Unfortunately, one of those critics is now dead, killed in an air ambulance plane crash that, according to at least one man, was not an accident. </PARA>
<PARA> There are also allegations that NSCA planes had blanket clearance for Customs. This is understandable when you consider the nature of their work. They could hardly be expected to queue for Customs clearance when they had critically ill persons from, say, Fiji or New Guinea awaiting urgent medical attention. But do we know how many times Customs clearance was sought and how often it was given? Was each case an emergency? We know flights were made to areas such as the Persian Gulf, but was every circumstance a fully documented emergency? What about the allegations made in the other place yesterday of the illegal entry of a German citizen aboard an NSCA plane? Let us face it: it would be no great effort to smuggle in or out of Australia via NSCA planes contraband, people-whatever you like. </PARA>
<PARA> Obviously many of the operations and relations between government departments and the NSCA were based on trust. Clearly that trust has been breached, but to what extent and does anyone know? Only a royal commission would find out. The old boy mateship network flourished very willingly. The NSCA annual report, which ironically boasts of 60 years of service to the community, is crammed full of activities and people. Just about every government department with any vague connection with NSCA activities had a seat on the Council's board. Yet it is that same board that claims it knew nothing of the financial mismanagement of the Council or its head. How much then did these people know or suspect but chose to ignore about mismanagement of their own department's dealings with the NSCA? How much do various State and Federal Ministers know but are not telling?</PARA>
<PARA> We know of at least one Minister who believed silence was the best course of action. I refer to the Deal Island fire. Deal Island is a 1,600-hectare Commonwealth lighthouse reserve in Bass Strait. It was used in 1986 by NSCA personnel to carry out survival exercises. However, while they were on the island a major fire broke out which required a massive firefighting exercise to contain. Subsequent reports indicate that the fire was started by NSCA personnel to cook some fish they had caught, despite the fact that fires were not allowed on the island. That one was lit in winds of around 40 knots is extraordinary. In fact, the winds were so strong it made air firefighting quite difficult and hazardous. It was suggested by local media at the time that the SAS was responsible for starting the fire because parachutists landing on the island were presumed to be SAS officers. The then Minister for Transport, Mr Peter Morris, knew the NSCA was responsible and chose to remain silent on the matter. I have a package of documents which show his Department was fully briefed as to who was responsible but Minister Morris said nothing. Neither has it been confirmed whether the NSCA, who not only started the fire but also put it out, actually charged the Commonwealth for its services. </PARA>
<PARA> An even more alarming allegation made against the NSCA is that of the sale of unsafe parachutes by a company associated with the NSCA to the Wilton Parachute School in New South Wales. This school is fairly well known, not only for the number of people who pass through its doors but also because there have been deaths of students there. The Department of Transport and Communications is in possession of signed statements from people who knew that faulty parachutes were being sold. Unserviceable parachutes were being used at the Wilton Parachute School. This has also been documented. What was behind the entire NSCA parachute rigging staff resigning because of poor safety standards? That is another question that could be asked. What about the allegations of jumps made from overcrowded aircraft or of parachutists dropped at Sale in Victoria with civil jets in the vicinity? Even the coroner inquiring into the deaths of the two parachutists killed at Wilton suggested that the Department of Transport and Communications hold an inquiry. Nothing was done. Again, the Department saw nothing and did nothing. </PARA>
<PARA> What is this Government trying to hide? Why does it not agree to a royal commission into the Victorian branch of the NSCA and clear the matter up for all the people who have been kept in the dark and make sure that every little facet of the organisation is made known by the Australian people, as is their right? A lot of us would like to know the facts. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is perfectly true that the collapse of the Victorian company, the National Safety Council of Australia (NSCA), is a serious matter. It has been a spectacular collapse. The only organisation in Australia that I am currently aware of that is in a more bankrupt state than the National Safety Council of Australia is the Federal coalition-Opportunists Pty Ltd in receivership. That is precisely the way the Opposition has behaved in this debate. I actually took the trouble to go over to the House of Representatives last night to sit in on the debate on this matter. I saw such a transparent attempt by a fairly desperate Opposition to clutch at straws and draw whatever long bow was in sight to try to sheet the collapse of a private Victorian company home to the feet of the Commonwealth. I am surprised it has bothered to run the same sham in the Senate today.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am not sure how I can filibuster with a 15-minute speech but I will try now. The National Safety Council of Australia is something of a misnomer because it is not a national safety council of Australia. A lot of people are under the impression that it is and it is the impression that it is some sort of arm of the Government the Opposition is trying to cash in on. It is a private Victorian company limited by guarantee. It has collapsed with the unfortunate effect of some 400-odd people being thrown on the street out of work. I dare say that the reasons for that will be canvassed in a judicial fashion in the weeks and months ahead.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> A reasonable comparison to make with the collapse of this company that the Opposition is now calling for a royal commission would be the collapse of Patrick Partners some years ago because of fraudulent behaviour on its board of directors. It may have escaped my attention-I went through the Hansards of that time-but I do not think the Opposition was screaming its head off for a royal commission into that. Perhaps Senator Michael Baume may have done so and I am doing him a disservice. I do not think anyone on the other side was screaming about having a royal commission on the collapse of Patrick Partners.</PARA>
<PARA> There have been so many canards run in this debate about the involvement of the Commonwealth in the National Safety Council in Victoria that it is necessary once again to lay them to rest. What was the involvement of this private company which tendered, along with other private companies, for search and rescue operations with the Commonwealth? It, along with thousands of other companies in Australia, has contracts with the Commonwealth Government and the State governments. What was its involvement? I thought the Minister for Defence, Mr Beazley, put it fairly succinctly in the House of Representatives last night when he said that the valid comparison to make was that the total involvement of the National Safety Council of Australia with the Department of Defence was for a total amount of money equivalent to one-seventeenth of one of the 75 FA18s that are operated by the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF). </PARA>
<PARA> I will give a little more precise detail about that. The facts are that the RAAF had three contracts for search and rescue services with this organisation totalling $4.7m and a number of smaller ancillary services. I might also add that it is appropriate to note that these contracts were due to expire this year. They were negotiated on the basis that no up-front payments whatsoever were required by the Commonwealth for these services to be provided; so there was no exposure of Commonwealth funds in relation to this organisation whatsoever. I am sure the 20-20 hindsight experts on the other side of the House would be prepared to concede that up until this point in time the company not only had a good reputation but had a spectacular reputation. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me address some of the points made by Senator Brownhill as the grounds on which the Government should establish a royal commission. What are the dreadful sins of this organisation? It had spectacularly good and sophisticated equipment. It had extremely efficient personnel. I think this highlights one of the holes in this whole debate: the Opposition is deliberately trying to confuse the activities of the organisation itself with the activities of Mr Friedrich. That is the big hole in the Opposition's argument. </PARA>
<PARA> The organisation was acknowledged to be efficient. The Department of Defence had no complaint about the service that was provided. It paid only for services that were provided. The Opposition has attempted to make something of the fact that the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) wrote to eight government departments as a very sensible precaution. Of course, the Prime Minister would do that. There is a little bit of public cont- roversy surrounding this organisation. </PARA>
<PARA> I wish to put into context the relationship of this private Victorian company which has failed. Of course the Commonwealth Government has thousands of contracts with private companies all over Australia. I will give just one quick example as time does not allow me to give any more. This organisation is not the only company that has contracts with the Department of Defence. Access by private contractors to defence bases in Australia can range from 65 visits a year in my home city of Darwin to 1,800 a month at Williamtown. It is seriously suggested by the Opposition-I heard it seriously suggested by Peter White last night-that the Department of Defence should set up an audit division of its own to investigate the financial affairs of every one of these hundreds of companies with whom it has contracts. What a nonsensical proposition that would be in terms of getting value for money for the Australian taxpayer. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition is seriously suggesting that we should have some sort of sophisticated security clearance for all of these contractors. It is freely acknowledged that sophisticated security clearances do have to be organised for contractors who are directly involved in highly sophisticated and secret matters such as providing the armaments on warships or the construction of submarines. But what is involved in getting a clearance of that magnitude? I can tell you that a great deal is involved. It involves investigations into a person's bank accounts and background and questions being asked of friends and neighbours. It is a very involved and highly intrusive process. The Opposition is seriously suggesting that organisations that have got a total involvement of $4.7m in contractual relationships with the Commonwealth Government should be put through such a process. To suggest that is an absolute nonsense. The entire government and business relationships of the Department of Defence would grind to a halt overnight and the cost of it would never be able to be justified. </PARA>
<PARA> What does it base this nonsense on? It is based on the alleged possession of a document by Mr Friedrich. What was the document? It has been described quite falsely as being top secret. It was nothing of the sort. The document was not a classified operational plan, nor a classified operational manual, but the findings of a Government review into counter-terrorist activities and search and rescue for aircraft downed in operations. Hundreds of copies were prepared and delivered, as they had to be, to State governments and various other departmental organisations across Australia. It was not a top secret document. It was a document that was classified, of course, to the point where it was not confetti on the streets, but it is a nonsense to suggest that a high security clearance is required for access to documents like that. The entire call of the Opposition for a royal commission into this affair is based on this nonsense. </PARA>
<PARA> Where should the onus for a security clearance of this level rest? Should it be with anyone that comes into contact with a senior officer or a senior bureaucrat in the Department of Defence? That would be nonsense. Is anyone seriously suggesting that because someone is the next door neighbour of an Army general or a senior officer in the Royal Australian Air Force or a senior bureaucrat and they have some contact with these people on a daily basis, they have to have a high level security clearance, that they have to have officers from Intelligence going round asking intrusive questions of their friends and neighbours? Of course they are not. The onus properly rests, in terms of security clearance, with the officers and the bureaucrats who have the information in the first place, and not with people they might give it to or come into contact with. Security clearances at that level are required to be given to the people who have the information in order to ensure that they will not pass the information on to anyone else they might come into contact with. That is where the proper onus should lie. The ridiculous proposition put by Peter White, on behalf of the Opposition, last night would render the Department of Defence unworkable overnight. </PARA>
<PARA> I add, just in passing, that in addressing myself to this debate and looking at what was said last night I tried to get all the relevant papers. It is just a minor complaint, but the honourable member for Richmond, Mr Blunt, said in the final few moments of his contribution in the House of Representatives last night that he had tabled copies of photocopies of cheques, invoices and termination papers that he had in his possession in the Parliament. I have contacted the extremely efficient Table Office in the House of Representatives. I cannot find them. In fact, the Table Office has informed me that, despite Mr Blunt's statement, they have not in fact been tabled. So perhaps I could just ask Mr Blunt, in order to complete the Opposition's case, which clearly has not been fully made yet, if he would care to table them today in the House of Representatives. It is just a minor irritation, but it is there. </PARA>
<PARA> Where should the responsibility lie for what has happened with this organisation? Before an investigation is even conducted, I have no hesitation in saying where I think it should properly lie. The ultimate responsibility for what happened in this private Victorian company rests with its board of directors. There is no question about that. It does not rest with Mr Friedrich. </PARA>

I am going to be very interested to find out whether this significant company had an audit committee on its board. I have no hesitation in saying that the public comments I have so far heard made by two members of that board are a nonsense. They sat at a board meeting and got a ring binder or a stack of papers from Mr Friedrich, from which he had removed the qualifying statements that had been put there by the auditors. They never thought to question him beyond that or go beyond that.

I would hope that there is not one single person in this chamber that would want to prevent, impede or make more difficult the successful prosecution of the people who were responsible for the collapse of this company. I would also hope that there would not be anyone in this chamber that would want to try to interfere with or prevent, in so far as it is still possible, the right that anyone who is going to be charged in this affair has to try to mount a defence in a court of law. The proposition to now establish a royal commission into the affairs of this company, when the full extent of charges that are going to be laid is not even evident yet and when the person who has been deliberately avoiding the police has only just been captured, is an absolute nonsense and is, in my view, completely irresponsible. I had some involvement with a similar example recently-the Amann Aviation inquiry. Honourable senators on the other side of the chamber and their colleagues in the House of Representatives know the great difficulties of the very proper sub judice conventions of this Parliament with matters that are before the court. Our hands are tied on those matters. People deserve their day in court. Mr Friedrich deserves his day in court-in so far as it is still possible to give it to him. On the other side of the coin, as I said before, this Parliament should be doing nothing to impede or cloud the opportunity to successfully prosecute the people responsible for the collapse of this company.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There is no question whatsoever, therefore, that the call by the Opposition for the establishment at this point in time of a royal commission is irresponsible. The proper course of action is to allow the authorities which are now in charge of this to complete their work, to allow charges to be made, to allow the court cases to ensue, to wait for the dust to settle, and then to see whether any further action is necessary. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;One at least has to give Senator Collins credit for being frank. He promised that he was going to filibuster and he did, practically in the same terms as did the Minister for Defence (Mr Beazley), for 15 minutes last night. I wonder whether he spent his bed time last night learning the Minister's speech. It would have made it simpler for him. It sounded very similar. He told us what the involvement of the National Safety Council with the Commonwealth was, and he gave us to understand that it was simply a question of a few piddling little contracts. Let us look at just what the involvement was with the Commonwealth. First of all, there were those contracts and queries about those contracts. Secondly, there were inquiries and complaints made to the Australian Federal Police (AFP) and to the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation (ASIO). Next, there was suggested involvement with the Special Air Service. There was also involvement with counter-terrorism units and complaints on air safety and other matters to the Department of Transport and Communications. We know about those areas for certain. I believe there to be more. So it cannot be said that the Opposition has no genuine cause for concern about the various areas in which Commonwealth bodies and agencies had some connection with the organisation and Mr Friedrich.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Minister for Defence, Mr Beazley, tried exactly the same tack last night. He tried to minimise the contact of the organisation and Mr Friedrich with the Commonwealth. He also tried the same stunt of trying to pour ridicule on the need for checks on defence contractors. We have been getting this Government line again today. We believe that there are many shady issues and unanswered questions that have to be dealt with. My colleagues Senator Chaney and Senator Brownhill have already alluded to many of them. The nation needs to know whether its security was jeopardised. If ever there was a good reason for the Commonwealth being involved in an inquiry at the level of a royal commission, it is that. The taxpayers also have a right to know what has happened to the money paid out for contracts that now will not be fulfilled. We believe that a royal commission is the best way of dealing with the questions that have been raised and the suspicions that are abounding. </PARA>
<PARA> There were so many Government and private agencies involved. It seems to be a bit like shutting the stable door after a $2m horse has bolted but we have to ensure that this does not happen again. In order to do that we have to know the full extent of the mess. Mr Friedrich was not superhuman; he was not a magician. Clearly, this has happened because various government bodies were negligent in some way, especially in the security area. They showed inertia in inquiring into allegations made to different Commonwealth bodies over several years. Alarm bells were ringing in some corridors of the Commonwealth Government at least two years ago. </PARA>
<PARA> I draw the attention of honourable senators to the Commonwealth Government's fraud report. The Minister for Justice (Senator Tate) has just come in. He will remember it quite well. We heard a lot about it from the AFP union during the last election. The Minister for Justice managed to keep the lid on that until the election was over. A couple of months later he was prepared to tell us about it. I recall that we had a great deal of discussion in a Senate Estimates Committee meeting in September and October 1987. I asked the AFP about the fraud report. I asked the Department of Administrative Services and I asked the Department of Defence. It is quite interesting. I would like to draw attention to the fact that on 22 October 1987 I referred to the Australian Federal Police estimate that fraud involving Department of Defence contracts and other defence matters amounts to about $800m a year. I asked whether the Department had taken steps to ascertain the accuracy of those estimates. I was told that there had been a detailed Defence internal audit report, only just completed, on the issue of fraud. I was told that the results of that report were being evaluated. That was in October 1987. I was also told by Mr McLeod, the officer concerned, that from time to time they receive specific allegations of fraud in respect of defence programs or contracts. My questioning went on for some time. They were investigated internally. In certain cases civil authorities were also involved. </PARA>
<PARA> At that time a body called the Fraud Control Committee was set up. It comprised the secretaries of some of the senior departments. The Committee was to look at ways of ensuring that the Commonwealth did not get caught up with shady deals or shady dealers and that fraud against the Commonwealth was prevented. It seems that that Committee has disappeared without trace. Once again we find the Commonwealth dealing with a contractor that it knows nothing about. </PARA>
<PARA> In this case the Commonwealth may not have been defrauded but there is no certainty of that. It is a matter of concern that, despite a long investigation into fraud against the Commonwealth, despite the AFP assessment of $800m fraud against the Department of Defence in its contracts, this contractor that came along was not thoroughly investigated. Perhaps we would not be debating this matter today if the Department, at that time, had taken steps to investigate its contractor. After all, as my colleagues have already said, it was pretty important. These defence contractors have access to senior defence officials. They also have access to restricted defence bases. Although the Minister and Senator Collins poured ridicule on the need to investigate the contractors, a year and a half ago the Commonwealth and the AFP were concerned to see that people were being properly checked out. </PARA>
<PARA> On 24 October 1986 Mr Beazley put out a press release in which he announced that he had called tenders for the provision of a civilian contract helicopter rescue service at RAAF Williamtown on a trial basis for two years. He intended to make more effective use of the defence resources. He thought that that could be done by providing a civilian contractor and tenders were going to be assessed. One wonders just how they were assessed. Was it purely for operational reasons? Was any thought given to the access they would have to defence establishments? Was any thought given to seeing whether they would be financially long enough to survive the length of the contract? The National Safety Council was given the initial trial run at Williamtown. That was fair enough. Clearly it must have been satisfactorily evaluated; either that or not evaluated at all. Its contract was extended to cover first Darwin and then Tindal. In both cases that was only some time early this year. The Department, or whoever was responsible for assessing this defence contractor, had a couple of opportunities for evaluating and clearly did not do so. </PARA>
<PARA> It may not seem so important to the Government but we have a problem with manpower and resources in the defence forces. They are strapped to the floor because of lack of money and lack of manpower. An arrangement was organised so that search and rescue was no longer one of its tasks. Search and rescue now suddenly has to be dealt with by a force that does not have the manpower and equipment to do all the tasks expected of it by the Federal Government. These defence funds are precious and there is no excuse for squandering them. If I had time I could go into the allegations about Mr Friedrich's international intelligence connections. </PARA>
<PARA> I am concerned that there has been a report that Mr Friedrich was looking at purchasing five Spanish CASA CN235s at a cost of more than $US8.5m each. This is a very strange proposal. Perhaps the report could be explained if we looked at the direction of the Defence Department under this Minister. He is planning to privatise more and more of the Defence Department. It may have been that he was going to have not only search and rescue provided by civilians but also medevac and troop transport. These planes would have provided quite good troop transports. The military sources quoted in the Herald newspaper said that they were puzzled about these prospective purchases. I wonder whether they really are or whether there are some people in the Department of Defence who know very well that Mr Friedrich was given a tip-off that this was a direction in which the Minister was moving. </PARA>

<PARA> It is obvious that we need a royal commission to see what jeopardy has been caused to our defence forces, our police forces, our counter-terrorism forces. The country is clearly in danger when this Government runs down the things that are absolutely basic to the responsibilities of a Federal government. These are some of the reasons that I believe are the most vital reasons why we need a royal commission. This joins the Amann Aviation scandal, but I believe it takes it a great deal further. This Government has shown irresponsibility; it has shown a curious lack of urgency or concern. The Australian public has a right to know why and where so much money has gone, how lax have been our security measures, our safety measures, our protection of defence secrets, our protection against fraud. Why were so many bureaucrats deluded by one man for so long? Who is he? How was he able to get here and to stay here for so long? Why was the Government unaware of his non-status?</PARA>
<PARA> The problems concerning Mr Friedrich and his rights can be quarantined if there is to be a trial. An awful lot of matters do not directly concern him but concern the operations of government departments and other bodies. The Government must be held to account. Too many government agencies are involved. Duckshoving will be the result of these seven or eight inquiries. All that will happen is that the people involved will rush to cover their hides with separate in-house investigations. We need a royal commission. If the Government chooses to run away from a royal commission, we will have to have a parliamentary inquiry. Too many serious and urgent matters have been raised by this scandal. We cannot afford to allow them to be dealt with internally by bureaucrats who may have something to hide. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I begin by telling a story which will become relevant as I proceed. Very recently my son was admitted to practise as a barrister and solicitor of the Supreme Court of Victoria. I had the pleasure, with my wife, of moving for his admission. Of course, it is always of concern, when one's children launch themselves into the world, as to where he or she might get a job. In that context, I am somewhat tempted to support the proposition put forward by the Opposition because if we had a royal commission along the lines suggested by honourable senators opposite, my son would be provided with work from now until the end of his days-and I hope his days extend well into his eighties.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> If the suggestion made by honourable senators opposite is adopted, we will have the greatest legal battle since the time of Charles Dickens. I think the case of which he wrote in Bleak House was Jarndyce v. Jarndyce. Honourable senators opposite say that this inquiry, this royal commission, should look, among other things, into fires that have been lit and then put out, I understand, by the same people. There would be inquiries into foreign affairs and the conduct of foreign affairs, into parachute jumps that have been made, parachutes that have been bought and sold, the inefficiency of public servants, the identity of immigrants, the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation, the Office of National Assessments, the Australian Secret Intelligence Service, and into the way in which directors have conducted themselves. Indeed, there have been some inquiries in this Parliament into directors and their companies, and those have taken us some considerable time.</PARA>
<PARA> Having looked at directors, we would then inquire into the financial dealings of private companies, the affairs of the Special Air Service regiment, the relationship between the Victorian Division of the National Safety Council of Australia and politicians, businessmen, big business and public servants. We would then inquire into the loss of safety services, large commercial losses, the screening of government contracts, and connections between the Victorian Division of the National Safety Council and transport and aviation. We would inquire into counterterrorism, fraud in defence contracts, the lack of manpower in the defence services, international intelligence gathering activities that may be going on in Australia and overseas, flights to the Middle East, police forces, and security threats. </PARA>
<PARA> That simple recitation shows that this proposal has been very sloppily drafted in order to get publicity in light of the publicity given to the man who headed the Victorian Division of the National Safety Council, as he has now been arrested. I note that it was not until Mr Friedrich had been arrested that this proposition was brought before the Senate, and the matter was not debated in the other place until after he had been captured. How sincere can we believe the Opposition is when it does not put forward this sort of proposition until the man has been arrested and publicity has surrounded him?</PARA>
<PARA> In that context, I say this: a humane and liberal society is one which extends the protection of the law to all people. It is easy enough to protect the people who we find beautiful, who we find intelligent, who we can sympathise with. It is easy enough to extend the protection of the law to them. It is a bit more difficult at times to extend it to those who we may not like or who we feel have committed a crime or crimes which are grander than normal ones. If that is the approach we take, I think we lose the ability to call ourselves a humane and liberal society. </PARA>
<PARA> Why is it-and this is not the first time-that the Opposition has waited until the man has been arrested to bring the proposition before the chamber? No matter how much argument there is that Mr Friedrich can be quarantined from any royal commission, the reality is-and the facts stare everybody in the face; they must stare the Opposition in the face-that even if this proposition goes no further, it has prejudiced the trial of Mr Friedrich, if he comes to trial. It has prejudiced any civil proceedings that may be brought by many people who may be candidates to do so. It may prejudice civil proceedings when, and if, any actions are brought against the directors of this company. </PARA>
<PARA> It is easy enough to put forward a proposition which, as I say, is a very sloppy proposition, to score points against the Government and to berate the Government for its alleged failures. On the other hand, if it is going to prejudice the rights of people in the community-Mr Friedrich, the directors of this company or public servants-it is proper for this side of the Senate to point out that that situation lacks propriety. </PARA>
<PARA> I have no doubt that the Opposition is intent on obtaining the truth on many subjects and many issues. Opposition members discussed many subjects and many issues in the debate today. However, they seem to lack a sense of propriety about when to introduce matters such as this. For example, I remember that when a civil hearing was about to take place in the Federal Court last year in a case between a union and employers the Opposition introduced a matter which cut right across the issues that that tribunal was going to deal with. Here we have again today, as we had last night in the other place, a proposition which is aimed, the Opposition says, at obtaining the truth but which has the effect of prejudicing people in exercising the rights which any citizen ought to be able to enjoy in this community. It has almost become a pattern of the Opposition to blunder in at times when issues of delicacy, issues that go to the very humane character of this community, are at stake. It is time that Opposition members started looking at themselves. </PARA>
<PARA> What does this motion mean? Why was it brought in now? Why could it not have been brought in-if it was going to be brought in-after the Opposition obtained some facts? What it has done today is typical of what happens in this place and in many other places. It has made a whole series of allegations that go to the integrity of all sorts of people, in this case to the Public Service, to the police and to people in private enterprise. No facts have been brought forward. Those allegations having been made, they are then made the basis of demands for a royal commission. One explanation might be that the Opposition has been so long out of government that it wants to try to exercise some executive power. It might feel that if it can get a royal commission up and running it will have somehow exercised the power of executive government. Royal commissions, of course, are the instruments of executive government. They are specifically aimed at giving information to government so that it can take particular actions in particular places. If an inquiry into a specific incident is called for, that is an appropriate thing for a royal commission to enter into, but it is extraordinary, in my view, that the Opposition should throw together-and this proposition has been thrown together-a matter of public importance and make all sorts of allegations without giving us any adequate proof. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It does seem to be fairly normal and it is a bit worrying. Opposition members talk about the need for the Government to appoint a royal commission, preferably in conjunction with the Government of Victoria. They want to exercise executive power, not only federally but also in Victoria, to inquire into all aspects of the collapse. Originally I thought that `all' meant a fairly wide range of subjects but I did not conceive, until the speakers opposite spoke, that such wide-ranging inquiries would be sought as have been sought here today. The Opposition proposed a whole litany of issues that it wants a judge-and no doubt the judge's son, his grandson and his great-grandson-to inquire into. Just how long this inquiry will take, with all the issues that the Opposition has raised taken into account, is beyond imagination. There is no attempt to confine what the inquiry will cover. There is no attempt to give any direction to this Parliament as to the specific issues it wants investigated, except some vague suggestion at the end of the Opposition's proposition.

<PARA>I suppose the Opposition wants the judge to haul before him the officers of our security and intelligence authorities such as ASIO, ASIS and ONA. No doubt the Opposition wants them cross-examined in public on the dealings of our security services. The Opposition has been very keen on the security services and has been very keen to see that what the security and intelligence authorities do is kept safe and secure. Yet as soon as it smells some sort of opportunity in the political field it is willing to cast aside all the jealousy that it had for preserving the confidentiality of these security organisations and wants to bring them out in the open. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the paper. </PARA>
<PARA>In view of the arrest this morning of five Indonesian fishing boats in the area north of Australia, the issue of the proper protection of the zone to our north with respect to fishing and a large number of other matters, such as drug running and security surveillance, becomes a very important issue indeed. The annual report of the Torres Strait Protected Zone Joint Authority refers to a small part of the protected northern zone which comes under the joint authority, which pays particular regard to fishing matters. Interestingly, the report deals with a number of matters such as the number of licences which have been granted and the size of the various catches. I notice that in the Torres Strait region there are already a large number of fishermen operating. As at 30 June 1988 there were 851 fishermen's licences for that region and they covered a number of species including prawns, rock lobster and several species of fish. For prawns there was a total allowable catch of 1,500 tonnes-a not inconsiderable catch from that region. </PARA>
<PARA> If this Protected Zone Authority is to manage the fishery properly, it is important that it is able to keep proper surveillance over the area and avoid the illegal fishing which is going on around our northern shores by a number of overseas fishing boats. Some of these illegal fishermen are arrested, but I have no doubt that the large majority of them are not. Interestingly, this morning's news item mentioned that the arresting vessel went out to arrest one vessel; it then discovered a second vessel and finally discovered five fishing vessels out there. On page 7 of the report under `Surveillance and Enforcement', we find that the ability to carry out surveillance properly in this region is indeed very limited. We have one boating and fishing patrol vessel, the Wauri, which commenced operations in mid-1988. We also have the occasional visit of naval vessels and Royal Australian Air Force P3 Orion long-range aircraft. Also, the report says that increasingly the coastwatch littoral surveillance flights are providing useful assistance for fisheries surveillance in the Torres Strait. </PARA>
<PARA> The point I would like to stress is that we need very much to improve the quality of our northern surveillance. This is a good example of an important area in this regard, not only with respect to fishing but also with respect to quarantine, because there are significant diseases which can move down through that chain of islands from Papua New Guinea to Australia. For those purposes, the Australian Democrats have long believed we should purchase the Canadian amphibious aircraft, the CL215, which could be used, among other things, for this surveillance purpose. Not only could it carry out surveillance but also, because it can carry an armed boarding party and land in large seas, it could actually land and arrest these illegal fishermen. At the same time, this aircraft would be eminently suitable for fighting fires in southern Australia during the summer time. For that reason, the Democrats believe that the purchase of a fleet of these aircraft would be extremely useful to Australia in a combination of these activities. It would be extremely useful for this task of northern surveillance, particularly because of its ability to land in remote areas to arrest the illegal incursions by fishermen from Indonesia, Taiwan and various other countries to the north of Australia. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the paper. </PARA>
<PARA>In speaking on the annual report of the Wheat Research Council, I wish to point out that the total amount allocated to continuing research in the last 12 months was $3.84m. It is no coincidence that Australia has the best quality wheat in the world at present. I know that wheat is the subject of the moment because of the expiration of the five-year agreement. A new agreement will start on 1 July. The reason that we have the best and cleanest wheat in the world flows from the use of research money provided by growers under successive agreements since 1947. It has generally been accepted that the average rate of research for each tonne of wheat has been around the $1.80 per year mark. This expenditure has created a pool of research into quality, fertilisers, handling and shipping, and this research activity lies behind our great wheat export trade. </PARA>
<PARA> I am worried about the new plan. If deregulation is accepted in respect of the domestic market, what will happen to research funds? Under the present scheme it is easy to collect the $1.80, or whatever the sum happens to be, at the source of delivery or payment. That has also been the case with the buyer permit and feed wheat systems which have existed for the past five years. Those who apply for permits ultimately are responsible for putting up research money. However, under a totally deregulated domestic market I am concerned about the future of the industry. I know that it will still be able to be collected from exporters, but if it is not collected on internal sales I am afraid that exporters will have to be charged more. </PARA>
<PARA> Each State makes its own collections of revenue by way of wheat volume in the way of research fees, and levies from the Australian Wheat Board are funnelled to each State to distribute and use as they think fit. Different States concentrate on different research areas and that research is then pooled. The fact that the main research ideas and recommendations are pooled reflects on the whole Australian wheat crop. I am happy to say that the accent in Australia has been on quality, cleanliness control and weevil control. This has shown up in the sales of Australian wheat throughout the world. In world markets corrupted by United States and European Common Market subsidies, we have been able to compete because of the quality and cleanliness of our product. I commend the report of the Wheat Research Council to the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to make some remarks on the annual report of the Wheat Research Council 1987-88. I am particularly interested in the reports from the State research committees where the main items of interest to the Australian Democrats are a number of points relating to the fragility of our soils, the use of chemicals, and emphasis on problems with weeds resistant to herbicides, whole farm management strategies and sustainable agriculture. It is good to see such an emphasis in the annual report on those issues, which the Democrats have been putting forward as major issues for Australia's long term agricultural prospects. We welcome these proposals in such annual reports. On page 12 the following statement is made:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>The agro-chemical industry has responded professionally to the development of resistance by the establishment of a `herbicide resistance action committee' but without providing a significant funding commitment to the research being undertaken. </PARA>
<PARA>This calls in question the credentials of the agro-chemical industry in attempts such as this, which must be seen as rather cosmetic attempts, to indicate its concern in the area of chemical resistance, especially where that industry sets up committees and then does not put its money where its mouth is. That is in contrast to the wheat industry itself which, as Senator Panizza said, has a fine record in funding its own research. On behalf of the Australian Democrats, I call on the agro-chemical industry, if it is really concerned about these issues, not just to set up committees as fronts to give everybody comfort but also to fund those committees adequately and get on with genuine research if the industry is itself genuine in that effort. </PARA>
<PARA> I congratulate in particular the States of Victoria and New South Wales. In this annual report those States go into some detail on those important aspects of the wheat industry such as fragility of the soils, use of chemicals, whole farm management strategies and sustainable agriculture. These issues are important to all agricultural industries. I wish to quote from the report of the Wheat Research Committee for Victoria, which says on page 44 of this annual report:</PARA>
<PARA>Soil degradation is becoming a real concern to farmers and to the Government. We believe it is important to continue research in this area to support farmers who are doing some valuable work at the practical level. We believe that one of our great thrusts in the coming year should be working towards what is called sustainable agriculture. This will ensure that the farmer can produce very valuable crops and still maintain or even increase the fertility of the soil. </PARA>
<PARA>The committee states in its next paragraph:</PARA>
<PARA>The whole farm management strategy would ensure wheat is grown on the most appropriate soil type, using optimal tillage methods, planting times, weed control measures, rotations and machinery systems. Computer modelling of whole farm systems is showing promise . . . </PARA>
<PARA>The Democrats can only say `Hear, hear' to that. The Australian Democrats commend the thrust of the Victorian report and the Victorian Government's growing interest in and stated commitment to the promotion of agricultural methods and management practices which emphasise sustainability. I should also like to quote from the report of the New South Wales Wheat Research Committee which, on page 24 of this annual report, says:</PARA>
<PARA> One of the major thrusts of the Department's research has been to develop cropping systems which are sustainable in the long term and do not leave the soil as vulnerable to erosion as traditional systems. </PARA>
<PARA>I take issue with the word `traditional'. The Democrats prefer the word `conventional' in regard to chemical-dependent agriculture. In fact, many traditional farming practices are chemical free and sustainable practices. Although we always want to move ahead with research and with industry in general, particularly agriculture, we believe that in many ways it behoves us to look back to our fathers and our fathers' fathers to see how they worked in a sustainable way on their land. The Democrats commend the wheat industry for its commitment to its own funding, and in particular the New South Wales and Victorian departments of agriculture, for their stated and emphasised thrust towards sustainable agriculture, which is in the best interests of the wheat industry and of our nation as a whole. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the paper. </PARA>
<PARA>When the original annual report was presented last year I was critical of elements of it. I now notice that at least one of the points I raised in criticism has been corrected by this corrigenda that has been tabled today. I might say that the list of several items that have been corrected indicates a touch of sloppiness in the preparation of this annual report. It seems to me unfortunate that there has been no effective response to the matters of serious substance that I raised last year about this annual report when it was brought down. I acknowledge the point made subsequently, I think by Senator Beahan, that the loss of $1.5m revealed in the accounts is more an accounting arrangement than an effective loss. But I think it would be useful if the report element of annual reports, as distinct from the accounts, effectively related to the figures shown in the accounts. The Trade Union Training Authority (TUTA) is one of many authorities under this Government whose written reports bear very little relationship to the accounts printed at the back of the document. That was my concern. </PARA>
<PARA> I am now interested to see that in this corrigenda tabled today there is a `slight' correction: on page 12 of the report the amount shown under the heading `Salaries and Related Items' for a prior year should be $2.7m and not $700,000. That kind of sloppiness in reporting brings its own consequences; and, of course, the consequence was that the report was strongly criticised by me. I regret that TUTA has not taken this opportunity to state more clearly just what were the consequences of the relocation of its office. </PARA>

<PARA>National Library of Australia</PARA>
<PARA> As I noted when I complained about this report, total expenses of $330,000 were involved in the relocation of the office and the retrenchment of staff when TUTA joined the whole horde of governmental authorities which are changing the location of their head office simply because the head of the organisation, appointed by the Government, is in a different location from that of the previous head or head office of that body. This is monumental waste. It is a disgrace. It seems to be the normal manner in which this Government conducts its business, and I think it should be strongly criticised. I hope TUTA's experience with its annual report will encourage it to report more accurately and more effectively so that it will not have to face the requirement next year of having to supply such a long list of corrigenda. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the papers. </PARA>
<PARA>In these times when we are conducting so much debate on matters with regard to film and video classification, this report is indeed welcomed as being informative and concise. The classification guidelines are clearly stated in this report. I remind the Senate of the classifications that we have in Australia. We have classification G, PG, M, R, X and videos and films which are refused classification. The films and videos which are refused classification are those which include `depictions of child sexual abuse, bestiality, sexual acts accompanied by offensive fetishes, or exploitative incest fantasies'; those which contain `unduly detailed, and/or relished acts of extreme violence or cruelty; explicit or unjustifiable depictions of sexual violence against non-consenting persons'; and those which contain detailed instruction or encouragement in . . . the use of terrorist-type weapons and terrorist acts' and `the abuse of proscribed drugs'. </PARA>
<PARA> The classifications for films and videos are the same with regard to R-rated videos; that is, there are virtually no restrictions on language in our films; sexual intercourse or other sexual activity maybe realistically implied or simulated; depictions of sexual violence are acceptable only to the extent that they are necessary to the narrative and not exploitative; violence may be highly realistic and explicit depictions of violence may be shown, but not if unduly detailed, relished or cruel; and drug abuse may be depicted but not in an advocatory manner. Extreme horror special effects usually warrant an R-rated certificate. </PARA>
<PARA> The report states that videos have an extra restricted classification if they contain material which includes explicit depictions of sexual acts involving adults, but do not include any depictions suggesting coercion or non-consent of any kind. There is an anomaly in the report because X-rated as a classification is also included for films, so I draw that to the Senate's attention. </PARA>
<PARA> There are some interesting statistics in the report with regard to the classifications made by the board during the 1987 year, and I would like to refer briefly to those. As far as videos are concerned, 30.67 per cent came into the G category; 17.67 per cent came into the PG category; 28.71 per cent came into the M category; 14.82 per cent came into the R category; and 6.68 per cent came into the X category. A total of 1.45 per cent was refused classification. It is also of interest to note the origin of the films and videos. The report states that 66.68 per cent of videos came from the United States of America (USA), 10.36 per cent came from the United Kingdom and 7.88 per cent came from Australia. It stated also that 38.13 per cent of films came from the USA, 16.45 per cent came from Hong Kong, which surprises me, 9.53 per cent originated in Australia, while 6.92 per cent came from the United Kingdom. I suggest there is scope for a labour intensive industry to be increased in Australia in the film and video business. I do not have time to refer to the activities of the Board of Review, except to express surprise at the number of videos and films which originally had an R classification but which were, on review, granted an M classification. I suggest that matter needs to be looked into. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the paper. </PARA>
<PARA>I want to raise this matter because I am a little concerned that the Government may seek to take some disciplinary action against the Australian Federal Police arising out of the industrial action that the AFP has taken over recent days. In the circumstances, the industrial action that was taken seems to me to be wholly responsible. The Australian Federal Police has been frustrated by this Government in that in its view, and it is a professional view, it has been unable to meet the statutory requirements of its office to provide the sort of security for the Australian people that it sees as its responsibility. It has been frustrated through a lack of adequate funding and a diversion of funding that has been necessary to a number of major investigations, including the investigation into the murder of Assistant Commissioner Winchester. </PARA>
<PARA> Regrettably these matters do occur from time to time, and we on this side of the chamber say that in such circumstances governments should meet their responsibility not only to fund adequately those investigations but also not at a cost to the balance of police work. That was what was occurring in Australia. This Government required the Australian Federal Police to conduct these new and major investigations at a cost to its existing work. </PARA>
<PARA> A number of examples have been put to this chamber. They have so frustrated the Australian Federal Police that it has been led to take that course of action, action that as I understand it is unprecedented for this police force. For example, I understand that basically throughout Australia the fraud units and other specialist units of the Australian Federal Police are now required to work office hours only, office hours being from 8 a.m. to 4 p.m. I would have thought that even this Government would have appreciated that a police force cannot operate on office hours. </PARA>
<PARA> A matter that was mentioned in this chamber by one of my colleagues a couple of days ago was ignored by the Minister for Justice (Senator Tate). Nevertheless, I will repeat it. We have good information that a recent drug surveillance operation in Sydney ceased at 11 p.m. because the police force conducting the operation ran out of overtime. We on this side of the chamber regard it as deplorable that major drug investigations-and they are one of the chief functions of the Australian Federal Police-have to be curtailed in such a way because the force is not adequately funded by this Government. </PARA>
<PARA> I refer to another matter-a significant fraud investigation in Sydney, which was to involve a number of search warrants which were to be executed out of office hours because that was the most effective time to gain the material that was being sought. At the last moment that operation had to be cancelled because the police force was unable to provide overtime for the officers concerned. I know that the intelligence and drug operations of the Australian Federal Police in South Australia are being restricted. I regard that as deplorable. </PARA>

The Minister's failure has led to a situation where the police have taken unprecedented industrial action, not to serve their own purposes but because they are frustrated that they are unable properly to do their job. The Minister has failed in that regard and his Government has failed. The police had to take industrial action to get even $500,000 partly to meet that shortfall. The Minister should have stood up for what he knew was necessary. He said he had sympathy for the position of the AFP, but Hawke and Keating had to make the decisions. What the Minister needs to do is show a bit more strength and leadership in this portfolio and then he might do something about lifting morale in the Australian Federal Police, which is at an all time low.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the report. </PARA>
<PARA>The inquiry which led to this report was the first comprehensive government or parliamentary inquiry into the Australian Audit Office since the Office of the Auditor-General was established at Federation in 1901. In the 88 years since then the Government and the Parliament have changed dramatically and the purpose and conduct of audits have also been transformed. The Committee examined the role of the Australian Audit Office and the Auditor-General in the light of those changes. </PARA>
<PARA> I stress that the report stands as an objective assessment of the need for reform of the Australian Audit Office and is above party political considerations. The Committee believes the report will be an enduring contribution to the reform of parliamentary democracy in Australia. It is a document relevant to the reform of the Audit Office not just at the Federal level but in the States and Territories and probably in other jurisdictions as well. It is a document of the Parliament for the Parliament and the people. </PARA>
<PARA> The terms of reference for the inquiry were, first, to investigate whether the Australian Audit Office had kept pace with developments in regard to the public audit function in the States and Territories and in comparable countries. The question was answered with a conditional no. The second term of reference concerned whether current arrangements guaranteed the independence and resources necessary for the Australian Audit Office to fulfil its role as determined by the Audit Act 1901. The answer to this question was no. </PARA>
<PARA> It must be pointed out that the reasons for these negative answers were largely outside the control of the Auditor-General and the Audit Office. The Auditor-General and the Australian Audit Office are responsible for reassuring Parliament that government's financial management and financial statements are sound. Considering the billions of dollars that the Commonwealth Government collects, manages and spends on behalf of all Australians, such reassurance is a foundation of citizens' belief in government. Without the Auditor-General's examination and reports on Commonwealth accounts, Parliament and ultimately the Australian people have less reason to feel confident in any statement by any department or statutory authority about its income and expenditure. </PARA>
<PARA> Therefore a strong and independent Auditor-General and Australian Audit Office are fundamental to the credibility of Audit opinions and the effectiveness of the Auditor-General and his staff. Independence has diminished practical value unless the Auditor-General has the human and material resources to exercise his responsibility. The report addresses the resources question by comparing three approaches to determining how many resources the Auditor-General requires. In theory the Auditor-General, Parliament or Government can determine how many resources are necessary for audit. The inquiry report compares and contrasts how these approaches work in different countries. It concluded that the least desirable basis for maintaining the independence and resources of the Auditor-General and the Audit Office was where the executive government determined audit resources. </PARA>
<PARA> Australia is one of the few comparable countries where the Government has such influence over decisions on audit resources. The ideal situation is either where the Auditor-General makes a professional decision on how many resources are necessary for him or her to be able to give an opinion on a government's accounts or where Parliament itself makes that decision. The Canadian Auditor-General has very great discretion over how many resources he needs. The Committee rejected the Canadian model as unsuitable for Australia. The Committee's recommendation was for Parliament to decide on how many resources it wanted to allocate for audit. This approach has been adopted by the British Parliament in recent years with the support of both Government and Opposition. </PARA>
<PARA> The Auditor-General audits the Government accounts on behalf of the Parliament and, through the Parliament, on behalf of the Australian people. The Committee believes that fundamental to reform of the Australian Audit Office is a more open and clearer acknowledgment of this Parliament. Consistent with this emphasis, the Committee recommended the establishment of an audit committee of Parliament comprising Government and Opposition members and senators and chaired by the President of the Senate and the Speaker of the House of Representatives alternately. The audit committee of Parliament would advise the Auditor-General on Parliament's audit priorities and make recommendations to Parliament on the Audit Office resources. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn to the question of human resources. The Audit Office has very many talented staff. However, in recent years it has lost many able personnel because the salaries of senior and specialist staff have lagged behind incomes available in the private sector. For example, the Australian Audit Office staff member responsible for audit of the Commonwealth Banking Corporation earns from one-third to one-quarter of the income of private sector auditors in charge of the audit of Australia's other large banks. Yet there is no evidence that the standard of the Commonwealth Bank audit is any different from that of private sector audits of very large banks. </PARA>
<PARA> Salary differentials between experienced auditors in the private and public sectors are now so substantial that the Audit Office is also having difficulty in recruiting junior staff. Thus there are two problems: how to attract young, new staff and how to maintain senior staff. It is so difficult for the Audit Office to recruit and maintain staff that Parliament must be made aware of the dangers that the current circumstances create for the strength and capacity of the Audit Office. The Committee recommends that the best way to overcome this problem is to establish the Australian Audit Office as a statutory authority and to give the Auditor-General the authority to determine the terms and conditions of employment of staff. </PARA>
<PARA> I now turn to the relationship between auditing and a more efficient public sector. The practice of auditing has evolved so that auditors now have techniques to analyse how efficiently Government programs are managed. The authority to conduct efficiency audits was introduced into the Audit Act in 1979 following recommendations of the Royal Commission on Australian Government Administration. Internationally, efficiency audits-or value for money audits, as they are sometimes called-utilise a very large part of the General Accounting Office's resources in the USA, while in Canada and the UK approximately half of the resources of the national audit offices are dedicated to efficiency audits. In comparison, the Australian Audit Office devoted 6 per cent of its resources to efficiency audits in 1987-88. No witness in the inquiry argued that this should continue. </PARA>
<PARA> To demonstrate the importance of efficiency audits, I recall that one prominent participant in our inquiry made a point to the effect that when an auditor enters an institution to conduct a regulatory audit the person behind the cash register feels the pressure but when an auditor arrives to conduct an efficiency audit the permanent secretary or head of the organisation gets nervous. A situation wherein only 6 per cent of the Australian Audit Office resources are set aside for efficiency audits is not compatible with a commitment to increase public sector efficiency. </PARA>
<PARA> Accordingly, the Committee recommended a major change in the Audit Office's orientation. There can be no reduction in resources for financial and compliance auditing. Therefore the only way in which more resources can be allocated to efficiency audits to improve public sector efficiency is if more resources are allocated to the Australian Audit Office. The Committee has recommended that an additional $3.1m be allocated to the Audit Office in 1989-90. This will increase to an additional $15.7m within five years. Consequently, by 1994-95 approximately 50 per cent of the Australian Audit Office's resources and effort will be for efficiency audits. The effect of this will be to place increased emphasis on maximising the efficiency of the public sector. Despite differing views held by Committee members on the role and size of the public sector, we are on common ground in believing that the public sector, whatever its size, must be both efficient and accountable. </PARA>
<PARA> In conclusion, I turn to an issue which lies at the heart of the inquiry, namely, the relationship between executive government and the Parliament. The year 1988-89 was the 300th anniversary of the drafting in London of the Bill of Rights. This Bill of Rights was one of the foundations of parliamentary democracy not just in the United Kingdom but in many other countries around the world, including Canada, New Zealand and Australia. One achievement of the Bill of Rights was to assert executive government's accountability to the entire Parliament. The United Kingdom Exchequer and Audit Department Act 1866 on which the Australian Audit Act 1901 was based was another milestone in the evolution of accountability of government to Parliament. Indicative of the importance of the Audit Act 1901 was the fact that it was the fourth Act to be passed by the first Australian Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> The report of the inquiry into the Audit Office points the next step forward to strengthen public sector accountability to the Australian Parliament. Political activity in the twentieth century in Australia has been characterised by the increasing domination of Parliament by the executive government. This increasing domination has occurred whichever political party or coalition has been in power. The results of the inquiry into the Australian Audit Office now provide the Parliament with an opportunity to strengthen the accountability of Executive Government to Parliament. For this purpose the Committee has recommended the repeal of the Audit Act 1901 and its replacement by two laws-a new Audit Act and a new financial administration Act for the Commonwealth. New audit legislation will be a cornerstone for relationships between Parliament and the Government for the remainder of this century and into the next. It is my deepest hope that the report will be the catalyst for further reform in this particular area. </PARA>
<PARA> I have a few further comments to make on this report. It is a recommendation of the Committee that an advisory committee be established by the Auditor-General with representatives from the private sector, universities and auditees to advise him on developments in private sector audit. This should be a milestone in the evolution of auditing procedures and practices. A further recommendation is that an additional committee be established to advise the Auditor-General on audit practices and ensure that the principal government audit authority is fully aware of practices in private enterprise in the field audit. </PARA>
<PARA> A further matter that must be drawn to the attention of the Senate is that there be established an interchange scheme to provide officers of the Australian Audit Office with the opportunity to be seconded to the private sector firms. Right at the end of the report there is a recommendation which I believe to be quite important. The Committee recommends that the Australian Audit Office plan for a new building within or close to the Parliamentary Triangle and that the new building be called Audit House. We are already aware of problems concerning the stability of its present office. I believe that this would provide a physical recognition of the close relationship between the Australian Audit Office and the separation of the Audit Office from other government departments which do not have the same important linkage. </PARA>
<PARA> I am also concerned about a number of issues that may come to light unless the Government provides adequate resources to the Australian Audit Office. In the report we have drawn attention to an increase in responsibility for the Australian Audit Office. I draw attention to recommendation 38, which says that it should devote significant resources to follow up performance audits. That has certainly been a criticism in the past. It recommends that it adopt a systematic approach to follow-up performance audit findings. Recommendation 39 says that follow-up procedures for performance audits should be linked to follow-up procedures for regularity audits. In addition, in section 76 we recommend that the Australian Audit Office undertake an efficiency audit of the internal audit of the Commonwealth sector. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the problems nowadays under this new philosophy of risk management is that many departmental secretaries are sacrificing the internal audit function under this concept of risk management. I believe that this attitude is just not good enough. It is certainly putting additional responsibilities on the Australian Audit Office. </PARA>
<PARA> I am deeply concerned that while we are talking about giving additional responsibilities to the Audit Office to undertake to audit statutory marketing authorities, and so on, some of the audits they are currently doing are quite unsatisfactory. For example, at the Public Accounts Committee inquiry into the Antarctic today the Auditor-General said that on only three occasions within 10 years had it audited aspects of the Antarctic Division in Hobart. Given the history of that particular institution, that is clearly not good enough. When we further questioned how comprehensive those audits were, we found out that they covered only certain aspects of the operation. In other words, a cyclical approach was used. Under such circumstances, this leads to severe questioning of the stewardship of certain assets owned by the Commonwealth. </PARA>
<PARA> I call upon the Government not only to provide additional resources but also to ensure that the Australian Audit Office more comprehensively audits on a more regular basis those responsibilities which come within its present domain. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In rising to take note of the report of the Public Accounts Committee, I want to support the remarks of my colleague Senator Watson in directing the Senate's attention, and hopefully its careful study, to the report of the Committee entitled The Auditor-General: Ally of the People and Parliament. As Senator Watson said, it is a bipartisan report in the sense that there is a commitment by all members of the Committee to truly strengthen the role of the Auditor-General and use him as the method of accounting to the Parliament and therefore to the people for the expenditure of Government moneys.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator Watson has already outlined many of the important findings of the report but there are one or two points I would like to mention specially. We are all concerned about the increase-the creeping increase, in a way-in the ways in which executive government is taking over the function of the Parliament and in which the function of accounting to the Parliament is becoming less and less. Of particular concern to me is the practice that this Government has entered into of pushing more and more government functions off the budget sheet so that the appropriations are not made and are therefore not subject to scrutiny through the Estimates committees. Once a function of government is corporatised, or whatever other mechanism the Government chooses to use, and it is pushed off Budget, the Minister tends to say, `It is at arm's length and therefore I am not accountable'. From my point of view, I find the answer to the dilemma to be privatisation. Those activities, if privatised, would then be answerable to shareholders. Bearing in mind that that is presently not the case, there is a concern that where Government moneys are spent the scrutiny and accountability are of a different standard from that used by private auditors when auditing either public or private companies. </PARA>
<PARA> I think it is most important to realise that the only link this Parliament has with many government business enterprises-with so-called corporatised activities-is the Auditor-General. There has also been evidence to suggest that some of these organisations be given permission to use private auditors and to bypass the Auditor-General. When I say that my very strong feeling is that it should be the Auditor-General who continues this auditing process, I am in no way disparaging the work, the ethics or the ability of private audit firms. I am merely saying it because I believe that where public moneys are expended, the responsibility of reporting to the Parliament is different from that of a board of directors reporting to its shareholders. Therefore, the role of the Auditor-General is a different role from the role of auditors in the private sector. I find that with the practice we presently have in place, whereby the executive arm of Government, via the Department of Finance, determines what the resources of the Auditor-General are, executive government can effectively curtail the activities of the Auditor-General. I find that is very strongly against the public interest. The report recommends one way in which there can be an interaction between the Auditor-General and using the skills of the private sector: that is for the Auditor-General to be able to use the private sector as a contractor in some approved instances. I think this could be a very useful development. But the responsibility must finally be for the Auditor-General to be the continuing link between this Parliament and the expenditure of Government moneys. </PARA>
<PARA> There is another strong recommendation made to which I would like to draw particular attention because I have had cause to look at this question in another committee. Recommendation 35 recommends amendment of section 48C of the existing Audit Act but, hopefully, if our recommendation to repeal the old Act and introduce fresh legislation is accepted, then, accordingly, a fresh section would be drafted that would carry out the recommendation. That recommendation is that the Auditor-General would be permitted to conduct an efficiency audit on an eligible incorporated company without a Minister's permission; further, that the definition of `eligible incorporated company' be amended to give effect to the Committee's concerns that the current definition excludes a company which is incorporated as an initiative of the Commonwealth and which receives the majority of its funding from the Commonwealth but which for policy reasons has a board of directors on which Commonwealth representatives are in a minority. This is exactly the sort of situation I was talking about before. Immediately prior to that recommendation there is a paragraph which I think is important to read. It is paragraph 12.18 on page 170 of the report which states:</PARA>
<PARA> The Committee is rather concerned that the definition of `eligible incorporated company' is excessively narrow in that it is limited to circumstances where the incorporated company is one over which the Commonwealth is in a position to exercise control. Such a definition excludes a company which is incorporated at the intention of the Commonwealth and which receives the majority of its funding from the Commonwealth but which for some public policy reason has a representative board of directors in which the Commonwealth representatives are in a minority-</PARA>
<PARA>as per the recommendation-</PARA>
<PARA>An example is the Australian Bicentennial Authority, ABA, which was incorporated at the behest of the Commonwealth, performed important national functions and which received the majority of its funds from the Commonwealth. The Auditor-General did not have the power under the 1979 Amendments to conduct an efficiency audit of the ABA without the permission of the ABA or the Minister. </PARA>
<PARA>That permission was asked for but was not forthcoming and, accordingly, the efficiency audit was not carried out. We found that to be an unacceptable practice. It is simply not acceptable for an efficiency audit to depend upon an auditee granting permission. </PARA>
<PARA> Overall, this report is profound. It deals with the importance of the office of Auditor-General. It deals in great detail with the options for reform that are available. It comes down with a set of finely tuned recommendations covering the interaction between the expenditure of public moneys by executive government as authorised by the Parliament-by way of the appropriations, and scrutinised under Estimates and Government moneys which are spent without such scrutiny. If people think of the Auditor-General, as we have entitled the report, as `an ally of the people and Parliament', and the report is considered in that way, then it ought to have bipartisan support. Its recommendations ought to be introduced as soon as possible and dealt with by the Government. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This report deals with the somewhat limited role that the Museum has as a consequence of the Government putting it somewhat on ice. The report refers to the functions of the Museum as being to develop and maintain a national collection of historical material and to exhibit, or make available for exhibition by others, historical material from the national historical collection or historical material that is otherwise in the possession of the Museum. It goes on to list the other activities and functions that the Museum is able to undertake. It is a pity that this Government seems to lack commitment to the Museum. The Museum of Australia would be totally different from any other museum that exists in any other part of Australia, and is holding and collecting material which has a quite different purpose and function from the museums which already exist. It seems to me that within the Government there are people who do not understand the reason why it was established and the function and purpose that it is to carry out. It is a great pity that, in the year of the bicentenary, the Government chose to downgrade the advancement of the Museum and did not get on with the construction of it. I would have thought that the bicentenary year was the year to give it a boost. I am well aware that the Government has got the economy into serious difficulties and that money is short, but even at such a time there are certain things which ought to be done for the longer term benefit of Australians who will want to see much of the material that, I believe, is being lost because the Museum is not able to get on with the work that it was established to do. It is doing something quite different from the States, and that needs to be recognised.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The other thing that perhaps it ought to be doing is getting on with looking after and developing the old Parliament House. This is a matter that I have been speaking about now for some four years or more. The old Parliament House is being left to be taken over by the cockroaches. At the same time, the Government is busily planning to put a child-care centre in its grounds without determining what should happen to the building first. There is a good case for suggesting that it should be restored to its 1927 configuration and be made available to the Australian people as a political and constitutional museum. I believe that we are losing material of that era that ought to be in that building and ought to be made available. The Museum of Australia is the organisation which ought to have the responsibility for that and, of course, the funding that would enable it to proceed. I trust that I will not need to speak in a similar vein this time next year when the National Museum of Australia annual report comes before the Senate and that reasonable funding will be made available to enable us to protect the heritage of this country and know that our children and grandchildren will have the benefit and understanding of what has gone before. It is all very well to shout that we have not got the money, but there are some things that need to be done in balance and in harmony, and this is one of them. I urge the Government to see that the report next year does not start of by saying, `For the third year in succession the National Museum of Australia was very much on hold'. Hopefully, that will not be the case. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I could take the rest of the afternoon talking about health in the Australian Capital Territory (ACT), but I shall refrain from doing so. I have frequently spoken on this before. Most people in Canberra and nationally realise by now that, as a consequence of Medicare, the health services in the Australian Capital Territory have, in some instances, almost ground to a halt. There are a couple of aspects of this matter that I wish to refer to-in particular, the rehabilitation and aged care services. I remind the Senate that we do not have enough beds for those who need to be in nursing homes. A number of people who need 24-hour care and nursing home care are in hospital beds but we have not yet managed to find sufficient resources to look after adequately the people who, perhaps, having stayed in their own homes for as long as they possibly could, finally get to the stage where they need the care that can be provided only in a nursing home. We have not done well enough in this community to provide for those people.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The other group we have not taken adequate care of are those who suffer from mental illness. The report under the heading of `Mental Health Services and Intellectual Disability Services' deals with the services available. To the extent that the Health Authority is dealing in these areas with the resources that it has, it is doing its best. But the clear fact is that we are not adequately providing services for those who are suffering from, in particular, schizophrenia and certainly not for the families who are attempting to deal with it. All too often one hears of suicides and other tragedies affecting people that are not able to get the services required. Frequently they will not be admitted to Woden Valley Hospital when they are taken there. They drift around from one place to another. </PARA>
<PARA> Somehow, we just do not seem to have got on to the right wavelength to deal with the tragedy of this problem in our community. There are a number of rehabilitation facilities and services but we are not doing well enough, particularly for the group that I have mentioned. While recognising what is referred to here, it is an area where we have a great deal more to do in the Australian Capital Territory before we can feel that we have dealt with the problem. </PARA>
<PARA> I commend the health service on the program that is provided to promote the immunisation of children against measles. It is referred to on page 24 of this report. I recently attended on a somewhat wet afternoon the Teddy Bears' health service, on the lawns outside the old Parliament House. It was held on the last day of the festivities in conjunction with the Canberra Festival and the Family Day. Many members of the Australian Capital Territory Health and Community Services Department gave of their time that day to encourage parents to realise the necessity for immunisation against measles and to encourage children to participate in a way which was meaningful for them. An excellent facility was set up. Cath Bourke, who is the ACT Citizen of the year, opened the day. It gladdened one's heart to see the number of little people there with their bears at the bears' immunisation clinic. It is certainly the right way to go about making every endeavour to eliminate this disease. It is being dealt with most effectively in the Australian Capital Territory. </PARA>
<PARA> Others could perhaps take a leaf out of this book and proceed with the same sort of programs. Similarly, I mention the scoliosis screening in Australian Capital Territory high schools. There can be no doubt that prevention in these areas is the much better course. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wrote to the Minister for the Arts and Territories (Mr Holding) about this matter in November last year, recognising, of course, that the Inspectorate was part of the Department of Industrial Relations. I drew to the Minister's attention the significance of the change which was to take place by basing the management of the Australian Capital Territory Inspectorate principally in Sydney. I pointed out to the Minister that I felt that this was not in the best interests of local employer organisations. I rather hoped that he would take the matter up as something that was significant for the private sector in Canberra and for those who work here. Unfortunately, he did not quite do that. He referred the matter to the Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Peter Morris). On 23 January, I received an acknowledgment from the Minister for the Arts and Territories indicating that that had been done. Unfortunately I have not yet had any response from the Minister for Industrial Relations. Perhaps he does not care about us.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Under the restructuring that was put in train by the Government after the 1987 election, the Inspectorate was to be based principally in Sydney. There is a portion of the report that refers to the major role of the central office and the development of the regional directorates which place us, as indicated on page 3, under the direction of the New South Wales Regional Director. I personally think that that was most inappropriate. The awards that are looked after by the Inspectorate are Australian Capital Territory awards; they are not New South Wales awards. Some 52 or so awards are looked after and they are different from those in New South Wales. I do not know why the Government felt that that was the best course. But now, in relation to a number of matters, the level of staffing left in the Australian Capital Territory will not have the former responsibility and decisions will have to be made in Sydney. People will need to be sent down from Sydney to deal with many matters that will arise. It seems to me totally inefficient and inappropriate to proceed along those lines. </PARA>
<PARA> Reading the report and seeing that the awards here are different, set out as it is and the way it is, I ask the Government to reconsider the approach it has taken. If it values the Inspectorate in the Australian Capital Territory at all, I think that it should have its management here and not be part of regional management from New South Wales. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the paper. </PARA>
<PARA>This is the report from the Australian Science and Technology Council entitled Health, Politics, Trade: Controlling Chemical Residues in Agricultural Products. I comment first on the membership of the Australian Science and Technology Council. It masquerades-I think that is the appropriate term-under the title ASTEC: This report considers the controlling of chemical residues in agricultural products. When one looks at the membership of ASTEC one finds that there is probably only one person on that Council who could claim expertise in any sense in this area. That fact is worth noting. This Council often has these sorts of matters referred to it. It has a certain aura of authority about it which perhaps, when one looks at it, is belied by the membership. </PARA>
<PARA> The two matters I particularly want to comment on today are the failure of the Government adequately to fund research in the area of alternatives to chemicals and the fact that the executive summary makes some rather interesting comments when, in one place, it states that there is a surplus of agricultural products, but in another, further on, it seems to accept the valuations that, I am almost certain, have been given to it by the Agricultural and Veterinary Chemicals Association of Australia (AVCAA). As to the benefit of agricultural chemicals, one could argue that we would be better off if we even suffered some diminution in productivity because the price of food would substantially increase. That might be to the benefit of the producers. Having said that, and having pointed out that health authorities generally do not regard the European Community's action with respect to chemical residues in food as warranted, the report continues:</PARA>
<PARA>Consumers who can afford to choose have made it clear that chemical quality is a factor in what they buy, regardless of assurances from health authorities. </PARA>
<PARA>Therein lies a very significant indicator for Australia, in that our overseas trade in food produced in this country will be increasingly dependent upon our ability to assure overseas consumers that our food is free of contact with agricultural chemicals and, should we further entertain food irradiation, that it has not been irradiated. The report states, in effect, that for this reason there is a need for research into alternatives to chemicals. It continues:</PARA>
<PARA>Research and development expenditure on alternatives in 1988 was only 2 per cent of that spent by farmers on chemicals. This expenditure is inadequate to meet long-term market requirements. </PARA>
<PARA>One finds a very serious criticism of the Government, which has very substantially cut funding for the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation in precisely those areas in which CSIRO was carrying out research into integrated pest management and methods of biological control which would avoid the use of heavy applications of chemicals or, in some cases, avoid the applications of chemicals altogether. As I have pointed out previously-but it needs stressing-the Government is being quite naive if it believes that private industry will take up the funding of that research work. The industry that may take up such funding, of course, is the chemical industry. The chemical industry would find it inimical to its short term interests to fund that sort of research. Therefore, that research is simply not being funded. ASTEC recommends as follows:</PARA>
<PARA>We consider that increased expenditure on alternatives to chemicals would be economically sensible-</PARA>
<PARA>I stress, `would be economically sensible'. The organisation is making a judgment, not about the health value, but that it would be economically sensible to do this. It continues:</PARA>
<PARA>and will be essential to meet the new demands of the market place. </PARA>
<PARA>Again, there is an emphasis on the economic aspects; yet we find this Government cutting the amount of money that it is spending in this area and naively expecting private industry to pick up an area of research which private industry, by the very nature of things, will simply not pick up. The report specifically stresses that in this research it is important that CSIRO maintain its research emphasis on alternatives to agricultural chemicals. It states that the Australian Research Council should establish a key centre of research and teaching in integrated pest management, which I find a rather peculiar recommendation. When CSIRO is carrying out that work, why should a new body be established to do that work? The report continues:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . the establishment of integrated pest management as a priority by State Departments of Agriculture . . . </PARA>
<PARA>Surely, this is the sort of work which should be integrated with the body which has traditionally carried out this work, and carried out this work extremely well, as Senator Powell indicated earlier. Finally, the report stresses that there should be a greatly increased commitment by the Rural Industry Research Fund to fund this research. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I, too, wish to make some remarks on the report by the Australian Science and Technology Council (ASTEC) entitled Health, Politics, Trade, which is a report on controlling chemical residues in agricultural products. It is a study which was set in train in the aftermath of the chemical residue problem, highlighted by the problem with our beef exports to the United States which resulted in a $20m screening program for organochlorine residues being mounted. A clearance program for over 100,000 farms Australia-wide was mounted. The report notes that, as of January this year, 1,000 farms still remain quarantined. Clearly, it is a major problem, at least in that industry. The section entitled `Executive Summary' reads:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>The major conclusion of the report is that chemical residues are not an undue health hazard to consumers of Australian agricultural produce, but chemical residues are an important factor in the marketing of this produce. </PARA>
<PARA>In chapter one of the report we find this comment:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . there are about 400 active ingredients used in agricultural chemicals sold in Australia. Furthermore, knowledge of the effects of particular chemicals is changing all the time, and regulatory systems must take this into account. Despite these difficulties, we feel confident in stating that chemical residues in agricultural products are not an undue health hazard to consumers of Australian agricultural produce . . . </PARA>
<PARA>My colleague Senator Coulter has drawn attention to another comment in the report in which ASTEC notes that those consumers who can afford to are choosing chemical free produce and that this is therefore opening up a market, which leads ASTEC to make recommendations of an economic nature. Clearly, the community does not accept that major conclusion, and therein lie both an opportunity and a challenge for the Australian agricultural sector and for the Australian community as a whole. </PARA>
<PARA> I draw attention to a warning in the report that we need more analytical chemists to meet this challenge. I believe that we need appropriate forms and methods of analysis, especially with regard to the chemical cocktail. We must go beyond looking at one chemical component in perhaps one food product. We need to be able to look at the context of everybody's personal workplace and social environment with regard to chemicals. </PARA>
<PARA> I focus for the few minutes remaining to me on the recommendation on funding for research on effective and economic alternatives. I stress, as Senator Coulter has, that ASTEC puts forward proposals for increased funding on the basis that they make good economic sense-a point which the Australian Democrats, since they came to this place and even before then, have been making for many years. It is good to see it repeated in this report. We hope that as a nation we are able to take up this challenge. I draw attention to comments on the method of funding. Senator Coulter has already mentioned some of those. The report makes the following point:</PARA>
<PARA> It is important to recognise that, unlike chemicals, biological control and biotechnology methods generally do not provide patentable products that can be sold to recoup development costs. </PARA>
<PARA>Therefore, it will not be done by the private sector, which is profit oriented or, at the very least cost recovery oriented. The report continues:</PARA>
<PARA> Such research will not be funded through the individual rational decisions of producers expressed in a conventional economic market, but must either be funded by producers through a levy system or by Government. </PARA>
<PARA>I do not want us to exclude the possibility that it be funded through a levy on chemicals. Only 2 per cent of the value of chemicals used by farmers in this country goes into research at present. If, for instance, we added a 2 per cent levy, we would double the amount of funding available by that one means alone. We must meet the needs of the market. We must meet this challenge as a nation. We must see it as a fully national challenge, not just something which is confined to the agricultural sector. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the papers. </PARA>
<PARA>These papers deal with International Labour Conference conventions or recommendations concerning the welfare, health and repatriation of seafarers. These International Labour Organisation (ILO) conventions are designed to protect all seafarers in all ports. Nobody would have any quarrel about that. However, there has been too little time to examine these conventions and recommendations in close detail and to consider their implications in the light of the past history of this Government's handling of these matters. </PARA>
<PARA> Honourable senators may recall that the ILO sets the guidelines for the standard of ships. In 1986 our Navigation Act was amended to give the Government power to prescribe health conditions which could be imposed on foreign registered ships visiting Australian ports. This was purported to be in accordance with article 4 of the ILO convention No. 147, which says in effect that we may take measures necessary to rectify any conditions on board a foreign registered ship which are clearly hazardous to safety or health. </PARA>
<PARA> It is clearly reasonable that Australia should have the power to enforce suitable health and safety standards on foreign registered ships, but only in cases which affect our own interests or the safety or health of our own people. In 1987 we introduced a set of marine orders which allowed this Government to enforce standards on foreign ships-not only ILO standards but standards far in excess of those recommended by the ILO. For instance, we insisted in these marine orders that flyscreens be fitted to all portholes, ventilators and doors. These are not required by the ILO conventions. In other words, we could detain ships on such a trivial matter in this country. We can also detain ships if light fittings are not fitted with globes or tubes to the full value of the fitting. One can make an argument that these things should be done, but it is a question of whether it is our job to enforce them in foreign ships when they in no way affect the safety or health of our community. But we have done it. I will give the Senate just one example. </PARA>
<PARA> On 11 November 1987 we delayed a foreign ship for four days because it had light covers missing in toilets and showers and had light fittings and bulbs missing from the crew's recreation rooms. None of this was our business, nor was it required by the ILO convention. </PARA>
<PARA> Honourable senators might like to look at paper No. 7 on the list, which deals with the welfare facilities and amenities which should be provided on board ship for the benefit of the crew. These include television viewing and the reception of radio broadcasts, projection of films or videos, stock of which should be adequate for the voyage, sports equipment, exercise equipment, table games and deck games, a library, facilities for recreational handicrafts, and the provision of bars on board ships. I am not saying that these things might not be desirable on board ships, but the question is: should we have the right to enforce these on foreign flag ships? We all know that militant unions have harassed and disrupted foreign owned ships in the past to the detriment of our exports and imports and our whole community. I am worried lest these conventions might provide more ammunition for future disruptions. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the paper. </PARA>
<PARA>The slender annual report of the Pharmaceutical Benefits Pricing Authority, which is six pages in length, reports on a six-month period, yet it has taken nine months to reach Parliament, and the covering letter inside it is not dated, so we do not know where the hold-up was. The report claims that the Pharmaceutical Benefits Pricing Authority is `more independent' than the bureau which it replaced. But one wonders what is meant by this when the Authority is merely implementing this Labor Government's haphazard policy in this area under tight ministerial control. And what is the policy? It is an application of bandaids, without proper review, to a scheme badly in need of major remedial surgery. </PARA>
<PARA> I find it interesting to note that the consumer nominee on the Authority is not identified as a member of any of the bodies which make up the Consumers Health Forum, but is listed as a consultant to the Health Forum and his background, we understand, is another Government department. The reason I mention this is that the pharmacists and consumers of pharmaceuticals should be aware of the membership of the Authority and assess whether such are in a position `to represent accurately the views of the majority of the community who do not belong to organised groups'. That quote is from the Government's own review of community participation when the Consumers Health Forum was established by the Minister for Community Services and Health (Dr Blewett). </PARA>
<PARA> Page 4 of this six-page report reveals that the major beneficiaries-if we can really currently call them that-of this scheme are pensioners. Eighty-two per cent of the pharmaceutical benefits scheme budget is spent on pensioners, most of whom would be age pensioners. Basically, we are talking about a scheme for the elderly. This Government has set in train vast policy changes, many of which have had an impact on the older Australian. There have been changes to the income and assets tests on pensions, capital gains taxes, nursing home and hostel funding, Medicare and health insurance, and now, to cap it off, the aged have to come to terms with their pills being in different packets with different names. If those on the other side of the Senate do not think this has been an added burden, let them go into pharmacies across this nation to hear how it is. Pharmacist after pharmacist will tell them that the new policy is a shemozzle. In fact, I would have to resort to unparliamentary language to quote what pharmacists have said. The latest confusion strengthens the Opposition's earlier call for a total review of the pharmaceutical benefits scheme. </PARA>
<PARA> The report before us justifies the latest round of changes, which came into effect last Saturday-April Fools' Day-as being needed to offset, in part, the costs of the Government's industry development policy. It has been the cruellest kind of April Fools joke on the sick and elderly of this nation. Twenty-one branded drugs have been delisted. The generic drugs supposed to replace them have simply not been available for much of this week from the wholesalers. Pharmacists around the country are reporting that there are no supplies of generics, and that the supplies of the delisted substitutes have dried up as well because of the change. The drug users are confused-and no wonder. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister for Housing and Aged Care (Mr Staples) issued a question and answer kit for members and senators which pharmacists have described to me as being full of misrepresentations, inaccuracies and untruths. The Australian Pensioners Federation has been enlisted as part of this propaganda exercise-like the Price Watch business. It in turn cited as its authority such organisations as the Consumers Health Forum, a body which was set up by the Government and whose representative nature is very doubtful where the majority of consumers are concerned. </PARA>
<PARA> It is high time that this Government came to terms with the fact that this is an ageing society and that ageing inevitably produces health problems. We need a comprehensive review of the pharmaceutical benefits scheme that takes this fundamental into account. We do not need more April Fools tricks played on our elderly citizens. I seek leave to continue my remarks later. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-The Pharmaceutical Benefits Pricing Authority was established as a non-statutory body on 1 January 1988. Its role is to review the prices of products listed under the pharmaceutical benefits scheme. Its report for the year ended 30 June 1988 provides an opportunity for us to review the principles and objectives of the Authority. Of particular interest is the section dealing with the factors considered in the setting of prices. These prices have an impact on manufacturers, wholesalers, pharmacists, and ultimately on consumers who pay the cost of the drug. The report also spells out the means by which prices are calculated. It is interesting to note that one of the factors, and one which I would certainly support, is the level of activity being undertaken by the Authority in Australia, including new investment, production and research and development where the activity is oriented towards international competitiveness. This factor obviously serves to develop in our country an internationally competitive pharmaceutical products industry.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It would be remiss of me not to take this opportunity to bring to the Senate's attention action which Tasmanian pharmacists were forced to take recently as a result of the treatment they have been receiving from this Government. I understand that Senator Watson spoke on this subject during today's lunchtime proceedings. On Tuesday 22 March 1989, 171 out of 176 chemists in Tasmania created history by closing their doors for three hours. The stop-work meeting was organised by the Tasmanian branch of the Pharmacy Guild of Australia to protest in the strongest terms the changes to the health system in the last 16 months, particularly the dropping of 12 brands of drugs from the pharmaceutical benefits scheme. That Tasmanian pharmacists were forced to take such drastic action does not surprise me in the least. I have had so many protests from chemists over the way in which they have been treated, and I know that this House has had thousands of signatures presented to it in the form of petitions and in other ways. </PARA>
<PARA> Much of the treatment which pharmacists have been receiving relates to the wish of the Minister for Finance (Senator Walsh) to trim $300m from the pharmaceutical benefits scheme. As a result bureaucrats have been experimenting with a number of means by which they can achieve these cutbacks. However, it is the chemists and patients who are suffering the most. The payment of claims has been inexcusably slow and this has caused severe financial hardship, particularly for chemists operating in rural areas. On more than one occasion I have presented petitions and concerns to the Minister on these matters. The Government does not seem to realise that chemists are forced to pay for supplies which they receive from wholesalers, and yet the Government does not provide the payments to allow this to happen. It has been brought to my attention that many pharmacists could be facing bankruptcy if the situation does not change. </PARA>
<PARA> A further concern is the decision by the Government to drop 12 brands of drugs from the pharmaceutical benefits scheme from 1 April and to replace them with alternative generic brands. This move has caused confusion and a great deal of discussion in the community. The elderly and the chronically ill are the least able to cope with this initiative. Further problems have been experienced in Tasmania because half the generic equivalent drugs are out of stock and unavailable in the State. Though doctors have been in a position where they have been obliged to prescribe the alternatives, chemists have been unable to fill the prescriptions. The Pharmacy Guild's Tasmanian Branch President, Mr John Cleary, informed me that Tasmanian wholesalers were out of stock of many of these drugs. </PARA>
<PARA> In defence of its situation the Government has claimed that pharmacists were deliberately misleading the public. It was also claimed by the Federal Minister for Community Services and Health (Dr Blewett), along with Mr Duncan Kerr, the member for Denison, and Senator Devereux, that all the drug brands which were delisted had an alternative and that therefore no patients would be disadvantaged. The facts are that the drug ammonium chloride, which is used by paraplegics to control the acidity level in their urine and to prevent urinary tract infections, is no longer available under the pharmaceutical benefits scheme. No alternative exists; so the drug must be purchased at the full rate. That is an absolute disgrace. It should be changed by this Government immediately. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That the Senate take note of the report. </PARA>
<PARA>I have the honour to be one of the two representatives of the Parliament on the Council of the National Library of Australia, and I want to say a few words in that capacity. The first matter I want to mention is that the Chairman of the Council at the time covered by this report was Morris West. Morris West has since retired. I would like to commend him for his excellent service to the Council and to the nation in that capacity. I have found him a most impressive person-one who has, obviously, not only a great capacity but also a great humility. His contribution to the Library leaves a mark that will demonstrate his wider contribution to the Australian community. He will be replaced by Sir Ninian Stephen, somebody who also exhibits both of those qualities. I am sure that he also will carry on the fine tradition of chairmanship and leadership that Morris West has set. </PARA>
<PARA> Morris West took as his charter a responsibility to extend the public programs of the Library. He had a great belief that it was important that the Library, its staff and its collections were effectively taken to the people. This promotion or extension of the Library into the community was his goal. The list of the Library's exhibitions which appears in this annual report provides an ample demonstration of the success of his charter. The highlight of this year's exhibition was, of course, the Library's major bicentennial exhibition, People, Print &amp; Paper, a celebration of the books of Australia. This exhibition celebrated 200 years of Australian life and culture through its books, writers, printers, booksellers and publishers. The standard of presentation and the quality of the exhibits, most of which came from the National Library's own collection, again demonstrated the depth and strength not only of the collection but also of the people who work for and who are involved in supporting the Library. </PARA>
<PARA> Since this annual report was written there has been a more controversial exhibition, which some of my colleagues have mentioned before-the constitutional exhibition. Certainly some of the matters in that exhibition gave cause for an interpretation of bias. I want to put on the public record tonight that I am absolutely satisfied that there was no deliberate attempt at bias on the part of the National Library staff. It would be the last thing that they would want to do. </PARA>
<PARA> In these few minutes I also want to make mention of the leadership role that the National Library plays in the library community in Australia. I would like to record a recognition of the work that is done by the Director-General, Warren Horton, and his staff, which rightly claims that distinction. Their leadership and professionalism is something that I admire, and something of which this Parliament should be proud. I am very pleased to be able to say that here tonight. </PARA>
<PARA> The last matter I want to raise is my one matter of regret, but I feel I have no choice but to mention it in these few comments. I refer to the attitude of this Government to the funding of the National Library, particularly to the book vote. I remind the Government that reducing the book vote creates a loss to the nation that can never be recovered. I think that was demonstrated by the estimates last year. I have time to say only that, in terms of monographs and printed books, the Library estimated that approximately 50 per cent of its purchasing power had been lost due to this Government's attitude to funding of the Library's book vote which led to reductions in real terms. That is a matter of great regret. It shows a distortion of priorities. Such priorities are not in the best interests of this nation. We had promises from Senator Richardson when he had a ministerial responsibility in this area. I would like to think that the Government would finally positively address this question and do something for the benefit of the nation in this regard. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Although I want to support most of the remarks that Senator Hill made in speaking to his motion to take note of the annual report of the National Library of Australia, I do not wish to join that list of people who always say that they support a tighter fiscal policy but then advocate increasing spending in every area they discuss. I do not intend to pursue that line of double standard, but I do want to support Senator Hill in the positive remarks he made about the Library. As a senator representing the area in which the National Library is found, I get more opportunity than most-perhaps not more than Senator Hill, who is on the Council-to observe and take advantage of the activities at the Library. I particularly want to join with Senator Hill in his comments about the excellent work that is done by the Director-General, Warren Horton, and the staff there, not just for what they do within the National Library but also for giving impetus to the wider library community. I want to come back to that later.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I also want to comment upon the diversity of activity that takes place in the Library. In recent years it has certainly been opened up and become a much more active and contributing part of Australian society. I say that deliberately; it is not just an active and contributing part of Canberra society. I want to make particular reference to the National Poetry Awards which it sponsors, which of course are not local awards; they are contested by people all around Australia. I had the honour of presenting the awards this year in the Library. I think the contribution it makes to Australian literature is substantial and entirely appropriate. </PARA>
<PARA> I note with interest also some of the political manuscripts which the National Library has collected this year, including those from Clyde Cameron, Norman Makin, Sir John Cramer, Wal Fife and a number of other interesting citizens, including David Williamson. Those things will make a substantial contribution to our culture and heritage, although some people may not always enjoy everything they find in Clyde Cameron's papers. </PARA>
<PARA> I want particularly to refer to the role the National Library played in supporting and bringing into being the National Library Summit this year. I addressed the dinner at that summit and tried to give my views about the role of libraries and the way in which they should go about developing a strategy to improve libraries in Australia. Out of that summit came a number of important agreements about the preservation priorities for Australian libraries; about establishing a central database, operated through the National Library of Australia as the major component of a national database for the foreseeable future; and about a national plan, which I think is very important, for improving access to information for remote users. There was talk about the primary responsibility of the public library to serve as the first point of access to information for the general public and to the national system of library and information services. It called for a strong funding partnership by the three levels of government. That is one of the important things about libraries in Australia. They are in one of the few areas that are supported by all three levels of government. </PARA>
<PARA> I conclude by again endorsing the things Senator Hill said about the good work which the Library does and by congratulating my Labor colleague Manfred Cross, who was Acting Chairman of the Council for some time this year and has made an outstanding contribution to the Library over the years. I hope that when he retires from the Parliament the Government can find its way open to reappoint him to the Council as a member. I am sure Senator Hill would agree he has had a longstanding commitment--</PARA>

<PARA>I hope that over the years we can implement that broad agenda and make information available to the people of Australia in the way that librarians and people who work in the information industry would like to do. I hope that the National Library can continue to play a positive role in that area. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-I wish to speak about the first Muirhead Interim Report on the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody. There are five reports noted and I wish to speak about the report of the inquiry into the death of Charles Sydney Michael. Charles Michael was an Aboriginal Australian who died at Barton's Mill Prison in Western Australia on 9 October 1984, aged 31 years. I quote from the report:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>The primary cause of death was myocardial infarction. He was suffering a serious heart condition, atheroma and coronary thrombosis, and the findings at autopsy prove he was prone to a fatal attack. This was unkown to the prison . . . authorities. </PARA>
<PARA> The disturbing feature is that when he died he was face down on the floor of the Senior Officer's small office, handcuffed, ankles secured together by a belt, another belt securing the handcuffs to the ankle restraint. He died following or during a struggle with several prison officers during which he remained at all times on the floor. No attempt was made to resuscitate him. At the time he was pronounced dead by a local medical practitioner he was beyond all aid and his body, trussed as it was, was there to be seen by the doctor and the investigating police upon their arrival . . . </PARA>
<PARA>Photographs were taken of the body of Charles Michael in that state. In other words, he was hogtied, and during a scuffle while still hogtied he died on the floor. When it was realised that he was unconscious, no attempt was made either to untie him or to resuscitate him. Mr Olive, counsel for the Committee to Defend Black Rights, puts the position on a different plane. He stated:</PARA>
<PARA>This is a shameful affair in which the supervisor bears prime responsibility although all prison officers share the guilt for their failure to act in a prompt and humane way-to accept the fact that a fellow human being was dying, was seriously ill, and needed their attention. </PARA>
<PARA>I suggest that such restraints are an infringement of the international covenant on human rights, to which we are a signatory. This is a very serious matter indeed. Commissioner Muirhead said in his findings:</PARA>
<PARA>I must accept the findings of Dr Pocock upon autopsy, namely that the direct cause of death was acute myocardial infarction due to coronary thrombosis and atheroma. </PARA>
<PARA>Commissioner Muirhead goes on to say that that condition had not been diagnosed previously. In fact, just a month before Michael's death, he underwent surgery at the Fremantle Hospital and there was no indication of heart trouble then. On 7 September he was certified fit to return to Barton's Mill Prison where, as I said before, he died on 9 October. What is very interesting about that is that I have seen a videotape of a program put out by Granada Television in the United Kingdom from a program called The World in Action. That tape has not been shown on television or anywhere else publicly in Australia. There are two re-enactments of Michael's death on that tape, One according to the warders' account and the other according to the accounts of other prisoners and witnesses who did hear some of the sounds made. On that videotape the pathologist, Dr Pocock, who was the pathologist in charge at the time and who conducted the autopsy, actually states that to some extent he has changed his mind. He has conceded that as Michael was hogtied and warders were sitting on him while he was on the floor, this may have contributed to his death. </PARA>
<PARA> Articles have appeared in the West Australian, both today and yesterday, about another young person, Stephen Wardle, aged 18, who died in the Perth lockup while being kept overnight on a charge. Although that inquest has now finished, and the findings are that he died of natural causes, the police internal investigation squad is now looking into allegations of police misconduct made by his stepfather. I hope that Commissioner Muirhead's recommendations about a review of our coronial system are seriously looked into, because a lot of people are not satisfied with the way that our coronial inquiries are conducted. There is insufficient independence and the coroner is too closely associated with police evidence because of the whole set-up of the coronial inquiry system in Australia. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the paper. </PARA>
<PARA>This is another of those instances where the report is presented unacceptably late. It is for the year ended 30 June, and it was tabled in the Senate in April, two and three-quarter months to go out of a year. This is unacceptable for a variety of reasons, but one of them is evident from the Auditor's Report, a copy of which is on page 67. I make no inferences at all about the management of the Australian Institute of Sport in making these points. In fact, I have a high personal regard for Mr Ron Harvey. But I do not find it acceptable that the Auditor's Report, dated 21 December 1988, which is in the annual report which has come into this chamber only now, reveals this:</PARA>
<PARA> The last full stocktake undertaken by the Institute was at 30 June 1985. Due to weaknesses in the asset recording system-</PARA>
<PARA>I emphasise that as I am not too cheered about seeing that-</PARA>
<PARA> and the impending amalgamation of the Institute with the Australian Sports Commission, the Institute commenced a complete stocktake of plant and equipment in February 1988 . . . at the time of signature of this report, the stocktake was not sufficiently advanced to enable verification of the $4,296,773 figure for plant and equipment in the financial statements. Accordingly, I am unable to determine if that figure is materially accurate. </PARA>
<PARA>Apart from the fact that we have had three full months since 21 December during which time some comment could have been made in the printed message at the front of these accounts about what had happened since then, it is simply unsatisfactory for this kind of note to appear in the accounts. I think the Senate has every right to ask: Is the stocktake sufficiently advanced now for the Senate to be told whether the auditor can certify that figure of $4.3 million?</PARA>
<PARA> It was interesting to listen to Senator Watson earlier. We should say how grateful we are for the sterling efforts of the Auditor-General, despite his lack of facilities and support from this Government, as he has been able to reveal many instances of inadequate reporting standards among so many governmental institutions. I am concerned to see the following remarks made on page 87 of the report, which states that under subsection 34 (3) of the Australian Institute of Sport Act:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . the money of the Institute shall not be expended otherwise than in accordance with estimates of expenditure approved by the Minister. During 1987-88 the Institute breached this sub-section as indicated below. </PARA>
<PARA> By 30 November 1987 it had exceeded estimates approved by the Minister on 30 June 1987 by $649,963 in various programs and $841,413 in administrative and operational expenses. It was also noted that expenditure at 30 June 1988 exceeded estimates approved by the Minister for administrative and operational expenses by $197,924 and by $118,360 for sport, $193,745 for a sports laboratory--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We are debating a private member's Bill relating to the censorship of `certain video materials'. In this case the `certain video materials' seem to be erotic video materials, apparently what is at present classified X. I wish to speak fairly briefly tonight in response to a small number of matters raised in the debate by the Opposition because they are myths which are also abroad in the community and should be exposed. One is about so-called evidence of public opinion from polling. Honourable senators opposite referred to a poll in the Age newspaper on 15 August last year under the heading `43% want X rated videos banned, opinion poll shows'. To the credit of the Age, a correction was later made. The question asked in the poll was:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>There has been some discussion recently about X rated video cassettes. Some people say that videos depicting sex or violence should be banned. </PARA>
<PARA>The question then went on to ask specifically what should be banned and produced a very contradictory result. This was that 43 per cent wanted X-rated material banned but only three per cent thought that explicit sex, that is, the real contents of X-rated material, should be banned. In other words, three per cent thought that real X-rated videos should be banned and the other 40 per cent were confused by the incorrect information in the question. As I said, the Age later corrected its mistake. Such confusion is widespread in the community as evidenced in many of the letters I have received from individuals and organisations and in a number of debates that have occurred in this place.</PARA>
<PARA> Honourable senators opposite also repeated during this debate their claim that most women oppose the availability of X-rated videos. In the Australian Capital Territory, an Australian Institute of Criminology survey found that 30 per cent of total hirers are women and 70 per cent are couples. I suspect that the view that these videos degrade women is based partly on a belief that women should not be seen to enjoy sex or take the initiative in sexual activity, as is the case in many of the videos to which they object. </PARA>
<PARA> I quote from what the Office of the Status of Women said when it appeared before the Joint Select Committee on Video Materials. </PARA>
<PARA>The Office is satisfied that the guidelines, as they now stand, will operate in such a way as to prohibit such material as is likely to cause direct or indirect physical or psychological harm to women, while maintaining the rights of individuals to develop their own view of life, without direction from the state or the majority. </PARA>
<PARA>Another opinion quoted by some honourable senators opposite was the opinion of the Shop, Distributive and Allied Employees Association, the shop assistants' union, which has claimed:</PARA>
<PARA>Habitual viewers of X rated videos were likely to hold a sexually callous view of women. </PARA>
<PARA>This is one of many similar arguments which fail to distinguish between cause and correlation. If the claim were true, the viewing of videos causes the callousness. As Laurence Splitter, chief research officer of the very prestigious Australian Council for Educational Research, wrote in a recent article in the Bulletin:</PARA>
<PARA>On the sexual side, I challenge anyone to establish a genuine correlation between viewing and real harm. There is little reason to think that if a person watches erotic videos they will be more inclined to do anything harmful. People watch what they want to . . . usually to satisfy rather than create a need. </PARA>
<PARA>I should add that much of the recent overseas evidence supports that view. In fact, there is some evidence that, far from being harmful, the material is helpful to many people. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the Opposition speakers supporting the Bill referred to the Association of Heads of Independent Schools in Australia as a body which opposed the availability of X-rated videos. I did a little bit of research on this matter myself before it was even mentioned in the Senate. Certainly that report did oppose the availability of X-rated videos, but I had difficulty in tracking down the process by which that decision was reached-apparently by a small working group of the Association. Its report said:</PARA>
<PARA>The working party had discussions with both Senator Harradine and Mr Charles MP. </PARA>
<PARA>In an addendum to the report the working party acknowledges:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . the assistance of Senator Harradine and David Charles MP in the selection of relevant extracts from the report. </PARA>
<PARA>This suggests to me that the working party did not take the time to read the whole report and the evidence it contains. It is probably significant that this working party, meeting in Victoria, did not seek to discuss the issues with a Victorian senator, namely, myself, who holds different views and also has qualifications and long experience in both teaching and pychology which they might have thought relevant. The first I knew about the report was when it landed on my desk. </PARA>
<PARA> Another matter raised by the Opposition was the recommendation of the State Attorneys-General last June that X-rated videos be banned. That recommendation was also based on lack of knowledge of what is shown in X-rated videos. The Attorneys-General are not alone in their ignorance; it is widespread in the community and has been fostered by some people who know better. I understand that the concern at the Attorneys-General meeting was about violence. X-rated videos are non-violent. The Film Censorship Board's guidelines define X, or extra restricted, material as follows:</PARA>
<PARA>Material which includes explicit depictions of sexual acts involving adults, but does not include any depiction suggesting coercion or non-consent of any kind. </PARA>
<PARA>That is why the Joint Select Committee on Video Material recommended that it be renamed `non-violent erotica'. That is a far more useful way of describing it in terms that people can understand. The most violent video material which is legally available in this country is that which is classified R, yet before and after the meeting of the Attorneys-General we read and heard interviews with State Ministers who clearly had been wrongly advised and/or had not done their own homework because they thought that, by recommending that X-rated material not be available, they had done something significant to prevent violence. It was irrelevant to violence. </PARA>
<PARA> I think it is notable that Senator Walters's private member's Bill does not address the question of the portrayal of violence, yet this is something that is of great concern in the community and is an area where the Film Censorship Board has already taken action to tighten up its own interpretation of the guidelines. </PARA>
<PARA> To save the time of the Senate, I have not addressed the details and wording of Senator Walters's Bill. If it reaches the committee stage, its lack of clarity will become obvious. At this stage I would just like to mention what I consider to be one very obvious flaw. Clause 4 of the Bill, on interpretation, states:</PARA>
<PARA>``explicit depictions of sexual acts'' means depictions of:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) sexual penetration;</PARA>
<PARA> (b) oral contact with genitals between consenting adults; or</PARA>
<PARA> (c) sexual manipulation alone or between consenting adults. </PARA>
<PARA>I imagine that Senator Walters intends the term `sexual manipulation' to mean masturbation but it could just as easily be interpreted to include such things as kissing, fondling and so on. I would like to quote from Senator Macklin's contribution to this debate. He said:</PARA>
<PARA> Sex is not a crime in Australia; it never has been and hopefully it never will be. It is a healthy human activity. The depiction of sexual activities occurs in an enormous range of movies . . . An example of this is kissing. </PARA>
<PARA>Does Senator Walters really want to ban the depiction of explicit kissing? Other parts of the Bill are similarly confused and seem in some cases to be self-contradictory. But that matter can wait until the committee stage. I would like to finish with another quotation from Laurence Splitters's clear-sighted article which appeared in the Bulletin last year. He writes:</PARA>
<PARA> In these times of safe sex promotion, legislation against a patently safe sexual practice i.e. watching erotic videos-seems to be a move in the wrong direction. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have a great deal of sympathy for the Opposition's opposition to these videos. I think it is a great pity that the advice of the Attorneys-General to ban these videos in the Australian Capital Territory was not taken because we would not then have had to debate this contentious but comparatively unimportant issue at such length now and on a previous occasion. There is clearly much misunderstanding about the nature of these videotapes. I must admit that I was one of those who misunderstood the nature of them.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I would like to give honourable senators present who have not seen any of these videos a brief outline of two of the six videos which Senator Macklin kindly lent me and which I subjected myself to one rainy weekend. Neither of them contained any physical violence at all. The first one I saw really offended my feminist sensibilities. It is called Butterflies and is about a rather sleazy yuppie type who is clearly suffering from satyriasis and requires a constant stream of women to satisfy his exceptional appetite. He is a cad, a bounder and a sexist pig who treats women abysmally. The story ends with the departure of yet another initially willing victim too naive to perceive his true character. His final words are, `There are always more where she came from'. Of course as a feminist I found this mortifying. </PARA>
<PARA> The other video called Deep Throat is about the wife of an apparently straight-laced senator who, when she is suddenly possessed by the spirit of her notorious mother, Linda Lovelace, sets about to prove the hypocrisy of the members of a committee, including her husband, who are examining X-rated videos. Does this sound familiar? There follow some amusing scenes when a news broadcaster and some gospel singers are overcome by irresistible urges. The only objection I had to this video was its execrable aesthetic execution. Its content, however, bore a remarkable resemblance to reality. </PARA>
<PARA> I refer now to an article in the Australian Financial Review of 2 February which was taken from the New York Times. The article was about a Christian religious broadcasters conference in Washington. There was a collection of delegates at the forty-sixth annual convention of that religious organisation. The end of that article states:</PARA>
<PARA> One of the highlights of the conference was a vote by the directors of the NRB to oust evangelist Jimmy Swaggart from the organisation for his `moral failure' in allegedly consorting with a Louisiana prostitute. </PARA>
<PARA>The journalist goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA> But one of the participants, radio broadcaster Paul Ramseyer, said that an analysis of hotel bills of the 1988 NRB-</PARA>
<PARA>that is, the National Religious Broadcasters-</PARA>
<PARA>conference participants had shown that 80 per cent of the delegates had watched an X-rated movie in their room. </PARA>
<PARA>I thought this quite amusing. I think these videos are misnamed as non-violent erotica. As Robbie Swan from the Adult Video Association suggested to me, they should be called not very erotic because, in their anatomically stark, repetitious, close-up shots, they contain little that healthy sexual adults might find appealing. I certainly acknowledge Senator Macklin's point which he made to me privately that `if a man is dying of acquired immune deficiency syndrome and wishes to view one of the gay X-rated videos I have no right to deny him that'. As far as my feminist instincts go I believe it would actually be unhealthier for this society in general, and for women in particular, to force this material underground. I am not just talking about the criminal domination of this particular business. A corollary to this would be the development of an unhealthy prurience about sexual matters that might have even more of a detrimental effect on the status of women in this society. In relation to this I have to think of the United States where some awful pornography and sex shows exist alongside some of what I regard as the most progressive feminist debate of sexism. </PARA>
<PARA> The last time I spoke on this Bill I referred in passing to an advertisement which cost me a job. It was an advertisement which portrayed women very much as dolly birds. It was an advertisement for a secretarial agency. I felt that the ad had denigrated women by showing them dressed in clothes which were not suitable for the dignity and seriousness of the work that they were to do. I did not even at the time-it was over 10 years ago-believe that that ad should have been banned. My advice to the organisation was that I would conduct a national education campaign against it to show how offensive its advertisement was to all female office workers. I wanted to expose its subliminal message and show women and men the sort of stereotypes that were being reinforced, to the detriment of women, and men, too, I believe. I believe that education and a re-examination of our attitudes is the path to follow in uncovering the sexist and demeaning nature of such advertisements in many of these X-rated videos. I urge the Government to maintain and expand its support for non-sexist education and training programs. I believe that this is the reasonable way to go. So I join the Women in Science Network in opposing Senator Walters's private member's Bill. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I support the second reading motion in respect of Senator Walters's Video Material Bill 1988. I do so for a number of reasons. I moved the resolution in the Senate which resulted in the setting up of the Joint Select Committee on Video Material. I did so in June 1984 and have maintained a very close interest in the progress of the Committee's work and its report, which was tabled some time ago. The establishment of this Committee arose out of a very serious situation which had developed from 1 February 1984 when the then Attorney-General, Senator Gareth Evans, in the Hawke Government, introduced some major amendments to legislation governing censorship of video material in Australia. As a result of those amendments which he made, with the very obvious purpose of removing virtually all controls on censorship of video material, the legislation is very complicated and has various parts to it. I do not propose to go into that detail.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The end result of the Hawke Government's legislative changes, taking effect from 1 February 1984, was to open the floodgates for importation into Australia of largely American X-rated video material, to enable that material to be given an X classification in Australia and to introduce a very liberal classification ordinance in the Australian Capital Territory for such material. This was done ostensibly to give effect to decisions which had been made by the Standing Committee of Attorneys-General relating to censorship. By the end of 1983 it had reached general agreement to introduce a scheme of this kind. It was part and parcel of that scheme that complementary State laws would be introduced. This was to be a national liberation of material of this kind. </PARA>
<PARA> Instead of waiting until that arrangement was finalised and that legislation was ready to come into effect in all the States, Senator Gareth Evans-as was his custom and probably still is in many respects-went ahead alone on behalf of the Commonwealth and allowed a great range of this American X-rated material to be imported into Australia before there was adequate legislation in place in the various States. The only place where there was any complementary legislation of that kind was in the ACT. The material, which was X-rated in the United States and which was imported into Australia under these new Commonwealth laws, created an enormous amount of alarm throughout Australia when it suddenly became available. There was immediate reaction, great concern and considerable opposition to the videos, and in the course of 1984 virtually all States decided that they were going to ban this material. The end result was, as is now the position, that not only the hire and sale but also the possession of this material was banned. However, the material is still allowed to enter Australia and be sold under the restrictions of the local ordinance in the ACT. Although State laws attempt to restrict interstate trade in this material, there is now a flourishing interstate trade in this material through mail order from the ACT. </PARA>
<PARA> The net result is that the ACT has become what is widely described as the porn capital of Australia. That is a very justifiable description. The national capital has become the porn capital because it is the only place in Australia where this material has any legal status. Because of the national laws and because there is a Commonwealth constitutional guarantee for freedom of interstate trade and so on, this material is still available throughout Australia by mail order. I am told that that has resulted in a $25m industry in the ACT. That is what the video industry tells us. It is in fact the fourth largest industry in the ACT. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is what the industry claims. It is a horrifying claim, and I hope it is not true, as Senator Harradine suggests, but the fact is that there is a very substantial business in this material concentrated in the ACT. That is a direct result of the attitude of the Hawke Government under the then Attorney-General, Senator Gareth Evans, and no doubt continued by his successor. The Prime Minister said recently that he could not care less about the situation; he is going to leave it to the new ACT administration, whenever that is brought into being under other recent laws of the Hawke Government. So there is a very clear attitude by the present Hawke Government, by the Caucus of the Australian Labor Party, that this deplorable situation should be allowed to continue indefinitely and that the Government does not intend to do anything about it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is in those circumstances that Senator Walters has brought forward this legislation, the purpose of which is twofold. Firstly, it is to correct the great anomaly that exists. The effect of the Bill will be to remove the X-rated classification altogether, thereby preventing this material from being available legally for sale, hire or possession in the ACT and to prevent it from being imported into Australia. Secondly, and very importantly, its purpose is to tighten up the violent content of the R or restricted classification, which is well known. Under the ordinary film and video classification laws of this country an R certificate means public viewing of material that is restricted to people over the age of 18. In recent years, unfortunately, that material has contained a good deal of violent material. Senator Walters's Bill is also designed to tighten up the classification of that material with a view to eliminating serious offensive violence contained within it. I hope that the Senate will support this Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> Some amendments could be made to this Bill. For instance, Senator Walters has said that she believes that X-rated and R-rated material should be given a suitable classification provided that it has educational, literary or artistic merit. The vast majority does not have that quality at all, so there would be only a few exceptions. She also believes that this material should be available for film festivals and that type of activity. The Bill purports to allow for that. There is some question about whether it does so correctly. There may be some amendments that are desirable to give effect to her intention. Subject to that relatively minor qualification, I hope that the Senate will agree in principle with the object of her Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> There is a good deal of confusion in the public mind about what is X-rated material. One of the excuses that the Labor Party Caucus has given is that this could be cleared up. Indeed, Senator Dunn seems to believe that this material is really quite harmless. On the other hand, there are people who believe that it is material which contains a great deal of violence, particularly sexual violence. The present classification system adopted by the Film Censorship Board does not admit into the X classification material depicting violence, particularly sexual violence. However, the confusion was clearly caused by the Hawke Government and the Attorney-General of the day. For the next 18 months, after the floodgates were opened on 1 February 1984, this material which was given X ratings under United States laws and which contained the most horrific violence flooded in. It is no wonder that the Australian community was outraged by the material that suddenly became legally available in Australia. It was not soft pornography, which is now said to be part of this X-rated material; it was pornography that contained a great deal of violence. In fact one of its major features was violence. </PARA>
<PARA> If there is still some confusion about what X-rated material is, it is clearly due to the way that the Hawke Government went about this exercise. As a result of the great concern that was immediately raised about this X-rated material, the Film Censorship Board-I think under a good deal of pressure from the ministerial councils involved-modified what was allowed in X-rated material. </PARA>
<PARA> We now come to the hub of this debate. Senator Dunn has said that she has seen two of these films. It surprises me that she can come into this Senate and give opinions and make judgments after having seen only two films of this kind. Nevertheless, it is claimed, and claimed with justifications, by those that have better knowledge of the matter than Senator Dunn, I or most of us that this X-rated material-I have taken the word of the Chief Film Censor for this; I think he knows what he is talking about-has now been sanitised so that at least it does not contain the sort of violence and the sexually violent material, some of which I have seen in the past, which is of an absolutely horrific nature and which all of us in this chamber would wish to ban. </PARA>
<PARA> The question is whether this existing modified X-rated material should also be banned. One of the major purposes of the Joint Committee was to evaluate evidence. A great deal of very valuable and highly expert evidence was given to that Committee about material which does not contain violence but which is made simply for the purpose of portraying various explicit sexual activities of a great variety; not just one-to-one heterosexual activity but various aberrations of sexual conduct of both a heterosexual and a homosexual kind. By no means is it the portrayal of sexual activity in a loving and caring relationship. This material is very far removed from that. The question is whether that material is or may be harmful. There is evidence to suggest that it is sufficiently harmful that we should prevent its being seen. </PARA>
<PARA> It concerns me when governments or parliaments are called upon to ban material, whether it be material that is viewed, read or heard. We take the general approach that censorship is permissible-there is a general right to that material-unless there is something harmful that may come from it. I have not the time to go through all the material that was canvassed in the report of the Committee. There are two volumes of that report. There is some very valuable material in it. It is clear from the evidence given to that Committee by experts and by many other people that there is a real risk that this sort of material can lead to changes of attitudes and conduct by people, particularly men in their attitudes to women. This is harmful and a denigration of women and attitudes to women. It could, in some circumstances, lead to aggressive conduct such as rape and other types of sexual assault. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the most persuasive pieces of evidence given to that Committee came from Professor Sheehan, Professor of Psychology at the University of Queensland. He has been a member of the Films Board of Review. He is an expert of high standing whose views one should take very seriously. Of non-violent material he says-I quote from page 1192 of the Hansard-in his evidence:</PARA>
<PARA>In and of itself, I do not think seeing sexually explicit material divorced from aggression leads to strong negative effects. Once you combine sexually explicit material with aggression you have a different kettle of fish. I think the evidence for harmful effects is much stronger in that. The critical thing is how much someone is aroused and how aggressive he is in the first place. </PARA>
<PARA>The thrust of that view is that one should not take the risk. It may be that, in the great majority of cases, this material will not have those effects. But we have to be concerned at the impact it may have on the exceptional individual. If the exceptional individual is aroused by this material to aggressive conduct-it may well be rape or aggressive, violent conduct particularly towards women; these days it may even be on a homosexual basis-then we, as legislators, should prevent the distribution of this material. It is of no real value to members of the community. If we do not let them see this material we are not depriving anybody of any great benefit. We should not trouble our tender consciences about rights of individuals and the freedom to see, hear and read what people want to. If there is evidence of that kind, and there was-one has only to read Professor Sheehan's evidence, which I have just quoted-it behoves us to be very cautious indeed. </PARA>
<PARA> I refer to a finding of the whole Committee, which included Senator Zakharov. I am not quoting from the minority report; there is great confusion as to who was in the minority and who was in the majority. I am now quoting from a summary of evidence on which all members, including Senator Zakharov, agreed. Page 230 of volume one of the report reads:</PARA>
<PARA>Theories of behavioural science, laboratory experiments and anecdotal evidence point strongly to the fact that the effects of pornography are not aberrations. Responses to pornographic stimuli fall within the range of human behaviour. </PARA>

While behavioural science studies in this area do not provide certainty they do establish theories which make reliable predictions about human behaviour.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Some studies have been undertaken that may be controversial. Professor Sheehan, in another article that was submitted to the Committee and published in the Committee's findings, refers to them. It sets out the results of experiments done in the United States by some researchers named Zillman and Bryant in which they summarised the effects that they observed on normal human beings as a result of exposure to this sort of material. What they found, most importantly, according to Professor Sheehan, was that massive exposure to this sort of pornography results in recommendations of significantly shorter terms of imprisonment for rape. They found that not only did this result in trivialisation of attitudes to rape, evident in women as well as in men, but also that this massive exposure resulted in significantly increased men's sexual callousness towards women.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is no wonder that so many representatives of women in Australia are deeply concerned about this material and are supporting Senator Walters's Bill. Senator Hill, in speaking in this debate a few weeks ago, quoted extensively from replies that he had received from women's organisations around Australia. The Women in Science Enquiry Network, which Senator Dunn referred to, was about the only women's organisation that expressed any lack of concern about this matter. </PARA>
<PARA> One need only read the text of Senator Hill's speech to see the massive widespread concern amongst women in Australia about this sort of material, for the very good reasons that have been set out in the expert evidence before the Committee, and which is there for anybody to read. I have mentioned some of it by Professor Sheehan. I have mentioned the findings of the Committee in relation to that material. They are warnings that have been given to us as legislators about the possible deleterious effects on human behaviour by a continual viewing of material of this kind. We have been warned. The Joint Committee-albeit that it took a long time to do so-came forward with a valuable report. It has collected a great mass of evidence of which we as legislators should take note and on which we should be prepared to act, and to act firmly. Senator Walters's Bill provides for this to be done. </PARA>
<PARA> There have been some great advances in evidence of this kind in the last 10 years. When I first became Attorney-General and had responsibility for censorship in this country, in 1977, my attention was drawn to the then development of violence, particularly violence in films. Videos were not a big deal in 1977. The Chief Censor in those days-and Mrs Janet Strickland, who subsequently became Chief Censor-became very concerned by the development of violence, and sexual violence in particular. I made a lot of inquiries at that time as to whether there was any real evidence about the effect of this on individual behaviour. I was told, as best as I could ascertain from scientists in the field, that there was no evidence one way or the other. That was the situation in 1977-78. The sort of scientific evidence that the Committee has obtained comprises scientific work and experiments which have been made since that time. It is quite clear, of course, that our knowledge only 10 or so years ago was quite deficient. Scientific development in this area has been quite significant. I only wish that that material had been available many years ago because, at least in relation to the R certificate area, we might have avoided a good deal of the violence that has crept in. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the things that I am particularly pleased about in this Bill-it is why I support it so strongly-is the attempt by Senator Walters to tackle that development which has occurred in relation to violence. In relation even to non-violent pornography, there is clear evidence now that there is a danger of harm to people. As long as there is any real danger, it is our duty as legislators to try to do our best to prevent it. </PARA>

The majority of the Committee, of which Senator Walters and I were a part, recommended that the Parliament introduce legislation to ban that type of relished violence. She did not ultimately sign that recommendation. Who is it amongst us who is soft on violence? Those of us who are against X-rated videos are frequently accused of being soft on violence. I ask the Senate: Who is soft on violence? Senator Zakharov will not sign the recommendation that we should abolish violence. Senator Zakharov says that Senator Shirley Walters is not doing anything about violence. The honourable senator should read the Bill; she might learn something.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I reiterate that there has been a deliberate pattern of delay and deception of the public about this issue. That started way back in the time of a former Attorney-General, Lionel Murphy. Honourable senators who have taken the trouble to read the first couple of chapters of the report of the Committee will see that there has been a deliberate attempt to hide from the public what has been going on. The advice given to the then Attorney-General was that `the Government's policy might best be achieved by a strategy of hastening slowly, gradually broadening the standards of imported material so that public opinion can be developed to embrace the principles embodied in the policy'. </PARA>
<PARA> What were those principles? That policy was that adults should be free to view what they wish. That is not an issue. Adults are free to take poison if they wish. It so happens that adults are not free under this Government to view many videos which it already bans, including unduly detailed acts of extreme violence and explicit or unjustifiable victims of sexual violence, not to mention bestiality. So the Federal Government does not see its policy as being a principle to be applied universally and uniformly, but rather as a slogan to be used selectively and arbitrarily in a manner which lacks credibility. And it does lack credibility because there is only one class of video that is not subject to the general censorship guidelines and that is the X-rated video. In the case of X-rated video pornography, this Government resorts to the use of that slogan rather than to admitting to giving priority to the exploiting pornographers' claimed right of freedom of expression over other individual and societal rights. </PARA>
<PARA> This is where the question of censorship comes in. I am quite happy to debate the issue of censorship. I am quite aware that censorship has a connotation of being associated with narrow-minded reactionary interference. If we are talking about censorship as a term, we should move away from some concepts of the word `censorship' as an abstraction to the term `censorship' as a principle which underlies human actions and conduct. It is a principle which will stand up to scrutiny and perhaps will provide a philosophical basis for the concept of censorship. I define censorship as the application of a carefully balanced and judiciously evaluated assessment of that which is conducive to the essential common good of an equal liberal-that is, free-and life-affirming society. It is important to consider the nature of society in any analysis of the justification or lack of justification of censorship since many of the arguments against censorship are based on the rights of the individual within society. Time does not permit me tonight to develop that point because I believe the Senate wants to vote on this matter, but I would like to develop it at some stage. I would like also to develop an argument against those who misquote John Stewart Mill on this issue. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me come back to the main theme. There has been a deliberate pattern of denial of democracy. This material has been allowed into the country without regulation until 1963-64. At that time, the Government for the first time legitimised the distribution for sale and hire in Australia of what it termed `hard core pornography' in the video field. That is not my term; that is the definition in the explanatory memorandum of the ACT Classification and Publications Ordinance, and it is a definition given to X-rated videos by this Government. This Government calls X-rated videos `hard core pornography'. We have had obfuscation of what is contained in X-rated videos. All we hear is that there is no violence in X-rated videos. All we hear is the bland statement that X-rated videos depict sexual acts involving adults but do not include any depictions suggesting coercion or non-consent of any kind. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me refer to the report. Those who wrote this report had seen far more than two X-rated videos, and I am not sure that one of the videos listed is an X-rated video. They indicated that the dominant theme of this non-violent, pornographic and degrading video material is that it objectifies and commodifies women. The report states:</PARA>
<PARA>Rather than treating women as free and responsible initiators of human activity, the material in this category, although non-violent, treats women as sexual commodities to arouse the sexual desires of its target audience. Thus sexual intercourse is typically depicted as a mechanical act devoid of love or human consequences . . . The bulk of all pornographic video material commercially available in Australia falls within this category. </PARA>
<PARA>As we know, in general there is little or no plot or character development. If there is a story line, it is an excuse for the sex exploits contained in this material. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee, as did the Meese Commission in the United States, referred to the material as degrading in that it frequently depicts people, usually women, as existing solely for the sexual satisfaction of others, usually men; depicts people, usually women, in decidedly subordinate roles in their sexual relations with others; or depicts people engaged in sexual practices that would to most people be considered humiliating. The Committee report states:</PARA>
<PARA>Women are often depicted as sexually malleable for the purposes of satisfying male sexual desires. </PARA>
<PARA>I wonder how many Labor Party people support material that depicts women often as `sexually malleable for the purposes of satisfying male sexual desires'. The report goes on:</PARA>
<PARA>This is sometimes manifested by themes involving workplaces sexual favours. </PARA>
<PARA>In fact, that is called sexual harassment. It further states:</PARA>
<PARA>Women are frequently depicted as eager for sexual experience of any kind and ever ready for any opportunity for sexual activity. This is frequently manifested in the group sex scenes depicting diverse sexual activity, which are a feature of much of the material in this category. </PARA>
<PARA>Senator Zakharov says that we cannot prove that there is causal harm in that. Who said we could? The majority of the Committee did not say that one could say that the viewing of this particular video caused the commission of that particular crime or offence. That is impossible to prove because of all the other variables, upbringing and so forth. But what can be established is the perception that this type of material mediates in the mind of the habitual viewers. That is what one can demonstrate and what has been demonstrated and proven to the satisfaction of the majority of the Joint Select Committee on Video Material. That is something that this Parliament cannot run way from. We spent many years on this and thoroughly examined it. </PARA>
<PARA> It is quite clear that the majority of evidence which was cited by the Joint Select Committee showed that the material engenders a sexually callous and manipulative orientation towards women. It mediates in the minds of the habitual viewer a perception of women as being highly promiscuous and therefore available. It is interesting to note that at least four of the behavioural scientists whose work was subjected to the scrutiny of the Committee saw non-violent pornographic videos as being more harmful in that regard-that is as to the perception-than the violent explicit pornography which has already been banned. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Zakharov referred to recent overseas research. She did not cite any of it, but I happen to have in my hand some very recent overseas research which clearly goes to this question. It is from a book-either a forthcoming book or one that is now in print-by Zillmann and Bryant Pornography: Recent research, interpretations, and policy considerations, Hillsdale, New Jersey. An article in that work entitled `Pornography and Men's Sexual Callousness Towards Women', by Professors Zillman and Weaver, deals with the nature of sexual callousness, the culture of sexual callousness, the nurture of sexual callousness and the theoretical proposals-namely, social cognition, social learning, guided imagery and target depersonalisation-and the pertinent research findings. </PARA>
<PARA> It is interesting to note that the article deals with this question of the effect of high fidelity audio visual pornography that is available in Western societies. It indicates that many of the pornographic scripts:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . dwell on sexual engagements of parties who have just met, who are in no way emotionally attached to one another, who enjoy sexual stimulation for what it is, and who will part shortly, never to meet again. The implicit conquests tend to be mutual and rarely show coercion. Men are invariably shown as go-getters. Women are portrayed as ever-ready to accommodate any sexual request from anybody in the vicinity, often taking initiatives in signalling their readiness. The women featured in pornography have been characterised as men's playthings, creatures who quiver at the sheer sight of a penis, who scream for sex, who squeal euphorically in response to any sexual or quasi-sexual stimulation to which they are subjected . . . </PARA>
<PARA>I will not go on. The effect of that clearly is to mediate in the minds of the male viewers a perception of women in general as being highly promiscuous and available. It is conducive to the formation of callous sexual dispositions towards women. The article states that pornography thus can be seen as the primary social institution that fosters sexual callousness by promoting self-serving male beliefs about female sexuality. It then goes on to deal with the effects on women. </PARA>
<PARA> Before I get to that, let me turn to domestic violence. This is a very serious question-so serious that this week the Government has seen fit to conduct a publicity campaign against domestic violence. Domestic violence is a disgrace-there is no excuse whatever for any domestic violence-but it is in the perceptions that are gained from outside and perpetrated by people against women-their victims. Incidentally I would say-and I do not know whether anybody is listening-I believe that in that campaign against domestic violence all the attention is being addressed to the victims. It is very important that victims are protected, that they know they have ability to rise above violence, but let us spare a thought for the perpetrators too, because they need help. </PARA>

I refer to what Professor James Check said in a study entitled Violence and Victims. Research was carried out by Check and E. Sommers into pornography and violence and dealt specifically with video pornography which is referred to as `sexually explicit or sexually arousing material'. The report says:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>A total of 39% of battered women versus only 3% of the women in the comparison group-</PARA>
<PARA>who incidentally were not battered-</PARA>
<PARA>reported that they had been upset by their partners asking them to imitate pornography. In addition, the battered women reported much more frequent pornography consumption by their partners than did the women in the comparison group . . . </PARA>
<PARA>I shall be brief, as I know Senator Walters wishes to reply to the debate. In its conclusion the study says:</PARA>
<PARA>Although the results of the present study do not provide direct evidence of a causal link between the use of pornography and violence against women, certain observations can be made specifically about the data collected for this study. These observations are consistent with the link between pornography and violence against women and may ultimately add to the growing body of evidence showing that the use of pornography increases males' aggressiveness towards women. Since other studies have suggested that certain forms of pornography contribute to aggressiveness against women, it was assumed that a higher consumption of pornography among the partners of the battered women than among the partners of non-battered women would be reported. This assumption was in fact confirmed. </PARA>
<PARA>Surely we cannot take the risk. I believe that tonight we are at the crossroads. I believe that it is most important for this Bill to be supported in the second reading stage. If there are concerns by some about whether it is effective and would be effective at the control barrier, that is the time to discuss those concerns and to amend the Bill if it is thought it would not be effective. I consider that it would be effective. I have heard no arguments that it would not be effective seriously advanced. </PARA>
<PARA> There has been a suggestion that, if X-rated videos were banned in Australia, a criminal element would be established. That is the latest of the excuses of those who do not want to ban hard core pornography. That sort of argument can be used for almost anything. If the Government can get away with that as an excuse on this issue, it can do it on any other issue. Four years ago the Senate Select Committee on Video Material, knowing that the Federal Government was to send this matter off to yet another committee and that this delay would entrench video pornography in Australia, and the Senate as a whole requested the Government to place a moratorium on these videos pending the outcome of the new Committee's report. What did the Government do? It did not do that, and it is to blame for this material currently in the community. </PARA>
<PARA> I say `in the community' because it is in the home video entertainment system; that is where it is. It is not just in a few restricted theatres or anything like that; it is in the home entertainment system, available for children and anybody else who wants to see it. Indeed, the mail order system is the worst of all in that there is no requirement for proof of the age of persons who are hiring the material; they just sign. </PARA>
<PARA> I end by conveying an appeal that was made by the President of Apex Australia. He has appealed to the community and the Parliament to take action against this type of material, which is, in fact, engendering attitudes within our society which we will live to regret. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to support the Regulation of Video Material Bill 1988 introduced by my colleague Senator Walters. I will be as speedy as I can because I recognise that Senator Walters would like us to get through the second reading stage this evening. This is the latest of a series of efforts by the Opposition-particularly Senator Durack and Senator Walters-and, of course, Senator Harradine, to stop the distribution of what I believe is quite disgusting material which can only pollute the minds of Australians, particularly the young. Every State in this country and the Attorney-General (Mr Lionel Bowen) are in favour of this measure. All States have in fact banned the sale or hire of X-rated videos. Canberra has become the porn capital of Australia. It is from Canberra that this quite obscene material is distributed by mail around the country.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The purpose of Senator Walters's Bill is to prohibit the importation, sale or hire of X-rated videos and to reduce the violence in R-rated videos. I refer to the reminder given by Senator Harradine to Senator Zakharov. The reasons for the Bill have been well canvassed by Senator Walters and others, and I will not go over them again. For four years now this out of touch Government has delayed doing anything about the distribution around Australia of this quite pernicious material. The Deputy Leader of the Australian Democrats, Senator Macklin, implied in his speech that he would not support the Bill and stated quite vehemently that he would call points of order on anyone who said that those who supported the continued distribution of this material were guilty of improper motives. In fact, he used the opportunity to attack my coalition colleague Senator Bjelke-Petersen. He drew a comparison between this matter and the views of those who are genuinely opposed to drugs but who took the view that the only way to control them, and thus remove them from the criminal elements in society, was to make them freely available to addicts. Notwithstanding the fact that I do not agree with Senator Macklin-or, perhaps more correctly, the views expressed by these people-I believe that such people take that stand because they have come to the conclusion that our law enforcement agencies cannot control the peddling of illicit and harmful drugs.</PARA>
<PARA> Hard drugs destroy the bodies and minds of people. Video pornography desensitises young people and degrades the dignity of women, and with it comes an attitude to women which promotes violence to women of all ages. We do not need scientific studies and inquiries to tell us that. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Macklin also said that he would prefer the videos-which he described as being amateurish and without any artistic merit, and I am sure he is right-to be out in the open rather than peddled by criminals in society. I wonder how Senator Macklin would describe those people who already, because of a loophole, peddle this material to all States, when it is illegal to do so within those States. To my way of thinking, people who make a living out of this would have to be among the lowest and most despicable people in our society. To give honourable senators some idea of their mentality, I seek leave to have incorporated in Hansard a letter which was received by all Liberal members of Parliament from a Mr Robbie Swan of the Adult Video Industry Association. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The letter read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA>AN OPEN LETTER TO LIBERAL POLITICIANS</PARA>
<PARA>It is a strange thing within the Westminster system that `conservative' politicians are supposed to toe `liberal' philosophies. </PARA>
<PARA>That sort of doublespeak doesn't exist in the Israeli Knesset, the Hindu Parliaments or even in the Russian Politburo. </PARA>
<PARA>You know why?</PARA>
<PARA>Because they don't have a christian church carping at them all day, telling them that God is looking over their shoulder-except when they do it in the missionary position and then He turns away for five minutes. </PARA>
<PARA>The way of Bjelke-Petersen and Fred Nile is not the true Liberal party way. Banning condoms in Queensland is madness in the middle of the black plague. </PARA>
<PARA>Banning `The Last Temptation of Christ' is an acknowledgement of cracks in one's own faith. </PARA>
<PARA>Banning X-rated non-violent erotic movies, while retaining movies like `Rambo' and `Blood Sucking Freaks' is a fascist move. </PARA>
<PARA>How can any of you say you are acting in accord with your Liberal Party Federal Platform which states in the second paragraph, ``Liberalism's central task is to safeguard and advance the freedom of the individual and to subject all constraints on him to ever more stringent scrutiny.''</PARA>
<PARA>Surely it's a small freedom, the one to watch a non-violent erotic movie in the privacy of one's own living room. </PARA>
<PARA>And how can any of you justify your involvement and co-ordination in bans on X-rated videos in the ACT?</PARA>
<PARA>In the fifth paragraph of the Federal Platform, under the banner of the Spirit of Liberalism, you state ``Within Government, Liberals encourage decentralisation decision making by State and local governments, which are closest to those affected. They seek to reserve for Federal Government decision, only those issues of truly national significance.''</PARA>
<PARA>How can you justify video erotica as an issue of truly national significance?</PARA>
<PARA>Maybe by virtue of the fact that 99% of the population enjoys some sex, but after that, surely schools, defence, the disabled and a free money system are all far more important. </PARA>
<PARA>The Government has at least bothered to hear both sides of the issue. Not one member of the Opposition has bothered to talk to anyone in the Adult Video Industry Association and hear their point of view. </PARA>
<PARA>Shirley Walter's time on the Joint Parliamentary Committee hardly rates. </PARA>
<PARA>If the Adult Video Industry Association is closed down in Canberra, business at Australia Post Express Courier will halve overnight. Canberra's printing industry will lose 10% of its business. Three hundred staff will lose their jobs. Two million dollars in group taxes to the nation will be lost and the publishing industry will lose two million dollars in advertising revenue. </PARA>
<PARA>All to please the outdated morals of elderly (and mostly celibate) men of the cloth. </PARA>
<PARA>The people of Canberra have clearly shown (see enclosed poll) that they approve of, and enjoy, adult video erotica, while condemning violence (R and M rated movies). </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It certainly gives me great pleasure to take this opportunity to support my colleague Senator Walters and to support all the people who have spoken in support of her Regulation of Video Material Bill 1988. Senator Walters's Bill has been designed to counter the growing availability of pornographic material in Australian society. Its main purpose is twofold. Firstly, it aims to prohibit the importation, sale or hire of X-rated videos; and, secondly, it seeks to reduce violence in X-rated videos. In my role as a senator for the State of Tasmania, I have had an opportunity to move around that State and to gauge the public feelings on this matter. I am able to say quite categorically that it has been rare for me to find the huge-in fact almost unanimous-public support for this Bill now before the Parliament. The Bill is supported by all sections of the Australian community. I believe that we, as representatives of that community, have a responsibility to ensure its safe passage through the Parliament because, if we fail to uphold our responsibilities in that regard, we fail as legislators to fulfil our obligations to those who elect us.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It has been particularly disappointing for me that my fellow Tasmanian senators on the other side-and I do not include Senator Harradine-have failed to act to support the views of those in their own State. I have received many letters from Tasmanians on this subject-and many petitions too. I cannot remember the exact number. I know that I have presented thousands of signatures on petitions which are part of the 18,000 signatures generally on petitions which have already been presented on this matter to this Parliament. I am quite confident that the Tasmanian Federal members have also received similar letters and deputations. It appears to me that those on the other side of the House have simply chosen either to forget them or to ignore them. </PARA>
<PARA> In the brief time available to me, I take this opportunity to bring to the Parliament's attention a few brief examples of correspondence from people from different facets of life in Tasmania who have contacted me. Reverend Beeston, who is the Superintendent/Secretary of the Baptist Churches of Tasmania, states:</PARA>
<PARA> We strongly support the decisions taken by the Attorneys-General in Darwin last week in relation to video pornography . . . We . . . urge you-</PARA>
<PARA>that is, this Parliament, to:</PARA>
<PARA>Support the measures to be taken by the Federal and State Attorneys-General in line with their Darwin decisions. . . </PARA>
<PARA>Questions the right of parents and guardians to show their children sexually explicit material; and oppose the screening of banned films (under the new conditions) from being screened in hard-top cinemas. </PARA>
<PARA>That was just one example. </PARA>
<PARA> It would appear that my concerns over the lack of support by Tasmanian senators on the other side was brought to the attention of the Baptist Churches of Tasmania also because, on 2 March, 1989 I received another letter from Reverend Beeston, which states in part:</PARA>
<PARA>It was with very deep concern and disappointment we learned that a number of Tasmanian Senators voted in favour of continued dissemination of hard-core pornography out of Canberra. In so doing, they ignored the calls of concerned parents' groups, schools teachers, churches and many other community groups. </PARA>
<PARA>I believe that Reverend Beeston has been very forthright in his comments. </PARA>
<PARA> I quote from a letter from the Rokeby High School, which is a very short distance from my home and also very close to Senator Devereux's home. That school has an excellent reputation for a very high standard of educational programs and the parents of its students are very committed. Those parents wrote:</PARA>
<PARA>The existence of pornographic videos in our community was discussed at the . . . August meeting . . . </PARA>
<PARA>The meeting was in favour of censorship including classification and restrictions on the availability, if any, of pornographic material. </PARA>
<PARA>As time is restricted, I mention briefly another letter, this one from the Municipality of Circular Head-local government even-which passed motions at its meetings calling upon this Government for support. It said:</PARA>
<PARA>A recent meeting of the Council gave consideration to a request from the Australian Church Women (North West Branch)-</PARA>
<PARA>that was-</PARA>
<PARA>that the Federal and State Governments:</PARA>
<PARA> ensure that ``X'' rated video pornography (and their . . . equivalents) are refused classification;</PARA>
<PARA>I fully support what has been said by the previous speakers tonight in support of this Bill. We have heard comments from the Women's Electoral Lobby, the Country Women's Association and Australian Church Women. I hope that tonight commonsense will prevail in this Parliament and that we will support this Bill wholeheartedly. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Regulation of Video Material Bill 1988 presents some difficulty not only for me but I think for many people in the community. From the letters I have had sent to me and letters I have seen sent to others, it seems that there still remains a great deal of confusion about the X and R classifications. I am utterly opposed to gratuitous violence on videos or in any other form. I am also opposed to videos which depict women as submissive, powerless and degraded, whether the material is of a sexual nature or not.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The real cause of concern for me, however, and I think for most Australians, is the level of violence in our community. I mean the real and acted out violence which is occurring. This is where our energies should be directed. It is interesting that this issue is being debated in the month declared national domestic violence awareness month. We certainly need community participation in reducing domestic violence, and I do not mean only in terms of supporting the victims and dealing with the problems of the perpetrators. What we need to address are the root causes of violence which have been, perhaps unconsciously, actually encouraged in our society. </PARA>
<PARA> Take the example of our children, who are subjected to hours and hours of mindless violence if they are allowed to watch programs which are actually designed for them. I have introduced a Bill on violence in children's cartoons which are used to promote violent toys. I believe there is continuing community concern over the level of violence shown on television. Much of this concern, of course, has been linked with the recent mass killings in Australia as well as those in the United States of America and the United Kingdom. What I am proposing is a ban on violent programs shown to our children on television, which amount to the promotion of toys which encourage violent play in our nation's children. Of course that has very severe psychological repercussions for the next generation. I believe that that is a much more practical measure to be taking, because violence which is shown on television for hours each day is available to all people in the community just at the flick of a switch. It is a very different matter from making a decision actually to go and hire a video, which people ought to be able to choose to do. </PARA>
<PARA> I note the Opposition's concern for a Christian opinion in support of this Bill, but I would point out that this same Opposition ignored church opinion on the subject of the Australian Capital Territory casino, and not all Christians support Senator Walters's Bill. Some of the carefully considered Christian opinion which I have had put to me is based on the fact that banning certain undesirable videos will drive this industry underground. Senator Macklin of course has put that position very eloquently indeed. We need to learn techniques of non-violence in problem solving. Educators are beginning to understand this and positive conflict resolution skills need to be taught in our schools and homes. That is where we should be directing our energies and not to trying to ban videos which people choose to watch in their own homes. Incidentally, these are videos which most Australian do not watch. For many who are one-time viewers, these videos are rejected as being very boring indeed. </PARA>
<PARA> I think it is about time that this debate was wound up, because we have heard about this subject in here for weeks. I conclude by saying that I support the decision for a committee to be set up to clarify further the classifications in relation to these videos. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;When the debate was interrupted earlier in the day I was addressing two Bills in this cognate debate concerning customs and excise, namely, the Customs and Excise Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1987 and the Customs and Excise Legislation Amendment Bill 1988. I had dealt with some of the Opposition's objections to the new system of issuing magistrates warrants by telephone, to penalties being made under the proposed new section 242t of the Customs Act 1901 and with out belief that the words `or otherwise' should be deleted from the proposed section. This morning I did not deal, however, with the proposed new sections 243u or 243v of the same legislation. Section 243u purports to provide relief from the harsh penalties under section 243t, which I dealt with this morning, by giving a discretion to the Comptroller to grant a remission of either the whole or part of that penalty at his discretion. It also purports to provide for a review by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. This again is a conferring of a discretion upon the Comptroller, and again the law is rendered uncertain.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The proposed section 243v provides that section 243t shall not apply if a declarant is genuinely uncertain of the truth of the information submitted and states that uncertainty and the reasons for that uncertainty at the time of declaration. Should the information supplied turn out to be false no penalty will be applied under the aforesaid section. But who decides what is genuine? Who decides whether the uncertainty was genuine uncertainty? It is yet again the conferring of another discretion and again the rendering of the law becomes uncertain. </PARA>
<PARA> At the actual point of interruption in the debate this morning I was dealing with a question of inland freight becoming part of the dutiable value of the imported good. I pointed out that the Government has made the false assertion that the reason for the introduction of this requirement is to comply with the provisions of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT). I pointed out this morning that article 8 of the code that is relevant to that part of the GATT specifically leaves the question of the inclusion in or exclusion from the customs value of freight insurance and other associated charges entirely at the discretion of the signatory country itself. I also pointed out that the Government had chosen to exercise this discretion with regard to exempting certain other associated charges from the value to be subject to duty. </PARA>
<PARA> I further pointed out that bona fide users of the exemption may be advantaged. Senator Lewis gave an example of this in his opening remarks this morning concerning Australian Consolidated Industries' importation of soda ash from Wyoming in the United States of America. The Government's move will simply result in higher importation costs and higher manufacturing costs which, of course, ultimately are passed on to the community as a whole. The Government's response that importers or others who consider that they may suffer a hardship under this provision would be invited to put their case to government or to the Industries Assistance Commission (IAC) with a view to having the duty on their goods reduced is quite unsatisfactory. It is unsatisfactory for several reasons, the first being that there will be a time lag and that the company concerned will have to pay duty in the interim. There will, indeed, be no guarantee of any reduction. Indeed, the case of the importation of soda ash has already been before the IAC and I think it is unlikely that the IAC would welcome a further reference on the matter. </PARA>
<PARA> It is also pointed out by the Customs Agents Institute of Australia, which has made a strong plea, that small importers would be quite considerably disadvantaged by this provision. People who can load a full container packed at the factory can gain an advantage over small shippers where goods are packed in container depots where they only fill part of a container. The former does not have to pay duty on the inland freight but the latter does. Again it is unfair and not consistent, and the law, to be a good law, ought always to be consistent as well as certain. </PARA>
<PARA> These Bills were first placed before the House of Representatives some 18 months ago and were then introduced into this chamber. They have been the subject of much discussion because industry has been so dissatisfied with the approach that the Government has taken to them and, indeed, with the lack of consultation. I do not think that situation has been remedied. Indeed, the amendments to the initial Bill introduced 18 months ago are considerable. My understanding is that the consultation concerning those further amendments has been less than satisfactory. </PARA>
<PARA> It is always disappointing to find legislation introduced into this House that makes conducting business more difficult. There are in excess of 80 discretionary powers conferred on the Australian Customs Service by this legislation. The legislation has a complexity which renders the law, as I have said earlier, uncertain. Good law is simple law. Good law is easy to understand, interpret and comply with. </PARA>
<PARA> I have already said that the technique that was used in drafting these Bills is the technique which has been used in drafting taxation legislation. In the taxation area we have come to the ridiculous situation where pensioners cannot fill out their own taxation returns because of the complexity of the law. In this area we are applying strict liability in some instances to a complex law which is uncertain and subject to many discretions. That is bad law. It would be quite refreshing if the Government could perhaps take a leaf out of the books of other countries which have similar problems to us, such as Canada, where they seem to be able to have law drafted in a more straightforward way and in a way which is comprehensible and certain. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition, in moving an amendment to one of the two pieces of legislation I have referred to, is taking a stance on an important issue. The nature of the Bills is serious because they will affect the overall economy. The concern of the Government seems simply to collect more revenue without concern as to whether this is just or equitable. I find the Bills to be bad law in the sense that I have described and would draw the Senate's attention to the fact that there is a need to overhaul totally the attitude which this Government has to the introduction of laws which affect the business efficiency of our economy. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to speak about clause 8 of the Customs and Excise Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1987, which allows for the Minister for Defence to suspend previously granted licences or permissions to export goods from Australia in circumstances where it is deemed in Australia's national interest to do so. This follows the recommendations of the 1986 Cooksey Review of Australia's Defence Exports and Defence Industry, which have never been debated in this chamber, and the announcement in June last year that the existing export controls on defence related goods would be revised so as to reduce constraints on exports where that could be done without prejudice to Australia's national interests and international obligations.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Cooksey report recommended that Australia could and should double its defence exports over three to five years. This is a curious contrast to the statement made by Mr Hayden, the former Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, speaking at the United Nations (UN) Special Session on Disarmament in June last year in New York. I will quote what he said even though Senator McLean mentioned it in his speech. I will add a little bit to it because his statement is central to my argument in opposing this clause of the Bill. The former Foreign Minister, said:</PARA>
<PARA>It is also clear that arms exports should not be turned to as a way of solving domestic economic problems. Arms transfers must not become a new cash crop. It should also be recognised, especially by those whose development needs are great, that the purchase of arms is at the cost of the purchase of the investment goods essential to the creation of employment and economic growth. </PARA>
<PARA>In June last year the Minister for Defence (Mr Beazley) announced in a news release:</PARA>
<PARA>This Government's successful economic and defence policies mean Australian companies can now produce a growing range of internationally competitive defence products. </PARA>
<PARA>Twelve days later Mr Hayden was quoted in the Australian as saying:</PARA>
<PARA>I can't go to the UN Special Session on Disarmament, as I did a fortnight ago in New York and talk about our commitment in Australia . . . to work to try to cut back the arms trade . . . and then come back home and talk about a huge burst in the sale of conventional arms. </PARA>
<PARA>The UN Special Session on Disarmament was important because 26 countries, including Australia, raised the issue of arms transfers in the plenary debate. The Assembly voted for further discussion on arms transfers in the Disarmament Commission meeting this year and there will be a report to the Forty-fourth UN General Assembly. A study will then begin, to run over two years, of ways and means of promoting transparency in international transfers of conventional arms on a universal and non-discriminatory basis. One possible outcome of this study would be the establishment of an international registry of arms transfers under UN auspices. </PARA>
<PARA> I look forward to seeing what position the Australian Government will take on this issue and whether we vote in favour of a register. It is a point I make because even Robert Cooksey in his report to the Minister for Defence observed that it was extremely difficult to estimate the value of current and potential defence exports due to lack of available data in Australia. I see nothing in the new arrangements which will make it possible for us to know what defence equipment Australia is exporting in this way. </PARA>
<PARA> What are the reasons for the contradictions I have outlined and why have the merchants of death won out over the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade with its consideration of our more long term interests? The reasons for the Government's change of mind on defence exports are partly strategic and partly economic. It considers that greater overseas sales of defence products will make Australia's existing defence industries more efficient, that they will help develop the kind of industrial infrastructure that is required to support our new so-called strategy of self-reliance, that they will reduce the relatively large portion-23 per cent in 1986-87-of the defence budget that is spent overseas, and that they will help offset our balance of payments problems. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like to question some of these assumptions. Given the changes now taking place in the international arms market, it is highly doubtful whether Australia can simply double its defence exports, despite a greater effort on the part of industry and appropriate government support. Today there is a growing buyers' market in military arms and equipment, including the kind of materiel that we would hope to sell. A lot of other countries are seeking to use defence exports to alleviate domestic economic problems and even well established defence equipment exporters are having to diversify and offer attractive package deals in order to survive. The main reason for this situation is the global recession and the indebtedness of many of the major arms importing nations as well as the tendency for importing nations to update existing arsenals rather than buy new replacement weapons systems. Under these circumstances, and in view of our relatively small and unsophisticated defence industry, it will be very difficult, if not impossible, for Australia to capture major new markets or significantly to expand its defence exports, at least not without disproportionate government investment and still further relaxation of the export control regime that we are considering right now. </PARA>
<PARA> Besides this relaxation of export controls there has been a change in export policy guidelines. While the revised guidelines have not yet been publicly released, they are believed to be far more lenient than those that have operated in the past. Moreover, there has been a reversal of the onus of proof in relation to the approval of export contracts. The Government will now have to indicate why a particular export agreement should not proceed, rather than the exporter demonstrating why the goods should be sold. Export proposals will no longer be considered on a case by case basis, and most will now be approved by officials of the Department of Defence. The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and the Department of Industry, Technology and Commerce will be consulted only in sensitive cases or when Defence proposes to deny an export application. </PARA>
<PARA> It appears that Australia will continue not to export defence goods to certain states against which there are arms embargoes imposed by the UN Security Council, or by any other international instrument to which Australia is a party. Also, we will not be exporting to those countries which threaten the strategic interests of Australia or its friends or allies. The Australian Government expressly reserves the right to prohibit the export of military goods to governments that seriously violate the human rights or constitutional rights of their citizens and also, in particular cases, where specified Australian foreign policy interests could outweigh the export benefits. Quite how these guidelines are to be interpreted remains unclear, particularly given the increasingly automatic nature of the export approval process. </PARA>
<PARA> There is also a conflict of interest associated with the encouragement and approval of exports. The Minister for Defence is the principal approval authority for the export of defence materiel. He is also responsible for the preparation of policies for the export of defence materiel. Given the present desire to increase exports, this dual function is likely to lead to the erosion or evasion of existing export controls. This conflict of interest is also a product of the generally closed nature of the approval processes within the Department of Defence. There is no oversight of defence exports by Parliament, nor are other government departments or agencies, other than the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, involved to any large extent. </PARA>
<PARA> Under the old guidelines there were 32 categories of weapons and equipment subject to export restrictions. These controls covered everything from ammunition to fire alarm systems. Under the new policy those broad controls have been reduced. The new controls will apply only to items specifically designed or adapted to military purposes and to products which are inherently lethal or destructive. In other words, far more products and services can be exported without adequate scrutiny. Obviously, I have not seen the new guidelines on export controls and therefore my reference is only to the press release put out by the Minister for Defence last June. Before then export controls on arms were tight by international standards, which themselves were depressingly slack. The revised controls of June 1988 have even more weaknesses than the old ones and I would like to outline what I see as the seven principal weaknesses. </PARA>
<PARA> There is no Australian arms embargo upon repressive governments. Instead, under the new policy exports will be favoured `where there is no reasonable risk of using the equipment against the citizens of a country with a dubious civil rights record'. This is splitting hairs. If a government has a track record of repression, like the Philippine Government, then the supply of Australian small arms target training ranges is support for repression, even though a target range cannot be used to kill. Secondly, subject to constraints, like the human rights ones I have just referred to, there will be a presumption that if our friends and allies export certain military equipment to country X Australia may export comparable equipment there too. This is more than disturbing given the deplorable record of the United States in supplying arms to repressive governments. </PARA>
<PARA> Thirdly, equipment which is neither lethal nor of major military significance will be exempted from controls. This implies that there will be no control whatever upon intangible exports like maintenance and overhaul services, or upon combat support equipment like small arms training aids and transport aircraft. Fourthly, the onus of proof has been shifted on to those opposing an export proposal. In such cases a specific case against an export approval will have to be made within 21 days. </PARA>
<PARA> Fifthly, the participation of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, which was the human rights watchdog within the old consultative status, is greatly reduced. Routine administration will be performed by the Department of Defence, whose prime concern is not human rights but keeping arms out of the hands of Australia's enemies, perceived or real. Sixthly, there are no controls upon the retransfer of Australian-made components incorporated into foreign built equipment. Finally, there are no controls upon the supply of First World countries with a record of repressive intervention in the Third World. Both the United States and France import arms from Australia. Both have a record of repressive intervention. Currently, the United States, the United Kingdom, New Zealand and Canada are exempt from export controls. Of course, these nations are free to re-export whatever they buy from Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> There is great doubt whether we can realistically compete with our defence exports, given the competition from countries such as China and exporters with lower costs. Obviously, we cannot compete in the high technology market. The danger is that we shall reduce our own restrictions in order to realistically compete in a buyers' market. Which countries are we hoping to sell to? Perhaps we could sell a little more to the United States as a concession from the Government there, given how much we buy from them-like 75 FA18s. We cannot offer much to Europe. We are already bullying New Zealand over the frigates. Most of the countries we might like to sell to in South East Asia come in the category of national security regimes where defence equipment is, more often than not, used on the people of those countries rather than any external enemy, or to boost the egos of the top military brass. Human rights groups in countries like Thailand and the Philippines have already asked Australia to stop encouraging their governments to spend more on military equipment or not to participate in defence exhibitions-for example, the ones in Bangkok and Singapore. </PARA>
<PARA> It is also not clear that an increase in arms exports will significantly benefit Australia's economy. Any increase in earnings from defence exports will need to be measured against some of the costs and potentially adverse economic effects of seeking to become a major arms exporter. These include the diversion of capital and key skills and resources away from other areas of the manufacturing sector; the need to import new technologies from overseas in order to establish new armaments and related industries; and the need to support these industries between contracts or in times of low demand. </PARA>
<PARA> No doubt we shall be hearing about the virtue of the patrol boats being handed over to the South Pacific nations under the defence cooperation program. I am not opposed to this program, but as far as I can gather we are not selling those patrol boats. They only benefit Australia because, in building them here, we create jobs in the yards concerned. I would rather we gave them as part of a civilian aid program. I fail to see why they should be considered as defence exports. I suspect that part of the motivation in providing these patrol boats is to develop our regional forward defence strategy in the South West Pacific, even if the patrol boats have to spend most of their time chasing trawlers engaged in poaching in the region, particularly those belonging to the United States. </PARA>
<PARA> Other contradictions are also evident. On the conservative side of this chamber there are those who believe that arms transfers are a part of building up a country's ability to defend itself against aggression. They seem to have a fixation with the past. They refuse to acknowledge that the nature of war and the weapons of war have changed. They are the kind of people to whom Albert Einstein referred when he observed that the atom has changed everything except the way we think and, thus, we drift towards unparalleled catastrophe. Yet at the same time they argue in favour of everyone's right to export arms, particularly to resolve problems with balance of payments. So we have a situation when they gravely warn us of the dangers of the naval build-up in the Indian Ocean by India and go as far as to suggest that perhaps Australia should acquire nuclear submarines and an aircraft carrier to replace HMAS Melbourne. Next, we hear that an Australian-Dutch consortium has won the contract to set up a huge new naval base in India and the Australia hopes to sell off 50 old Mirage fighters to Pakistan, thus further exacerbating the arms race in the region. I thought that there might perhaps be some protest about this; but no there is silence. It is very hypocritical. </PARA>
<PARA> The balance of payments is a mess, in great part because of the vast amounts we are importing in the way of military equipment. I have already referred to the 75 FA18s, which will probably cost us over $5 billion by the time that they are all delivered. I refer to the new submarines that we are buying through Sweden, although they are largely being put together in Australia. The same goes for the ANZAC frigates, and the new computers for the Department of Defence for the Geraldton spy base. We are buying all these from countries which are also exporting to offset their balance of payments. There are then the countries I have listed before with which Australia will have to compete-China, North Korea, South Korea, Singapore, Taiwan, India, Brazil, Argentina, Israel and South Africa. </PARA>
<PARA> In opposing this particular clause, I want to stress once again the wide amount of community concern about the decision to try to double our military exports in the next few years. On an earlier occasion, Senator MacGibbon referred to a few extremist groups opposing the decision. He actually mentioned the Australian Council for Overseas Aid (ACFOA) in this context. It is worth recalling that ACFOA represents 80 non-government organisations working in the field of overseas aid and development. The Australian Council of Churches, which passed a resolution on the subject and sent a letter to the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) about its concern, is hardly an extremist group or a subset of the peace movement. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not know whether Senator MacGibbon has read the Autumn 1989 Community Aid Abroad Review, but it contains a four-page section on military exports and asks readers to write to their local members of parliament on the subject. I do not consider Community Aid Abroad an extremist group either; nor is it a subset of the peace movement. I know that there are a number of members of Parliament who will be taking part in the Community Aid Abroad walk against want on 16 April, even if they do not necessarily agree with my views or Community Aid Abroad's critique of military exports. It is not valid to write off critics of the Government's decision as a few loonies, which the supporters of this Bill will doubtless seek to do. I would rather that they addressed the substance of the argument instead of heaping personal abuse on the critics. </PARA>
<PARA> I do have an alternative, because I am concerned about jobs and the balance of payments. Rather than increasing defence exports, we should be opposing arms transfers worldwide. We should expand the debate about Australia's defence policy which has driven us to purchase such expensive military equipment from overseas, severely damaging our balance of payments. We should spend more money on promoting common security in our region. We should develop policies which address the issues of jobs and economic conversion for those already engaged in the defence industries sector. </PARA>
<PARA> If this legislation goes ahead, as seems inevitable, unfortunately, because of the unholy alliance on the matter between an Australian Labor Party which has forgotten its principles and an Opposition which does not have any on this issue, then I would at least urge the Government to give serious consideration to the following measures to prevent further supply of arms for repression: Firstly, extending the scope of our arms export controls to cover equipment, components and intangibles such as services and skills specifically intended for end use by foreign military, paramilitary or police clients, and to include the United States, the United Kingdom, Canada and New Zealand in the control procedure; secondly, to impose an arms embargo applying to all items I have just listed upon countries whose governments are repressive or engaged in, or likely to engage in, repressive intervention in other countries; thirdly, to control the retransfer of Australian made components incorporated into military equipment made by foreign manufacturers; fourthly, to control and reduce Australian collaboration in international military production. </PARA>
<PARA> I urge that there should be routine parliamentary and public scrutiny of arms exports. At present, this would hardly be possible in view of the difficulty of obtaining information on military exports. It is, therefore, important that the Government publish an annual register of Australian military exports. This should include a contract by contract list detailing the Australian supplier, the nature and quantity of the export, and the foreign recipient. It should also include details of Australian collaboration in international military production. In addition, I would recommend that any substantial military export proposals should require parliamentary assent. These proposals are not so far-fetched as both of them are in line with current United States practice. If they can do it, I do not see why we cannot. I would also suggest that there should be an attempt by the Government and the community to trace the fate of Australian arms exports. </PARA>
<PARA> I am indebted to St John Kettle from the Victorian Association of Peace Studies for some of this material. I want to remind the Senate that often people who are looking only at the business and dollars aspect of exporting anything forget about the end use of the products that they are promoting. Let us consider the point of impact-the suffering of the ultimate receivers of so-called defence exports. They would be more realistically labelled as components of offensive weapons systems, as instruments of repression. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Very briefly, I would like to underline, yet again, in concert with many of my colleagues in the Opposition, the parlous state that Australia is in with regard to science and technology. The future development of this nation for our children and our children's children depends upon the intellectual and technological investment we make in science, research and technology. Under the present Government we have seen the wastage of our developed resources in this important area. It is of great concern to many constituents in all States and Territories of the nation.

We do not need a publicist; we need a scientist and an administrator to give leadership in this vital statutory authority. CSIRO's most successful years were under its first chief, Sir David Rivett, an eminent scientist. Secondly, we should allocate substantial funds to CSIRO, the flagship of Australian science. To return the CSIRO to the position it was in in 1982-83 we need to provide about $50m extra this financial year. Thirdly, we need to re-establish the science department or equivalent to provide a focus for politicians, scientists and the public. Science ought to be represented at Cabinet level. Fourthly, we ought to put in place a national science strategy for Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
