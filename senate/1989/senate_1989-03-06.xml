<TITLE>X-rated and Violent Video Material</TITLE>
<PARA>To the Honourable the President and members of the Senate in Parliament assembled. The humble petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth that:</PARA>
<PARA> The Parliamentary Joint Select Committee on Video Material has concluded that ``Adverse effects upon people, and especially upon children, of exposure to material containing various degrees of violence, pornography or obscenity have been demonstrated''.</PARA>
<PARA> The majority of the Select Committee strongly opposed the proposition for a new NVE (non-violent erotica) category, which would have entrenched X-rated video pornography.</PARA>
<PARA> All six State Governments have, through their Attorneys-General expressed unanimous opposition to the circulation of X-rated videos.</PARA>
<PARA> We consider the continuing distribution of X-rated videos from the A.C.T. to be reprehensible and to be contrary to the wellbeing of the Australian community in general.</PARA>
<PARA> We strongly request urgent Government action to prohibit the distribution of X-rated and excessively violent video material.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister representing the Minister for Housing and Aged Care. I refer the Minister to the Saulwick Herald poll published in today's Sydney Morning Herald, which showed that almost 40 per cent of people polled believed interest rates were the most important factor in pushing up housing costs. Twenty per cent of people believed the cause was the presence of overseas buyers whilst 18 per cent believed it was the activities of speculators. Is the Minister aware that only 9 per cent of respondents blamed the housing crisis on availability of land? Why did the Government's housing summit last Friday focus on land availability, when the main cause of the crisis is clearly the failure of the Government's economic policies?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;If the honourable senator wants to give it to me now, I am quite happy. But I do not want to delay the Senate by looking at what he hands to me across the table five minutes after he has asked me a question when he could have handed it to me across the table five minutes before he asked the question.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The question Senator Boswell has asked seems to me to be an extraordinary question. He is saying that, according to this poll, a number of people in Australia believe one thing and a number of people believe that the solution to the problem is the availability or the supply side aspects of land for housing. The difference between perceptions and reality is the question that the honourable senator is asking. What is a clear analysis of the housing problem is that the supply side aspects of the problem are the most difficult and the ones for which there is the possibility of immediate relief. Frankly, I get sick and tired of members of the Opposition trotting out arguments about interest rates when it could be helping create a positive framework and a positive atmosphere in this country and doing something about the land supply problem which is a real aspect of the housing crisis in this country. The housing summit on Friday was aimed at doing something positive about that. If this were a conservative government-the people of Australia can thank God that it is not-it would have clamped down and created a recession. The demand and the overheating in the housing sector would have been dealt with that way and people would not have had access to housing.</PARA>
<PARA> What we as a government are doing is identifying the positive things that can be done to improve the supply side aspects-releasing land onto the market in Australia to make land more available, making it available to the States, asking the States to do the same and setting up mechanisms by which we identify other blockages in the supply side of the system such as the questions of skilled labour and housing materials. I will read Senator Boswell's poll, but it will not alter the fact that that is the positive, most pro-active policy a government in these circumstances can take.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I refer the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade to recent public comments about Australia's relations with the Soviet Union and in particular the press release by the Opposition spokesman for foreign affairs, Mr Spender, last Friday in which he asserted that the Government's policies towards the Soviet Union have been influenced by the alleged clandestine activities of the Soviet diplomat Zemskov, and implied that there has been a sinister relationship between Zemskov and a senior official of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade. What is the Government's attitude to the issues and allegations that Mr Spender has raised?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator GARETH EVANS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As I said last week, it is well-established practice that the Government does not comment on security and intelligence affairs. I will not depart from that practice any more than I did last week, to the obvious distaste of Senator Stone then and now and some other members of the parrot brigade opposite. But within that constraint there are aspects of the allegations made by the shadow Minister for foreign affairs and trade, Mr Spender, which do not go to the sources or nature of Australian intelligence information and on which I am able to comment as a result and indeed which I believe cannot be allowed to pass without a comment. At the outset let me make clear that the Australian Government's approach--</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="EF4">Senator Chaney</NAME></TALKER>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator GARETH EVANS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am happy to talk about that in general terms, but not in the context of any particular case, the scrutiny that was made of any particular individual in that context or the sources of information about that particular individual in that context. I do not propose to do that, but what I do propose to do is to respond to the allegations, not only those directed against the the officer of my Department, but also those which specifically claim that certain aspects of our dealings with the Soviet Union have in fact been influenced by a particular alleged role played by a particular Soviet official. What I want to say at the outset is that the Australian Government's approach in its relations with the Soviet Union is hard headed and realistic. It takes due account of the commercial benefits that flow from adopting a position of recognition of the practical benefits that can flow from a relationship in economic and trade areas-a relationship which we have not been afraid to develop-but it is an approach which is also based on advice from all relevant departments and agencies, including our security agencies, in the context of any advance in that relationship. Thus, the current fisheries and commodities negotiations with the Soviet Union have been undertaken with the fullest possible consultation with the defence and security agencies, and Australian security interests have been fully taken into account in the course of these negotiations. I believe that when the outcome of those negotiations becomes a matter of public record-it is already partly so-the force of what I am saying will be perfectly clear; indeed, it should be quite apparent.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The shadow Minister, in suggesting that Australia's relations with the Soviet Union so far as the consular agreement is concerned are somehow the product of an exercise that puts us at security risk-an exercise based on an allegedly sinister relationship between Zemskov and an Australian official-is making an absolutely preposterous assertion. I can say for the record that the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation had no problems whatsoever with the consular agreement which has been concluded-that is to say, negotiated but not yet signed-between our two countries. Moreover, Mr Spender is absolutely wrong in suggesting, as he does in his press release, that the consular agreement will grant full diplomatic status to Soviet consular officers and do so in a way that is without precedent elsewhere in the world. That agreement provides immunity from criminal jurisdictions similar to that accorded to diplomats, but that does not amount to diplomatic status. Moreover, and perhaps more significantly in the light of the flavour that Mr Spender was seeking to convey in his press release, the kinds of immunities in question are not unusual in agreements of this kind; indeed, no lesser immunities have been granted for more than 20 years under specific consular treaties, not diplomatic ones, which the United Kingdom and the United States of America have with the Soviet Union.</PARA>
<PARA> Again, the immunities granted in the Australia-Union of Soviet Socialist Republics agreement-and this is part of the explanation of them, being cast as they are-are reciprocal in character and will apply equally to Australian consular staff in the event that Australia opens a consulate in the Soviet Union in the future. As I have said, one of the reasons they were negotiated on that basis was to acquire reciprocal status for Australia in the event that we might open such an office. So there is nothing unique, nothing unusual and nothing untoward about this agreement. It is quite grotesque for it to be suggested that this is not only something that will help the Soviets in a potential espionage activity but it is also somehow attributable to the relationship referred to in the press release.</PARA>
<PARA> Let me now turn to that relationship, because in Mr Spender's press release personal allegations have been made against a particular Australian official which are among the most shabby, despicable and utterly unsubstantiated to have come from the Opposition in recent memory. They represent a grossly unfair attack upon the officer concerned, who has served and continues to serve his country with diligence and dedication. The unambiguous purport of what Mr Spender is saying in his press release of last Friday is that there was a sinister relationship between Mr Hayden's former principal private secretary, namely, Mr Michael Costello, who is now a deputy secretary in my Department, and the Soviet official, Zemskov. Not the slightest foundation is given for that serious personal attack on a senior Australian career diplomat, nor to my knowledge is there any conceivable foundation for such an assertion. In making the allegation the shadow Minister refers only to a Canberra Times report of 5 February. He suggests, based evidently on that report, that the relationship between the Australian official and Zemskov is, in his terms, `a cause for particularly grave concern'. Mr Spender neglects to note that the very same report states that there was never any suggestion of impropriety. The report states that it was natural enough that Mr Costello should know Zemskov in view of his professional responsibilities in the Department for Australia's relations with the Soviet Union. Moreover, and this is completely ignored in the Spender release, on the following day the Canberra Times printed under the heading `Zemskov: clarification' a piece which states:</PARA>
<PARA> The Canberra Times reiterates that its original story did not suggest Mr Costello's conduct was anything but appropriate, professional and necessary to the execution of his duties.</PARA>
<PARA>So in basing his allegations on the newspaper report but neglecting-obviously deliberately-even to mention these clear and unequivocal subsequent statements by that same paper, the shadow Minister is clearly engaged in a malicious and quite dishonest attack, not to mention a highly actionable attack, upon the individual in question.</PARA>

What particularly annoyed me was that the day before I had at least given an unequivocal answer clarifying those matters. Mr Howard chose to ignore that. Indeed, a close reading of Mr Howard's answer shows that he said that he relied on a newspaper report in the Melbourne Herald.

This year's program will run under estimate and will cost us $350m. No claim was made then by the Prime Minister, nor now by me, that that is attributable entirely to one factor. What I said in Hong Kong was that there were three factors operating in our failing to achieve our business migration target: firstly, the appreciation of the Australian dollar; secondly, competition from New Zealand and Canada; and, thirdly, our image in the continent of Asia in particular due to the debate we had last year.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Under the offset guidelines all tenders are subject to a specification of appropriate offsets. These have to be complied with for all eligible government purchasing. Firms which have undertaken partnership agreements are, as Senator Macklin points out, exempted from the offset obligations on the basis of a long term agreement which the partnership agreements represent. Thus firms which have entered long term agreements such as partnerships are exempted from offsets but all other overseas tenderers-that is to say, tendering companies which are not subject to partnership agreements-are required to specify how their offset obligations will be met. I think that explains why purchasing departments still require details of offsets from non-partnership tenderers-indeed, from all. The tender specifications go to a wide range of companies, some of which are partnership companies while others are not.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> On the second part of the question, there has been extensive communication between my Department and other purchasing departments about these matters. The main vehicle for these communications has been the Government Offsets and Purchasing Advisory Committee, which is a part government-both State and Federal-and part business or industry committee. It has on it representatives from my Department, the Department of Administrative Services, the Department of Defence and State government departments. The Government's policy regarding offsets in well understood, I believe, within government departments. However, if Senator Macklin's question was prompted by a query from some more remote place, let me say that I willingly concede that a large number of purchasing officers are scattered widely across the many arms of government. There may be some lack of clarity about these procedures in some isolated instances, but I believe that that is generally not so.</PARA>

Are United Kingdom age pensions indexed in the United Kingdom but not indexed if the recipient settles in Australia? If so, does the Australian Government supplement the United Kingdom pensions of persons resident in Australia to counter the loss in real value of the pension due to non-indexation? What is the nature of the supplement which is provided and are such payments ex gratia or are the payments in accord with a provision of the Social Security Act? Has the Australian Government approached the United Kingdom Government to index its pensions for recipients now resident in Australia and, if so, when were those approaches made and when is some agreement likely?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="XE4">Senator BOLKUS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have some information for Senator Colston from the Minister for Social Security. It is correct to say that United Kingdom age pensions are indexed in that country but are not indexed if the recipient moves to Australia and lives here permanently. That means that a former United Kingdom resident who has come to live in Australia has pension paid at the level it was when he or she left the United Kingdom or, if it was granted while that person was in Australia, at the time of the grant. Australian pensions, by contrast, are fully indexed in the United Kingdom. Accordingly, it has always been a matter of concern to this Government that the United Kingdom Government chooses not to index its pensions here, despite the fact that it does so in approximately 30 other countries. A United Kingdom pensioner, therefore, living in Australia may get as little as $5 a week from the United Kingdom Government, whilst someone living elsewhere, with an identical United Kingdom contribution record, could get the fully indexed amount of up to $185 a week. It is therefore costing Australia about $80m a year to subsidise the United Kingdom pension in Australia because of this refusal by the United Kingdom Government to index pensions.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator Colston asked about the nature of supplementation and subsidisation. Subsidisation takes place under two different arrangements. The first and by far the largest group who are subsidised are those who have qualified for the Australian pension by meeting residency requirements, for example, 10 years for age pensioners, and so are paid under the Social Security Act in the same way that other pensioners are paid in Australia. For this group, normally the United Kingdom pension is treated as income under the income test. The second and smaller group are those who do not meet residency requirements but who are in the process of doing so. This group is paid under a social security agreement between Australia and the United Kingdom.</PARA>
<PARA> The last part of Senator Colston's question was about approaches made by the Australian Government to the United Kingdom Government on this matter. The Minister for Social Security raised the issue in talks with the United Kingdom Minister, Mr Nicholas Scott, in London in July last year. The Prime Minister, Mr Hawke, raised the issued again with the British Prime Minister, Mrs Thatcher, during her visit here in August last year. Subsequent to that, the Prime Minister wrote to Mrs Thatcher urging consideration of indexation. Her response, received in January, again declined to index pensions on the ground of cost to the United Kingdom Government. Finally, the Australian Government is committed to raising this issue with the United Kingdom Government at every possible opportunity.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I should thank Senator Black for not asking me the same question that Neil Kinnock asked the British Prime Minister in the House of Commons last month-that is, `What did you have for lunch?'. As I recall she replied, `Cheshire cheese-and very nice it was too'. I did not have cheese for lunch, but if I had and it had been something as exotic as King Island brie, Margaret River brie or even humble cheddar, being an Australian product it would have been very nice indeed and very likely free from any taint of listeria. I have seen the press reports, which were mainly of overseas contamination of cheeses by listeria. To my knowledge there have been no reports of any contamination of Australian cheeses. The reports have all concerned the organism listeria monocytogenes and it should be mentioned immediately that listeria itself is an organism that is naturally present in a variety of raw food ingredients of animal or plant origin. In fact, there are eight species of listeria. One of them, listeria inocula, is an additive in the cheese making process. But the offensive one, the culprit, the dangerous one which has caused ill health, sickness and, I believe, death in Spain last year, is listeria monocytogenes. As an organism it is destroyed by cooking or by pasteurisation. Thus, local cheeses made on the Australian market are not likely to have this organism present as they have either survived a heat treatment or been made from pasteurised milk. There may be some very small family backyard concerns that privately make a cheese or two to which this does not apply, but it certainly applies to the regular brands. The problems are generally associated with inadequate cooking or heat processing, or they can arise because of poor hygienic practices in the factory, shop or home after the necessary delivery of cheese has been made. It is a feature of soft cheeses, and not all cheeses, in which the food poisoning occurs.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service has operated since January last year-indeed, I think that it was one of the first decisions that I made in this portfolio-to institute a control program on imported cheeses. All imported soft and surface ripened cheeses from factories identified overseas as potential sources of contamination are sampled upon arrival and are held until they are cleared. High risk cheeses are sampled and recall procedures are implemented if listeria is detected. Since the program four samples have tested positive. They have been destroyed by Quarantine under supervision and no recalls were necessary. For Australian produced cheeses all factories manufacturing high risk products are tested on a random basis under a Commonwealth and State program. There is in place a procedure agreed by the States and the Commonwealth for clearing plant and product if contamination is detected. None has up until now. If I had been asked what I had for lunch and it had been an Australian or an imported cheese, it would have been okay.</PARA>

It would be very difficult for any Sydneysider not to be aware of that at the moment, with demonstrations on the beaches and lifeguards threatening to withdraw their services. I am also concerned about it from the tourism point of view because it cannot be doing the tourism industry very much good. I am aware that infrastructure costs in the capital cities are mounting. I am asked whether I am aware that these cost increases are stressing the ability of State governments to meet such costs. All the State governments would certainly claim that they were being stressed to meet those costs. The truth of such claims I am not always sure of, but I am aware of them. I am asked whether I support the Prime Minister's call for a 25 per cent increase in Australia's population in the next 10 years.

We all obviously have to be careful about the capacity of Australia to meet its needs in relation to population increases. What I think should be the rate is not relevant, but obviously the Government will monitor that increase. The Government will have to make sure that Australia can afford to take on new migrants.

Does the Minister agree that, in light of the program, which spoke of a Mr Rover against a background of images of the most horrendous concentration camp scenes, if Mr Rover were to be tried he could not now be guaranteed a fair trial? Does the Minister agree that the program reinforces the fears expressed by many ethnic communities that such communities, rather than individuals, would be targeted?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I had some glimpses of the Sunday program when I was interstate and happened to switch on the television in my motel room. However, I did not see the whole program, so I cannot talk about the entire context as it may have been developed by the directors of that segment of the cover story.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As I have said before, in answer to questions about a certain Australian citizen who was also named on the program and who faces expulsion from the United States, any publicity which can prejudice the fair trial of a person who may be charged in relation to these very serious offences is to be avoided, if at all possible. I would make a plea to the media of this country to exercise some self-restraint and some decency in this respect. As was indicated in the question, it is very important that the fountains of justice are not poisoned by pre-trial publicity.</PARA>
<PARA> As a Senate, when passing the war crimes legislation, we said, as is indicated in the preamble, that it is essential in the interests of justice that persons accused be given a fair trial with all the safeguards for accused persons on trial in our courts, having particular regard to matters such as the gravity of the allegations and the lapse of time since the alleged crimes. Certainly, the courts of this country have always taken care to protect an accused person against the possibility of a jury-there will be jury trials if committal proceedings are successful, from a prosecution's point of view-being prejudiced in its dealings with an accused person. What one would not wish to see is a trial not going ahead because of an indulgence in appeal to emotional reactions such as those foreshadowed in the Sunday program which I partially saw.</PARA>
<PARA> I do not believe that any reasonable person would think that the investigations being carried out by the Special Investigations Unit, the prosecutions to be undertaken or the Government's policy or indeed the Parliament's policy in eventually passing the legislation is directed against communities. Clearly attention is directed to those individuals who, it is indicated, have sought haven in this country, despite the fact that there are serious allegations concerning some of them. I make no indication that the persons named on the program are indeed the subject of investigation by the Special Investigations Unit or may be the subject of charges. The fact is that the allegations which may be made against certain persons in Australia are so serious that restraint, both in the media and in this chamber, is called for if persons are eventually to receive a fair trial.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The second Jakarta Informal Meeting (JIM) which was held between 19 February and 21 February did achieve some limited progress, attended as it was by the Association of South East Asian Nations countries plus Vietnam, Laos and the various Khmer factions. It did clearly and systematically identify the issues that need to be tackled, both internal and external. That, I think, is a tribute to my colleague Indonesian Foreign Minister Alatas, the Chairman of that meeting, who has been concerned to focus the parties on those issues of detail in a way that some of them have not in the past been prepared to do. It was also agreed on the need for an international conference and an international control mechanism to supervise a settlement, although details as to participation in that conference and its venue, and as to the role, function and size of an ICM do remain to be settled.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I think the greatest disappointment at the JIM meeting-this also was acknowledged by Foreign Minister Alatas-was the continuing failure of the Khmer factions to make headway on the internal aspects of a settlement, although they did agree of course to continue talks, with timing and venue as yet unspecified, and to report back to the JIM Chairman within four months.</PARA>
<PARA> So far as Australia's role in all of this is concerned, during my own visit to the region a few weeks ago-that is to say in the relevant countries, being for this purpose Vietnam, Laos, Thailand and China-and in my discussions with Foreign Minister Alatas last week, I have made clear Australia's interest as a concerned regional neighbour in the resolution of the Cambodia conflict and in the removal of a major cause of tension within the region, although I have repeatedly said that Australia does not claim to be a central player in this affair or to be really in a position of offering solutions to the present rapidly evolving situation. But in expressing Australia's interest I have been concerned to say a number of things: first of all, to express Australia's strong support for an early agreement on the withdrawal of Vietnamese troops and the cessation of external military aid; secondly, to express our unequivocal opposition to any return to power of Pol Pot or his senior associates in the Khmer Rouge; thirdly, to make clear our desire to see the Cambodian factions reach agreement among themselves on a durable internal settlement leading to elections and to do so as soon as possible; fourthly, to express support for Prince Sihanouk as a key figure whose incorporation in a leading role in any transitional Cambodian administration would really be crucial if it were to secure international acceptance; fifthly, to express our willingness to participate in an international conference if invited to do so; and, finally, our willingness to consider participation in an international control mechanism, but depending, of course, on the circumstances of the settlement and the proposed mechanism in question and our assessment of their respective viability.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;From time to time perhaps some of the Opposition senators will reveal where their investments might be-I exempt Senator Panizza from that-when this gold question comes up. After all, no other industry that produces a profit in Australia is exempt from tax like the gold industry is. The closing of that loophole is a necessary step in terms of economic efficiency and equity. And that is an important consideration. As I recall it, the price of gold hit a top of about $US477 per ounce in January 1988. It is now at around $US385 per ounce and, in Australian dollars, about $473 at present. On average, the cost of producing an ounce of gold is about $300 an ounce at present.</PARA></TALK.START>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RF4">Senator COOK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On average, those are the production costs in Australia, involving all forms of mining. Obviously some forms are cheaper and some forms are more expensive. As I understand it, Norseman is deep mining, so its costs could be at the upper end of that. In Australian dollar terms at present, gold is about $473 per ounce and the average production cost is around $300 per ounce. So there still ought to be a healthy margin for gold producers. I am aware that, at a time in which prices have fallen, as they have since the top in January 1988, there is an increasing impetus on companies to rationalise and to amalgamate. That is the working out of the market. In all these issues the international price is a key determinant as to whether investment is committed or production is continued. The reasons for the slump in gold prices are, to say the least, fairly complex. Some of the reasons would be: the United States dollar has appreciated in real terms recently; there are lower inflationary expectations in the United States; there has been a reduction in international tensions; and there has been an increase in gold supplies.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Gold is a counter-cyclical commodity. When things turn good the price of gold tends to go down; we know that from our own experience. We also know from our own experience that, although the strengthening of the Australian dollar has given some relief to mining producers over the last few weeks, production costs in Australia have risen. I do not like to see anyone put out of work anywhere at any time, but gold is a commodity traded internationally on an international price and, when those prices fall, we expect those industry fluctuations.</PARA>
<PARA> I am pleased to say that the honourable senator yet again has shrunk from calling it a gold tax, as he knows that it is simply not that; it is merely an extension of company tax to the goldmining industry and the closing off of a long-running loophole. It is not having any impact at present for the simple reason that it does not yet operate. As I understand it, the analysts still predict that goldmining in Australia will peak in around 1990-91.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Government has received confirmation of the fundamental soundness of its economic policy from not so much an extraordinary source but from a surprising source-indeed, from the shadow Treasurer pro tem. In today's Australian Robert Hadler wrote:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Responding to Mr Keating's taunts, Mr Peacock promised that a Federal Coalition government would aim to have a sufficient Budget surplus, after tax cuts, to offset all Commonwealth and State borrowings.</PARA>
<PARA>In the jargon that Treasury officials are fond of using, that means a net public sector borrowing requirement of either zero or a negative net PSBR. That is not something that this Government aims to do; it is something we have already done. It is nice to have from the mouth of the shadow Treasurer that the ambitions of a future coalition government are to achieve what this Government has already done. If I may say so, along with a refusal to make any specific commitments to tax cuts-we have become used to that-that was the only hard statement, so far as I could detect, in the whole interview. The rest of it was fairy floss, which would not surprise anybody very much who has been listening to Mr Peacock recently-if, indeed, anybody has been listening. It should not surprise listeners because, as Mr Peacock himself has said, he does not bring an accountant's approach to putting a Budget together.</PARA>
<PARA> That statement, of course, is incompatible with Mr Peacock's call, as recently as last Tuesday, for a tighter fiscal policy. I presume that the incompatibility is due to Mr Peacock not knowing that there are two perspectives to fiscal policy-one is the revenue side and one is the expenditure side. Mr Peacock probably does not know that. He sees only one component of it. If he does not want to take a tutorial from somebody in my office, from the Treasury or from somebody else in the bureaucracy, perhaps we could arrange for him to have a tutorial from Dr Hewson on that.</PARA>
<PARA> The only other point I make is that Mr Peacock said in that same article that the Opposition's policy on taxation will be released well before the next Federal poll is called, unless there is a poll before June 1989. Mr Howard, of course, had already promised to release that taxation policy in August 1988. That is a promise that is unfulfilled by some five months. Mr Howard now seems to be sliding out of any commitment to introduce or publish the Opposition's tax policies-that is assuming it has one-other than on the death knell before the next Federal election.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable senator for the question. I take great pleasure in answering it. Mr Punch did say that he thought an airport could be constructed in three years at Badgerys Creek. Honourable senators would find that one of Australia's leading engineering companies bore that fact out last week by saying that it could do one in 3 1/2 years. So I do not think we have much argument about whether it can be done. As far as environmental impact statements on Badgerys Creek are concerned, my predecessor, Mr Cohen, was satisfied with the environmental impact process carried out at Badgerys Creek. I shall endeavour to rummage through the records to see what I can give Senator Brownhill a copy of in that respect. So far as the construction of a third runway at the existing airport is concerned, the difficulty is not the construction period but that there would need to be an environmental impact process. Looking at Botany Bay and its importance, all I can say is that it would be a very lengthy process. One would imagine that, given the controversial nature of the project, it would have to involve a very long public period. We could not simply shut it off behind closed doors: there would need to be a public hearing. I would estimate that an environmental process of that kind would take between one and two years-leaning more towards the two than to the one. That being the case, those comments that have been made by our Ministers about the respective times when something could be ready at Badgerys Creek as against Kingsford-Smith are correct.</PARA></TALK.START>

That is clearly deplorable from the person who has the responsibility of advising the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) in this important area of the status of women. It is important because she did not receive the report only towards the end of last week when it was released publicly; we understand that her Government has had a draft of the report for about a fortnight. Perhaps the Prime Minister did not even think that it was worth while providing a copy of the draft to his Minister advising for her advice. If he did give it to her a fortnight ago, that is an even greater indictment of her. As we are to have the privilege, apparently, of her contributing to a debate on the status of women, on this rare occasion, she might tell us whether she has had that report for a fortnight and explain to the Senate why she is not prepared to address a document by such a highly regarded body which, in the terms of this motion, expresses a concern about the bias that exists within the Government's tax system against families and the sharp fall in real disposable income suffered by most families under six years of hard Labor. It is being celebrated with evidence of a growing rejection by Australian women of Labor and an even greater rejection by Australian women of the Prime Minister. I am sure that this Government would like to be reminded that the rating of the Prime Minister in the eyes of Australian women collapsed last month from 41 per cent to 29 per cent-only 29 per cent of Australian women now support this Prime Minister, as disclosed by the Saulwick poll last weekend.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Why are the women of Australia rejecting the Prime Minister so? I suggest that it is because he is arrogant and out of touch. How out of touch will be demonstrated during this debate. He is offensive, as was shown in his response to the many thousands of Australian women who protested against this Government's policy on the pornographic video industry in the Australian Capital Territory (ACT). He had no respect for the views those women were putting or for the views of the women's organisations that Senator Reynolds, time and time again, comes into this chamber and tells us that she wishes to hear and will respond to. But when a practical application comes to the test, Senator Reynolds does not even note the objections of these women's organisations. Perhaps she will respond to that in today's debate. As I have indicated before, on the issue of her Government's attitude to the demeaning of women by the pornographic video industry, she will not even front up or contribute to debates. Australian women are rejecting this Prime Minister because he is condescending and perhaps also because he gets no help whatsoever from the Minister assisting him, Senator Reynolds. </PARA>
<PARA> As I have said, this country has had six years of Labor government, during which time the women of Australia have been bombarded with a most sophisticated and expensive propaganda campaign telling them what this Government is doing for them.

<PARA> We have now had two women in advertising conferences, building expectations that the sexist stereotyping of women will end. Women have been brought from all around Australia to attend and participate in these conferences outlining the problem. But what has happened? Has anything happened? It certainly has not. When we look at the Government's own performance in its own arena we find that sexist advertising is still continuing in relation to the Royal Australian Navy. We find that this Government, which has dictated that the private advertising sector should lift its game in relation to sexist advertising and stop stereotyping women in the kitchen, is, at the same time through its legislative framework, supporting the pornographic video industry in the Australian Capital Territory. Forty-five thousand Australians have already petitioned this Parliament for this Government to act in accordance with the unanimous resolution of the Attorneys-General of this country, including the Government's own Attorney-General (Mr Lionel Bowen), to close the loophole and remove the ACT as the one remaining place in Australia from which this industry can operate and women can be demeaned in that degrading way. Will this Government respond to that? No, it will not. Yet at the same time it has the gall to say to the advertising industry, `You must lift your game'. What we say and what the women of Australia say is that this Government should start in provinces that are directly under its control, but it is failing to do so. </PARA>
<PARA> We have seen expectations built up in relation to part time work. In 1986 there was a conference on legislative and award restrictions to women's employment. What happened? Nothing. We are now told that the Australian Council of Trade Unions and the Government are finally negotiating towards this restructuring. Surprise, surprise! In an election year this matter is back on the agenda again, but what has been achieved? Very little. </PARA>
<PARA> We have identified, as this Government has identified, that there are particular problems relating to migrant women. What does this Government do? In 1985 the Government held a conference-surprise, surprise! The National Conference on Immigrant Women's Issues was held in 1985. What has happened since then? Again, Mr Deputy President, very little except that before Christmas last year Senator Reynolds called the key women within these groups to have another talk about what might be done to achieve the Government's objectives. This has been the practice of this Government: raise the profile of these areas that are critical to women but do not provide solutions, do not provide policies and do not provide programs to implement answers to these concerns. The Government's approach has all been about identification. Nothing has been done that is actually worthwhile for women. It is not surprising that Australian women are now rejecting this approach, recognising that they have been conned by this Government and saying that they have had enough. That is why the support for the Prime Minister has plummeted and support for this Government by Australian women has fallen so dramatically in recent times. Australian women realise that they have been conned and they will not let it continue. </PARA>
<PARA> Opposition senators have referred in the last few days to the important report put out by the Australian Institute of Family Studies entitled Families and Tax in 1989, which the Minister has yet to address. Perhaps we could draw to her attention in this debate some of the key findings of that important independent inquiry. They include that under this Government average tax rates have risen for most families and that those rises have been greater for families compared with single persons. They have been greater for those on middle incomes than for those on high incomes. I should remind honourable senators that this Labor Government is the one which provided extra tax relief for the most wealthy in this country while people in lower and middle income groups were allowed to suffer. The report states:</PARA>
<PARA>Since 1984-85, real disposable incomes have fallen sharply for all income units dependent on one income. </PARA>
<PARA>What about families with children? The report looks at a family consisting of two parents and four children. Their real disposable income has fallen more than $47 since 1984-85. That is why these families are hurting. That is why women are rejecting this Government. This has been caused not only by bracket creep but also by a decline in the real value of family concessions, namely, family allowances, the dependent spouse rebate and the sole parent rebate. During the short time that Senator Reynolds was present at the Women's Tax Convention on Saturday the women of Australia and women's organisations reinforced their concern that the real value of these allowances that reflect the cost to families of bringing up children has been disregarded by this Government. </PARA>
<PARA> We have seen a lack of support for families, a lack of recognition of the growing poverty of women, a total failure to understand what interest rates are doing to families and the need to house families, and a total lack of understanding of what is happening to families under this Government's inflation rate, with the cost of living families are having to to bear. Although no doubt the Minister in this debate will say that this is a family issue and not a women's matter, I would say to the Minister that, if she asks women whether they regard it as being particularly in their consciousness, they say that it is, because they are primarily concerned with the interests of their families and not just of themselves. The Minister should address that aspect rather than trying to find flippant ways of avoiding the problem. </PARA>
<PARA> It is not just the Institute of Family Studies that has been saying these things to the Government. I wonder whether the Minister has read the report of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission that came out a week or so ago on homeless children. Judging by the precedent, one would suspect that she has not. I invite her, when she finds time with her other pressures, to read page 105 of that report, which again talks about the stress on families and the effect that that is having on family breakdowns as part of the difficulty of homeless children in our community. The report adopts a submission on the lines:</PARA>
<PARA> We-</PARA>
<PARA>that is, this Government-</PARA>
<PARA>are prepared to provide economic support when a family breaks down, but not the support services which might have prevented the breakdown. We expect the family to take the lion's share of caring for its dependent members without providing the support necessary for it to do so. </PARA>
<PARA>That has been the approach of this Government and it is related to the frightening level of homeless children in our community. Although the Minister denies it, that is also related to the growing level of domestic violence that is occurring in our community. If this Government started by addressing the cost and stress in economic pressure on families, it would be taking a worthwhile step towards resolving some of these awful situations that exist in our community. </PARA>
<PARA> If the Minister says that these reports have some out only in the last couple of weeks, I remind her of her Government's chief economic advisory report in October last year. It is worth repeating what the Economic Planning Advisory Council said in its report and advice to the Government:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . the evidence suggests that many low income people, especially families with children, have to survive on insufficient nutrition, are unable to heat their homes in winter, are often unable to afford medication, and are denied most forms of recreation. </PARA>
<PARA>Could there be a worse indictment of this Government than that statement from its chief economic advisory body? The report continued:</PARA>
<PARA>In many instances, there may be long-term adverse consequences for the education, health and employment opportunities available to such families. . . . The proportion of families with children in relative poverty has been higher during the 1980s than in the previous decade. </PARA>
<PARA>So the report goes on. What note did the Government take of that advice? Obviously, it took none at all. </PARA>
<PARA> We on this side of the chamber say that we have had enough of the propaganda. Women are rejecting this Government because it has not produced programs to match its propaganda and its rhetoric. The Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for the Status of Women said last week, `Come to the women's tax conference on Saturday because we as a government will sit back and listen to the Australian women. We will not be participating in it because we want to receive advice from women'. We went along to the conference, and what did we find? It was opened by Minister Kerin, the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy. What did he say to the 200 women and me? He said:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . we should remember that there have been unparalleled initiatives to advance the status of women in the past six years . . . </PARA>
<PARA>He then proceeded to bucket the Opposition. If we wonder why the Primary Industries Minister was asked to open the conference, perhaps we had some indication when he tried to draw a parallel between the women's movement and farming. He spoke of women and their resource use. It was not surprising that he left the conference as soon as he had finished his address and that Senator Reynolds left not much later. If Senator Reynolds had remained at that conference, let me quote some of the things she would have heard from the women's organisations that she should have been listening to rather than avoiding. No doubt the Minister would say that she listens to the Women's Electoral Lobby (WEL). The paper received from that body states:</PARA>
<PARA> Families with children, as a category, have lost out over the last few years and should be seen as a priority group for assistance. </PARA>
<PARA>But they have not. The paper states further:</PARA>
<PARA> The loss of income by families with children over the last five years comes from the following factors:</PARA>
<PARA> 1. The loss in value of Family Allowances-as these have not been indexed or increased since the advent of this Government. </PARA>
<PARA>I remind honourable senators that it was WEL advising Senator Reynolds on these points. The paper continues:</PARA>
<PARA> 2. The loss of family allowances for families with joint income over the limit . . . </PARA>
<PARA> 3. Increases in child-care fees for many families due to changes in the funding system in 1985 . . . </PARA>
<PARA> 4. The fact that cuts in income tax have been primarily directed at higher-income-earners with no compensatory payments for most dual- (but relatively low-) income earners. </PARA>
<PARA> 5. The rapid increase in housing costs and interest rates which fall primarily on households with younger children . . . </PARA>
<PARA> 6. The general fall in real wages which will affect spending power in larger households more than smaller households, as children are additional consumers.</PARA>
<PARA>The Minister ought to listen to this advice rather than lecture this chamber. But this advice did not come only from WEL. All the submissions have the same theme. For example, the Catholic Women's League said:</PARA>
<PARA> We believe that for many families the present tax system is not collecting ``surplus wealth'' but rather household income which the family requires to sustain an independent and dignified lifestyle. </PARA>
<PARA>That is the sort of advice to which the Minister ought to listen. I do not have time in this debate to go through all the submissions, but they were presented to the Minister at the conference. The Catholic Women's League, Women in Management, the Country Women's Association, the Australian Family Association, the Women's Action Alliance, the Young Women's Christian Association and the Union of Australian Women all said basically that families and the women in them have suffered the most under this Government and that the Government has ignored their pleas. That is why they are now rejecting the Minister, the Government and the Prime Minister. We find that the Minister takes little notice of submissions from women's organisations. If she has not had the time to read the submissions, perhaps she could concentrate simply on the recommendations that were received at the end of the conference, because they recognise the Government's failings in this area. </PARA>
<PARA> The first proposition is that the cost of children be given greater financial recognition in the tax-social security transfer system. It is further recommended that the majority of women be given credit in their tax system for the costs they bear and the families they support; that children be recognised within the family system; and that the cost of children be properly recognised. The recommendations also condemn the Government for its higher education contribution scheme and say that it is about time that the Government did something about women's tax concessions. Above all, the report came down to an analysis of the fact that the value of unpaid work by women in the home who are supporting children is not recognised and that women and families simply cannot afford to maintain and bring up children in the style to which they would like to be accustomed, a style which we on this side of the chamber say they deserve. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I welcome the opportunity for this debate to take place this afternoon. We have heard what can be described only as a rave of misrepresentation by Senator Robert Hill. I will go through some of the points he made which totally misrepresented either this Government or individual members of the Government. Let me start with his comments about the popularity of the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke). I am prepared to present him with a copy of an article about the support for Mr Hawke and Mr Howard as leaders. I assure Senator Hill that the Liberal Party, rather than having a gender gap, has what can only be described as a leadership gap. According to the article to which I refer, indicators showed that political support for Mr Hawke in February was 41 per cent, while that for Mr Howard was 19 per cent. It is quite clear which leader the women of Australia prefer.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator Hill referred to a poll, but was not honest enough to give the details which I have in front of me. Forty-one per cent of women gave Mr Hawke a good or very good rating. Only 20 per cent gave Mr Howard a good or very good rating. Only 14 per cent of women gave Mr Hawke a poor or very poor rating, and-surprise, surprise-39 per cent rated Mr Howard poor or very poor. If Senator Hill wants to attack the Prime Minister, to misrepresent the way Australian women feel are thinking in relation to his leadership and commitment to policies that benefit women in so many areas, that is entirely a matter for him. However, I place on the record the very clear figures given by opinion polls. </PARA>
<PARA> I move now to Senator Hill's comments about X-rated videos, though what relevance they have to this debate I am not sure. Again, Senator Hill misrepresented the views of Australian women when he said in effect that they condemn the Government with respect to this matter and that this is an indication of lack of support. I have before me a letter from the National Women's Consultative Council which I will read in its totality. It is addressed to Senator Hill and states:</PARA>

He says, as I have said, that the Government welcomes all contributions to policy discussion and development. This Government, more than any other, has encouraged consultation. We welcome all submissions which have become common each year as part of the Budget process. The Institute of Family Studies report is the theoretical study of the effect of the tax transfer system, the interaction of the tax and social security systems. Its analysis is no more than that.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="XI4">Senator REYNOLDS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wonder whether Senator Walters and Senator Tambling have considered implementing the social wage contributions of Medicare, superannuation or education. Mr Howe obviously has. He says:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Medicare: If you have children you need health insurance. Medicare is worth $21 a week for AWE family. </PARA>
<PARA> Superannuation: This Government, with ACTU, has made superannuation widely available to ordinary families. </PARA>
<PARA>That is worth approximately $14 a week. He goes on:</PARA>
<PARA> Education: . . . Nearly 30% more children are staying on to year 12 because of the Government's policies. AWE family with one year 11 student and 2 younger children will get over $32 per week in Austudy-a total of $67 compared-with the . . . alleged tax loss for two-child AWE families of $27-$34 a week. </PARA>
<PARA>Social policy is not built on hypothetical examples. The other issue which is of concern to us is that the Social Security Review highlighted needs for social policy to consider all families-couples with children and with one or two incomes; sole parent families; unemployed families; kinship groups. About 11 per cent of families earn between $20,000 and $25,000. Only 7 per cent of income units are the Opposition's `typical family'-a `typical family' which lives in a magnificent mansion, on a quarter acre block, with a beautiful white picket fence, as is depicted in the picture on the cover of the Future Directions document. It is quite clear from the figures which Mr Howe has presented that those families on which the Opposition purports to have written its entire policy paper constitute only a small percentage. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me now detail some of the facts, because facts were rather short in Senator Hill's contribution. In the seven years of the Howard-Fraser regime, payments for children in low income families were increased once. In 1980 payments was increased from $7.50 per week to $10-the only increase for low income families in seven years, while economic policy deliberately threw families out of work. The results were devastating. By 1983 one in five Australian children lived in poverty. In 1976, 373,000 children were in low income families and by 1983 this figure had grown to 830,000. </PARA>
<PARA> The response of the Hawke Government in six years stands in clear contrast. We have increased pension and benefit rates in every year of our term-in 1983 from $10 to $12; in 1984 from $12 to $14; in 1985 from $14 to $16; in 1986 from $16 to $17; in 1987 from $17 to $22 for younger children and $28 for older children and in 1988 from $22 to $24 for younger children and $28 to $31 for older children. </PARA>
<PARA> The progress is there to see. Under Howard, in seven years, there was one increase from $7.50 to $10. In the same period, prices increased by 104 per cent. So in real terms payments fell by 35 per cent. We have increased payments to $31 for teenage children. That is a real increase of 108 per cent. For younger children we have increased payments to $24, which is a real increase of 61 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> Clearly, a number of the statistics which have been quoted by Senator Hill are very much open to question. But the measures which the Hawke Government has adopted within the tax and social security system to reduce the impact of high effective marginal tax rates are not open to question. I will read through a number of these measures and am prepared to table the document. The three pages which I have before me detail, on a month by month and year by year basis, what has been done to reduce the impact of high effective marginal tax rates:</PARA>
<PARA> May 1983-Introduction of Family Income Supplement (FIS), as a payment to low income working families meant that in most cases families receiving FIS were better off working than receiving unemployment benefit . . . </PARA>
<PARA> 1983-84-Increase in the Sole Parent Rebate from $713 to $790 a year: the Sole Parent Rebate, because it is not income-tested, acts as a workforce incentive by giving sole parents a higher taxfree threshold. </PARA>
<PARA> 1983-84-Pensioner tax rebate was increased from $167 to $250 a year. </PARA>
<PARA> March 1984-Increase in the benefit income test fee area from $10 a week to $20 a week, and an increase in the upper limit of the 50 per cent taper from $60 to $70 a week. </PARA>
<PARA> 1984-85-Beneficiary tax rebates were introduced at $50 a year for single beneficiaries and $75 a year for married beneficiaries. The Dependent Spouse Rebate was extended to de facto couples, thereby protecting certain beneficiaries. </PARA>
<PARA> 1985-86-Beneficiary tax rebate increased from $50 to $170 a year for single beneficiaries and from $75 to $220 a year for married beneficiaries. </PARA>
<PARA> May 1986-Increase in the benefit income test free area from $20 to $30 a week. </PARA>
<PARA> 1986-87-Beneficiaries tax rebates were increased from $170 to $190 a year for single beneficiaries and from $220 to $280 a year for married beneficiaries. </PARA>
<PARA> December 1986-Increase in the income tax threshold from $4,595 to $5,100 a year flowed through fully to pensioners and beneficiaries as the nominal value of the pensioner and beneficiary rebates was maintained. </PARA>
<PARA> 1987-88-Married beneficiary tax rebate was increased from $280 to $430 a year. </PARA>

I wonder how smaller government will maintain the commitment that the Hawke Government has given to job creation? I wonder how smaller government will help in relation to housing policy, education policy and child-care policy? I think it would be salutary for members of the Opposition to take note of the fact that at the Tax Convention the idea of tax rebates for child-care or tax deductability was overwhelmingly rejected, income splitting was overwhelmingly rejected and there was an overwhelming rejection by women attending the Tax Convention of a downgrading of public services. </PARA>

The Liberals would have us see the family as depicted in their glossy document Future Directions, which Senator Vanstone assured us just a few minutes ago is not a policy document. It is more a publicity gimmick, I would suggest. It depicts an idealised mum and dad and two kids being rather cosy in an upper middle-class home which they own with dad bringing home the bacon, mum keeping the home fires burning and with single income home owning families being a minority among families in our community. What we have been offered by the Opposition, if we have been offered anything in terms of policy, is really picket fence politics. Apparently we are going to have to suffer that through the rest of this election year, a thought which is a little daunting. However, we want to make it clear that we are talking about all those family units in our community which vary very much and which provide an enormous challenge to all policy makers. Perhaps that is one reason why there does not seem to be much policy being made by the Opposition. There is no doubt either that there has been a fall in real disposable incomes, which is the other issue addressed in Senator Hill's motion. We need go no further than the report of the Australian Institute of Family Studies last week. Under the heading `Summary' it states:</PARA>
<PARA>In 1988-89 dollar terms, the same AWE family is now paying $30.80 per week more tax than they did 12 years ago compared to the twice AWE single person who is paying $18.88 more and the single person on four times AWE who is paying $105.32 less. </PARA>
<PARA>That is just one example. Examples abound across income and family groupings to demonstrate that real disposable incomes have fallen sharply for all units with dependants in particular. Those are the people whom we are concerned about today. </PARA>
<PARA> The Democrats remind the Senate that this is not only the result of tax rates. I also inject into this debate the fact that the Democrats were the only ones who, at the time, opposed tax cuts for high income earners which Senator Hill now seems to view after the fact, as is so often the case from that side of the House, with high dudgeon. The lower real income levels are also the result of considerable wage restraint which has been accepted by working people in our community, the hardest hit being the low and middle income earners while executive salaries, as has often been noted recently in debates, seem to have soared regardless. It is also an effect of the growth of part time work. The Government puts forward the increase in jobs consistently when the figures come through on employment, but we must remember that a great deal of that employment is part time employment which does not do a great deal to improve the incomes of people who are dependent upon that part time work. </PARA>
<PARA> One major issue pointed to both in the Australian Institute of Family Studies report and at the Women's Tax Convention is bracket creep. This is where I ask my first question of the mover of this motion, as well as of the Government. I ask it as a member of a political party that has consistently since 1977 had a policy of indexation of taxation levels, the only party which has. My question is: how will the Opposition deal with that? Will it index? I noted some quite equivocal remarks on that matter by the Opposition Treasury spokesperson, the honourable member for Kooyong (Mr Peacock), in this morning's Australian newspaper. Once again, the Democrats stand alone. </PARA>
<PARA> In general we are fascinated by Senator Hill raising in this matter of urgency today and in a barrage of questions in recent days of the Minister for Local Government and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for the Status of Women (Senator Reynolds) matters regarding family income and in particular the Australian Institute of Family Studies report because of the numbers of questions that raises about the Opposition's policy. I will begin with the report of the Australian Institute of Family Studies and then I will move on to additional significant recommendations from the Women's Tax Convention held here last Saturday to which the issues addressed by the Institute of Family Studies were also central. The components of the Australian Institute of Family Studies tax package incorporate significant changes to tax scales which I will not detail here at the moment. They are changes which are designed, unlike tax changes which we have had so far, to support and assist low and middle income groups and include a continuing 49c in the dollar top rate on income above $45,000 a year and changes to family rebates. The introduction of a new income tested family rebate is proposed which would apply to all families, including sole parents, couples without children and couples with children, which is not exactly picket fence politics, I would have thought. This would replace the dependent spouse rebate and the sole parent rebate, and the Democrats are delighted with it. Again, we are the only party which has been getting up anywhere in politics in Australia and saying, `Let us get rid of the dependent spouse rebate and let us use it for child payments'. At the time we talked specifically about the family allowance. We would be interested to hear members of the Opposition, instead of all this hot air, saying what they think about this Australian Institute of Family Studies package. </PARA>
<PARA> The third point made in this package refers to changes to family allowances. The Institute states that rates for all children should be changed to $10 per week per child irrespective of the birth order of the child; that means testing of the family allowance should be abolished; and that the family allowance should be renamed the child tax allowance. I would be fascinated to hear Opposition speakers in this debate tell this Parliament-and I am quite sure they will not-what they think about a universal payment for children: getting child payments back as part of the tax system instead of part of the welfare system, which the introduction of income testing has done. I believe that that is an issue of major concern. Should our children be a matter for our welfare system or should they be incorporated in the tax system, as the Institute of Family Studies suggests?</PARA>
<PARA> The Institute goes on to suggest changes to the family allowance supplement-an increase of $1 per week for 13- to 15-year-old children-to bring it in line, and changes to the level of pensioner and beneficiary rebates. Those are the major components of that package, about which we have heard no comment as far as the Opposition is concerned, but about which we have had lots of hot air from the Opposition spokesperson trying to put the Government on the spot, the Government having said that it is addressing these issues and hopefully will bring us concrete comments soon. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn now to the Women's Tax Convention. It is important to note the introduction to the summary of the submissions. The Democrats would like to endorse this statement:</PARA>
<PARA> Women do have different perspectives on many of the issues under discussion. Their situation vis a vis the workforce and the social security system is often different from that of men. They are the bulk of low paid and part time workers, have high rates of dependency on social security transfer payments (pensions and benefits) and carry most of the responsibility for the daily care of children and other dependants. </PARA>
<PARA>Again, that is not exactly picket fence politics. The Democrats endorsed that statement at the beginning of the conference. There are a number of specific recommendations and again the Australian Democrats would be fascinated to hear from the Opposition on these recommendations. For instance, its recommendation on dependent spouse payments is very much along the lines of the recommendation of the Australian Institute of Family Studies. It is saying, `Let us get rid of that and let us turn it into a child payment', which again is something the Democrats have been saying for years. Another recommendation involves the children's services program. It is very important that all community service programs are stongly supported. How can they be in the context of a tax policy which is slowly emerging from the cocoon of the Opposition's policies? Clearly, its policy is likely to be based on the policy of the Business Council of Australia, which talks about higher interest rates and tax cuts--</PARA>

We would be fascinated to see where those cuts are coming from. The latest suggestion from the Business Council of Australia is that there are $1 billion extra of cuts. How the Opposition will keep up those sorts of services I do not know.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I turn now to tax and wage changes. The real levels of the family allowance are to be indexed. Again, this has been Democrats policy right from the beginning. It is proposed here to increase the income test free area of pensions to $60 per week per individual and $30 per week per child. Again that is a proposal which the Democrats have been putting forward. Even before I made my maiden speech in this chamber, the first notice of motion that I put down called for a significant rise in the free income area. If we are ever to get rid of the poverty traps, we need incentives for pensioners and beneficiaries to get out of their poverty cycle, into paid employment, and off the welfare system, and to be independent. I will be fascinated to hear whether the Opposition finally supports that. The recommendations go on to stress:</PARA>
<PARA>The above does not preclude an integrated tax credit system for child support.</PARA>
<PARA>Again that is an Australian Institute of Family Studies proposal. </PARA>
<PARA> The Women's Tax Convention also had some strong words to say about and called for the abolition of the higher education contribution scheme. That is another measure on which the Australian Democrats stood alone in opposing in this chamber and out in the public arena. The convention complained about the inequities in superannuation tax concessions. My Party has had a policy of a universal national contributory superannuation scheme since its inception in 1977-12 years ago. We have been told that the time for that is past and that it is occupational superannuation for us all. Let us hope that it is for us all, including women, on an equal basis. The Democrats endorse that recommendation. </PARA>
<PARA> I have made some comments about public sector services, as has the Minister for Local Government. We cannot have social justice or, as Don Edgar would rather have us say, `a fair go for everyone', if we are to get into, as the Opposition has done, private education and private sector housing and cut back on public transport, communications and infrastructure and the public media. None of that can lead to a fair go for everyone. If we are to cut spending we will cut public services. We hear lots of questions being asked of the Government by the Opposition, but we see no policies from the Opposition. We have had a barrage of questions, but we want to know what is the Opposition's attitude both to the proposals of the Institute of Family Studies and to the tax convention. </PARA>
<PARA> I understand that the Women's Tax Convention proposals will be put to the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) on International Women's Day on Wednesday. I suggest that the organisers press the Opposition equally as hard. They must face the fact that this is an election year and I think they should be putting the Opposition equally on the spot as they are the Government. After all, most of the time here we have Tweedledum and Tweedledee or, as somebody once put it, Tweedledum and Tweedle-even-dumber. I think the Women's Tax Convention should apply pressure across the board, bearing in mind my comments about our support for those issues. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition has not had a great deal to say about tax equity. We are talking here about restructuring the tax system-a motion put up by a party which opposes the removal of the exemption of the gold industry from normal company tax. The Opposition calls it a gold tax, et cetera, but does not seem too perturbed that the top 200 companies are only paying 28c in the dollar when the level was 49c; and the Opposition has not opposed, as the Democrats did, the reduction of company tax to 39c, while individuals are still waiting for their tax cuts. Individuals are paying the foreign debt, which is largely there through the private sector. We are also paying through cuts to government services as this Government has cut back its funding, particularly through the States. These are generated largely by the private sector, that same private sector that this Opposition continually supports and shelters. There are challenges from the Democrats to the Opposition, most particularly on this issue of whether it will support the legislation introduced by Senator Haines last week on the issue of savings and housing. We hear all kinds of noises, but it appears that the only measures that the Opposition would be interested in would be those which, once again, would support high income people. </PARA>
<PARA> We have had deregulation. We are looking at the big picture. We have been asked to do this from people on both sides of the chamber. The Opposition does not say anything. Some measures have been taken by the Government, but none of them goes far enough. Certainly we need to restructure. The Democrats suggest that we need some pretty radical thinking. I commend to the Senate, and I foreshadow, further debate from the Democrats on this issue of national income support which would get the whole question of payments to support all individuals, including families, out of the welfare area and into removing the need for pensions and benefits-a system which will get over the problems of social welfare, industrial relations, employment and taxation which constitute the mess that we have got ourselves into today. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to support the matter of urgency moved by Senator Hill, namely:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The need for the government to restructure the tax system to remove the bias against families with dependants and to tackle the issues raised in the Institute of Family Studies report which documents the sharp fall in real disposable income suffered by most families under six years of hard Labor, a report which the Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for the Status of Women failed to address when asked about it in the Senate on Friday. </PARA>
<PARA>The National Agenda for Women, which was released in March last year and which no doubt honourable senators are familiar with, indicates in the early stages of the booklet that the Government believes that a government's economic policies are the best way to ensure a bright and secure future for all Australians. That is a very sensible statement. It is a sensible acknowledgment that we can have all the conferences, all the workshops and all the glossy leaflets we like. We have heard from Senator Hill details of the conferences that this Government has organised relating to matters that are of concern to women. We have heard about the workshops and the glossy leaflets. But, of course, what the statement in the National Agenda for Women tells us, when it says that the economy is the best way to provide a bright and secure future for all Australians, is that we can have all the circuses we like and they will remain circuses unless we do something with what we are told at the conferences and with what we learn from the workshops. People, in the end, expect some results from this sort of effort and they have not been forthcoming. </PARA>
<PARA> I know from Senator Powell's contribution that she wants to know what solutions the Opposition has to offer. She will learn the details of our taxation and economic policies in due course. She will not learn the details of them in sufficient time for this Labor Government to do what it normally does when the Opposition releases its policies, that is, snitch them a few months later, rename them as something else and simply take our good ideas. We are not offended by that; we are complimented that the Government sees the errors of its ways and follows the policies that we release. </PARA>
<PARA> I am, in a sense, embarrassed to be participating in this debate today. I find it embarrassing that the Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for the Status of Women (Senator Reynolds), the woman in government who is meant to be representing the women of Australia and putting our views, cannot seem to get to where the real action is, namely, the hard economic issues. She is not even interested in this debate. She has had her say and she is off, probably, having a cup of tea. It is a pity that she is not here to contribute to the debate over and above her own speech, by way of interjection, follow-up or whatever. </PARA>
<PARA> If Cabinet is a sort of football field, if that is how government works, the guys are all in there grabbing the ball for their department. But what is Senator Reynolds doing? She is carrying the drinks. That is all she is doing in the hard political game in terms of representing women. The ball is going past and she is not catching it on my behalf, on behalf of single income families, on behalf of dual income families or on behalf of part time workers. She has demonstrated quite clearly an incapacity to get into the hard economic issues. The National Agenda for Women produced by the Government clearly acknowledges that that is where the action is for all Australians. Women deserve better and, in that sense, I am embarrassed. </PARA>
<PARA> My colleague Senator Hill asked why women are not prepared to support Bob Hawke. I have a few answers to that question. Some of them might have taken the suggestion I offered last year and read Blanche d'Alpuget's biography of Bob Hawke. That would give an insight into the man. I suggest to those who have not read it that it may change a few views. Then again I have another suggestion: perhaps some women have been watching the national television news and have heard the Prime Minister cursing, taking, as I understand it, the Lord's name in vain, because he misses a golf shot. He did this in front of the national news services. I do not care what he does in his private life or at the Lodge. But, quite frankly, I do not think that sort of standard on national television is acceptable from a Prime Minister. I do not care at all what he does in his private life. </PARA>
<PARA> Then again some women may have been listening to the AM program and heard the Prime Minister tell a reporter, in what I understand is a polite version of it, where to get off. I can tell honourable senators that Australian women regard that as an unacceptable standard for a Prime Minister. We would laugh hysterically if we heard Maggie Thatcher speaking that way. We would think that she had gone off her head and deserved to be locked up. One would not hear President Bush or President Gorbachev speaking that way. But that is how we hear this Prime Minister speaking. Women are not impressed with it. They expect a better standard. </PARA>
<PARA> Women expect something to be delivered from a Prime Minister who promises so much. They are fed up with the circuses, the conferences and the offers to listen. They now want action on what has been said. Women have heard all the promises. The most current one in vogue to talk about is the promise with respect to child poverty in 1990. There are others that we would do well to remember, namely, the promise of 75,000 Australian trainees per annum in the bicentennial year. That little promise went by the board. We had up to 15,000 in that year, if we were lucky. It is my assessment that 17,000 Australian trainees would have been the cumulative total for the entire program from 1985. But we had the Prime Minister promising, `Don't you worry, men and women'-or boys and girls, if one wants to put it that way because it was particularly for young Australians-`my Government understands your problems and that you need training. It is a very important issue for women. You will have 75,000 traineeships available per annum by the bicentennial year'. What has come of it? Nothing. It puts the worth of the Prime Minister's promises at approximately 10c in the dollar or less. It is very important that the Government immediately address the issues raised in the report by the Institute of Family Studies entitled Families and Taxation in 1989. </PARA>
<PARA> I indicated to honourable senators earlier that I was somewhat embarrassed at the Minister's incapacity to reply. She is apparently not conversant with the report and apparently can only read from the documents provided by other Ministers. She says that we do not understand the distribution of ministerial responsibilities. She says that she is not responsible for the Institute of Family Studies and that she cannot be expected to be across this report. Apparently, we should not mind the fact that it affects most women in this country. It affects all the single parent families in desperate situations now, all the dual income families and all the single income families. But the Minister does not have to worry about that as it is not her ministerial responsibility; that is her view. </PARA>
<PARA> I wonder whether she has the same view when putting forward a discussion, for example, on equal employment opportunity. Does she say, `This is not my problem; this comes under the portfolio of the Minister for Industrial Relations.' Of course she does not, because she has some capacity to throw a few words around with respect to equal employment opportunity. She is happy to have a go. Does she say with respect to X-rated videos that it is not her responsibility; it is the Attorney-General's responsibility? No, she does not. Does she say with respect to child-care that she is not expected to be across that as that is a function of the Department of Community Services and Health? No, she does not. She has a go at getting across that because it is a matter that she has some understanding of and is conversant with. Does she say with respect to access to education that it is not her problem and that she will leave that up to the Minister for Employment, Education and Training? No, she does not, because she knows how important access to education is to women. </PARA>
<PARA> Similarly with training, she does not leave it up to the Minister for Employment, Education and Training. She knows that she is expected to be across these sorts of issues, and similarly with respect to access to health. One asks why, when one comes to the section of government activity which the Government itself admits is the core way to ensure a bright and secure future to all Australians, namely, the economy, the Minister ducks out and says that it is not her responsibility and that we should speak to someone else. </PARA>
<PARA> Perhaps we should, at this stage, turn our minds to why we need to address the problem of the taxation structure for families with dependent children. It is obvious, in the first instance, that a simple, glib answer is that families are our future. But, of course, in order to support Senator Hill's motion we have to show that families are under stress and that some restructuring needs to be done. I remind honourable senators who are present or listening of seven or eight reasons why families are now under stress. I am not talking now about just the single income, dual parent family with two happy children. I am talking about sole parents, single income families, dual income families where people work full time or part time-all families with dependent children. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us listen to some of the reasons why these families are under stress under this Government. When we left government in March 1983 the home loan interest rate was 12.5 per cent. It is now 15.5 per cent. That has to impact on families. Another cause of stress is bankruptcy. It is a mistake to think of people who go bankrupt as being isolated businessmen. They probably have families. Bankruptcy has serious consequences for their families. The average in the Fraser years was 4,717. The average in the years of this Prime Minister has gone up to 7,138. Living standards have definitely fallen under this Government. The marginal tax rate for an average income earner in March 1983 was 30c in the dollar. It has now shifted up to 40c in the dollar. In March 1983, under the last Liberal-National Government, the average monthly home loan repayment was $350. It is now $778. If someone does not understand how that impacts upon families with dependent children, let me tell them that that repayment as a percentage of income has skyrocketed from just a little over 19 per cent to 30 per cent under this Government, and that makes it difficult for families. </PARA>
<PARA> If the Government does not want to hear about people who want to buy a house-those who are lucky enough to have a job and be able to have a go at it under this Government-it should look at public housing waiting lists. In December 1982, there were 110,000 people on public housing waiting lists. Under this Government, in December 1988 there were 160,000. The waiting period for public housing for people who do not have the opportunity to buy their own home is deplorable. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us look at a sixth factor. Let us look at family allowances, which have been frozen by Labor, and the dependent spouse rebate. Under this Government there has been a fall of 37 per cent in real terms for a family with children. If that does not tell us why this matter is vitally important for families and why the Minister should be across it-families include women and children-let us look at a couple more. Let us look at unemployment. I know that the Government says it has created, or the economy has generated, a number of additional jobs, but that is not the only way of looking at the matter. Under the Fraser Government the average monthly unemployment level was 403,000. It is now 627,000. That means there are individuals out of jobs who therefore have trouble supporting their families. </PARA>
<PARA> The average monthly youth unemployment level under the Hawke Government is 130,000. Under Fraser it was 115,000. That was not good, but nonetheless the figure was lower. Under the Hawke Government the average monthly youth unemployment rate is 23 per cent. Under Fraser it was 18.6 per cent. That tells us how many families have young people still dependent on them, people who cannot get a job but who want a job-young Australians, both men and women, who were promised traineeships by the Prime Minister. In the bicentennial year they were promised 75,000 traineeships per annum. What has been delivered? Not very much at all. So it is with real regret that we see that the Minister simply cannot address the hard economic issues. I remind the Minister of an article in the Age newspaper to which I have drawn her attention previously called `Orange among the mandarins'. The article is about the Office of the Status of Women and is written by Eva Cox, a noted Sydney social policy consultant. She said:</PARA>
<PARA> Under Malcolm Fraser, there was a powerful National Women's Advisory Council which spoke about against government decisions and represented its constituency. </PARA>
<PARA>She went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA> Some women are asking whether the resources going into the National Women's Consultative Council should be diverted to an independent peak group which could speak out. </PARA>
<PARA>That is a relevant point because the Minister says that the National Women's Consultative Council is independent. Yet, when she quoted a letter from her chairman, she said, `My chairman'-her Council; appointed by her. I ask the National Women's Consultative Council to think very seriously about the contribution it makes and to show its independence publicly because, as Eva Cox said, if the Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for the Status of Women continues `to be seen as marginal and irrelevant to the main issues'-we are talking about the economy and tax-the advantage that Labor has gained with women voters `may be whittled away'. How right she was. If the Minister does not want to play ball, let her get out of the park. Perhaps she should give Senator Crowley-who is not in the chamber-a go. Perhaps Jeannette McHugh or Wendy Fatin in the lower House would like a go. I want someone to do for women something other than carry the drinks. I want someone to go into Cabinet and argue very hard for me. The Minister is incapable of doing that. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think that we should put the record straight on a matter on which Senator Vanstone commented on several occasions. It is so long since the coalition has been in government that it has completely forgotten what ministerial responsibilities can be. Quite apart from all the other misconstruction that Senator Vanstone put on the position of the Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for the Status of Women (Senator Reynolds) this afternoon, I make it quite clear that at the moment the Minister is having a meeting with the Australian Pensioners Federation. She is discussing with the Australian Pensioners Federation a submission on the needs of older women, focusing particularly on the solid economic issues which concern women in their mature years. She is probably having a great deal more fruitful time than she could possibly have in this chamber. She would not learn very much this afternoon from the coalition, which has brought forward a matter of urgency which purported to be about a report produced by the Institute of Family Studies (IFS).</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The report is quite extensive and very substantial. Released on Thursday of last week, it is entitled `AFIT Bulletin No. 5', has 56 pages, and comprises solid, mostly economic, theory. The Institute's paper expressly endorses the Government's strategy of giving priority to low income families through the family allowance supplement and rejects the Opposition's policy of income splitting. There is an interesting point. We have not heard much about income splitting from the Opposition this afternoon. It has been very vocal about it on a number of occasions over the last few years and dredges it up just about every time we come up to an election. That was one of the matters discussed quite thoroughly at the Women's Tax Convention on Saturday. If Senator Vanstone had been there she would have heard how thoroughly the women there understand that it would be an extremely regressive way of approaching any sort of restructuring of the income tax system. We have heard nothing from the Opposition this afternoon about what might be a way of restructuring the income tax system. All that we have to go on is what is we have heard in the past. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Maybe when Senator Newman's contribution arrives we will get a little more enlightenment. Those listening to this debate and those who get around to reading it in Hansard at some future time would probably like to know the thrust of the report on tax that has just been produced by the Institute of Family Studies. I will summarise very briefly the main points that it makes. It concludes that the Government's strategy of giving priority to low income families is the way we should go. It concludes that tax cuts are justified for all taxpayers but should be targeted to middle income families, particularly those with children, and to low income single people who have not benefited from the family allowance supplement. The report places emphasises on increasing concessions to families. That point was made extremely strongly by the women at the meeting on Saturday.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The report also advocates abolishing the dependent spouse rebate, which is seen as a rather ineffectual way of redistributing resources to families with dependent children, and suggests that the DSR be replaced with a family rebate, income tested on family income. The IFS also supports a universal family allowance and gives support to the notion that all family allowance payments should be the same rather than being graded in relation to the place in the family of each child. </PARA>
<PARA> The Institute advocates the lowering of marginal tax rates up to $45,000. The piece of fiction entitled Future Directions advocates `a flatter tax system with two steps'-very fair, I must say!-`in order to provide incentive to people to work harder and to exercise enterprise and initiative'. That is what the coalition, or Liberal Party at least, seems to be advocating. However, the Institute of Family Studies suggests an extra step so that at $5,000 there would be a percentage rate of 22; at $13,500, 29; at $20,000, 35; at $35,000, 40; and at $45,000, 49. That is probably the first bit of hard factual data to go into this debate this afternoon about the issue that we are supposed to be dealing with but which, having been taken off in all sorts of highways and byways, we have hardly got to. The Institute of Family Studies suggests that the new family rebate, of which I spoke before, should be $16,000; that there should be a family allowance at a flat rate of $10 per child per week; and that an addition of $1 per week be made to the family allowance supplement. It also advocates an increase in the pensioner benefit rebate. So far so good; that is the taxation side of it. </PARA>
<PARA> As has been stated here this afternoon, there is no doubt in anybody's mind that the Government's position, that the good management of the economy is the best way of raising the incomes and standard of living of the population, is by far the most sensible and effective way to go. Over the six years we have been in government the work force participation rate has risen to 63 per cent, the highest in Australian history. The women's participation rate is over 50 per cent. Forty per cent of women are in the work force. The M-curve is flattening out, which means that women are leaving the work force to have children at a later age and for shorter periods. The important point about this set of figures is that the number of households in Australia where both spouses are employed has risen from 46 per cent in 1984-85 to 55 per cent in 1988-89. This means that in a great many more households there is considerable more disposable income. So, when one is looking at tax rates, one may have a skewed view of exactly how much disposable income is available. </PARA>
<PARA> There are many more ways of increasing disposable income than putting it in a person's pay-packet, or of reducing it as the result of income taxation. Already mention has been made this afternoon of the $67 a week on average which goes to low income families with two children who are getting the benefit of Medicare, Austudy and superannuation. Two other measures we have undertaken and which are making a great deal of difference to the average income and well-being of low income families are the family allowance supplement and the child support scheme. This Government had the courage and the integrity to introduce the family allowance supplement. In 1987 the entire financial community and the coalition were baying for drastic cuts in public spending. We were able to see that we had to make a genuine funding allocation to enhance the living standards of the lowest income families with dependent children. As a result we introduced the family allowance supplement, which has made an enormous difference to the well-being of 141,000 Australian families, with something like 300,000 children. An average of $40 a week goes to those families. </PARA>
<PARA> Measures of this nature in the long run are transfers of income from taxation into the purses of women and keep individual families going. Measures of this nature are of crucial importance. A large number of families have already been assisted by the child support scheme, introduced on 1 August last year. By 25 February, 13,178 cases had been registered with the Child Support Agency out of a total of 17,168 applications. The number of all Department of Social Security pensioners receiving maintenance increased from 66,455 in June 1988 to 83,149 in February 1989. This is highly significant. These pensioners maintenance has increased, not through the Child Support Agency or by their having been dealt with directly by the Government, but because as a result of our introducing this scheme maintenance orders are being increased to a much more realistic level. Whereas previously custodial parents were expected to feed, clothe, shelter and educate their children on something like $25 a week, they are now being given much more realistic maintenance orders. The average rate of maintenance received by sole parent pensioners increased between June and February from $36 a week to $49 a week-a not inconsiderable improvement. Many of these families are amongst the most poverty stricken in the community.</PARA>
<PARA> The Government believes that the document put out by the Institute of Family Studies is a very useful analysis of the effects of the tax transfer system on hypothetical average weekly earning couples. The Institute of Family Studies is a highly respected organisation. It has not always been shown a great deal of respect by the coalition. If I recall correctly, Mr Howard has made some rather scathing remarks in the past about the Institute of Family Studies, but suddenly he is seeing it as a useful tool. I am glad that he has seen the light. </PARA>
<PARA> The Institute of Family Studies document contains a considerable amount of data. It presents a number of options. I have given merely an overall summary of the measures the Institute advocates, which in many cases are along the same lines as the way in which the Government has been thinking for a long time. They are along the same lines as the way in which the women who met on Saturday have been thinking for a long time. They are along the same lines as we have been moving over the years. In 1987, the Economic Planning Advisory Council did a study of exactly how much had been added to average incomes as a result of the social wage. That was before the introduction of the family allowance supplement and the Child Support Agency. Those two very significant measures which have been taken since then would have increased the 1986-87 figure of 5 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> I have not even mentioned the fact that we have introduced a rental subsidy for people who rent privately and increased the disabled child allowance to $112 a month, a much more substantial amount than it was previously, which helps to meet the extra needs that we know make such a big difference to the costs of families with disabled children. It is absolutely clear that the Opposition is still totally bereft of ideas for taxation reconstruction. I have here an extract from the Future Directions document, which Senator Vanstone tells us is not a policy document. We must assume that it is fiction, recreation or whatever. </PARA>

<PARA> We have just heard a diatribe from Senator Giles about women working and incomes coming into the families. Like Senator Crowley, who gave us the benefit of her lack of understanding one night last week in a debate when she proudly said that 50 per cent of Australian women were out working, Senator Giles does not understand that so many of these women are economic conscripts; there is no other way to describe it. They are working in order to bring some income into the family; but increasingly, that income is decreasing in value and the bread and the cheese are getting more and more expensive every week. Any housewife not sitting in the Senate pretending to know the cost of living and pretending to know why these women are working would understand exactly what is happening to the economy and this Government's mismanagement of it. </PARA>
<PARA> In my contribution to this important debate, I intend to highlight the way in which the Government has treated defence families because they are a group which, because of their special circumstances, give a special benchmark against which we can test the Government's real credentials for demonstrating concern for families. If the Minister for Local Government had not left the conference hall at morning tea, she would have heard the representative from the national board of the National Council of Women speak on the problems of service families and other transient families, which in many ways are much worse than those being suffered by families in the suburbs. Service families not only reflect the serious consequences of government policy which affect all Australian families but also show how a captive group can be even more affected by a government which simply does not care. Clearly there is in the tax system a bias against families. In the same way as the report of the Institute of Family Studies has done, I intend to document the fall in real disposable income and the standard of living of our defence families. There are 38,500 Defence Force personnel who are married and of these a huge proportion have two children. It is this family unit which has been used many times in the report Families and Tax in 1989 to demonstrate how badly families are being attacked by this Government. </PARA>
<PARA> As a generality, in 1976-77 a two-children family with a taxpayer on average weekly earnings received a 46 per cent tax reduction compared with a single person. In 1988-89 this figure had dropped to 26 per cent. In the defence forces a number of other issues come into play which make this basic reduction in family living standards even worse. I intend to demonstrate this proposition by giving a number of examples from the following areas: taxation, education, removals, housing, service allowance and so on. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me tell honourable senators about tax changes. The Government has introduced changes in taxation provisions that have severely reduced the real level of income of servicemen and their families. I draw attention to the uniform maintenance allowance. Until two weeks ago servicemen were provided with a uniform allowance which was tax free. It was designed to replace items of compulsory uniform, as well as maintenance, et cetera. On 21 February the Government advised its servicemen that this allowance would now have to be substantiated. </PARA>
<PARA> Previously the allowance had always been treated as an `in-out' allowance where it was assumed that it would be expended totally for the purposes for which it was paid. Therefore, a large proportion of servicemen have not kept records of how that money has been spent. They will be unable to substantiate their claims this financial year and they may well suffer penalties at the hands of the Taxation Commissioner as a result. This, of course, means that their allowance for replacement of compulsory uniforms will be taxed this financial year, which is another blow to the family budget. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me draw attention to the Medicare levy and the service family. As I think most people would understand, but perhaps the Labor Party does not approve, servicemen are provided with free medical care because of their service and they are not subject to a Medicare levy for themselves. Their families are not provided with free medical care and so a serviceman pays half a medicare levy when he has a dependent spouse. Incredible as it may seem, when a spouse works and pays her own Medicare levy, this provision does not change. So the serviceman still has to pay 50 per cent of a Medicare levy even though his wife is paying for her own and he is entitled to free care. This is a direct additional cost to the family income which cannot be substantiated either in logic or in equity. It has been described by Dr Paul Gerber of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal as being completely unsupportable. Yet the Government has refused to change the requirement. It is yet another sneaky, illogical impost to grab even more revenue. Again, it is directly at the expense of the family. As the report of the Institute of Family Studies points our, during recent years there has been a large increase in the number of spouses who have gone out to work, in addition to the prime breadwinner, in order to make ends meet. I referred to that earlier. Service families are particularly disadvantaged because they have an inability to find those second jobs because of their constant posting routine. They are constantly met with opposition from local employers who give jobs to the locals because they know that the service spouses will be moving on. </PARA>
<PARA> One way service spouses can get some additional income into the family is to join the Reserve. Reserve pay is meant to be non-taxable. But, as usual with this Government, there is a catch. Let us take the example of a wife who has a position in the Reserve. Her pay is not taxable but when her husband is confronted with his tax return he finds he cannot claim her as a dependant because the level of dependency depends on all her sources of income, which are meant to be tax free. He loses the concession and once more it is the family which suffers to the tune of probably $1 in each $4 of additional earnings made by the wife through her Reserve service. Everywhere these families turn there is some new tax bite upon them. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me draw attention to the education allowance and the drop in living standards in that area. The Defence Force has recognised that an education allowance should be paid to defence families to assist in defraying costs incurred by soldiers who make arrangements for their children's secondary education to see that they do not suffer serious interference if the father is posted away. That sounds fair enough-a proper provision to ensure families are fairly treated. But the reality is quite different. In many ways this allowance exists in name only. In the last school year, out of the 34,000 service families with children only 82 members of the Defence Force were paid this allowance in respect of 93 children. The conditions are too stringent and complicated. There is a whole maze of restrictions and regulations which makes it almost impossible to obtain. Once again, the Government seems hell bent on making family life difficult for members of the defence forces. </PARA>
<PARA> Madam Acting Deputy President, you would be well aware of the fact that servicemen are being required to move constantly, and even more so in recent times because of the great losses from the defence forces and people being posted to fill the gaps. The question of removals becomes an extremely important issue. Soldiers are provided with free removals and some allowances that are designed to reduce the costs to them and to their families. But once again, the gap between what is needed and what is given is very large. Let me refer to a letter I received from the wife of a Royal Australian Air Force serviceman who documented in detail the removal expense which applied to a family of two children and two adults during their move from Canberra to Adelaide. These figures take into account the net effects of allowances which are received. The bill from the old locality to meet costs such as cleaning materials, telephone calls, transfer insurance and memberships which were not transferable or refundable totalled $503. At the new locality, costs for cleaning, telephone calls, garden items, schools uniforms, drivers licences, school fees, telephone connection fees, et cetera, amounted to $1,543. That is a total of over $2,000, of which they received $680. In other words, the family was expected to fork out over $1,400 for the privilege of taking up a new posting to defend this country, once again another strike against the standard of living of that family unit. One must remember that in six months' time that family may well be told that it will have to pack up and move to Perth, Darwin or Cairns. It could happen twice in a year, and certainly to many families it is happening once a year. I see Senator Collins is present; he would know the problems of such families who go in and out of Darwin. </PARA>
<PARA> Defence salaries are supplemented by a range of allowances to compensate for disabilities or exceptional circumstances. The most significant of these is the service allowance. In September this year the allowance was $4,002 a year. In 1987 the Services were seeking an allowance of a minimum of $7,715, mainly because members were on average working about 52.5 hours a week, were not being compensated, and of course received no penalty rates. These long, unrewarded hours clearly have a significant effect on the quality of family life. One wife gave the following evidence to the Cross subcommittee of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade:</PARA>
<PARA> It is alright to say we are compensated by the time off, but mostly that has to be taken at the Air Force's convenience, and not when it is most beneficial to us. Time off does not pay the bills and it is no good having time off when you've got no money to do anything anyway. </PARA>
<PARA>Some of the personnel are now working 58 hours and up to 72 hours a week, as has been documented by the forces, because there is not enough manpower left to do the job which this Government requires of them. If ever there is an example of a total lack of understanding of and sympathy for the plight of servicemen and their families, this must be it. The Government trades on their commitment to work whatever hours are required, and the families are expected to put up with it. </PARA>
<PARA> There are problems concerned with the cost of housing. I do not have time to go into it, but assistance is given in regard to rentals. When personnel are sent to capital cities there are difficulties because, as we all know, rentals have been skyrocketing. Yet the Government does not review the ceilings on allowances. As at November last year, for Adelaide the allowances were last reviewed in August 1986, for Brisbane in July 1987, for Melbourne in August 1986, and for Sydney in November 1987. No wonder service families are finding that they cannot afford to go to these areas. Many families are being separated while the husbands go ahead and the families stay behind somewhere cheaper where they have a house they can afford. I have no opportunity to discuss the subject of child care, but we know that the standard of living of service families has been very much reduced because of their inability to obtain access to child care. Therefore, there is difficulty in bringing a second income to the family. This affects their standard of living. This Government has an employer scheme-a scheme to give employers in private industry assistance with child-care schemes. Servicemen and their families are not eligible for the subsidies under that scheme, and yet the Defence Department is a major employer. </PARA>
<PARA> The Families and Tax report has shown how families and their standard of living have been attacked. On top of these revelations, I have demonstrated how families are disadvantaged in the Defence Force. It is a stark recital of how the standards of the family unit are being lowered, making it more difficult to educate, clothe, feed and look after children-making it more difficult even to hold a marriage together. All Australian families are $58 a week worse off since this Government came to office. One might have thought that the Government would have taken more responsibility for the families of the servicemen who defend our standard of living, but that is not the case. Such families are even worse off than most families, largely as a result of a lack of government support or of government action. The Government stands condemned for its treatment of all Australian families, and in particular Defence Force families. </PARA>

One would have thought that, if we are to spend two hours of debate on an urgency motion which specifically refers `to the need for the government to restructure the tax system . . . and to tackle the issues raised in the Institute of Family Studies report', there would have been at least one Opposition speaker who addressed the substance of the motion. However, not one of them did so. Senator Newman, to her credit, at least spent 15 minutes of what I considered to be an informative and useful contribution to this debate not discussing the urgency motion, but at least canvassing those areas of the tax structure which relate to her shadow ministerial portfolio. However, she said nothing about the report.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator Hill spent 10 minutes of his 20-minute address talking about X-rated videos. In the last two minutes of his remarks he gave a synopsis of contributions made by other people at the women's tax convention. We heard not a single word from Senator Hill about his or the Opposition's position on any of those matters. Senator Powell asked what the Opposition had contributed to the debate on the policy of tax restructuring. The reality was that in two hours of debate the Opposition contributed absolutely nothing. To understand why that was the case, we should turn to the Opposition document-the great leap backwards-Future Directions. One sees on page 15 a statement with which I totally agree:</PARA>
<PARA>The effect of government economic policies on families in terms of their employment prospects, purchasing power and general quality of life should be at the heart of the economic debate. </PARA>
<PARA>Amen to that, and so it should be. We wait in vain, and continue to wait in vain, to hear this so-called alternative government's view on that topic. I refer to a lead story on page one of the Australian Financial Review, in an article by Geoff Kitney:</PARA>
<PARA> The Federal Opposition may abandon the idea of detailing its tax and spending policies before the next election as part of a strategy it is considering to minimise political risks. </PARA>
<PARA>We were well aware that the Opposition was doing that, but the article goes on:</PARA>
<PARA> Mr Howard is confident that the social values and policies contained in Future Directions strategy unveiled last year will present the coalition parties as a clear conservative alternative to the Labor Party. </PARA>
<PARA>We have heard Senator Vanstone in this debate saying that Future Directions is not a policy document, whereas Mr Howard says that it is a policy document. What it is in fact is a huge contradictory con job. Let me demonstrate what a substantive con job this document is in this key area of tax restructuring for families. We have to refer to it. We cannot avoid it, because not a single Opposition speaker in the debate gave one clear indication of what the Opposition's policy is. Opposition members have no excuse for not doing this. The document which is the subject of this debate, AFIT Bulletin No. 5, lists in an entire section on page 24 a proposal for tax changes. It is a useful document. It is a theoretical examination of the relationship between tax and social security, the tax transfer system. It makes a useful contribution to the debate and I read it with great care. It contains detailed proposals-whether one agrees with them or not-on what should be done to restructure the tax system. The Opposition, even though it has moved an urgency motion concerning this report, has not given a single indication of whether it disagrees or agrees with anything contained in it. That is absolutely typical. If we want to know why it is the Opposition's policy not to have a policy, we can refer again to its document, Future Directions, which states in relation to this matter, on page 72:</PARA>
<PARA>The precise details of our social security and taxation policies must await our assessment of the overall resources available nearer the time of the next election. </PARA>
<PARA>As I said before, the document we are discussing says on page 15 that it is essential, if the community is to know what will happen to it after the election, for it to know what the economic policies of the Government and the alternative government are. But, on page 72 of Future Directions, the Liberal Party says it will not tell us until closer to the election. </PARA>
<PARA> However, there has been a shift since Future Directions was drafted. Mr Howard was quoted today on page 1 of the Australian Financial Review as having said that the Opposition was considering not doing even this much until after the next election to minimise its political risks. What political risks is the Opposition talking about? None of us can forget the accounting errors it make the last time it brought down a detailed tax policy; it was laughed out of court as a result of it. The Opposition has completely failed to mention what the report says about the family allowance supplement (FAS) that this Government has brought in. The report devotes some time and care to talking about it, as must any document which talks about families and tax. With respect to FAS, on page 6 the report states:</PARA>
<PARA> The Family Allowance Supplement is the major policy measure of the Government's Family Assistance Package. The Package is viewed by the Government as a crucial component in its program to eliminate child poverty. It has been estimated that, when the Package is fully implemented, the number of children living in families with incomes below the poverty line will fall by 76 per cent for low-income families and by 30 per cent for pensioner and beneficiary families . . . The poverty gap, that is, the differences between the income of each family type and their poverty line, will fall by over 50 per cent both for children in pensioner and beneficiary families and in low income working families. </PARA>
<PARA>On page 8 the report states:</PARA>
<PARA> The pattern of higher increases in average tax rates for those on lower incomes is repeated for all the various family types shown in Table 1. The outstanding exception to this pattern is for families on low incomes with children. </PARA>
<PARA>They are the very people referred to in the Opposition's urgency motion. The report continues:</PARA>
<PARA>These people have been greatly assisted by the Family Allowance Supplement. </PARA>
<PARA>The Opposition does not say a word about that. The table on page 10 of the report goes to the very heart of this debate. It shows the changes in real disposable incomes. With respect to the table the report itself at page 9 makes this necessary qualification:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . the figures refer to hypothetical couples on AWE. In reality, there has been a substantial increase since 1984-85 in the number of couples with both partners in employment . . . Thus, families who were one-income couples on AWE in 1984-85 may have improved their family disposable incomes since that time if they now have the income of a second earner. </PARA>
<PARA>Indeed, that is precisely what has happened. The Government, since it was elected, has created 1.25 million new jobs-a growth of around 3.5 per cent a year. In just the last 12 months 300,000 jobs have been created, an increase of 4 per cent. Youth unemployment has been brought down from 27 per cent in March 1983 to 17 per cent now, and it is still decreasing. Half the number of new jobs have gone to women. Participation rates in the work force have never been higher than they are now. The report itself qualifies its essential element by making that point. </PARA>
<PARA> When reading this theoretical examination of the tax structure-that is what the report is-we must understand that it does not take into account things such as education and the allowances provided for education, child-care, superannuation, new job creation or Medicare. I have talked about the Government's achievement in creating new employment. It has resulted in an overall increase in disposable household income of 13 per cent in real terms since the Government came to office. National wage case decisions since March 1983 have been worth 34 per cent to workers, yet the Opposition, which has the hide to come in here and talk about disposable incomes for families, has opposed every single application for wage increases-and it has the hide today to talk about increasing benefits for families. </PARA>
<PARA> With respect to social security, I have talked about the family allowance supplement which, although an integral part of the report that we are debating today, the Opposition has failed to mention entirely. It means that families with three children on around $16,800-which is the threshold for the maximum benefit-get $101 tax free a week over and above their existing family allowances. This lifts their income to the equivalent of $25,000 a year, equal to a pay rise of 50 per cent a year. I recall only too well what Bill Kelty said at the time the family allowance supplement was introduced. He said-I think I am quoting him correctly-that the family allowance supplement for low income families with dependants had achieved in one Budget what would have taken the industrial movement 50 years to achieve with industrial action. That was a pretty high compliment to have come from the union movement. That has been achieved by this Government but was not mentioned by the Opposition at all. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn now to Medicare. As the result of a national health scheme which the group opposite would abolish, two million Australians previously without any health cover are now covered. Medicare is a progressive scheme. Reversion to the old scheme would cost an average family $21.50 a week more than the $5.50 it currently pays under Medicare, a direct benefit to families. </PARA>
<PARA> With respect to education, I noticed with some disgust the lie contained in Future Directions, which says how dreadful the Labor Government is because kids are being forced to leave school. The fact is that the Government has raised the retention rate in year 12 from 36 per cent when we took office to 60 per cent this year. In an early section of the report, the valid point is made that this Government, having had the courage to direct government resources not where the votes are but to where they are needed-that is, to low income families-has brought about a situation whereby those who now need help are those people on middle incomes with dependants. That is precisely what will happen, as this Government has already announced. That help will be given in accordance with the desires of the report we are debating today, in the April statement and in the July tax cuts. </PARA>

The women present were primarily concerned about the costs women face and the need for recognition of the costs of raising children. I think the Opposition is hypocritical in raising this issue, because the Opposition framework for families is still the basic framework in use. The Opposition's promises in the last election were aimed at supporting traditional families, the numbers of which are decreasing. This was certainly recognised by the very broad-based group of representatives at the Convention here on Saturday. Women now recognise that they will be in the work force for most of their lives, including the period during which they are rearing young children. At any one time more children have two parents working than one parent working and the other at home.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Tax Convention's resolutions were aimed at recovering the 1976 situation with respect to family allowances, which had lost much of their value before the change of government in 1983. The participants in the Convention also wanted the dependent spouse rebate directed to more useful purposes than the subsidising of high income males who could afford to keep their wives in their own personal service. The women at the conference wanted more child-care places and they certainly wanted the present subsidy to continue. They wanted the costs of the rearing of children to be recognised by a contribution from the public purse. They objected to superannuation benefits, which primarily go to high income males. </PARA>
<PARA> The women wanted to make sure that cuts in taxes did not leave public sector services short of necessary funding. They wanted to make sure that low income earners, who are mainly female, shared in the proposed tax cuts and wage rises. Above all, the women wanted to be consulted; to be seen as legitimate sources of advice and expertise in the economic debates that would determine the policies of the major parties in the run-up to the next Federal election. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Vanstone mentioned earlier that there was a swing by women voters away from the Government, but of course there was no indication that these women would prefer the Opposition. It may well be that the Democrats or an Independent such as me will pick up a lot of votes from the disillusionment which women have with both of the major political parties. I seek leave to incorporate in Hansard the resolutions of the Women's Tax Convention. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The resolutions read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA>RESOLUTIONS OF THE WOMEN'S TAX CONVENTION 4 MARCH 1989-PARLIAMENT HOUSE CANBERRA</PARA>
<PARA>The Women's Tax Convention resolved:</PARA>
<PARA>Child Allowance or credit</PARA>
<PARA> (1) that the cost of children be given greater financial recognition in the tax-social security transfer system and that this entitlement to a child allowance or credit be indexed and paid to the primary care giver, outside any considerations of income;</PARA>
<PARA>Payments for children</PARA>
<PARA> (2) that, in recognition of the contribution of children as a future resource of the community, a system of payments for children be instituted. Such a payment should:</PARA>
<PARA> recognise that the costs of children should be shared between the community and the parent(s)</PARA>
<PARA> be a standardised amount paid universally for each child (regardless of the marital or workforce status of the carer) as compensation for the costs of children;</PARA>
<PARA> be paid to the primary care-giver;</PARA>
<PARA> be recognised in the tax system as a tax equity measure;</PARA>
<PARA> be indexed;</PARA>
<PARA> be paid at an adequate level (which will ensure an increase to the present level of child payment);</PARA>
<PARA> ensure affordable and good quality child care. </PARA>
<PARA>Increased indexed and universal family allowance and pensioner earnings</PARA>
<PARA> (3) that the forthcoming tax-wage changes for women should in the immediate future include:</PARA>
<PARA> increasing to 1976 real level Family Allowances (tax credits) and for these to be indexed from now on, restoring universality;</PARA>
<PARA> increasing the income test free area of pension to $60 per week per individual and $30 per week per child. </PARA>
<PARA> The above does not preclude an integrated tax credit system for child support. </PARA>
<PARA>Removal of workforce disincentives</PARA>
<PARA> (4) that a priority of government should be the removal of workforce disincentives brought about by the interaction of the social security and taxation systems which result in poverty traps that particularly disadvantage sole parents and potential second income earners moving back into the workforce. </PARA>
<PARA>Replacement of Dependent Spouse Payments</PARA>
<PARA> (5) that present payments for dependent spouses be replaced by a combination of direct cash payments for children and low-income families. </PARA>
<PARA>Priority for low income earners in tax changes</PARA>
<PARA> (6) that priority in the forthcoming tax changes be given to low-income earners, of whom the majority are women This will necessitate such changes as the closing of tax loopholes and a fairer distribution of the tax burden to all sectors of the community. </PARA>
<PARA>Wage increases for low income workers</PARA>
<PARA> (7) that in wage/tax trade off discussions and subsequent policy developments high priority be given to raising the wages of low income workers through supplementary payments and other measures. Both the ACTU and the Government are urged to support wage increases for low-income earners, the majority of whom are women. </PARA>
<PARA>Maintain/Extend Public Sector Services</PARA>
<PARA> (8) that the provision of services from tax revenue is critical to providing an equitable society and thus states that any forthcoming tax changes should ensure that we can maintain and extend the role of the public sector in providing services. </PARA>
<PARA>Other Issues</PARA>
<PARA>Expansion of Children's Services Program</PARA>
<PARA> (9) that the Children's Services Program be expanded as a key component of the economic infrastructure, that it be adequately funded to ensure high-quality and affordable child care, and that the present structure of operational grants and subsidies be maintained and expanded, and that these be indexed from now on. </PARA>
<PARA>Superannuation Tax Concessions</PARA>
<PARA> (10) that tax concessions for superannuation contributors discriminate against women most of whose workforce participation is irregular and low paid. ``Retirement'' is a gender-based concept. </PARA>
<PARA>Abolition of Higher Education Contribution Scheme</PARA>
<PARA> (11) that this Convention views with concern the adverse effects of H.E.C.S. (Higher Education Contribution Scheme) on women and that we urge the Government to re-establish education as a priority and abolish this tax as it, among other things, disadvantages women. </PARA>
<PARA>National Accounts/Unpaid Work</PARA>
<PARA> (12) that women's unpaid work in the home be fully recognised in the national accounts. </PARA>
<PARA>Concern re: Broader Issues</PARA>
<PARA> (13) that while the convention has not provided resolutions on issues such as assets, provisional sales or consumption taxes it is not an indication of women's lack of concern about the broader issues. </PARA>
<PARA>Issues for further examination</PARA>
<PARA> (14) that the following areas require further examination before any proposals can be put forward:</PARA>
<PARA> income equalisation;</PARA>
<PARA> provisional tax;</PARA>
<PARA> value of unpaid work;</PARA>
<PARA> sales tax;</PARA>
<PARA> raising the tax free threshold by $1500 and indexing that threshold thereafter. </PARA>

<PARA>STATEMENT TO PARLIAMENT BY THE LEADER OF THE GOVERNMENT IN THE SENATE ON NAMIBIA</PARA>
<PARA>6 MARCH 1989</PARA>
<PARA> I seek leave to report to the Senate on recent events in Namibia and Australia's role in assisting the implementation of UN Security Council Resolution 435 of 1978, providing for the withdrawal of South African military forces from Namibia and the holding of elections under UN supervision and control. </PARA>
<PARA> As announced by the Ministers for Defence and Foreign Affairs and Trade on 2 March 1989, a contingent of three hundred Australian engineers will leave shortly for Namibia. They will form part of a United Nations Peacekeeping Force in Namibia that will help bring independence to Namibia after more than one hundred years of rule by foreign powers. The settlement of the long and complex issue of Namibian independence is an important international event. It is an event in which Australia has played, and will continue to play, a substantial part. </PARA>
<PARA> During the Prime Minister's recent visit to India, he noted that there had been much talk during the 1970s and early 1980s about an arc of instability stretching from southern Africa, through the Persian Gulf, through Afghanistan and South Asia and on to Indochina. We see now, if not an arc of peace, than at least an arc of peace-making. It is a process, facilitated by an improvement in superpower relations and aided by the constructive role of the United Nations, that is finally bringing the treasured goal of independence within sight of the people of Namibia. The Government recognises that the problems in southern Africa constitute one of the major challenges facing the international community. We have sought, through the United Nations, the Commonwealth and our own diplomatic links with countries in the region, to find peaceful solutions to the complex set of problem that trouble that region. </PARA>
<PARA> In recent times, there has been little cause for optimism in southern Africa. The offensive doctrine of apartheid remains entrenched in South Africa's social, political and economic life. Civil wars with drastic human consequences continue in Mozambique and Angola. The Front Line States of southern Africa-including fellow Commonwealth members such as Botswana, Tanzania, Zambia and Zimbabwe-continue to be vulnerable to economic and military destabilisation. The question of Namibia, in many ways, encapsulated a number of these problems. The fact that Namibia is now on the way to independence demonstrates that concerted international action, the determination of the region, and the goodwill of individual players can combine to bring solutions to longstanding problems in the region. For southern Africa torn by attrition, deprivation and tragedy, recent moves on Namibia offer a glimmer of hope. Namibia has been the international community for 70 Years. South Africa was appointed mandatary over the former German colony of South West Africa by the Treaty of Versailles in 1919, in circumstances similar to Australia's own mandate over Papua New Guinea. This mandate was confirmed by the League of Nations. </PARA>
<PARA> After the Second World War, the League of Nations was superseded by the United Nations, and the mandate system by the trusteeship system. Alone of the former mandatary powers, South Africa refused to submit a trusteeship agreement for South West Africa, or Namibia, as it is now known. In 1966, the UN General Assembly resolved that South Africa's role in Namibia should be terminated, and that the responsibility for the territory should be assumed by a UN-appointed Council for Namibia. Despite these decisions, South Africa continued to govern Namibia against the wishes of the United Nations, and claimed sovereignty over it in the face of widespread international condemnation. </PARA>
<PARA> South African rule has been opposed from within Namibia since 1957 by the South West African People's Organisation, SWAPO. SWAPO commenced an armed struggle in 1966, and was supported in this by Namibia's neighbour to the north, Angola, when it achieved independence in 1975. </PARA>
<PARA> South Africa responded by supporting an insurgency against the Government of Angola, and by direct attacks against Angolan Government forces inside Angola. Angola sought Cuban involvement and as many as 50,000 Cuban troops have been deployed there at any one time. This involvement, with substantial Soviet backing, became a significant source of East-West tension. </PARA>
<PARA> It has taken years to begin to untangle this mess. In 1978 the UN agreed on a plan for a settlement contained in UN Security Council Resolution 435, but intransigence on all sides prevented that plan from being implemented. Then last year, in the context of reduced East-West tensions, the log-jam started to break up. South Africa agreed to withdraw its forces and to allow Namibia its independence, while Angola agreed to the withdrawal of Cuban forces and the removal of African National Congress camps from its territory. The signing of the Brazzaville Protocol on 22 December last year by South Africa, Cuba and Angola has at last formalised the acceptance by South Africa of the 1978 UN settlement plan. </PARA>
<PARA> Last month the UN Security Council agreed that the transition to independence for Namibia would begin on 1 April 1989. Over the 12 months from that date the UN will monitor the withdrawal of foreign forces, oversee the drafting and adoption of a Constitution, and supervise the installation of a new Government after general elections. </PARA>
<PARA> A vital element in this plan is the United Nations Transition Assistance Group, UNTAG. It will monitor the ceasefire and troop withdrawals, supervise elections, and support the maintenance of law and order in Namibia until the new government of independent Namibia is ready to take over. </PARA>
<PARA> The scale of these tasks is reflected in the size of the force. UNTAG will have civilian, police and military elements. The military element will consist initially of 4,650 personnel including three infantry battalions, with scope for expansion to 7,500 should the circumstances demand. </PARA>
<PARA> Australia is providing the engineering component of UNTAG. Our contingent of 23 officers and 277 other ranks will provide engineering and construction support to the UN effort. Such support will be sorely needed. Namibia is a large, arid, sparsely-populated and underdeveloped country which has been a war zone for many years. Our engineers will build roads, bridges, airstrips and camps for UNTAG. They will have the very serious task of clearing mines which have been laid by the various contending forces along the border between Angola and Namibia. </PARA>
<PARA> This is of course not the first time Australian personnel have been involved with a peacekeeping force in Africa; we participated in the Commonwealth force that monitored Zimbabwe's transition to independence in 1980. In that process, as in others before and since, Australian defence forces played a constructive role in what can be a difficult and sometimes dangerous process. </PARA>
<PARA> Members of the Australian contingent will serve in Namibia for tours of six months, after which they will be replaced by a fresh contingent from Australia. The UN plans to complete Namibia's transition to independence within a year, but delays in this complex process are possible, and we may be called upon to stay longer than a year. </PARA>
<PARA> The bulk of the Australian contingent will be based at Grootfontein in the north of Namibia, near the border with Angola. Elements of the contingent could be required to deploy into neighbouring countries to support UNTAG operations there. </PARA>
<PARA> This is a very large and important commitment for Australia, comprising almost half of the Army's construction engineering capability. Careful planning, including the use of Reservists, has been required to ensure that high-priority engineering tasks closer to home can still be performed. </PARA>
<PARA> I am pleased to say that it has been possible to minimise the impact of the deployment on support of the operational deployment force, exercise Kangaroo 89, and the defence cooperation program in the South Pacific, where our engineers build wharves, airstrips and other essential infrastructure. </PARA>
<PARA> It has to be understood that the political and military situation in the border region where the bulk of our men will be deployed will remain uncertain and outbreaks of fighting cannot be ruled out. Members of the Australian contingent will travel often on minor and remote roads. They will be responsible for the dangerous work of clearing mines throughout the country. Threats are also posed by disease and the harsh environment. </PARA>
<PARA> Against these dangers should be set the fact that our service personnel are experts in their profession; they are well trained and will be armed for self-defence. </PARA>
<PARA> I can assure honourable senators that the safety of the Australian contingent is uppermost in the Government's mind. To ensure that we are kept fully informed of developments that may affect the well-being of the Australian contingent, the Government has decided to establish a temporary Australian Liaison Office in the Namibian capital of Windhoek for the duration of the 12 month independence process. The Office will provide the Government with first hand reporting on political and military developments in the territory, during what at times is likely to be a difficult process. The Office will be headed by an experienced diplomat with many years background in African affairs. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has also ensured that members of the Australian contingent be adequately compensated for the hardships and dangers they will face through a comprehensive and generous set of conditions of service, including the payment of special allowances. In addition, the Treasurer will be seeking an amendment to the Income Tax Assessment Act to exempt the pay and allowances earned by Defence Force personnel while they are on tour with UNTAG. Repatriation benefits appropriate to the tasks and hazards encountered will also be provided. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr President, our contribution to UNTAG and our involvement in the Namibian settlement makes Australia party to what may be one of the United Nations' most substantial achievements for many years. We have been involved in this process from the start. Australia has been a member of the UN Council for Namibia since 1974. We pledged our support for UNTAG at the inception of the UN plan for Namibia in 1978. Australia also made an important contribution to UN deliberations about Namibia during our recent term on the UN Security Council in 1985-86. </PARA>
<PARA> Our participation in UNTAG also builds on the constructive role successive Australian Governments have played on southern African issues. I pay particular tribute to the achievements of former Prime Minister Malcolm Fraser in this regard. Our decisive contribution to the attainment of independence by Zimbabwe, Australia's leading role in the Commonwealth on southern Africa affairs, our bilateral aid support for the member countries of the Southern African Development Co-ordination Conference all speak of a firm commitment to peace and stability in that region. Our involvement in the Eminent Person's Group was only one demonstration of our longstanding determination to work constructively to bring about an end to the repugnant policies of apartheid. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that the Namibian settlement, together with the resolution of the Iran-Iraq war and the end of Soviet military intervention in Afghanistan, marks a renewal of faith in the UN as an effective participant in international affairs after many years of cynicism and apathy about its role. The UN belongs on the centre stage of world affairs, not in the wings, and it is very encouraging that more and more countries are recognising this. I take this opportunity to pay tribute to the efforts of Martti Ahtisaari, the UN Secretary-General's Special Representative on Namibia, for his important role, and those of the late Bernt Carlsson, the UN Commissioner for Namibia, who was tragically killed in the Lockerbie air disaster. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like to think that Namibia's transition to independence will proceed to plan and that there will be no major setbacks. But such things are never certain. Our effort in Namibia will be the largest peacekeeping commitment in which this country has ever participated. It may also be the most difficult. I am sure that all honourable senators, and the people of Australia join me in wishing our troops well in their endeavours. We do so in the knowledge that they will make an outstanding contribution to the future peace and prosperity of an independent Namibian people and a more stable region. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That the Senate take note of the statement. </PARA>
<PARA>The armed force which is going to Namibia on behalf of the Australian Government and the Australian people was originally made as a commitment 10 or more years ago by the Fraser Government. It is now being implemented by the Hawke Government. Before the force goes, I would like to take this opportunity to briefly make a few points in the Senate. This is a very serious undertaking. It is not a Boy Scout jamboree, but something of great moment. It is the largest peacekeeping force that this country has ever sent away. It is also a very dangerous undertaking and the Government has been warned of the likelihood of serious casualties. </PARA>
<PARA> It is a force of approximately 250 engineers with about 50 support personnel. The force is to help Namibia prepare for peace and for free elections. Namibia has been heavily mined and the mining has been, to a large extent, random and unmapped. Therefore, our men are going on a particularly dangerous undertaking, as has been mentioned by the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) in his statement. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister for Defence Science and Personnel (Mrs Kelly) this afternoon failed to come to grips with that fact when she referred to the `difficulties' which the force may face. I am afraid there is no getting away from the fact that these men are going on a dangerous undertaking. This country and the Minister responsible for these men have to acknowledge this fact. In the light of that fact I am particularly concerned that so many months have been spent behind the scenes engaging in quite disgraceful haggling over the allowances and the benefits to which these men will be entitled. </PARA>
<PARA> I have been keeping a close watch on this matter and less than a couple of weeks ago these men were still being offered by the Government of Australia a lesser allowance per day than is currently paid to Telecom linemen who go and camp in the bush to extend and repair Telecom's lines around Australia. There was no recognition at all, up to a few weeks ago, of the importance, the danger and the difficulty of the work these men will be undertaking. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, I remember the compensation on your part for the kids in Vietnam.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senate NEWMAN-Which was tax free. It has only just now been decided that the men who will be going to Namibia will also be in receipt of tax free allowances. It is important to recognise that, although the allowances now appear to be more generous, they have not become so lightly. Certainly, I have done my bit behind the scenes, as has the rest of the Opposition, to see that these things have been improved. I am glad to say that they have been. We have to remember, as Senator Aulich said, how Australia treated the men who were sent to Vietnam. We must remember that the men being sent to Namibia are men who represent our country and they should go with our pride and our total support. Let us not have them treated as my husband and those who served with him were treated when they returned from Vietnam. </PARA>
<PARA> At this stage it is certainly not clear what the veterans' entitlement would be for these men. It is not certain whether the wives of any who may be killed would be entitled to become war widows nor is it clear what the details of their veterans' entitlements would be. That is something that I expect the Government to make clear very shortly for the peace of mind of the men who are going. </PARA>
<PARA> Another factor which the Prime Minister skated around in his statement was the effect which this Namibia commitment will have on Australia's defence capability. This force will take an enormously high proportion of the engineering strength of the Australian Defence Force. Will this commitment be for six months? It certainly appears to be for at least 12 months, but for how much longer will it be? The Prime Minister of Australia and the Minister for Defence (Mr Beazley) are regularly seen going around the traps in our region offering assistance here and there. In the last few months we have had suggestions that we may also have a commitment to Cambodia and possibly some commitment to honour our treaty obligations with Papua New Guinea. </PARA>
<PARA> If we were to undertake those commitments, it would be quite impossible for us to maintain this force in Namibia at the same time. Despite the Prime Minister's remarks on page 4 of the statement, I have grave doubts about how the Defence Force will cope with the engineering component of Kangaroo 89. Kangaroo 89 and how much it will achieve have been written about almost weekly, but the commitment to Namibia, which we support, will have a major impact on that achievement. It is quite unrealistic to look at any further commitments of forces in our region unless the Government is prepared to do something about the manning levels of the forces, which levels it has quite seriously cut in recent years. The Government will also have to do something about the level of resources given to the defence forces. </PARA>
<PARA> Unfortunately, in many ways the defence forces of Australia are being given fewer resources and less manpower to do increasing numbers of tasks. It is impossible for the situation to continue any longer. The reality is that the armed forces will continue to try to do all that is asked of them by the government of the day in the great and the proud tradition that those defence forces have had in Australia for generations. We in this Parliament and in the nation have a very heavy duty to see that they have all the manpower and all the resources that they need to do what we ask of them. Next week I am hoping that the Leader of the Opposition, John Howard, my colleague Peter White and I will be able to go to Holsworthy to see the troops that are going away to serve for Australia in Namibia. These soldiers and their officers are well trained and we can be very proud that they are a continuation of a very great military tradition in this country. They go on our behalf to do jobs that most of us would never dare to face. We in the Opposition, and I believe in the nation, honour them. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On behalf of the Australian Democrats, I wish to respond to the statement made to the Parliament by the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) with regard to peacekeeping forces in Namibia. Indeed, the history of that unhappy part of the world with its linkages to the United Nations goes back a very long way. This is another chapter-hopefully a definitive chapter-in bringing Namibia to independence. I wish to quote from the Prime Minister's statement. On page 5, he states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I believe that the Namibian settlement, together with the resolution of the Iran-Iraq war and the end of Soviet military intervention in Afghanistan, marks a renewal of faith in the UN as an effective participant in international affairs after many years of cynicism and apathy about its role. The UN belongs on the centre stage of world affairs, not in the wings, and it is very encouraging that more and more countries are recognising this. </PARA>
<PARA>That certainly expresses my party's sentiments with regard to this particular peacekeeping force. In the past we have opposed sending Australian troops to various parts of the world, but we have never opposed a force which is being sent under the United Nations auspices. We believe that this is the appropriate body to sponsor such peacekeeping forces. We believe that by working with the United Nations on such events, costly though they are-and this is also a costly exercise-Australia is continuing a tradition that it has had since Federation of assisting where it can, and to the extent of its resources, in a peace supporting role. We believe that the exercise being undertaken will certainly, as has been indicated in the Prime Minister's statement, stretch our resources. Indeed, as also indicated, it will take up almost half of the construction possibilities of our armed forces. In doing that, it is fairly obvious that this is not something that is entered into lightly. In these circumstances it is a pity that such a peacekeeping force is necessary. However, given the still unsettled nature of the South African continent, particularly the aggressive nature of South Africa with regard to its surrounding neighbours and the destabilisation in which South Africa is engaged in many front line states, it is certainly a welcome move that a ceasefire could ever have been attained. </PARA>
<PARA> When one looks at the complexity of the issue, the variety of groups and support that is provided-whether it be from South Africa or Angola-one wonders how a ceasefire ever managed to come about. Now that it has, I think that it is certainly a worthy contribution from Australia to attempt to solidify that ceasefire, to take that ceasefire through to permanent state and then to take Namibia through to independence hopefully as a peaceful nation in the African continent. However, I think that last sentiment-the ability of any nation in the southern part of Africa to operate on peaceful terms with its neighbour-depends probably less on most of the smaller nations, given the very limited resources that they actually have, and far more on South Africa, which has enormous armed forces and an enormous capacity to interfere in the internal operations of the countries in that region. Since South Africa was a party to the ceasefire, it is to be hoped that, on behalf of that country, this also shows an awareness that, like elsewhere in the world, the resolution of these complicated and difficult issues is far better done by discussion than it is by war. It is also interesting to note that, like the Iran-Iraq war and the Soviet intervention in Afghanistan, essentially at the end of the day as such the parties have not managed to achieve a winnable position, they have ground to a halt in all those conflicts. It may be dawning on the world community that armed intervention will not lead to the early types of successes that one had imagined probably prior to the Vietnam war and the United States and Australian involvement there. </PARA>
<PARA> The Afghan war with Soviet involvement has shown that countries with massive military hardware and capacity have not been able to win a war under those circumstances; they have been able to win the battles, but finally not the war. If that is the case, and if the agreement of South Africa to the ceasefire indicates that that country is willing to enter into discussions on a whole range of very complicated matters that face the southern part of that continent, then it will be a magnificent move ahead for the world community. I think that in that context certainly the contribution that Australia will be making will be most worthwhile. </PARA>
<PARA> I think that it is very useful and beneficial that we are in the position to be able to make that type of substantive contribution. Troops in Namibia will be in significant danger, given the unsettled nature of the ceasefire and the type of country that they will be expected to deal with. Naturally enough, in terms of its role, this particular peacekeeping force will also be involved in mine clearance and the like. So there will be some significant danger. If it does not come from that area, as we now know, but have tended to forget previously, there are significant casualties during times of engagement and even during times of peace. Casualties will often occur from things which arise outside military exercises, particularly from disease. Unfortunately, given the unhappy history of that part of the world, our forces will be exposed to many rampant diseases. </PARA>
<PARA> We are asking our forces to undertake a dangerous exercise which I think is well within the capacity of our armed forces. It is also well within the approach that this country now wishes to take to promote peace around the world. Hopefully the UN peacekeeping forces will become the dominant armed forces operating outside national borders anywhere in the world. If that is the case in the future, then I think that everybody in Australia-and in fact in the world-will have a far happier planet to look forward to with regard to these matters. We wish the contingent well. I think it would be everybody's hope in this place that it will be able to return without casualty. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to make some brief remarks about the statement of the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) tabled today regarding our involvement in the Namibia peacekeeping force. It is a major achievement for the United Nations (UN) to have reached a peace agreement in view of the intransigence of the contending parties and, in particular, the South Africans over many years. One should not forget that South Africa has illegally occupied Namibia for many years in contravention of the United Nations trusteeship. To have finally reached a settlement is a great step forward for peace in southern Africa. Independence has been a long time coming for the people of Namibia, but it will be joyously received by those people next year.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Australia's involvement in the peacekeeping force further confirms that we are able to play a major part in various foreign affairs issues in the world. It reaffirms that we have an independent foreign policy, and it reaffirms the constructive role that Australia has played, as a member of the UN Security Council since 1974, in achieving peace in Namibia-a role that at times one felt was leading us nowhere. But Australia stuck at it. I pay tribute not only to this Government but also to the previous Government in carrying out that role. It certainly enhanced our position and reputation amongst the African nations. I also believe that our participation will again mean that the professionalism of Australia's armed forces is recognised. We know that our soldiers who go there will fulfil their duties with that professionalism and will add lustre to the traditions of Australia's military forces. As one who opposed Australia's involvement in the Vietnam war, I must say that it is a very welcome opportunity to be able to strongly support Australia's armed forces being involved in a peacekeeping force in a country such as Namibia. </PARA>
<PARA> This leads me to make a couple of comments about a further prospective area where Australia may be asked to play a role in a peacekeeping force-that is, in Kampuchea. Recently I had the honour of being a member of a parliamentary delegation to Indonesia and Vietnam. In both countries it was quite clear that, if an international peace conference on Kampuchea were successful and an agreement were reached for a peacekeeping force to be sent to Kampuchea to oversee free and fair elections, Australia would almost certainly be invited to participate in that peacekeeping force. Again, like Namibia, there would be some risk to the military personnel involved, but I think the risks are more than outweighed by the fact that Australia has a chance to play a constructive role in reaching a peaceful settlement. If we receive an invitation from an international peace conference to send forces to Kampuchea, I hope that this Government will accept the invitation. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, people will note that the Prime Minister, in his statement, paid tribute to the role of Bernt Carlsson, the UN Commissioner for Namibia, who was tragically killed in the Lockerbie air disaster. I had the good fortune of meeting Bernt Carlsson on a number of occasions when he was the Secretary-General of the Socialist International from 1975 to 1983. Bernt was a very good friend of Australia. He saw that an organisation such as the Socialist International had to become more worldwide in its perspective. He came to Australia on a number of occasions and convinced the Australian Labor Party to become more international in its activities within the Socialist International and other issues in the world. When he was appointed UN Commissioner for Namibia his friends in Australia realised that he had a difficult task, but we were all delighted when a peaceful settlement was achieved. Of course, the great tragedy is that, just before Christmas, he caught the plane that crashed at Lockerbie to fly back the United Nations in New York to take part in the signing of the peace treaty. We all know that the plane crashed and Bernt was killed. I would like to place on record that it is a real tragedy that he was not able to take part in that peace ceremony for Namibia when he contributed so much to it. In my view, it is one of the awful ironies of world politics that the good people always seem to get killed early. Bernt was certainly one of the good people of the world. I think Australia's participation in the peacekeeping force will go some small way towards a recognition of his contribution to peace in Namibia. I strongly endorse the Prime Minister's statement today. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the paper. </PARA>
<PARA>It is indeed apt that today, just two days after the Australian Capital Territory (ACT) election, we have before us the 1987-88 annual report of the Australian Electoral Commission. I note that among the functions of the Australian Electoral Commission are:</PARA>
<PARA>provide information and advice on electoral matters to the Parliament, the Government, Departments and authorities of the Commonwealth;</PARA>
<PARA>. . . </PARA>
<PARA>consider and report to the Minister on electoral matters referred to it by the Minister and such other electoral matters as the Commission thinks fit. </PARA>
<PARA>Honourable senators will recall that I moved a motion last week to have tabled in the Senate advice given to the Government and the ACT Administration on the ACT electoral system-the modified d'Hondt system. I did this in the interests of open government. I regret very much that all senators from the Australian Labor Party, the Liberal Party and the National Party voted against my motion. In fact, they voted against the people in the ACT having this information before they went to the polls on Saturday. For obvious reasons, the next section of the report of the Australian Electoral Commission that I looked at was the section on freedom of information. I was very pleased to see that, in a report of 109 pages, 22 pages are devoted to freedom of information. For anyone who may be listening to this debate, the report states:</PARA>
<PARA>Requests for access to documents held by the Australian Electoral Commission should be forwarded to:</PARA>
<PARA> Electoral Commissioner,</PARA>
<PARA> P.O. Box E201, Queen Victoria Terrace, A.C.T. 2600. </PARA>
<PARA>However, letters or request forms posted to any office of the Australian Electoral Commission . . . will be treated in the same manner as if the request were posted or delivered to the registered address. </PARA>
<PARA>These documents are available to people on request. Other functions of the Australian Electoral Commission include:</PARA>
<PARA>conducting all Commonwealth parliamentary elections and referendums; maintaining up-to-date electoral rolls . . . promoting public awareness of electoral and Parliamentary matters. </PARA>
<PARA>The last function is one which is very dear to the hearts of all Australian Democrats. We find that there is an increasing interest by the general public in our electoral systems and how they work. People are increasingly aware that, in order to make democracy work, electors must play a vital part. I must say that one of the pleasing aspects of last Saturday's election in the ACT was that people realised that they had alternatives to the two major blocs-Labor and Liberal-and that well over 50 per cent of the voters voted for parties other than Labor and Liberal. This is a sign of the times. We have seen Independents recently elected to the New South Wales Legislative Council. We have seen the emergence of new, alternative parties in Western Australia in the recent State election. We have also seen serious, alternative parties in the Australian Capital Territory. I would like to add that I certainly do not condone an informal vote of any sort at all. </PARA>
<PARA> People need to have access to and understanding of voting systems. I must say that it is regrettable that the people of the Australian Capital Territory were confronted with a very complex system-the modified d'Hondt system. It is a proportional representational system. It has that to its merit. However, considering that we have had other forms of proportional representation tried in Australia, for example, the Senate system and the Hare-Clark system, it is regrettable that neither of those systems was allowed to go to the people in the Australian Capital Territory. </PARA>
<PARA> The Democrats in Western Australia are attempting to promote public awareness of our electoral systems. During the last State election campaign one of our two-minute segments in our broadcasts gave a demonstration of how the preferential system works. We had a lot of appreciative calls because of that. I must say that I certainly look forward to the 1988-89 report of the Australian Electoral Commission because I am sure it will contain some comment on the modified d'Hondt system. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would have thought that, given the level of interest in this matter in the Senate, it was a subject on which in General Business or at some other time we might well wish to have a full debate, not one with a five-minute time limit, so that we can deal with these matters more thoroughly. I certainly indicate the Opposition's interest in doing so.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody has attracted a great deal of attention. To some extent the value of the Royal Commission has already been demonstrated by some of the facts which have been disclosed in the interim report. Honourable senators will recall that during the early period of the Commission there was a period of some difficulty with regard to the Commissioner. We unanimously passed a resolution supporting the Commissioner and the operations of the Commission. It would be common ground that there is a general wish in this chamber that some good should come out of this inquiry. </PARA>
<PARA> Having said that, there is in the community some doubts about the efficiency of this particular way of getting to the bottom of what is, after all, not a particularly new problem. I say that because one matter which was certainly not known to me at the time the Commission was appointed, but which has become apparent from the facts brought forward in this interim report, is that when one looks at the tragic number of Aboriginal deaths in custody one finds that there are a lot of non-Aboriginal deaths as well. Indeed, the report suggests that the proportion of deaths of Aboriginal people in custody is, if anything, slightly less than the proportion of Aboriginal people in custody. In other words, the proportion of Aboriginal people going into custody who are then dying is slightly less than the proportion of non-Aboriginal people who go into custody and who die in custody or while in prison. </PARA>
<PARA> We have a situation in which what the Commission has identified is a problem which affects the whole of the prison community, not merely the Aboriginal community. That, of course, does not in any way make it less of a problem. It suggests that it may not be as racially based as perhaps all of us assumed at the time the Commission was appointed. In one sense I would like to think that that was so and that my own theories as to why Aboriginal people are dying in custody-and this is to some extent borne out in this interim report-may not be correct. The report says:</PARA>
<PARA> The social reasons are complex and cannot . . . be fully addressed . . . The explanations . . . do not all lie within prison walls or the confines of lock-ups, nor are they explicable only in terms of sentencing policies. </PARA>
<PARA>The Royal Commissioner goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA> I am confident a significant number of deaths have their roots, not only in health issues, but in the very despair of individuals, in frustration, in anger, in legal practices and procedures in which many Aborigines have no confidence. </PARA>
<PARA>My personal view was that the deaths were a combination of despair on the part of the Aboriginal people concerned and the contempt they often find within the community-I suspect they sometimes find it in the prison authorities, but that is something which is in no sense peculiar to those authorities; it is unhappily one of the less pleasant aspects of our society-that combination of despair and contempt which would lead people to take their own lives is perhaps something which is felt by many other people in the community. Hence the non-Aboriginal deaths in custody is roughly of a similar proportion. </PARA>
<PARA> The serious issue for Aboriginal people is, of course, that so many more Aboriginal people go to gaol. There is a totally disproportionate number of Aboriginal people who find themselves in gaol, compared with their share of the population. The thing we should note in this essentially preliminary comment on these reports is that that problem is one which has been identified for many years. </PARA>
<PARA> Many honourable senators would have met the late Elizabeth Eggleston who wrote a book entitled Fear, Favour or Affection, which was a study and really in book form her thesis subtitled `Aborigines and the Criminal Law in Victoria, South Australia and Western Australia'. It was published as part of the Aborigines in Australian Society series under the late Professor Charles Rowley. I will very quickly refer to that book, which was published, I point out, in 1976. We find that this contrasting pattern of arrest for Aboriginals is quite different from that for the rest of the population. Elizabeth Eggleston reported:</PARA>
<PARA>The Aboriginal offence par excellence is drunkenness, with charges constituting 48 per cent of all charges against Aborigines. </PARA>
<PARA>From the reports, it would sadly appear that that is still a major cause of imprisonment, and there are recommendations which relate to that major cause of arrest. We also find:</PARA>
<PARA>Thus, Aborigines, forming 2.5 per cent of the population of Western Australia and being convicted of 11 per cent of offences, made up 24 per cent of the prison population of the State. </PARA>
<PARA>This goes back 20 years. This is not a new problem. It is an old tragedy. It is time we directed our attention to it in a very constructive way and found some answers. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I endorse Senator Chaney's remarks. In fact in the adjournment debate last Thursday I spoke about two white deaths in custody. This is a matter which concerns us all. I am pleased that we will continue this debate at a later time and in greater detail. In speaking briefly to the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody interim report, I must say that I do so with a heavy heart. The Commission was established towards the end of 1987 and was expected to complete its work within 12 months. Everyone I know is appalled and sickened by the black deaths in custody, which are still continuing. The interim report is welcome and it provides us with useful information. It is clear that the Commission's research programs are far from complete. Nevertheless, Commissioner Muirhead has made some suggestions and recommendations dealing with issues which must be considered to be not only important but also deserving of immediate consideration by State governments.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In all, Commissioner Muirhead puts forward some 56 recommendations, with the main focus of attention being on sentencing practices; intoxicated persons; conditions and procedures at police lockups; the recruitment, training and placement of police and prison officers; medical issues; and coronial inquests. The public response to the recommendations has been varied and, on occasions, far from exemplary. There seems to be something close to universal acceptance that imprisonment should be utilised with much less frequency and not imposed automatically in default of payment of fines and that the offence of public drunkenness should either be decriminalised or abolished. Implementation of some of the recommendations on the conditions and procedures at police lockups could well put an end to deaths in custody. I refer briefly to an example of this. Recommendation 12 reads:</PARA>
<PARA>In no case should a person be transported by police to a lockup or watch-house when that person is either unconscious or not easily roused. Such persons must, if found on a patrol, be immediately taken to a hospital or medical practitioner or, if neither facility is available, to a nurse or other person qualified to assess their health. </PARA>
<PARA>There have been disappointing reactions in Western Australia from representatives of the police and prison officers unions as to the recommendations on the recruitment, training and placement of police and prison officers. For example, recommendation 27 states:</PARA>
<PARA>Appropriate screening procedures should be implemented to ensure that potential officers who will have contact with Aboriginal people in their duties are not recruited or retained by police and prison departments whilst holding racist views which cannot be eliminated by training or re-training programs. </PARA>
<PARA>There is a great uproar in Western Australia about that and similar recommendations. The recommendations with regard to greater understanding of Aboriginal history, culture and social behaviour make very good sense. If the recommendations on medical issues were implemented now, they would prevent those Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal deaths in custody which are caused directly by police and prison officers not being instructed to seek medical attention immediately. I refer to recommendation 38 which states:</PARA>
<PARA>Correctional institutions should have 24 hour a day access to medical practitioners. </PARA>
<PARA>That is another very important recommendation. With regard to post-death investigations or coronial inquiries, Commissioner Muirhead recommends greater independence for the coroner's court and less reliance on the outcome of the autopsy and assumptions by the police and prison warders on the cause of death. Commissioner Muirhead says that suicide must never be presumed. We have a long way to go. If some of the recommendations could be implemented right now I think we could prevent such deaths, which, unfortunately, still continue. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I take this opportunity to join with the remarks by Senator Chaney and Senator Jenkins on the important reports before us. The interim report of the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody is a very important document and will be seen in the future as a benchmark against which both the Commonwealth and State governments will be measured. Firstly, I pay tribute to the retiring Commissioner, Mr Justice James Muirhead, who was given the invidious task of setting up this commission of inquiry and leading it through all of the stages to date. James Muirhead is an outstanding jurist in Australia and has had a very distinguished career. He is retiring from the post of Commissioner of this inquiry to take up the appointment of Administrator of the Northern Territory, which is another position to which he will be able to bring his particular skills, background and interests to the advantage of all Territorians, particularly the Aboriginal community of the Northern Territory. The task which Justice Muirhead has taken in bringing together this report and the sensitivity with which he has dealt with it need to be commented on and noted formally.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As Senator Jenkins has just said, the interim report covers a wide range of issues and recommendations. I am pleased that both Commonwealth and State governments responded so quickly, by holding a ministerial conference to address those important issues that required concerted policy action and for which Budget provisions had to be made. Nobody denies that the deaths in custody issue has been blown up through the media to much greater significance than the issue really bears. More importantly, the reports of the Commission have highlighted all the causes and reasons why Aboriginals are placed in custody in the first place. It is interesting to note that the Commission's recommendations are now being addressed by all governments in Australia. I hope that such action will continue and receive the priority that it enjoys currently. I move:</PARA>

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the paper. </PARA>
<PARA>The tabling of the 1987-88 report of the Northern Land Council is shrouded in controversy. All of that controversy is of the making of the Northern Land Council itself. I am of the opinion that, unfortunately, in the past couple of years there has been continued politicisation of the Bureau of the Northern Land Council in particular. This arises on many issues when priorities need to be given in the Aboriginal affairs area. I refer to issues such as the Aboriginal treaty: the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission, which has been the subject of much debate in this chamber and has been pushed so actively by the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs (Mr Hand); and the role of the Northern Land Council with regard to emerging local government, or what is referred to in the Northern Territory as community government. In fact, all the issues that were promoted and pushed so strongly by the Northern Land Council at the Barunga festival in June last year point in that direction. </PARA>
<PARA> The report points to a number of areas of efficiency, accountability and staffing. A whole range of notes to the accounts that are covered at the back need particular attention. We need to challenge the Bureau of the Northern Land Council to ensure that, as it is a Public Service bureaucracy, it is measured in similar terms to the Public Service. It needs to develop performance indicators to ensure that the functions it carries out are being done effectively for the Aboriginal constituency that it represents and to ensure financial accountability at all times. I think everyone would accept that in the period that the Northern Land Council has been in existence it has had to do a very difficult task. Often it has chosen to hide behind the principles of Aboriginal self-determination that are generally so misunderstood. I am sure nobody would argue that efficiency and accountability ought not to be the measuring stick of all these issues. </PARA>
<PARA> I wish to highlight some differences between this and the previous year's report. In that report the auditor put in qualifications, particularly regarding the administration of the royalty trust account. In the previous year it was not covered adequately and reconciled. This year there is no similar qualification, but I have become aware that, since the end of the financial year commencing June 1988, there have been continuing problems concerning royalties, particularly the administration of buffalo royalties in the Northern Territory. I have had allegations made to me that the administration of that area is very loose. It certainly requires a heck of a lot of personal attention, both by the Minister and by the Northern Land Council itself. </PARA>
<PARA> The accounts are qualified particularly in the notes at the back of the report relating to the overflow of actual expenditure as against budgeted expenditure for the year. There has been a blow-out in the operational area, in particular. The administration costs involved are substantial. All honourable senators should give close attention to this area of Aboriginal affairs. Often the problem is due to inadequately trained staff who perhaps need special training programs. The Northern Land Council is always aware of this, but it needs to make sure that the administration of the Bureau is not run by a gang of four-or indeed by any small group of people-who do not have sufficient resources or an adequate training background. </PARA>
<PARA> In recent months we have seen a number of breakaway land council movements in the Aboriginal constituency in the Northern Territory. They reflect the disquiet and frequent problems in this area. Aboriginal people themselves see the need to get much tighter administration. The Minister, Mr Hand, must give attention to the calls and demands of these breakaway groups. They are very meaningful. On behalf of the Aboriginal people of the Northern Territory I point out that they demand urgent attention. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the paper. </PARA>
<PARA>I believe that the annual report of the Central Land Council for 1987-88 needs the close attention of honourable senators. These documents are often couched in such a way that they look like reports of organisations that are proceeding with a great deal of success. Like the Northern Land Council, the Central Land Council has attracted a great deal of controversy. That is easy to cope with in the context of the continuing political debate. There have been breakaway movements within the Aboriginal constituency represented by the Central Land Council. At Docker River on the Western Australian border and in the areas close to Hermannsburg and Ti-Tree, groups of Aboriginal people are expressing their disquiet at the Central Land Council's administration and are asking for smaller, more accountable organisations to represent them. </PARA>
<PARA> If one looks at the annual report of the Central Land Council, one notes that the auditor's report by Price Waterhouse is, in a number of instances, couched in rather unusual terms which, I believe, are qualifications that the audit procedures have not necessarily been carried out as they ought to have been. I do not wish to be seen in any way as patronising the way in which Aboriginal people do their accounting, but the cash accountability procedures that have been used were discontinued by most commercial organisations 30 or 40 years ago. Cash disbursements can be made and are open to questioning. But we must ensure, as I said in regard to the Northern Land Council's report, that the people who are destined to receive the cash do receive it, particularly royalty moneys. As I said, this report also demands the close attention of all honourable senators and must be read with regard to the other initiatives that are going on. </PARA>
<PARA> I draw a comparison between the reports of the Northern Land Council and the Central Land Council and the report of the Tiwi Land Council, which was also tabled today. The Tiwi Land Council report is in very different language. The Tiwi Land Council has different objectives and achievements. As I said last year, when the reports of these three very important Northern Territory Aboriginal land councils were tabled, it is interesting to note that the style and activities of the Tiwi Land Council are quite different from those of the more politicised Northern and Central Land Councils. In their case a number of outside people are more directly involved in their activities. </PARA>
<PARA> The Tiwi people are a much smaller group. They are island contained, on Bathurst and Melville Islands, north of Darwin. They have entered into a number of commercial agreements that are complementary to the Aboriginal lifestyle and the aspirations of Aboriginal people. Because they are able culturally to link together and identify with each other so much more closely than the diverse groups represented by the Northern and Central Land Councils, they are in a position to be much more successful. This probably highlights why breakaway movements are being formed by Aboriginal people throughout the Northern Territory. </PARA>

<PARA>On 6 December 1988 the Senate referred the following matters to the Committee:</PARA>
<PARA>Whether false or misleading evidence was given to a Senate Estimates Committee in relation to the Department of Defence Project known as Project Parakeet, and whether a contempt of the Senate was committed in the giving of that evidence. </PARA>
<PARA>The Committee, having received and considered submissions from Dr M. K. McIntosh and Major-General D.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I support the motion moved by Senator Giles in her capacity as the Chairperson of the Committee of Privileges in presenting the report on this reference on behalf of the Committee. This reference to the Committee arose from a matter which was raised in the Senate on 29 November last year by Senator MacGibbon in remarks he was making on the Appropriation Bill. He focused on certain evidence that was given by the Estimates Committee of which he was a member which had been considering the Estimates for the Department of Defence. The report of that Committee then became part of the discussion on the Appropriation Bill.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator MacGibbon was concerned about the attitude that had been shown to, and the evidence that had been given to, the Committee by a Dr McIntosh, a very senior public servant in charge of capital procurement in the Department of Defence. He is a public servant who has had a great deal of experience in appearing before Estimates committees and, no doubt, other parliamentary committees. His attitude to the Committee could certainly not be construed as the attitude of someone who had little experience of appearing before committees or who was appearing before such a committee for the first time. From his experience of many years of sitting on Estimates committees, particularly in relation to the Department of Defence and certain other departments, Senator MacGibbon also had concerns that there had been a lack of cooperation on the part of many witnesses. Indeed, in his speech in the Senate on 29 November 1988 he quoted his own words spoken on a previous occasion when he said:</PARA>
<PARA> The effect has been that far too many witnesses who have appeared before us have given us answers that are obstructive, evasive and at times misleading . . . </PARA>
<PARA>In his experience this was not the first time that had happened. It had been happening for a long period on many committees, although probably Senator MacGibbon was speaking mainly about his experiences with the public servants appearing on behalf of the Department of Defence. </PARA>
<PARA> The particular problem that gave rise to this reference is set out in the report of the Senate Committee of Privileges which, in appendix 2, incorporates Senator MacGibbon's speech of 29 November. That speech itself incorporates in Hansard the offending passages of the examination of Dr McIntosh. Three senators were questioning Dr McIntosh on Project Parakeet. They wanted to know the true position in the light of a number of press reports which had been made just prior to the hearing of the Estimates Committee on 21 April 1988. Presumably some other information had also been given to the senators. Senator Newman was the first to raise a question about Project Parakeet. She asked:</PARA>
<PARA> Is the contract going ahead?</PARA>
<PARA>Dr McIntosh answered:</PARA>
<PARA> At this stage there are no decisions that would affect additional estimates. </PARA>
<PARA>That is hardly an adequate reply to that question, which was the first on the subject. Then Senator Newman raised the question of whether Project Parakeet was in doubt. Dr McIntosh replied:</PARA>
<PARA> I think that speculation of that kind is premature. </PARA>
<PARA>Again that is hardly an adequate response to a question of whether it was in doubt. In fact, as it turns out now, it was not in doubt. I do not know why Dr McIntosh could not have said so at the time. That drove Senator Newman to make a classic comment on the whole of Dr McIntosh's evidence. She said:</PARA>
<PARA> You make me more suspicious than ever by your answers. </PARA>
<PARA>That sums up the normal reaction of all the senators resulting from their experiences which followed. Senator MacGibbon then asked whether there were considerable technical problems with Parakeet. He was told by Dr McIntosh that that was an overstatement. I ask honourable senators to note that I am simply quoting the actual answers. Those were the answers given. Senator MacGibbon then asked:</PARA>
<PARA> Is it not true that one of the major subcontractors is in difficulty?</PARA>
<PARA>Dr McIntosh replied:</PARA>
<PARA> I think that, too, is an overstatement. </PARA>
<PARA>There was no suggestion about the extent to which that subcontractor may have been in difficulty. Then Senator Newman asked whether the project was way over budget. Dr McIntosh replied:</PARA>
<PARA> At this stage, no. </PARA>
<PARA>As it turned out later there was no evidence that it was over budget at all at that stage. Finally, Senator Newman asked:</PARA>
<PARA> Is it behind schedule?</PARA>
<PARA>Dr McIntosh replied:</PARA>
<PARA> Not significantly, no. </PARA>
<PARA>As it turned out later, it was not behind schedule at that stage, so I do not know what the answer `not significantly, no' means. </PARA>
<PARA> Even more extraordinary were some of the answers given to Senator Hill by Dr McIntosh. Senator Hill asked:</PARA>
<PARA> Are reports in the Press that the project is likely to be reopened for tender untrue?</PARA>
<PARA>Dr McIntosh gave some explanation pointing out that at that time the matter had not gone to tender and the existing contractor who had been performing earlier phases of this project had been asked to provide some estimates. There was no public tender so clearly there was no question of reopening the tender. It was a question of whether the Government intended to accept these offers for the later stage by the contractor. Dr McIntosh explained this and then Senator Hill said-quite correctly in the light of the information:</PARA>
<PARA> So, therefore, reference to having to reopen a tender would appear to be incorrect?</PARA>
<PARA>It was not a question of reopening a tender because no tenders had been called at that stage. To that question Dr McIntosh replied:</PARA>
<PARA> I am sorry; I have not said that at all. </PARA>
<PARA>In these highlights of this interchange between the three senators and Dr McIntosh we have a very clear picture and the tasty flavour of the sort of examination that went on. In the light of this, I am not at all surprised that Senator MacGibbon complained about this matter, raised it in the Senate and referred it to the Committee of Privileges. As it subsequently turned out in the later Estimates Committee, there had been some unsatisfactory features of this contractor and the Government had decided to give him away and call tenders. That was the stage, six months later, at which Senator MacGibbon raised the matter and it was referred to the Privileges Committee. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe, as Senator Giles has said, if fuller information had been given to the Estimates Committee and Dr McIntosh's approach to the Estimates Committee had been the same as it was to the Committee of Privileges, apart from one qualification-and Dr McIntosh's submission to the Committee of Privileges and a statement by Major-General Francis, who was also a witness before the Estimates Committee, are set out in Appendix 3-I am sure that the Estimates Committee would have been satisfied. Clearly, by the time the matters came before the Committee of Privileges, indeed at the time the matter came before the second Estimates Committee, the problem which was apparently bothering Dr McIntosh-namely, that the Department had put a submission to the Minister that a new contractor should be found for the latter phase and that tenders should be opened-would have been alleviated. I am sure that Senator MacGibbon, Senator Hill and Senator Newman would not suggest that the recommendation that the Department gave the Minister should have been given to the Estimates Committee. We recognise that committees do not have that information given to them, nor would a public servant be pre-empting a Minister, as Dr McIntosh puts forward in his defence, but the situation as it was at the time with the contractor could have been fully explained without giving the information as to what was the Department's advice to the Minister, or indeed what was the Department's attitude to the contractor. It was simply a matter of indicating the factual background at that time, and not fending off questions in the way in which Dr McIntosh did. In his submission to the Privileges Committee Dr McIntosh said:</PARA>
<PARA> It is also the practice that officials at the hearings respond to questions from Senators on detailed Explanatory Notes on the Estimates and an opening statement, rather than volunteer information in a more seminar style. If questions are not asked, it is presumed that Senators do not require further information on that item or aspect of the Estimates. </PARA>
<PARA>Certainly there were plenty of questions asked by senators, and they made it quite clear that they were not getting enough information. Therefore, I do not know how that statement applies. Dr McIntosh went on in his submission:</PARA>
<PARA> While a less formal approach is sometimes adopted, and obviously Senators wanted any or all information they could get on the Parakeet project, it would clearly have been inappropriate for officials to volunteer information and comment in a sensitive area yet to be decided by Government. </PARA>
<PARA>This was not a question of their having to volunteer information or comment on a sensitive area. It was simply a matter of giving senators facts which they were entitled to have and which they could quite simply have been given without the public servant having to comment on a sensitive area to be decided by government. </PARA>
<PARA> I am rather concerned to read the view of a senior public servant that public servants do not have to volunteer information to a parliamentary committee or an Estimates committee. If it is clear that senators are confused in some way about some aspect of information they have been given, or if clearly they have not received as much information as they want, which was the case here, I think that it is up to public servants to be prepared to volunteer information to try to clear up misunderstandings. That is what the process is all about. If it is to work satisfactorily, as by and large it has done over the years, public servants must have a much more forthcoming attitude than that adopted by Dr McIntosh in the proceedings to which I have referred-certainly a more forthcoming attitude than the view he expressed in his submission to the Committee of Privileges. </PARA>
<PARA> I hope that, this matter having been referred to the Privileges Committee, and closer examination having been given to it, as was required of the Committee in order to make a judgment as to whether there had been a contempt by Dr McIntosh in these matters, this will be used beneficially in the future and that public servants will not put themselves in a position where they are suspected of hiding something from a committee and thereby suspected of misleading a committee. Clearly that would be a contempt. It is a fine line to draw in many cases between deliberate misleading and giving technically correct answers. Even in this case it is clear that Dr McIntosh was giving technically correct answers, but giving rise to concerns that information was being withheld beyond what was necessary, desirable or justifiable. Public servants in that position should err on the side of providing as much information as they can, subject to the clear prohibitions on them pre-empting decisions of Ministers or giving evidence about that advice they have given to Ministers. </PARA>
<PARA> There was no reason why at these hearings information could not have been volunteered about the actual state of play with this contractor. There had been some technical problems, and they were ironed out later as it turned out. There had been some problems with the management of the company, but apparently those also were ironed out. The whole question revolved around the costs quoted by the company for the later stages. For that reason the Government decided to reopen tenders and those have not been finalised. All that background, issues as to whether the project was in doubt, whether there had been technical problems, whether the contractors were in difficulty, and whether the project was to be significantly delayed are all questions on which Dr McIntosh could have been far more forthcoming, so that this whole exercise could have been avoided. I seek leave to continue my remarks later. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I was speaking last Friday on the amendments moved by Senator Macklin. Since then I have received via the Treasury some advice from the Office of Parliamentary Counsel which says, among other things:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In general the amendments are in danger of being outside the scope of the long title. </PARA>
<PARA>I do not want to place too much importance on that; I just put it on the record that, because the proposed amendments refer to other Acts, there is some doubt at least as to whether they are technically in order. I dealt last Friday with the degree to which matters are reported in general by the Treasurer under the 1947 legislation. I was dealing with the Australian Democrats' third amendment, regarding the annual report. The first couple of paragraphs of that amendment are fairly innocuous. However, paragraph (c) of proposed new clause 7 (2) requires the report given by the Treasurer to include the following:</PARA>
<PARA>an assessment of the activities and effectiveness of the Bank and the affiliates, including their activities and effectiveness in relation to:</PARA>
<PARA> (i) the alleviation of poverty;</PARA>
<PARA> (ii) the prevention of damage to the environment; and</PARA>
<PARA> (iii) obtaining, and taking into account, the views and needs of indigenous peoples . . . </PARA>
<PARA>The objective behind it is pretty clear-to extend social engineering on a global scale-but it is fatuous to suggest that any report, even one which had substantive content, on matters which are subject to such extremely subjective judgments would be worth anything. For those reasons, as well as the reasons I put on the record last Friday, the Government will not accept the amendments. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The proposition that Senator Walsh has put up is interesting inasmuch as the second reading debate on the Bill canvassed these issues fairly extensively. I do not wish to go back over all of it; I merely mention the fact that neither the United States Congress nor the World Bank agrees with Senator Walsh's views. For example, before the Congress at the moment is a Bill entitled `A Bill to seek the eradication of the worst aspects of poverty in developing countries by the year 2000', which has been signed by 155 House members. Senator Walsh made a point about subjectiveness. It is rather interesting that clause 2, `Specified Goals', on page 5 of that Bill says:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>Among the goals included in the plan developed pursuant to subsection (a) shall be the following:</PARA>
<PARA> (A) UNDER-FIVE-MORTALITY-RATE . . . </PARA>
<PARA>It then goes through the various levels that it is seeking to obtain in the countries that are provided with aid from the United States of America. It continues:</PARA>
<PARA> (B) FEMALE LITERACY RATE . . . </PARA>
<PARA>Again, it outlines the levels it seeks to achieve. It seeks a female literacy rate of 80 per cent by the year 2000. It continues:</PARA>
<PARA> (C) ABSOLUTE POVERTY LEVEL-For a country having 40 per cent or less of its population below the absolute poverty level in 1985, reducing that percentage by 50 per cent by the year 2000. For a country having greater than 40 per cent of the population below the absolute poverty level, reducing that percentage to no more than 20 per cent by the year 2000. </PARA>
<PARA> (D) ECOLOGICAL SUSTAINABILITY . . . </PARA>
<PARA>It then goes on to something quite pertinent to the amendment I am raising, and in publication of the plan-Paragraph (L) it states:</PARA>
<PARA> ANNUAL REPORTS-Not later than 1 February each year, the President shall submit a report to the Congress detailing progress toward achieving the goals established in the plan developed pursuant to subsection (a). The report should specify, for each activity carried out pursuant to the plan, how that activity is expected to reach one or more of the goals established pursuant to subsection (c). </PARA>
<PARA>In other words, other people around the world do not happen to think the attack on poverty is necessarily as subjective as does Senator Walsh. I refer to the last annual report of the World Bank itself. The 1988 annual report, on page 41, referring to poverty alleviation, says:</PARA>
<PARA>Poverty alleviation has long been, and continues to be, central to the Bank's work. </PARA>
<PARA>It sees that as fundamental. As I suggested in the second reading debate, the World Bank itself has developed a number of procedures for dealing quite specifically with the alleviation of poverty and believes that that ought to be the central criterion on which the effectiveness of the World Bank is judged. That is, it believes it should make a judgment on itself. With respect to the environmental protection aspect, on page 43 of the World Bank's annual report it is stated:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . efforts are being made to identify projects, which, while meeting the criteria of economic growth and poverty alleviation, directly address environmental issues or ease the problems of environmental management . . . </PARA>
<PARA>The third point I raised in my amendment concerns indigenous peoples. A document I mentioned in my second reading remarks, entitled Environment and Development: Implementing the World Bank's New Policies, published in July 1988, talks of the importance of forging closer links with non-government organisations in countries in receipt of assistance because, amongst other things, they better allow the bank to take into account the needs of indigenous peoples. </PARA>
<PARA> We say that this Parliament, similar to the United States Congress and in line with the intentions expressed as late as the middle of last year by the World Bank itself, should focus on those three issues. The point of our amendment is to ensure that Australia's ongoing representatives on the Executive Board in Washington and Australia's representative on the Board of Governors, the Treasurer, support and encourage the bank's works in these areas. We believe that it is necessary, in terms of any further items in this Bill, to provide to this Parliament information that will enable us to monitor what Australia has been saying and doing in the World Bank with regard to these particular items. I understand the sensitivity of Treasury and other bureaucracies about sharing with the Parliament the information that they have, but I think this is one occasion, in view of the number of signatures from members of the Opposition and the Government on precisely these issues, on which the Parliament is entitled to this type of information. </PARA>
<PARA> As I mentioned before in referring to the International Monetary Agreements Act, the Treasurer's annual report provides none of this information. It has not been provided to date and I see no reason why it should not be provided in the future. It would specifically address that arm of the World Bank, or the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development, with which this Bill is concerned. That is what we are seeking. We are seeking to find out the response of the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development to Australia's move to back up what is now the undoubted policy of the World Bank in this area. It is perfectly in accordance with the Act and the processes of this Parliament that we should have that type of information. From what we have been able to discover, that information is held by Treasury. If it is held by Treasury, it should be a simple matter to inform the Parliament of such so that next time a Bill appears requesting further assistance for the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development we will be in a position to make an informed judgment about what has happened in the year or two since the passing of the Bill before us tonight. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to speak on a rather narrow point that arises out of that portion of the amendment moved by the Australian Democrats calling for an annual report to be presented. I have no problem with the call for a report. I think there is already provision under a much earlier Act for a report to be issued. However, the report required here would be a much more detailed one. Subparagraph (c) of proposed new clause (7) in Senator Macklin's amendment calls on the Treasurer to present in this report:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>an assessment of the activities and effectiveness of the Bank and the affiliates-</PARA>
<PARA>that is, the International Development Association and the International Finance Corporation-</PARA>
<PARA>-including their activities and effectiveness in relation to:</PARA>
<PARA> (i) the alleviation of poverty;</PARA>
<PARA> (ii) the prevention of damage to the environment; and</PARA>
<PARA> (iii) obtaining, and taking into account, the views and needs of indigenous peoples,</PARA>
<PARA>in countries affected by the activities of the Bank and the affiliates.''. </PARA>
<PARA>With all respect to the views of those who run around the world depicting the World Bank as a new moloch devouring, through its activities, the resources of the world in the interests of some kind of international capitalism-or other figment of the tortured imaginations of the people in question-the truth of the matter is that the World Bank is a very successful and, in my opinion, notwithstanding some criticisms I have, very responsible international financial assistance agency. Notwithstanding the highly coloured accounts which one receives about the President of the World Bank being personally responsible for the greenhouse effect which, if we are not provident and careful, is about to overwhelm us in the next six months, or because of the bank's activities in Brazil or elsewhere, the facts, as distinct from the figments of these people's imaginations, are that the World Bank is getting on with what it is required to do by its charter. Australia is a member of the institution and subscribes to that charter. The charter states that the bank should help to provide development assistance, in one form or another, to most of the developing country members of the bank. </PARA>
<PARA> Firstly, if the bank is successful in that objective-and I regard it as being, with some qualifications, certainly successful-it is by definition contributing to `the alleviation of poverty', which is the first subset of Senator Macklin's demands for this report to focus upon. On the question of the second of the matters listed, namely, the prevention of damage to the environment, it is obviously true that the processes of economic development do inevitably, to some degree, conflict with the total preservation, or conservation, of the previously existing environment. That fact is not in debate. The only question in the perpetual debates that rage on this subject is-and always has been-whether the contribution which is thereby made in order to enhance the lot of the peoples of the developing countries concerned outweighs, in terms of human happiness the inevitable damage to the environment which is caused by, for example, the damming of a river in Brazil, or the clearing of some land for a major road, or perhaps the planting of crops where previously none were grown. </PARA>
<PARA> However distressing that fact may be to the people who are rich enough to take their holidays to these far-flung, romantic and relatively savage places, the truth of the matter is that that is not the chief concern of the World Bank. The chief concern of the World Bank is the alleviation of the lot of the peoples who presently have to live in these places and present themselves for the cameras of the passing tourists. While much may be said about the damage to the environment in these places, we should bear firmly in mind that any damage to the environment is incidental to what the governments and the people of those countries have as a more important objective, namely, the raising of their desperately low standard of living. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, the third head of demand put forward in subparagraph (c) of Senator Macklin's amendment is that the report which the Treasurer of the day has been called on to make-I suspect it will not be the current Treasurer (Mr Keating) by the time the amendment becomes effective-should take into account the views and needs of indigenous peoples. The mind boggles at the thought of the Treasurer of the Commonwealth somehow taking independent action to ascertain how the World Bank's activities and effectiveness measure up against the objective of obtaining and taking into account the views and needs of indigenous peoples in countries affected by the activities of the bank and the affiliates. What is the Treasurer to do? Is he to pay a personal visit to the jungles of the Amazon? I know that, to the Australian Democrats, public moneys are of no account; but is the Treasurer supposed to send an expensive mission to be led by, for example, Colonel Sanders on my left here? Is he to come back and present to the Treasurer a report as ill informed as his reports to this Parliament normally are on other matters, particularly environmental matters?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;No, I am not getting angry in the least. Senator Sanders is not worth getting angry about. I want to point out the extraordinary ineffectiveness, or pointlessness, of the third head of the amendment. I can see a case for saying it would be possible for the Treasurer to report on the first two points-the World Bank's activities in relation to the alleviation of poverty and the prevention of damage to the environment, although there may be many problems with the second point-but the last point, `obtaining, and taking into account, the views and needs of indigenous peoples', has nothing to do with anything other than the fact that it happened to be a fad running in the newspapers and, as so often occurs, the Australian Democrats picked it up and ran with it. That is their wont; that is what finally gave them their comeuppance in the Australian Capital Territory election last Saturday. If the election had no other beneficial result, at least it showed the due esteem in which the Australian Democrats are held by the people of the Australian Capital Territory. The Democrats got 1.3 per cent of the vote.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The National Party has never made a strong pitch for representation in a town of public servants and is never likely to. Let me get back to the more clear purpose of my remarks; that is to say that, notwithstanding some of the things I have been saying about the Australian Democrats, I would have hoped for, and indeed expected Senator Macklin to accept the fact that what he is calling on the Treasurer of the Commonwealth to do is something which is not really sensibly within his power to do as far as subparagraph (iii) is concerned.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> So far as subparagraph (i) is concerned, it can tell us nothing other than what it does. Of course the activity of the World Bank has been useful and constructive in the cause of the alleviation of poverty. So far as subparagraph (ii) is concerned-the prevention of damage to the environment-of course there has been some damage to the environment and there is bound to be always when the process of economic development occurs. The only question is, at the risk of repeating myself, whether or not in the judgment of reasonable people, and particularly the judgment of the peoples of the countries concerned who are the ones most affected by this after all-not, as I said, the passing parade of American millionaires or other millionaires who want to go down and take photographs of the place-that damage to the environment is more than outweighed by the improvement in the standards of living of the people who have to live in those countries. </PARA>
<PARA> I simply want to say before I conclude that I have no problem at all with the greater part of the amendment proposed by the Democrats, but as to paragraph (c), I strongly say that this is simply an appeal in the best populist Democrat tradition; namely, the kind of thing which they think will get them a headline or two or will enhance their standing with some particular interest group or other of a marginal kind. I do not believe that it would be sensible to support this particular subparagraph of the amendment. I am perfectly happy, for myself at any rate, to support the amendment for the most part, but I think that subparagraph (ii) paragraph (c) is a nonsense. I do not think the Parliament should be enacting nonsenses. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;During the debate last Friday when we were winding up fairly quickly at the end, I drew the attention of the Minister for Finance (Senator Walsh) to the existence of the International Monetary Agreements Act 1947 which I understood required the Government to report to the Parliament about the operations of the World Bank from time to time. In his response, which admittedly was under pressure of time as we got close to Question Time, I do not think he had the opportunity fully to develop all the points that were relevant to the debate. For that reason, I would like to just ask him again whether he has had the opportunity to scan the last few minutes of the Hansard of Friday to see whether the issues that were covered in the Australian Democrats' amendment which we are now discussing are part of the requirements to be reported under that rather old Act. That point did not emerge, I do not think, in the course of Senator Walsh's remarks last Friday. It is now that assurance that I am seeking his advice about.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thought I did deal with that matter on Friday, although I have not had a look at the Hansard. Further to the Treasury note from which I quoted fairly extensively on Friday, I now have here the most recent 1987-88 report under the International Monetary Agreements Act 1947 to which I referred. Just inside the flyleaf, it states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Under section 10 of the International Monetary Agreements Act 1947, the Treasurer is required to prepare and cause to be laid before each House of the Parliament, as soon as practicable after the end of each financial year, a report on the operations of the Act and of the operations in so far as they relate to Australia of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD) during the financial year. This report in respect of the financial year 1987-88 is presented accordingly. </PARA>
<PARA>In other words, apart from the question I raised about the possible technical defectiveness of all the amendments that have been moved, the Government's position is that while the amendments are at best superfluous-that is, amendments (i) and (ii)-amendment (iii) is I think, as Senator Stone has demonstrated more amply than I did, really rather absurd. If the Senate decides to press this amendment and pass it, it will not be at all difficult I suppose for somebody in the Treasury to write that he has done this sort of an assessment. He could say, `But we came to the conclusion that it is too hard and we cannot really report anything meaningful'. That really would not do much harm, I do not suppose, except to make a bit of a laughing stock of the Senate for having passed such an amendment in the first place. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to make a contribution. Before I do so, I refer to a point that was made by Senator Macklin and a response made by Senator Walsh. As I understood it, Senator Macklin was indicating that it was of considerable importance that the activities and effectiveness of the bank be considered against the background as to whether its activities were alleviating poverty. I was not actually impressed with the response by the Minister for Finance (Senator Walsh) in respect of that matter.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I remind the Minister that the former Australian Foreign Minister, Bill Hayden, subtly criticised the World Bank's loan conditionality. I will quote from a special survey of the World Bank IMF. The article is entitled `The World Bank sticks to its guns' in Triple A of September 1988. I will not make any comment about the journal one way or the other because that is not appropriate during this debate. Quoting Bill Hayden, it stated:</PARA>
<PARA> World Bank lending to support structural adjustment in developing countries has caused controversy. Although the adoption of appropriate policies is necessary if a country is to develop, the poor can be hurt in the process . . . </PARA>
<PARA>I think that is a matter which the Committee is attempting to focus its attention upon. I also refer to comments that were made in the World Development Report 1988 which is a study of major development issues written by the staff of the World Bank. It has a short article on the World Bank's evolving role in public expenditure reviews. It was citing studies which document the higher lifetime productivity of workers and which suggested that health investments improve `the productivity of labour force'. </PARA>
<PARA> From my trade union background, I raise that as a real query as to whether the focus of its health investments is to improve the productivity of the labour force. I am not saying that that is precisely what the World Bank is on about, but I am indicating that this report did cite those studies. I consider it most important to establish a major principle-that is, that development must always centre on humans, the dignity of the human being and human rights. Any development that goes against that principle is just not authentic development, and ultimately not only will cause direct problems to the individuals in developing countries but will also have a backlash against those countries that are the highest contributors to the World Bank, namely, the Western countries. It would be easy and correct to suggest that any development that did not uphold that major principle would really be an attempt at neo-imperialism. </PARA>
<PARA> In saying that, I do not wish to canvass the issues which were canvassed at the second reading stage. I only regret that I was not here on Friday at the second reading stage. Frankly, I had expected the second reading stage to have continued today. I wish to focus on Senator Macklin's amendment, which has a number of points about it. It states:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . the Treasurer shall prepare and cause to be laid before each House of the Parliament a report on the operations of this Act during that financial year. </PARA>
<PARA>It also states that there should be:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) a statement of the terms and conditions of any agreement or agreements made by the Treasurer;</PARA>
<PARA> (b) a statement describing the nature and extent of Australia's participation as a member of the Bank and the affiliates during that year;</PARA>
<PARA> (c) an assessment of the activities and effectiveness of the Bank and the affiliates, including their activities and effectiveness in relation to:</PARA>
<PARA> (i) the alleviation of poverty;</PARA>
<PARA> (ii) the prevention of damage to the environment; and</PARA>
<PARA> (iii) obtaining, and taking into account, the views and needs of indigenous peoples. </PARA>
<PARA>I think it is common ground around the chamber that such a specific report should be laid before the Houses of Parliament. As honourable senators would know, there has been concern about damage to the environment. I have touched upon the first matter-that is to say, the alleviation of poverty-and I have indicated that, as the World Bank is one of the major, if not the major, multilateral providers of funds, it should have regard to that principle of authentic development that I enunciated earlier. </PARA>
<PARA> As we all know, there has been considerable worldwide discussion about the prevention of damage to the environment and the World Bank has addressed itself to that question. Indeed, in its annual report of 1988 it refers to a paper on environmental activities which was developed in 1987. That paper, entitled Environment, Growth and Development, was prepared by the bank for submission to the Development Committee at its meeting in Washington, DC. It is interesting to note what is in this paper. The 1988 annual report of the World Bank had this to say about the paper:</PARA>
<PARA>It-</PARA>
<PARA>namely, the paper-</PARA>
<PARA>stressed both the importance of addressing environmental issues in the context of overall economic policy, rather than simply by concern with individual projects, and the overriding importance of the effects of rapid population growth. </PARA>
<PARA>That comment attempts to obscure some of the legitimate concerns about particular projects which were environmentally unsound and seeks to lump it all on the effects of rapid population growth. We have seen too much of that go unchallenged in the international sphere. We have seen it at international conferences, without analysing the very strong academic and economic arguments that have been advanced to the effect that the problem is not rapid population growth but real structural problems that developing countries have, both internally and in the management of their foreign debt. Because of time constraints I cannot refer to a number of the quite erudite papers that have examined that question and found that this sort of glib reference to rapid population growth as being the main problem has been addressed and demolished.</PARA>
<PARA> It is important to know what the third point that has been made in Senator Macklin's amendment means. Paragraph (iii) states:</PARA>
<PARA>obtaining, and taking into account, the views and needs of indigenous people. </PARA>
<PARA>I go to this question of human rights. I went to the Philippines last year. A great deal of concern was expressed both in non-government and in official circles about the arm twisting that is done by the World Bank in an attempt to impose population control methods which are unacceptable to the people of those countries. I also refer to a scheme that the World Bank has now entered into, that is, the HRP program-the human reproduction program-which is developing abortion drugs, chemical weapons to be used against the unborn. I believe that we should be seriously concerned about this and also acknowledge the dangers of any policies which would give sustenance to the types of population control policies for example, in China and in some very near neighbours, which amount to a denial of human rights. I would like to be assured that the Government will take that on board. I am not sure whether that is what is meant by this third point in the amendment:</PARA>
<PARA>obtaining, and taking into account, the views and needs of indigenous peoples.</PARA>
<PARA>I would like the Minister to explain again, as I was not too clear on what he just said in response to Senator Messner, whether a report along these lines is required to be tabled in the Parliament and whether it would deal with it in such specific terms. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is not a science, as Senator Stone said. Economics is not regarded as a friend of the earth. Economic progress destroys and modifies natural environments. It makes the quality of the environment a dispensable item in the pursuit of `rising living standards'. We hear a lot about how we would like to maintain our living standards. A lot of people on this earth simply want to live. They simply want to survive. I would like to quote from a New Scientist article dated 7 July 1988 entitled `Sustained hope for development'. It says:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>It is more or less official: much of the activity we call development destroys the topsoil, fresh water, atmospheric systems and genetic resources upon which human progress must be based. It is hard to say just when it became official. Perhaps it happened in London on the night of 3 March, when David Hopper, vice president of the World Bank for policy, planning and research, explained how and why the bank often spent large sums to ruin good agricultural land. </PARA>
<PARA>This is not a greenie organisation. He is an official of the World Bank itself. The article goes on:</PARA>
<PARA> Hopper worked for 10 years as an anthropologist and agriculturalist in India. He realised that irrigating land without installing drainage would inevitably create a salty swamp. Then he became a vice president of the World Bank, with responsibility for projects in South Asia. One of the first schemes he was asked to approve was for irrigation without drainage. He said no. His staff patiently explained to the new boy that because the land was already highly productive, the added cost of putting in drains meant that the project would fail the bank's test of a return of 10 per cent on investment. Besides, the Government receiving the aid was keen on the project. Hopper approved it. </PARA>
<PARA>Hopper approved it in spite of his own opinion and expertise. The article went on:</PARA>
<PARA> Hopper said this incident shows that: ``The accepted economic justification for proceeding with the investment was certain to lead to a degrading of the resource base, and there was no acceptable justification for protecting those resources from destruction''. Hopper was letting this particular cat out of the World Bank's bag, but in doing so he was damning what he called ``the anomaly of economic calculus'' that governs the decisions of all aid agencies and the world's ministers of agriculture, forestry, fisheries and so on. </PARA>
<PARA> Planners and economists often fail to open their spread-sheets wide enough to cover the consequences of development. First, they cannot deal with the value of resources not defined by the market: trees that protect a tropical watershed, or an ozone layer that protects a planet. Secondly, they ``discount'' future values, though common sense tells us that the future value of an intact tropical forest-in terms of timber, genetic resources, water and stable climate-will be no less in the future than now. Thus many developing nations overfarm their land to export commodities to the North. </PARA>
<PARA>That means the Northern Hemisphere. To continue:</PARA>
<PARA> In doing so they are subsidising the North's purchase of their already cheap commodities by assuming the cost of restoring the lands themselves. Botswana is destroying its grasslands to produce cheap beef for Europe. Botswana, not Europe, will pay the cost of this destruction. </PARA>
<PARA> A stronger, more official description of this syndrome came from the World Commission on Environment and Development (WCED). Headed by Gro Harlem Bruntland, the prime minister of Norway, it reached its conclusions only after three years of hearings in five continents at an expense of $6 million. The commission decided that: ``Many forms of development erode the environmental resources upon which they must be based, and environmental degradation can undermine economic development''. </PARA>
<PARA>It goes on and on. We can all quote horror stories about how development has actually degraded the lives of those whose lives it was meant to develop. It may in fact enrich the lives of the `haves' in a poor third world nation because of the trickle down effect; the money goes to the top and very little of it reaches the bottom. When it does it is often in an environmentally hazardous way that does not take any account of the indigenous people. They never ask the people what they want or how best to give it to them. Over and over again we hear of cases where the World Bank furnishes a crop or an agricultural system which, if it had asked the local people, it would have found completely unsuitable. But they never ask the local people. What we are saying in this amendment is, `Let us, at least in Australia, have a mechanism where the local people are considered and asked whether (a) they want the development; (b) will it be a good development; and (c) will it affect their own ways of doing things; their way of life'. That is all this amendment does.</PARA>
<PARA> I find it absolutely shameful that senators in this chamber argue against such a development because it means that they do not care about the people of the world who are less fortunate than us. They simply want to go along, churning out their reports in a way which would exclude the indigenous people. I urge support for this amendment. I hope that the Government will see fit to support it. I certainly hope that the Government will also take a good hard look at its responsibilities towards the less fortunate peoples of the world. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;One of the depressing things about these types of debates is that, fairly obviously, the Minister and others do not bother to listen to the second reading debates. I had always assumed that the second reading debates were taken as basic to the types of amendments that one may wish to move during the committee stages. In looking at this amendment and responding, in particular, to Senator Stone's comments, it is rather fascinating-I developed some of these points during my speech in the second reading debate-that the material that is provided to Treasury already happens to include elements with regard to these three proposed new paragraphs.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I also referred in my speech during the second reading debate to documents that the World Bank has produced. I quoted from them again a little while ago-that is, The World Bank's Support for the Alleviation of Poverty, published in June 1988, and Environment and Development: Implementing the World Bank's New Policies, published in July last year. It is interesting that the World Bank has moved in this direction. It is seeking to take into account those three proposed new paragraphs quite specifically in terms of its funding mechanisms. Senator Stone waved his arms around and made unfounded allegations, but these are not things that the Australian Democrats picked up. In fact, we picked them up by reading World Bank documents. They were the bank's ideas as at the middle of last year. I find it extraordinary that people pay absolutely no attention to a second reading debate in this place and do not do their homework; yet they then come in here and relieve themselves of their prejudices. In quoting extensively from the various documents, it was fairly easy to show that the three items are ones on which the World Bank makes an assessment and now informs our Treasury about. So the material is already provided to us. The material is in our hands, but we need to provide it to the Parliament. Naturally enough, the Government is simply saying `We don't want to tell Parliament anything'. But there is nothing new in that. </PARA>
<PARA> I am not alone in my view. As I suggested before, over 100 members of both Houses of the Parliament, including a number of people who are in here at the moment-Senator Messner was among them-signed the letters referring quite specifically to three items, which are covered by the three paragraphs in my amendment. The letters are in the Hansard record. Senator Hill, who is a shadow Minister, was one of the main instigators in collecting signatures for the letters. Senator Teague, who is in here at the moment, and Senator Harradine signed the letters. The three specified items to which I refer are not new. They have been around for two years and have exercised the independent interest of honourable senators. In fact, the terminology in my amendment was taken specifically from the letters signed by people on whom Senator Stone has just launched scathing criticism. I do not know whether his front bench colleagues appreciated that type of attack. I suppose they can discuss that themselves. It needs to be made very clear that if those members of this chamber, from all political parties, who signed the letters vote against this amendment, they will be repudiating their signatures on the letters. It comes down simply to asking that the material which is currently provided by the World Bank to the Treasury be provided to us in accordance with each of the proposed paragraphs. While Senator Stone reluctantly accepted the first and second paragraphs, he refused to accept the third and said that this was some interesting recent fad. </PARA>
<PARA> Debates on matters such as this manage to maintain a reasonably high tone for a while. In fact, I re-read Senator Alston's and Senator Watson's speeches at the second reading stage. They made excellent contributions. There had been detailed research, they had gone back to the original documents and they had troubled to do their homework. Both those people referred quite specifically to the type of support that is necessary from this chamber to enable our Government to put pressure on the World Bank to look at each of those items. </PARA>

Unless we express our views clearly as to where we believe we should be going with these paragraphs, particularly the one which he rejects totally, we will be in great difficulty. The non-government organisations are playing a very interesting, new and quite innovative and constructive role with regard to indigenous peoples. The World Bank in its most recent documents has expressed a lot more concern about that area. It is of concern to all aid and development agencies. It is not something apart from the alleviation of poverty or environmental degradation. As I attempted to show in my second reading contribution, the paragraphs of the amendment are bound together. They are not separate items; they are part and parcel of the new policies enunciated in the document Environment and Development: Implementing the World Bank's New Policies of July last year. That is an excellent document which shows the way ahead.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Last Thursday when we first started discussing this legislation at the second reading stage, I drew attention on behalf of the Opposition to the Opposition's commitment to the humanitarian objectives of the World Bank in the development of better standards of living for those in lesser developed countries. Indeed, that remains the objective of the Liberal and National parties in our general support for the legislation. However, we did say that there were problems of accountability in respect of the way in which the World Bank in its various arms goes about its business of alleviating poverty throughout the world. Questions have been raised not only in this country but in the United States, as Senator Macklin pointed out, and the bank itself about the effectiveness and the accountability of the various arms of the World Bank in distributing funds. Those are vital matters on behalf of the Australian people.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> A question of accountability is involved here. Senator Macklin's amendment, for the greater part, points strongly to that. The only point of contention before the Committee tonight is paragraph (c) of proposed sub-clause (2) of his amendment, which refers to specific matters which are to be the subject-if the amendment is carried-of report by the Treasurer to the Houses of Parliament. I regret to say that, although I have asked the Minister, Senator Walsh, twice about the application of the International Monetary Agreements Act 1947 and the requirements upon the Government to report subject to that Act, we still are not clear whether or not the Act spells out the specific requirement on the Government to report on the matters mentioned in proposed new paragraph 7 (2) (c)--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have quoted from the report issued annually pursuant to the International Monetary Agreements Act. I do not have a copy of the IMA Act here, so I cannot tell honourable senators what section 10 says precisely as to whether such matters must be reported, but I would be surprised if it were particularly close to the wording of the amendment proposed by the Australian Democrats to clause 7. I leave aside the arguable technical defectiveness of the Democrats' amendments because they exceed the scope of the long title. The Government's view at best is that these amendments are superfluous-or at least, in so far as the amendments mean anything, they are superfluous, particularly the first two of them. The third amendment is, I believe, also superfluous in proposed new subclauses (1), (2) (a) and (2) (b).</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Subclause (2) (c) is so nebulous that I suggest that it means anything or nothing, depending on the preferences of who chooses to interpret it. It certainly does not say, as Senator Macklin suggested, that the Treasurer will provide to the Parliament some information provided to Treasury by the Reserve Bank. What it says-this is not a continuous quotation-is that the Treasurer shall prepare and cause to be laid before each House of the Parliament a report which shall include the effectiveness of the programs of the bank and its affiliates in the alleviation of poverty. I suppose that one could have a stab in the dark; one could probably get somebody to argue that the bank's program was very effective in relieving poverty and somebody else to argue that it had not been. Indeed, we have had that sort of argument tonight, I suggest, between Senator Harradine and the Democrats. So honourable senators can see how meaningful any report which purported to give a definitive evaluation of whether a particular program had been effective in relieving poverty would be. </PARA>
<PARA> Proposed new subclause (2) (c) mentions the prevention of damage to the environment. There is little economic development which does not change the environment. Whether it damages the environment or not is again, to a large degree, a subjective judgment. Proposed new subclause (2) (c) mentions obtaining and taking into account the views and needs of indigenous peoples. So, according to the literal interpretation of this amendment, the Treasurer is required to obtain the views of indigenous people and take them into account. </PARA>
<PARA> As I said before, I do not believe that it would be hard for some class 9 clerk, or even a class 1 clerk, in the Treasury to comply with the letter of this amendment should it be incorporated into the Act. But whether such a report, in compliance with the letter of the Act, were written by a clerk class 1-the newest clerical recruit-or the Secretary to the Treasury, would not, I suggest, make much difference to its value because it would deal with matters which are so nebulous that to report on them, and purport that that report is a definitive report, is quite absurd. But if the Senate wants to pass the amendment, it will not in my view create any insuperable barriers-anything that cannot be dealt with. But I repeat: I regard the whole exercise as absurd and a waste of the Committee's time. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the Minister for Finance (Senator Walsh) for his response. I have now obtained a copy of the International Monetary Agreements Act 1947. Article 1 of the first schedule of the Act sets down the purposes of the International Monetary fund quite clearly. Paragraph (ii) of the first article reads as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>To facilitate the expansion and balanced growth of international trade, and to contribute thereby to the promotion and maintenance of high levels of employment and real income and to the development of the productive resources of all members as primary objectives of economy policy. </PARA>
<PARA>Quite clearly, the first subparagraph of the Democrat amendment, which refers to the alleviation of poverty, is covered by the purposes as set down in the schedule to the Act under which the Government is required to report to the Parliament. It seems to us that that point is well and truly covered, as revealed in the Government's argument. </PARA>
<PARA> The second and third subparagraphs of proposed new subclause (2) (c) go to questions of the environment and also to the need to obtain and take into account the views and needs of indigenous peoples. In respect of damage to the environment, we have observed that reporting procedures are available through other sources. It was made clear to us by Senator Macklin in the debate that information of this kind is available. It seems to me that the matter is also covered by the general principles of proper management and efficiency of the bank in carrying out its economic objectives. Clearly, the matter would find its way into a proper reporting procedure by the Government within the terms of the original Act. </PARA>
<PARA> The views and needs of indigenous peoples obviously are the subject of agreement and debate at the time when the World Bank enters into development arrangements with the nations to which it will offer assistance. Clearly, proposed new subparagraph (2) (c) (iii) would be encompassed by the general purpose of the Act. The specific reporting requirement provides, in the most general of terms, a means by which information could be provided to the Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> We have a further amendment which was designed to fit in with the Democrat amendment and to draw attention to the fact that there is a need for assessment of the bank's managerial efficiency and financial and economic effectiveness in carrying out the purposes as set down in the article from which I have just quoted. Our amendment covers the very points I have just been describing. I move:</PARA>
<PARA> Proposed paragraph 7 (2) (c), insert the following paragraphs:</PARA>
<PARA> ``(c) an assessment of the managerial efficiency, and financial and economic effectiveness, of the Bank in carrying out its purposes as provided for in Article 1 of the Articles of Agreement set out in Schedule 2 to the International Monetary Agreements Act 1947;</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Under those circumstances the Government regards these amendments as being superfluous, but the amendment circulated by Senator Messner does give some focus to the far more nebulous propositions that were in the original amendments. The Government will support Senator Messner's amendment to the original amendment, but we will not support the amended amendment. However, I gather from Senator Messner's comments the Opposition senators will support it. Under those circumstances, and should that be correct, I will not bother to call a division.

<PARA> I do not intend repeating what has been debated at some length. At the second reading stage, I raised the question of the International Monetary Fund Act annual report last year and discussed it in some detail. If honourable senators had bothered reading it they would know that not only has this Government not reported on those items, but also neither has any previous government. The only item in this particular annual report that is anywhere near it is the inclusion of some communiques of the International Monetary Fund and the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development governors. Those communiques, of course, are compressed documents that obviously express a carefully worded approach after a lot of work has been done behind the scenes. They do not spell out the type of thing that we were looking for by way of our amendment. It was not provided last year; it was not provided the year before and nor has it been provided since 1947. There is no reason why it would be now. This is the only chance that this Parliament would have to enforce that. We will oppose the amendment in the form in which I presume it is now before the Chair. </PARA>

<PARA>Dear Mr Beale</PARA>
<PARA> I refer to our recent discussions concerning the States Grants (Technical and Further Education Assistance) Bill 1988. </PARA>
<PARA> In those discussions I put to you my concern that we should reach a speedy resolution of the differences which prevented passage of the legislation last year. As we agreed, the only contentious matter in the Bill relates to the proposed phasing-out of subsidies to non-government business colleges and it would be regrettable if differences on this matter should hold up all Commonwealth funds for both TAFE and the non-government colleges. </PARA>
<PARA> I indicated that the Government has decided to restore AUSTUDY eligibility for students in those non-government colleges where it applied last year, as soon as it is clear that the funding legislation will be supported by the Senate. Support for the legislation will allow the proposed $1.5 million to flow to the colleges, assisting with the phasing-out of the subsidy and providing a measure of public support to those institutions in 1989. It is consistent with existing policy that AUSTUDY should therefore be available to students who commence approved courses in those institutions prior to 31 December 1989. Eligibility would be restored with effect from 1 January 1989. </PARA>
<PARA> You have stated your preference for some more extended form of `grandfathering' of both the subsidy and the application of AUSTUDY. For the reasons we have discussed extensively in debate in the Parliament and elsewhere, the Government is not inclined to extend the subsidy program beyond that provided in the legislation. In this context I note that the Australian Council of Independent Business Colleges is not pursuing extension of government subsidies beyond the end of 1989. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that the future application of AUSTUDY is a matter most appropriately handled by a review of the broader policy questions involved. Therefore I am also not inclined to give any undertaking on this matter beyond the end of this year. However, I recognise that there are important considerations involved and I am therefore prepared to carefully review the overall policy on AUSTUDY eligibility as it relates to non-government institutions for 1990 and beyond. This review would form part of a broader examination of issues arising from the likely development of new forms of training and education in the context of an enhanced national effort in skills formation in the coming years. </PARA>
<PARA> As noted above, the Government is prepared to restore AUSTUDY eligibility for students who commence approved courses in the non-government business colleges before 31 December 1989. This already implies that some students at the colleges would still be receiving AUSTUDY into 1990. </PARA>
<PARA> If you are prepared to agree to the States Grants (TAFE) Bill on this basis, funds can flow quickly to the TAFE sector and the business colleges and the Government will proceed immediately to implement the decisions on AUSTUDY outlined above. I would appreciate your urgent confirmation that these arrangements are agreeable to you and that the Bill will therefore proceed without further delay, to the benefit of the students and institutions involved. </PARA>
<PARA> I have written in identical terms to Senator Macklin. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Opposition, when the Senate was debating the States Grants (Technical and Further Education Assistance) Bill 1988, put forward two amendments which were adopted by the Senate and which subsequently became contentious between the Senate and the House of Representatives. Because there are some important broader principles involved, I feel that it is incumbent on me, on behalf of the Opposition, briefly to remind the Committee of the issues at stake at that time and subsequently when the Senate sat to hear the response of the House of Representatives a week later. I shall then outline when the Opposition is prepared to support the motion that is now before the Committee.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In May 1988 the Government, as part of its mini-Budget, decided to cut grants to non-government business colleges-that is, to cut entirely the whole category of $6m made available to these technical and further education (TAFE) type non-government business colleges. The Opposition rejects this policy decision. We do not believe that it is a sound decision. We do not support the decision as we do not believe it is in the best interests of the provision of business skills, especially in respect of stenographers and the women who take stenographic courses. For more than 50 years the best provision of stenographer skills has been by non-government business colleges. Even where there have recently grown up similar courses in government-owned TAFE colleges, there is not the capacity in such colleges to provide the skills to sufficient numbers of persons to meet the nation's needs in this area. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has not brought forward any assessment other than to accept that Australia, in all its States, depends on non-government business colleges, especially for the training of stenographers and persons in business skills. Therefore, to cut out arbitrarily from all recurrent funding these important non-government business colleges was seen by the Opposition to be unacceptable. The Government rethought the matter when this Bill was being formulated in the latter part of 1988 and decided to leave in a transitional $1.5m because the cut would have made it difficult, even in the transition period, for these colleges to remain viable with the enrolments to which they had already committed themselves. </PARA>
<PARA> I remind honourable senators that students who attend these business colleges have in the main attended government secondary schools, the taxpayer having provided 100 per cent of the cost of their courses. Other school leavers who go on to tertiary study, whether in TAFE, universities or colleges of advanced education, undertake their courses, in the main, with 100 per cent support from the taxpayer. Why should there be this discrimination against the students undertaking stenography and other business studies courses? It comes down to the fact that the Hawke Labor Government has an ideological difficulty with supporting non-government business colleges. Various Ministers for education, particularly the Minister before the present one, have come out with all manner of ideologically framed statements against the Bond University and against any kind of initiative by non-government educational institutions in the area of post-school education. Yet for a century this country has been served well by bodies such as these non-government business colleges, theological colleges, church-run teachers colleges, independent non-government agricultural colleges, and the providers of a wide variety of adult education courses that are entirely provided without the Government's owning the college or the training institution. No-one during the debate in the Senate or in the House of Representatives has denied that the particular expertise that has been developed by these non-government business colleges over many decades is other than the best available in this country. The third point is that 95 per cent of students undertaking the courses in non-government business colleges are women and are more likely than other tertiary students to have such low recurrent incomes as to be eligible for Austudy benefits if they were available to them. We have a deserving group of school leavers going on to important tertiary training, going to the colleges that provide that training in the best available way, being denied by an arbitrary decision in the nature of a financial stricture, being just cut off the books by the Hawke Labor Government. The failure of the Federal Government to give any support to these students and the colleges concerned was unacceptable to the Opposition in November and December last year, and it is still unacceptable. </PARA>
<PARA> When this Bill was first considered in the Senate we moved these amendments successfully. Two amendments were passed at the time. The first, which at the time was called amendment (2), was to remove certain words from clause 12 of the Bill. It would have had the effect of reinstating the level of support that had previously been available-that is, $6m a year. The second amendment, which was then called amendment (3), was to delete clause 13 entirely. It was necessary to proceed with that amendment only if the previous amendment was passed because the deletion of clause 13 meant that it was no longer necessary to make available the $1.5m. It certainly was not our intention to restore the $6m and then, through clause 13, have the $1.5m as well, to make a total of $7.5m. So the effect of the two amendments was to make available $6m instead of the Government's $1.5m. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill went back to the House of Representatives with the Senate's amendments. I will later outline why the Senate's amendments were put in the form of amendments rather than requests for amendments. The House of Representatives considered the Senate's amendments, decided not to agree with them and sent the Bill back to us. This led to a deadlock between the two Houses on this Bill which, in all, provides $313m for technical and further education for the 1989 year. </PARA>
<PARA> It is my strong view that the Government dug in its heels on this one Bill rather than on the other six Bills that made up the education package at that time because the other six Bills amounted to some $16 billion in funds for educational purposes, to higher educational institutions and schools in the main, for the next three and four years. If these had been delayed there would have been serious consequences in terms of the recurrent support for schools, universities, colleges of advanced education and institutes of technology. However, only one Bill of the seven, the TAFE Bill, related to 1989 only. In the main it related to capital money provision, for which there were well-laid plans in the States. By and large the money required for the recurrent needs of technical and further education institutions is provided by the States, so the Government had in its pocket the knowledge that to delay this Bill by three months would not be to the enormous disadvantage of the technical and further education sector in this country. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that the Government was quite facetious in putting up the white flag and agreeing to the Senate's amendments with respect to the other six Bills while, with something of macho self-assertion, members of the other place tried to tackle the clear resolve of the Senate-that is, the clear resolve of the Opposition and the Australian Democrats, which have a majority in this place-on the TAFE Bill. They were concerned about the Government's ability to win on a policy matter and they were concerned not to give way to the Senate's clear decision against the Government which had an iron majority of numbers in the House of Representatives. The Government did not put up the white flag on the matter, but chose to have it stand over as a point of drama because the matter could be delayed by a few months without any real disaster occurring. It was a point of drama. The Government said to the Senate, `We will give in to you with regard to the six other education Bills, but on this one we want to create a bit of drama and try to assert our view'. Clearly, the Senate is more mature than that and will not allow the Government to see the technical and further education colleges of Australia suffer a delay in their capital moneys of some $313m. </PARA>
<PARA> The proposal of the Opposition offered a constructive way to break the deadlock. We urged on the Government that there be an extension of Austudy payments to students in these non-government business colleges, not only for 1989 but for the course of study of any student who began in 1989 so that, in effect, the Austudy would extend to 1990. This extension of Austudy to non-government business students will lead to a benefit commensurate with that which we were seeking to give by direct grants to the institutions involved. (Extension of time granted) I thank the Committee and I thank you, Mr Chairman. I thank my colleagues who are hanging on my every word, wanting to hear the outline of the present situation and the creative proposal that the Opposition and the Australian Democrats have made to break this impasse. </PARA>
<PARA> We are aware that the Government is anxious to save face. We want to make sure that non-government business college students are assisted in continuing their courses during 1989 and 1990. These courses are of value to the nation and to the individual students concerned. That is why we are glad to see that the Government has accepted this initiative. The Government has said, `Yes, we will give the additional resources in the form of Austudy payments to these non-government business college students'. </PARA>
<PARA> I thank the Minister for Finance, Senator Walsh, for incorporating in his remarks the letter written by the Minister for Employment, Education and Training, Mr Dawkins, giving that undertaking. We look forward to the change of the Student Assistance Regulations as soon as is practicable so that there is a clear knowledge amongst the affected students that the Austudy payments are available to them. We note that those Austudy payments are to be backdated to 1 January this year. </PARA>
<PARA> It is our expectation that every student in these non-government business college courses who believes himself or herself to be eligible because of personal or family financial circumstances ought to apply as soon as is practicable to gain Austudy for this academic year and for that payment to be backdated to 1 January. The letter from the Minister also sets out that there is a review under way into provisions for Austudy. It is our expectation that the review will incorporate a sympathetic approach to this arrangement. There is no expectation on the part of this place that this will be an undertaking for only one year. Rather the expectation is that it will have a definite effect for one year, and a likely continuity thereafter, in the context of the terms of that wider Austudy review. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition wants to break the deadlock and see that this money is released for the benefit of all technical and further education colleges around Australia. We want to make it entirely clear that, with the concurrence of the Democrats, we did our utmost to persuade the Government to retain the $6m level of funding to the institutions. Instead of that, we have now gained, as a direct concession from the Government, a similar amount of assistance which will be made available through the means of the Austudy extensions. </PARA>
<PARA> I conclude by referring to the Senate amendments. They were not a request, because, despite advice that was given to some members of the House of Representatives including the Minister, Mr Dawkins-we, in the Opposition, do not believe that the form of amendments 2 and 3 to this Bill is contrary to the provisions of section 53 of the Constitution. My colleague Senator Hill will refer more directly in this debate to this matter. I would like to refer entirely favourably to the advice that has been more fully made available by the Clerk of the Senate. At the time of the amendments being moved, the Clerk of the Senate and his assistants gave very direct advice that it was appropriate-notwithstanding our own Standing Orders or the provisions of the Constitution-that we should move by way of amendment rather than by way of request. This advice concurred with our own view of the matter. Accordingly that procedure was followed. Because it is a matter that is of importance to the Senate and to the whole of the Parliament, the Clerk has gone over the precedents in this matter. I commend entirely the paper that he has made available. </PARA>
<PARA> I note that this matter was most carefully debated in this Senate in 1903, some 86 years ago. The two main contributors to that debate were two South Australian senators. One was Senator Sir Richard Baker, a free trade senator from South Australia who was in this chamber from 1901 to 1906. The other Senator Sir Josiah Symon, also a free trade senator from South Australia, who was here from 1901 to 1913. In the important precedent of the debate in 1903, which was on a sugar bill, the points that were made and established became the foundation on which Senator Hill and I-also two South Australian senators-have continued to build. It is entirely appropriate for the Senate to consider as amendments those aspects of a Bill we believe can lead to the improvement of legislation, whether by a change of wording to express a change of policy or whether by widening the discretion of a Minister in the making of payments. No decisions of this type involved in the States Grants (Technical and Further Education Assistance) Bill transgress section 53 of the Constitution, which provides that the Senate may not amend a Bill so as to increase any proposed charge or burden on the people. The interpretation of the third part of section 53 must be that there is a requirement that a request have the necessary effect of clearly and directly increasing expenditure under an appropriation. Any increase in government spending must not be just a possibility but must be a matter of necessity; a matter that is clear and direct. </PARA>
<PARA> The consequence otherwise could well be-we would totally resist this in the Senate-that it would be regarded as against the provisions of section 53 of the Constitution for the Senate to amend almost anything that was before it because it may have the consequence of indirectly leading to some additional charge or burden on the people. If it is indirect, clearly it should not prevent the Senate from considering the merits of legislation that is before it and making up its mind on the merits of the case, even on the merits of its view about policy, but only where it is totally direct and clear that there would be an extra charge or burden should there be an amendment to legislation here that takes the form of a request to the House of Representatives. </PARA>
<PARA> I will leave my colleague, Senator Hill, to refer to this important issue in his subsequent remarks. It is clear to me that members of the House of Representatives in their report to us as to their reasons for not agreeing to our amendment and the Minister, Mr Dawkins, in his references were using this as a matter of rhetoric to try to bolster the Government's own argument, which is unacceptable to us. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I met the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Dawkins) last week with Julian Beale, who is the Opposition shadow Minister for education. Senator Teague's recounting of the outcome of that particular meeting was somewhat more sanguine than mine is. Having been through an exercise with the States grants Bills under the Fraser Government when Senator Peter Baume was the Minister for Education, I remember that the same type of blackmail was used. Again with Senator Susan Ryan and the States grants Bills the same type of blackmail was used. It has to be admitted that by and large at the end of the day this chamber has very little leverage with regard to States grants Bills. It might be that the people in the community are not quite sure why that is, but it becomes very clear when the entire funding of one of the levels of education in this country depends on a particular Bill. The Senate can actually hold that Bill up if it wishes, but I think that it would be at its peril.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Government also has other procedural devices, one of which it took a few days ago to split the Bills and introduce the purely technical and further education (TAFE) component and the private business college component as separate Bills so that the TAFE component would have a passage through the chamber since there was no dispute concerning that matter. The other Bill would languish in the House of Representatives, in the Senate or the large space in between. </PARA>
<PARA> Our view is that this is a compromise. It is an unhappy compromise because it still fails to address the fundamental issue. The Australian Democrats supported the Opposition's amendment with regard to the private business colleges-I suppose some people may find it odd that we would support private business colleges-quite precisely because of the group of people who were involved; that is, 95 per cent are young women under the age of 20. They are overwhelmingly from state schools and are overwhelmingly eligible for Austudy.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;They are also eligible for TAFE in most cases.</PARA></TALK.START>
</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="2I4">Senator MACKLIN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Zakharov interjects that they are eligible for TAFE. That is perfectly true, except that TAFE has not been able to offer them the places and that is very clear. It has not had the money, it has not had the resources, and it cannot even fulfil the demands which are currently made on it. It certainly could not take these types of demands; if it could, there would not be a debate. In fact, if it could the income of most of these people would dictate that they would go to TAFE and not to private business colleges. So these colleges have been offering a good career to a group of people who have not necessarily clicked terribly well in the schooling context. At a later stage they often do go back to further study. If they had chosen to remain within the schooling context they would have been funded 100 per cent by the Commonwealth. They are deserving of support.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> These people are now able to have Austudy for a year. I think that that is important because it seems to have been the major reason for the very alarming drop in enrolments in those courses. We have a modicum of support for the business colleges that have dealt with this matter so successfully over a considerable number of years. Where we go from here and what is likely to happen next year is a matter of interest. One hopes that we may see a liberalisation of the funding for TAFE so that it will be in a position to offer more extensive courses to people in clerical areas. If that does not occur, then I think there will be a significant educational loss for these people. That would be an enormous shame not only for those people but also for the country. </PARA>
<PARA> We are not happy with the outcome. It is a compromise which enables these people to get though this year, but it does not present us with a long term view. Austudy will operate from 1 January to 31 December. There is no guarantee, except for the people who enrol before 31 December, that it will go through to next year. We certainly have a fairly firm guarantee of no continuing funding for the private business colleges which offer those types of courses. Honourable senators should remember that this funding is not for overseas students; it is essentially for 10-week-type courses in the areas that I have already outlined. </PARA>
<PARA> There is continuing concern on our part that we have not resolved the policy issues. I am mindful of a letter that was written to me by the Minister and his undertaking that he would look at this whole business of Austudy, particularly with regard to the developing types of courses that may be around through a whole range of institutions. It seems fairly reasonable that, if those people are eligible and the courses are not offered elsewhere, that is a reasonable base to say, `Well, there is at least a prima facie case that they should be funded in that way'. </PARA>
<PARA> With regard to the general matter of private institutions, I think that in part that is a red herring inasmuch as the Government, not only by way of amendment but also by way of legislation, has often engaged in grandfathering exercises, as they are called, whereby a particular policy initiative that arose and was carried forward over a number of years was not treated as a precedent for a wider break-out in an area. Seemingly that has also been rejected. I think that that is probably a pity. I hope that the Government does not simply wash its hands of this group of people but that it actively seeks to make sure that education is provided from here on in in a way that is commensurate with the types of financial resources that one could expect to be available for that group of women. If the Government does not do that, I think it could very well stand accused of selling out a group of people who I would have thought, at least on the basis of the Government's own agenda for women, it was dedicated to support. I hope that this will be looked at. I hope that it will be pursued vigorously. I hope that, with the absence from the Ministry of former Senator Susan Ryan, who had a great deal of interest in these things and pursued them with a fair amount of vigour, this will not be pushed aside by the Government as just another of those items that one can wave one's arm at and say, `This is a private sector exercise'. It is not. It is a provision that has been offered by the private sector to a group of people who would normally be found within the state sector in TAFE, if there were any availability. That is where they would have gone. If most of them were available to gain Austudy, one can certainly assume, fairly clearly, that their resources are not vast. </PARA>
<PARA> I assume that the Government will follow through on that; I hope that it will. I hope that, when we come again later this year to States grants, TAFE and tertiary assistance Bills, we will have an opportunity of furthering this debate and of seeing in a report from the Government precisely where it has gone with its deliberations set down in the letter to me and to the Opposition spokesperson on education, Julian Beale. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Administrative Services Legislation Amendment Bill 1989 involves amendments to four different Acts of Parliament: firstly, the Public Works Committee Act 1969; secondly, the Australian Protective Service Act 1987; thirdly, the Commonwealth Grants Commission Act 1973; and, fourthly, the Parliament House Construction Authority Act 1979. I do not wish to deal at great length with all these changes, many of which are unexceptional and which involve sensible alterations.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> One thing that these amendments do is to recognise that the Joint Statutory Committee on Public Works, which is a very effective and important committee of the Parliament, works under a very heavy burden. There has been some controversy in the Parliament about the extent to which the Public Works Committee should be provided with assistance. I am glad that the Government is recognising that the work it does is of great substance and that it should be assisted, by way of these amendments, in lessening some of its burden and in making clearer what it should be looking at. </PARA>
<PARA> One of these amendments ensures that works carried out under the deferred payment arrangements that the Government has undertaken come within the purview of the Public Works Committee. I would like to discuss this a little because there are many instances now-and the Budget Papers reveal them-where the Government is, in effect, hiding the extent to which it is spending large amounts of public money on major new buildings, such as the government offices in Wollongong or the government offices in Parramatta. This Government, which goes to the people saying, `We have cut government spending enormously', is in effect hiding the extent to which it has failed to cut government spending so dramatically because it is going ahead with these major projects for which it then pays over an extended period; in other words, it leaves the bill to be picked up by the Budget down the track. The interesting thing is that in the past, it appears, these kinds of works carried out under the deferred payment arrangements were not subject to Public Works Committee scrutiny. I am very glad indeed that the Government is now bringing these matters under the control of the Public Works Committee. </PARA>
<PARA> The main matter I want to talk about deals with the parliamentary zone and the Parliament House Construction Authority, but before I get to that I should just mention that the legislation also covers amendments to the Australian Protective Service Act to extend the list of specified offences for which protective service officers have the power to arrest without warrant. These offences, such as escaping from lawful custody, aiding a person to escape from lawful custody, or rescuing a person by force from lawful custody, were recently created by amendments to the Crimes Act 1914. These amendments are essentially consequential to the Crimes Act amendments and, of course, the Opposition is quite happy to support them. We also support amendments to the Commonwealth Grants Commission to provide the option of appointing a part time chairman to that Commission. </PARA>
<PARA> The point I would like to deal with, though, relates to the Parliament House Construction Authority. This legislation will reduce the number of members on the Board of the Parliament House Construction Authority from six to three. That amendment clearly is in recognition of the facts that the new Parliament House has almost been completed and the services of many of the people on the Board are no longer needed to supervise this major building. The three members to be removed from the Board will be the National Capital Development Commissioner and two others yet to be named. </PARA>
<PARA> It is worth making the point at this moment that the Board has worked very hard in very trying conditions. I noticed that Mr Morokoff, the Chairman, was quite properly rewarded with membership of the Order of Australia in the Australia Day honours list. I am certain that all senators will join me in congratulating him on that award, as all senators clearly will join me in congratulating Mr Gordon Peatey, the Chief Executive Officer of the Parliament House Construction Authority, who also received such an award and who next month will retire from his very arduous job. I say that, having been a major critic of Mr Peatey and the Parliament House Construction Authority. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not resile in any way from that criticism. Now, at the time when the Bill comes in reducing that Board, we see some of the consequences of the extraordinary manner in which this building was constructed. I am not going to rake over the old coals of the consequences of the fast track building method and how it added multi millions of dollars to the cost of this building. But it is worth saying that one of the major problems we face in this building and one of the major causes of millions of dollars of unnecessary expenditure is that in so many instances the architects of this place rediscovered the wheel. They were so determined to get a finish which was up to the standard that they sought and which they believed was only fitting for a building of this status that they refused to go down the track of getting fittings and equipment which were readily available, no matter how good the quality. </PARA>
<PARA> Instead, they designed matters going down to door knobs which were once-off and specially designed and cost many times the amount that similar items of similar quality would have cost and which were readily available without the extraordinary specifications that were introduced. I say once again that this was at immense and unnecessary cost, which was met by the people of Australia, in building this very significant public structure. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As Senator Watson said, they did not take any notice of the users' needs, either. My criticism of this place is not that I am opposed to the existence of this significant, very impressive public building-although I do concede that I have reservations about the extent to which this place is more of a major public building than it is a workable parliament. It would seem to me-perhaps this is selfish because I have to work here as a parliamentarian-that the task of the Board of the Parliament House Construction Authority and the architects in building this place was primarily to build it as a parliament. But that objective seems to have been way down the list of objectives that were before those people who were responsible for creating this place.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The ostentatious waste of space between our offices forces us to get incredibly fit when trying to have any kind of interaction with our colleagues. I know that the Minister at the table, the Minister for Local Government (Senator Reynolds), from the far off ministerial wing no doubt finds a diminished need for using an exercise bike because every time the bells ring she has an enormous distance to cover. Those distances are largely unnecessary, as one can establish very clearly by looking at the massive amounts of waste space in this place. Once again I say that this is at enormous cost to the people of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> I am concerned that in the little over six months that we have been in this building-we have had only the Budget session before starting this session-the problems we are having do not seem to be simply those of settling into a new building. All new buildings have major problems. It would be ridiculous for anyone to say that this Parliament House should somehow, magically be free of problems simply because it cost $1,060m. It is the biggest and most expensive building ever in this country's history. It is one of the most expensive buildings in the world. It is incredible in that sort of situation that there has not been tighter control of a whole range of things. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not want to go over once again the detailed auditor's report which demonstrated the lack of cost control in many areas of this building's construction. But I do want to say how extraordinary it is that, when the architects or the Parliament House Construction Authority, or whoever was responsible, decided that the expenditure restraints the Government had imposed would involve cuts in completing this building, the areas where it would be most inconvenient to the inhabitants of this place were those that are cut, and those which would be of minimal inconvenience to the occupants by not being completed, but which would look nicer to the visitors, were those that received the money. </PARA>
<PARA> Honourable senators will notice that, outside the Senate chamber in the areas that lead to the party rooms of both parties, there is gravel thrown about on the ground instead of a completed courtyard. We have been told that that was because the Government reduced the amount of money available to complete those things. In the other courtyards, where members of parliament, to my knowledge, do not walk and are never likely to walk, there are beautifully finished courtyards with granite paths which look lovely but have no effective, meaningful use. Yet in the one area where we need some effective paving, outside the chambers and our Party rooms, there is gravel because, frankly, it cannot be seen from the public areas and people cannot say, `Why didn't the architects, the Parliament House Construction Authority, the Government or someone finish that off?'. The only people who are inconvenienced are the members and senators of this place. </PARA>
<PARA> It seems ludicrous. I might add that the gravel is then trodden onto the expensive flooring of this place, quite frankly, because of incompetence. I will not use other adjectives. But it seems to me to be a deliberate and determined decision that the people to be inconvenienced by a reduction in the amount of money to be spent here are the occupants and users of this building, not the people who come to look at it and go away. </PARA>
<PARA> The reason I concentrate on such a small issue-the fact that gravel has been trodden through the beautiful parquetry floors, destroying them-is that it seems to me to reflect an attitude in this place which I find unacceptable. I am particularly irritated that the public places of this building have at all times taken precedence over the working requirements of a good Parliament House. For example, this chamber is not a patch on the chamber in the old Parliament House. Its timber walls gave a feeling of solidity and reliability. This chamber, with its panelled textile walls gives no feeling of anything other than that one day, with average luck, the walls may fall down. Maybe it is appropriate while this Government is in office that the walls give no feeling of stability. I trust that that analogy is appropriate. </PARA>
<PARA> At a Senate Estimates committee hearing last year I asked numerous questions about who would pay for all the problems that have occurred since we came into this place. I think that everyone is aware of the massive indentation of the parquetry caused by stiletto heels. At Senate Estimates I asked what would happen, who would pay to get it fixed and when it would be fixed. I was told at that time that the Great Hall would be sanded. That has subsequently been denied. It certainly did not happen over the Christmas break. It seems to me that this Parliament is entitled to know who will pay to fix up all the things that have not been successful. As I understand it, the ceiling tiles in many areas of this place have been rehung, not once or twice but three times. Who has paid for that? Were they dangerously installed, as was alleged by one of my colleagues, who asked the people reinstalling the material what they were doing mucking around with the ceiling tiles again? He was told that they had been dangerously installed. </PARA>
<PARA> Anyone who has had a good look at the carpets on the second floor will have found that they look stained somehow. I understand that the glue is coming through the carpets because they have been steam cleaned nigh unto death through having been mishandled. We can look at the whole question of maintenance. Several of the beautiful black marble blocks that pave this place have been torn up in recent times because of some problem underneath them, broken in the process and replaced by marble blocks which appear to be light grey rather than black and look hideous. In passing I ask why this cannot be done properly. What has gone wrong? Who paid for it, and why was there not a stock of similar marble? Why, when it was pulled up, did it have to be broken?</PARA>
<PARA> The list-I am picking out only a few items-goes on and on forever. Water pipes have burst in many areas because they were not properly joined, involving flooding of many of the offices. The staff in particular have been most inconvenienced by that. As a result of flooding, some of the parquetry has curled up. We have had the extraordinary situation of four lavishly equipped subkitchens, as they are called, having their equipment pulled out because apparently there is no real demand for them and no staff resources to use them anyway. I wonder what sort of planning went on to bring about such a situation. </PARA>
<PARA> I am concerned about what will happen in the management of this building. I am concerned about who will rectify the things that have gone wrong and who will pay. I notice plenty of door sealers falling off around the place. Until there is clear evidence that someone is taking a strong and determined position in the new Parliament House-someone who has the status of client-we will keep on not getting answers to these questions. I can assure the Joint House Department and the Parliament House Construction Authority that at the Senate Estimates hearings in April I will ask a whole host of questions, which I hope will be answered satisfactorily, about what has gone wrong, what is going wrong and what is likely to go wrong with this building. </PARA>
<PARA> The failure to maintain the Sydney Opera House has involved the State Government of New South Wales in massive-multimillions of dollars-worth-expenditure. I want to be assured-I think the Senate has every right to be assured-that the external, and total maintenance of this building is not only adequate but capable of ensuring that there will be no sudden and unexpected multimillion dollar attack on taxpayers' pockets because things have not been done properly. One of the major problems faced in the maintenance of a building such as this has been the once-off nature of specially designed equipment and specially designed furniture-specially designed everything-that is simply not available off the shelf for replacement or repair purposes. For that reason I hope that the changes being made to the Parliament House Construction Authority under this legislation will be matched by changes within the administration of the Parliament itself in the manner and status of the management of this place. </PARA>
<PARA> This is a major public building. It is a public building that requires an immense staff and immense management. I would ask that the same enthusiasm which has prompted the Government to introduce the Administrative Services Legislation Amendment Bill, which has the Opposition's support, also be directed towards a close examination-certainly closer than we have seen so far-of the administration and maintenance of this Parliament House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Over recent years many in the media and public life have played down the importance of the wool industry to Australia. I wish to draw the attention of honourable senators to an extremely important event which took place in Tasmania last week. I am very proud that we in Tasmania were able to host the second World Sheep and Wool Congress which focused worldwide recognition on our wool and sheep industries. The far-sighted goals of and the heavy groundwork preparation for the congress to be held in Australia had the driving force of three key players in Mr Keith McLauchlan, Mr Richard Lawrence and Mr Ian Downie and others, whose determined lobbying at Edmonton, Canada, in 1986 with a selection of sheep of various breeds from leading studs won Tasmania the right to host the Congress. Keith McLauchlan spearheaded the project, built around him an enthusiastic and capable team comprising Bruce Connor, Graham Foster, the managing director of Combined Rural Traders Ltd, Mark Barnett and Pat Headlam and formed committee contacts overseas. The appointment of Mr Ron Limb as executive director, with his extensive background in the media and agriculture, and with responsibility for the overall coordination of this event, further ensured its success.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Congress symposium brought together some of the world's leading authorities on sheep and wool. The Princess Royal, when she spoke at the opening of the Congress at the Wrest Point convention centre on Monday, 27 February, said:</PARA>
<PARA> The World Sheep and Wool Congress has come to the right place. </PARA>
<PARA>Seventeen countries and 1,000 delegates were registered at the conference, which had its itinerary divided between the north and south of the island. Tasmania has long had a reputation as a fine wool producer and a centre of excellence. This has been borne out recently by the huge prices commanded for wool at the recent wool sales in Launceston, when the Japanese Fujii family paid 300,850c per kilo of saxon merino superfine wool from the Connorville property near Cressy. </PARA>
<PARA> We were most privileged to have had an array of well-qualified and respected speakers both from overseas and around Australia. A considerable range of international experiences, skills and specialised knowledge were shared with us on diverse topics. Sheep and goat breeding was the topic of Dr Moroz from the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics. Dr Brian Bagnell from the United States of America spoke on the development of markets for agricultural products. Dr Ted Jones, also from the United States, spoke on markets for woollen fabrics and sheepmeats. Mr R. Campbell from New Zealand delivered an address on prime lambs for export markets. Speakers came from every state of the Commonwealth, and all contributed greatly to the quality of the symposium.</PARA>
<PARA> The dedication of these people to the wool and sheep industry and their efforts to improve and share their knowledge was much appreciated and provided an insight into the concern of sheep farmers all over the world. In addition to the specialist lectures, guests were shown various stud properties and there was a trade fair in Launceston. The trade fair was a most important sheep breeders event, where the quality and importance of sheepmeat was highly acclaimed. The fair concentrated on the technical side of the industry, with producers being able to display the latest developments in a range of areas from genetic engineering to marketing. It was an opportunity for them to show their knowledge in so many areas such as animal health; genetic engineering, the biological control of diseases, electronics for the sheep industry, fencing, shearing, state of the art wool processing, other farm orientated equipment and wool crafts such as spinning and weaving. Producers exhibited their wares to people from all over the world who are totally dedicated to the sheep industry. </PARA>
<PARA> The wool and carcass exhibit was truly of international standard. Credit must go the organisers of the Congress for the results they have achieved since winning the right to host the Congress in Tasmania. It is also important to acknowledge the support received from the Federal Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Kerin), who took a high profile at the conference, as well as the unstinting support of the Tasmanian Government, especially the State Department of Agriculture, and the Tasmanian Development Authority. The support of my Senate colleague Senator Paul Calvert as President of the Royal Agricultural Society of Tasmania was very much appreciated. The Society generously underwrote a number of important Congress activities. </PARA>
<PARA> The wool and sheep congress was not an end in itself but a big step in the continuation of further development in a most important and vital industry all over the world, as evidenced by the number of participants and the countries they represent. The Congress will in the future be seen as an appropriate vehicle for the development and maintenance of information channels where exchange of information and technology is allowed to flow and opportunities for trade will be created and fostered. I would like especially to mention the scores of Tasmanian woolgrowers and their families who gave countless hours in a wholly voluntary capacity to ensure that the Congress was the success it was. They put a great deal of effort into every aspect of the event, especially making a warm welcome to the many overseas guests who attended. </PARA>
<PARA> The World Sheep and Wool Congress shows that wool is still a fundamental element of the national economy and lifestyle. The staging of this international Congress was a coup for Tasmania, recognising the importance of the industry in the State and nationally, and the role that wool plays in the international arena. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to put on record a few remarks about the hypocrisy of some members of the Opposition in quoting slabs of material from a commentator whose writing would not generally be supported on their side of the chamber. Eva Cox has a long record as a commentator on social and women's issues and her comments have been taken out of context in recent days. The Age article from which Senator Vanstone quoted today expressed concerns about marginalisation of women. The Opposition's actions in selecting a male spokesman on women's issues indicates that it also does not take women's issues seriously. It is mischievous and dishonest for Opposition members to quote selectively from this article.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Similarly, and even more bizarre, was Senator Walters's use of the same article last week. Senator Walters's record in these areas has been one of almost total opposition to any programs which recognise that women have suffered and are still suffering disadvantages. If members of the Opposition were vocal and enthusiastic supporters of affirmative action, of special programs for women and of the existence of the special units for women, such as the Office of the Status of Women, their sudden interest in women might be more credible. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition has shown a complete disregard of most of the programs that a feminist such as Eva Cox would support. Its policies on income splitting and on tax rebates for child-care and its support for the traditional family indicate that its only interest in this area is to use, quite cynically, any material which might embarrass the Government. Considering the Opposition's poor record in this area, its use of writings by radical feminists such as Eva Cox to criticise the Government is very bizarre. The Opposition has failed dismally to support many of the measures that have been introduced by the present Government to assist women. </PARA>
<PARA> There are many problems with any government trying to address women's issues. Most of these problems arise from the mostly male and patriarchal systems which still dominate the political and bureaucratic systems. However, while ever the corridors of power are largely inhabited by men, women will find much to criticise. Nonetheless, my criticisms arise from a desire to make further changes to enhance the position of women. They stem from a belief that the present Government moves too slowly and is not sensitive enough to women's issues. For example, it was noted by the women at the Women's Tax Convention on Saturday that it was the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, Mr John Kerin, who opened the conference. It was felt that the Government might have taken the Convention more seriously and sent along a senior finance Minister to open it. However, the women who want to see change towards a less discriminatory society, one which gives women the fair go that men have, are not supporting the sometimes antediluvian views promoted by the Opposition. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to make a few comments about the changing situation in Namibia and the announcement that Australia will be sending a small force of 300 troops there as part of the United Nations Transitional Assistance Group. I welcome this initiative, which will assist Namibia in reaching independence after more than 100 years of colonial rule by Germany and South Africa. This is one of the best uses for Australia's military forces-to be available for United Nations peacekeeping missions, rather like the Irish, Swedish and Austrian military forces. That role is largely possible because those countries are perceived as neutral by the world community. For Australia, this is the tenth contribution it has made to United Nations peacekeeping forces over 42 years. It is commendable. It is also good that the vehicles going with the Australian group have been repainted the international colours of the United Nations rather than drab army green.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Of course, one of the problems with this operation is the cost. I note that South Africa will be supplying much of the fuel and other supplies and equipment for the United Nations (UN) peacekeeping force. While I know this is largely because of the high costs of taking such goods from outside the continent, I would point out the concern of those who believe that South Africa will use this opportunity to do everything it can to influence the outcome of the forthcoming elections in favour of its own candidates and against the wishes of the majority of the people of Namibia. </PARA>
<PARA> Many have died or had to leave their country as refugees in the 23-year war against South Africa. It has been one of Africa's forgotten wars. Like those in Eritrea, the Western Sahara, Chad and Mozambique. It is not without significance that there are those in this Parliament who have criticised the Namibian Liberation movements like the South West Africa People's Organisation (SWAPO) for many years. They have confused Marxism with nationalism and mistakenly have argued that the freedom movements were inspired more by Moscow than the Christian churches. In fact, it was the Lutheran, Anglican and Catholic churches which had a great influence on the early struggle for independence rather than ideas from books which are not even available in South Africa or Namibia because they are banned. </PARA>
<PARA> It was apparently all right for Australia to fight with the Soviet Union against Nazi Germany 50 years ago. But it was not all right for SWAPO to get support from the Soviet Union to fight Adolf Hitler's successors in Pretoria, while the West tacitly supported white South Africa in its illegal occupation of Namibia in defiance of UN resolutions. The UN has consistently supported the cause of liberation for Namibia since an Anglican priest, the Reverend Michael Scott, persuaded the member states not to let the South African Government incorporate Namibia into South Africa as a fifth province after a bogus plebiscite at the end of the Second World War. </PARA>
<PARA> Australia, to its credit, was the first Western nation to join the UN Council for Namibia and it was this Government which allowed SWAPO to open an information office in Melbourne despite attempts by right wing apologists for apartheid to close it down. I am sorry that the Government refused the fund the office, but at least it resisted calls to close it down by those who confuse liberation movements with terrorism, while supporting state-sanctioned terrorism in other parts of the world such as Central America and the Philippines. I hope that we will be vigilant in making sure that South Africa does not use its position to abuse the agreement which will lead Namibia to independence after free and fair elections for which its people have waited for so long. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like to make a plea for more support and understanding for the United Nations organisation which is acting as the third force in this conflict. The world puts a lot of money into military forces-about a trillion dollars this year, I believe. In Namibia there has been a war of attrition for 23 years and in the end it needed negotiating skills and a third party to resolve the conflict non-violently. If the money the world's nations spend on war and preparations for war was spent instead on developing alternative models of conflict resolution and strengthening the UN, then the world would be a much better place. This operation in Namibia nearly fell apart because of the costs, estimated to be approaching $US500m. When one considers that the United States and the Soviet Union alone spend $US1.5 billion a day on the arms race, it really is not very much. It shows that a re-ordering of our priorities is necessary. </PARA>
<PARA> Another comparison worth noting is that our contribution to this peacekeeping force represents what we spend on defence against non-existent threats in about one month, although I know there are some people who feel that the Australian defence forces and Kangaroo 89 will fall apart without these 300 men. I commend the Government for its support for the UN in this operation and I would also like to commend the men who, for 12 months, will go to help a people who have waited so long for their freedom. I realise that they will find Grootfontein somewhat different from Holsworthy or their own homes, but I hope they will find life interesting working with a multinational force drawn from Africa, Asia, South America, North America and Europe. </PARA>
<PARA> On a different subject, I want to draw attention to an article in the current edition of the Bulletin entitled `Small fish in a big world' in which Alan Renouf, a former Australian ambassador overseas and a former Secretary of the Department of Foreign Affairs, reflects on the mindlessness of Australian foreign policy. Having just commended the Government for its enlightened view of South Africa, I want to talk for a moment about how we act in relation to our own situation in the Asia-Pacific region and particularly in relation to the United States alliance. Alan Renouf is a person who ought to know what he is talking about. Actually, I think it is probably very embarrassing for the Government to have this kind of thing said by somebody who has been working at such a high level in the Department of Foreign Affairs in the past. The main thrust of his article is that there is very little difference in substance between former Prime Minister Fraser's foreign and defence policies and those that the present Government is espousing. The article states:</PARA>
<PARA> At the centre of Prime Minister Bob Hawke's foreign policy is that familiar crutch, the alliance relationship with the US. This has never been stronger, which is truly astonishing, for the US until very recently had, as President, Ronald Reagan-the greatest reactionary to have led that country in modern times. Even this did not deter the enthusiasm of Hawke for the alliance and his government has simply trotted out the so familiar and so misleading account of the `advantages' of the ANZUS pact. </PARA>
<PARA>Further on the article states:</PARA>
<PARA> In defence, the policy discredited by the Vietnam War-forward defence-has been resurrected by Hawke. </PARA>
<PARA>I think that it should really be attributed to Mr Beazley as much as to the Prime Minister, but this is how Alan Renouf sees it:</PARA>
<PARA> Fraser started the process, Hawke has continued it with only one change-it is not called `forward defence' any longer. Current defence policy is said to be `self reliance' but, when one looks into it, it amounts to reliance upon the US as before and helping South-East Asian and South Pacific countries so that any menace to Australia will be averted far away from the continent. </PARA>
<PARA> Perhaps it makes some sense to ensure that problems do not reach our shores but not by a policy which, in itself, is a contradiction in terms. How can we be self-reliant if we are tied into this very close alliance with the United States? In 1986 the United States announced it would have a 600-ship navy that has since gone by the board; the United States cannot afford it. So now we see Australia filling the gap for the United States Navy in this part of the world and trying to draw New Zealand back into the fold with the Anzac frigate project. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Renouf talks about the very sad fact that Australians generally seem to be very apathetic about foreign policy and defence issues. I think he is absolutely right in that view. As someone who has taken a great interest in those areas, I believe it is sad that most Australians do not seem to have very much concern about these issues. Unfortunately they seem to leave foreign policy and defence issues to the Government, to the defence people on Russell Hill or to a small group of academics who are interested in these issues. These issues are far too important to leave to such groups of people. They are issues that the community at large ought to be involved in and ought to be interested in. A final comment from Mr Renouf is as follows:</PARA>
<PARA>Hawke's government has been much more active in the disarmament field, Fraser having been more in favour of armament than disarmament. But all of Hawke's efforts have produced nothing concrete because of the perceived need not to annoy the US. Hence, Hawke has refused the only weapon he has to influence the US-namely, the American `bases' in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA>I could not agree more. For example, the very good work that has been done by the disarmament conference representatives in Geneva and New York on the comprehensive test ban has been stymied, thwarted again and again by the US because it is the US that does not want to see a comprehensive test ban. For all of the rhetoric that has gone on, there has been, as Alan Renouf says, no substantive change whatsoever. His article concludes by stating that:</PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition('s) . . . principal criticism of Hawke's policy seems to be that the government is not close enough to the US. What an attitude! Australia could only be closer by becoming a state of the American Union to which the US would never agree. </PARA>
