<PARA>To the Honourable the President and members of the Senate in Parliament assembled:</PARA>
<PARA> This humble petition of certain citizens of Australia respectfully draws the attention of the Senate to the Government's attack on the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme, which has severely affected the viability of our community pharmacies and their ability to provide the quality and quantity of services to which we as Australians have a right.</PARA>
<PARA> Your petitioners respectfully request the Senate to urge the Government to guarantee an adequately funded Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme, so as to ensure the continued viability of neighbourhood pharmaceutical services through our local community pharmacies.</PARA>

<PARA>To the Honourable the President and members of the Senate in Parliament assembled. The Petition of the undersigned respectfully showeth that:</PARA>
<PARA> 1. The Australian Taxation Office disregarded its privacy obligations to the citizens of Queensland, Western Australia and the Northern Territory in February by sending an admitted 55,000 to 77,000 tax file number letters to people who were either deceased or had changed address.</PARA>
<PARA> 2. The Australian Taxation Office disregarded its privacy obligations to the citizens of New South Wales, Victoria, South Australia, Tasmania and the Australian Capital Territory in March by sending an admitted 29,000 to 58,000 tax file number letters to people who were either deceased or had changed address.</PARA>
<PARA> 3. The Australian Taxation Office disregarded its privacy obligations by sending out a large number of tax file number letters during March in unsealed envelopes.</PARA>
<PARA> 4. The Australian Taxation Office extended the deadline for employee declarations beyond the 31st of March as defined by section 202c (4) (a) of the Taxation Laws Amendment (Tax File Numbers) Act 1988, but failed to obtain a Proclamation from the Governor-General for this extension as stipulated by section 202c (4) (b) of the Act.</PARA>

<PARA> (b) notes, with concern, that an Israeli judge was horrified that these defendants had been held without trial for 21 months by authority of the Australian Attorney-General (Mr Bowen), that Australia had given them no opportunity to explain their ownership of the vessel and hence their innocence, which resulted in the dropping of the charges against them;</PARA>
<PARA> (c) notes that their arrest and imprisonment in Canning Vale prison, the seizure of their possessions and detention in Albany of their 11 travelling companions for over three and a half years has, therefore, proved to be an extraordinary and ruthless violation of the liberty and human rights of innocent people who called into an Australian port only in order to purchase provisions;</PARA>
<PARA> (d) urges the Government to cease its inexplicable persecution of the 13 very personable American expatriates who have been charitably sustained by the community of Albany while having been refused permission to work for their own keep; and</PARA>
<PARA> (e) further urges the Government to extend compassion to these people, one of whom is 80 years of age, by granting their wish to become permanent residents of Australia, extending to them every help in regaining possession of the Orionia from their wrongful accusers, and compensating them for the extremes of hardship to which they have been subjected.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I cannot add to the information that I supplied to the Committee last evening on the questions that were raised by the honourable senators referred to by Senator Puplick. From the Government point of view, we have been exhaustive in putting forward answers as best we can to the questions on discrimination and whether or not what is being done in Australia is harsher than what is being done elsewhere. I think we have put that to rest. I have replied in some detail to the question concerning the independent peer review and wait for the completion of that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I think it is necessary for me to answer in some more detail another question that was raised last night-the question of appeals by general practitioners, if they feel the need to do so, against the Royal Australian College of General Practitioners' assessments. I would like to take a minute to deal comprehensively with that matter, which takes my fancy as something worthy of putting down on the record in some detail. The first point that I make is that the Health Insurance Commission puts general practitioners on the register based on decisions taken by the college-that is, if the college is prepared to certificate them as eligible-and takes them off either at the request of a general practitioner or on a notice from the college for whatever specified reason. There is a series of specified reasons. The categories are set out in the Act and I will not go through them. The decisions of the Health Insurance Commission are appealable, if that be the right word, under the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act. On page 8 of its report, the Scrutiny of Bills Committee states:</PARA>
<PARA>In view of the major role played in the process by the Royal Australian College of General Practitioners, the Committee does not regard it as necessary that the general manager's discretion should be subject to review by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. The Committee regards the review of the legality of the discretion pursuant to the Administrative Decisions Judicial Review Act 1977 as sufficient safeguard in these circumstances. </PARA>
<PARA>If that be the line of approach for the Health Insurance Commission, it throws some responsibility on the shoulders of the college. The first element in a consideration of what the college's responsibilities might be is whether this Government can impose on the college a set of appeal provisions. Our legal advisers have it that there is doubtful legality as to whether we as a government can compel an independent organisation like the college to institute an appeals structure or set-up of the sort that we might wish to impose or which those opposite might think we should impose. I have left aside the question of the desirability of the Government's intervening in the proceedings of an organisation like the college, but it is a relevant question. I do not shy away from it. Nonetheless, the question of our legal ability to do that is debatable. </PARA>
<PARA> What do we now do? The college itself has agreed-it is set out in the discussion document to which I referred last night-that a mechanism will be developed to allow medical practitioners to appeal against exclusion or removal from the register. Someone as incisive and discriminating as Senator Peter Baume may well say that as a general undertaking taken at face that is fair enough, but that it is not good enough in that it does not spell out what the proceedings might be. If that were raised, I would say that it is absolutely right that those proceedings are not spelt out. How should we therefore answer that concern? I am advised that had this provision been passed last night or today in the time between the carriage of these Bills and their obtaining royal assent, the college would have been in a position to have instituted an appeals structure with the terms of that structure clear, with the procedures of the mechanisms clear and with the appointment of an arbitrator to head up the structure. It would be an independent appeal mechanism so that the problem identified last night by Senator Peter Baume of Caesar appealing to Caesar over a decision made by Caesar would not exist. The college would set it up, but it would stand aside from the college and would thus be an independent appeal mechanism. </PARA>
<PARA> Given the body language of those opposite, I presume I am right in anticipating that the next line of objection will concern the question of why that mechanism cannot be seen at this stage. At this point, this chamber has decided to refer all this to an inquiry of a Senate select committee. The evidence will be presented to the Senate select committee so that it can analyse it and check whether the appeal mechanism is satisfactory. Had we been in a position of proceeding with this Bill today, the Government would have become satisfied, given our discussions with the college, that the mechanism and its efficacy were proper. I say that in this debate quite unabashedly. As a government we would be concerned to see that that was so. </PARA>
<PARA> There is a fine line between compulsion and discussion and persuasion. We believe by exercising discussion and persuasion that the reservoir of goodwill between the Government and the college, if this question were ever in doubt, would have made it possible to resolve any doubt. I am therefore not able to put to the Senate this morning what the appeal structure and the procedures would be and who the independent arbitrator would be. That is a matter which can come before the Committee and be looked at by it. </PARA>
<PARA> It would seem to me that one option for the Committee would be to endorse the independent structure that the Royal Australian College of General Practitioners would set up. That is an option we would prefer. It has another option: to interpose between the college and the Health Insurance Commission some other form of structure. As a government we have shied clear of interfering in the internal affairs of the college. But if the Senate chose to do that it would be possible to contemplate the setting up of an independent structure which would sit between the college and the Health Insurance Commission. </PARA>
<PARA> If someone, having exhausted his appeal rights within the college, was dissatisfied with a decision from the college, he could theoretically appeal to this structure that we would put in place and have his appeal dealt with in that way. That is another possibility. The reason why we have not gone down that course is that we thought in all of the circumstances that it was proper to proceed in common accord with the college to resolve these matters. We believe that would have produced the results which would have resolved these matters. It is not just a question of hope; it is also a question of belief that we would have got there. I hope that answers those questions, in particular the ones about appeals. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the Minister for Resources for his explanation. I understand that basically what he is saying is that there remains a right of appeal under the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act on questions of law, but on questions of merit we will have to wait for some body to be devised by the Royal Australian College of General Practitioners in consultation with the Government for these matters to be addressed. May I say a couple of things about that. Firstly, it just reinforces the value of having this matter before a Senate committee. The college undoubtedly will want to present to the Senate committee its precise mechanism. Undoubtedly, should it fail to do so, the committee will be entitled to draw conclusions from that. Undoubtedly the college will be able to appear before the committee and indicate to it what it has proposed or what it will be proposing and the committee will be able to make some judgment on that. Nevertheless it does not entirely answer the questions about avenues of appeal.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator Cook is a little too used to dealing with Caesar. It is not a question of Caesar appealing to Caesar. What the Opposition is concerned about is not Caesar's rights of appeal but the rights of Civitas Romani. Perhaps if the Minister and the Government spent a little less time looking after Caesar and a little more time looking after the citizenry they would not be in the mess they are in at the moment. </PARA>
<PARA> The questions of the mechanism are mentioned in the document Raising the Standard, a copy of which was provided formally to us this morning. One is always grateful for small mercies, even indeed for late mercies, as far as these things are concerned. That document simply says in part:</PARA>
<PARA>A mechanism will be developed to allow medical practitioners to appeal against exclusion or removal from the register. </PARA>
<PARA>We have heard the Minister's explanation on that matter. Obviously, this will now be a matter for the Senate Committee to take further. </PARA>
<PARA> I have one final question relating to this section. In the same document, relating to another part of the audit function in this scheme, it is stated on page 3:</PARA>
<PARA>Dr Blewett and Dr Gates-</PARA>
<PARA>the Dr Gates who has signed this agreement on behalf of the college-</PARA>
<PARA>said that monitoring of and auditing the use of the new content-based items would be carried out by a peer review body independent of Government and the RACGP, but with the full support of the college. </PARA>
<PARA>I ask the Minister: Is that the Independent Peer Review Organisation (IPRO)? If it is, how can the Minister say that that body will be `independent of government and the RACGP' when that body is to be composed, apparently, of three members nominated by the college, a nominee from a separate appropriate medical organisation chosen by the Minister for Community Services and Health (Dr Blewett) in consultation with the college, a nominee of the Department of Community Services and Health and a nominee of the Health Insurance Commission? What is the definition of the term `independent of government and the college' when the college nominates three persons and has a hand in nominating a fourth? Presumably, the Minister who has responsibility for the Department and the Commission will have a hand in the nomination of the other members. Firstly, can the Minister confirm that the so-called independent body is the IPRO? Secondly, can he explain to us the way in which he has now constituted a new definition of the term `independent'?</PARA>

The Senate Committee will then deliberate and in due course bring down a report. We are here starting the forensic research that the Committee should rightfully do. Therefore, I think I should take some elements of Senator Puplick's question on notice. The Minister for Community Services and Health may then be able to reply to them.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In conclusion, let us not make this mistake when we talk about independent committees. Organisations may well-and rightfully should, since they are the organisations embracing the particular professional qualifications and skills required-nominate individuals to sit on committees. Once they do that and a committee is constituted there is a clear distinction between a representative and a nominee, someone who is then able to sit independently. The Government is seeking for this body not a representative to impose a policy but someone with the necessary qualifications, adjudged by the relevant organisation, to be independent of it and exercise that independence in the Peer Review Organisation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We can take it that the Minister-indicated by his silence-refuses to answer the question. We note that. We are also intrigued with his answer to Senator Patterson's question. He said that the Senate committee will be provided with information provided it does not breach the secrecy provisions of the Health Insurance Commission Act. If that principle is applied, it will be the first occasion that this Government has ever decided to take the secrecy provisions of the Health Insurance Commission Act seriously. It is interesting that the Government is prepared to say that it will invoke them to withhold information if possible from Senator Patterson, the Senate and the Senate committee, but that it will not do anything to ensure that it does not make use of that information in the public debate in the scandalous way in which it has in the past.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I conclude my remarks on clause 10 by noting that the Minister has clearly affirmed that the Independent Peer Review Organisation is the body referred to in the joint statement by Dr Blewett and Dr Gates about the independent review body. I am sure that once general practitioners have had a chance to see exactly what are the operating principles of this organisation, they will be better placed to see the extent to which the Government and the college are pulling the wool over their eyes. In terms of independent organisations, if we are to have such bodies, I hope in some respects that they have a slightly better track record in observing the law and in observing principles of equity and natural justice than the Government's advisory bodies have had to date. </PARA>
<PARA> Part of this legislation establishes a new pathology schedule because the Federal Court of Australia decided that the previous body, the Pathology Services Advisory Committee, was incapable or had failed in its statutory duty to observe the requirements of the Act when setting pathology tables. We have seen today a report from the Federal Court of Australia overturning the determination of the Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee. The report said that the attempts to reduce pharmacy fees were unreasonable, contrary to the principles of natural justice, and so unreasonable that no reasonable person could have come to that determination. So the Government's track record in setting up these bodies, which are designed to do its dirty work for it in terms of cost cutting, has been, by and large, set at nought by the courts of Australia, which have once again demonstrated that they are far more solicitous of the rights of ordinary citizens and of professionals in this country than the Government has ever attempted to be. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I remind Senator Cook that I am asking for general statistics which show the minimum, maximum and average number of services provided to trainees in an average sample of general practitioner trainees and, if possible, the standard deviation which would give us some idea of the range of services provided. I do not think that that would breach any privacy Act. I already have a copy of that sort of information obtained under freedom of information legislation. But the problem I have is that I am not exactly sure how many weeks that covers, although I do know how many trainees it covers. I think it would be more appropriate to have official data from the Department of Community Services and Health to enable the Senate Select Committee to make some sort of objective judgment about the range of experiences that a trainee has. I hope that the Department will stretch itself to provide that information.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I take it that the Minister refuses to answer my question about the type of body that is to be established. Is it because he does not know? The Minister may laugh, but I am interested to know what sort of body he is considering establishing in place of the Royal Australian College of General Practitioners. He will not answer the question and I can only presume that he does not know or there is some secrecy about it. I can assure him that I am not asking this question at the request of the AMA, and I think it is a gross insult for him to suggest that. If the college is not being used, I am interested to know the type of body that will be established, whether it will be totally independent and what the Government is thinking of in this legislation. I think those are legitimate questions.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Minister has the legislation. He is putting it before the Committee. We are entitled to ask questions on it at the committee stage but he sits there and says that he refuses to answer the question and will refer it to the Minister in the other place. When a question is referred to the Minister and he refuses to answer, it is usually because of lack of knowledge on the answering Minister's part. That is the reason I am asking. Is it lack of knowledge on the Minister's part or is there some secret about the type of body that is envisaged to take the place of the college? The Minister refuses to answer. We can all play at this. If he wants the legislation it might not be a bad idea if he starts answering the questions asked. </PARA>

<PARA> Pages 8 and 9, subclause 20 (2) line 8 (page 8) to line 40 (page 9), leave out the subclause. </PARA>
<PARA>I presume that has to be committed to writing. I will do that as soon as I have the opportunity. Subclause (2) of clause 20 together with clauses 21 and 22 are those sections which deal with day care surgery. As I indicated in my previous address during the second reading stage, the Opposition is opposed to the introduction, at this stage and in this form, of the arrangements to provide for day care surgery. I will briefly state the basis of that opposition. It goes to the question of consultation. I made it quite clear in my speech during the second reading debate that we do not object, in principle, to the extension of the use of day care surgery and, indeed, day only hospital treatment or day only surgery. We hope that day care surgery will in fact substantially increase as it demonstrates its justification on medical grounds. We believe that this is a perfectly proper way for the health delivery system to be developing. Nevertheless, we believe that the lack of consultation with the National Day Surgery Advisory Committee is a serious flaw. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister for Resources has rightly indicated that this matter has been discussed by the Australian Health Ministers Conference. He has drawn our attention to a communique emanating from a meeting in Burnie on 21 March 1989 and to a list of some 20-odd bodies that the Minister for Community Services and Health says he has consulted. I accept that. Nevertheless, we believe that the Day Surgery Advisory Committee should have been more extensively consulted. We have drawn attention to the fact that the Royal Australasian College of Surgeons has objected in principle to this proposal. Mr Temporary Chairman, you yourself mentioned the question of endoscopy which makes it quite clear that it is not just surgeons who have an interest in this matter; physicians who perform that procedure also have a significant interest in it. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not propose to delay the Committee longer, other than to repeat that we object not to the principle of the expansion of these forms of treatment but simply to the way in which the Government has gone about excluding what we believe to be the correct degree of consultation with the National Day Surgery Advisory Committee. For that reason I will vote against the definitional provisions in clause 20 (2), new section 4a proposed to be inserted in the principal Act by clause 21 and new section 5 to be inserted in the principal Act by clause 22 of the amending Bill. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am a little surprised that there has been no circulation of proposed amendments to clause 20 (2). Therefore, I am rather taken aback by an action which involves essentially deleting four pages of the legislation. In pursuing this desirable goal of day surgery it would seem, from representations that have been made to me, that insufficient attention has been paid to the follow-up and care of patients who return to their own homes. I understand that in several cases the Federal Government has provided funding for hospitals and the hospitals have provided follow-up care at considerable cost although the follow-up care of those patients involved in day surgery might have been conducted much better and more cheaply by existing organisations such as the Victorian Bush Nursing Association and, say, the Western Australian Silver Chain Nursing Association (Inc.).</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The point has been made to me that patients may be operated on in a hospital on one side of a major capital city but live on another side. It is very inefficient for a nurse to have to travel a vast distance across a major city to deliver care to those patients in the days after surgery, whereas the district nursing associations already have a large number of nurses. I understand that the Victorian Nursing Council has some 500-odd nurses continually traversing the metropolitan area of Melbourne and is much better equipped to provide 24-hour care to those patients. </PARA>
<PARA> As I understand it, no provision has been made for such nursing organisations to provide that care. They are still very much tied to caring for the elderly. The provision of extra funding for district nursing associations would be a more efficient way of providing that follow-up care to day surgery patients. I ask the Minister whether consideration has been given to providing that extra funding through the existing nursing organisations. If not, will he give consideration to that provision of funding? Does he agree that that would be a more efficient way of delivering services to patients involved in day surgery programs?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to respond very briefly to Senator Coulter's reference to the circulation of amendments. It is not usual to circulate a piece of paper saying that we will oppose particular clauses. I indicated at the second reading stage that the Opposition would vote against the day surgery provisions. They are contained in subclause (2) of clause 20 and in clauses 21 and 22. The Opposition will vote against those. But because clause 20 has two parts, one of which we oppose and one of which we do not, it is not possible simply to vote against the whole of clause 20. On the basis of your advice, Mr Temporary Chairman, I have moved the formal amendment to allow the mechanism whereby the Opposition will vote against subclause (2) of clause 20 by seeking to leave it out.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Opposition has said that it agrees with the Government's proposal but that we had not consulted widely enough. Therefore it will vote against part of the clause. It has been acknowledged by Senator Puplick in his remarks that the Minister for Community Services and Health (Dr Blewett) has consulted extremely widely but the net may not have been cast as widely as the Opposition wants in terms of exhaustive consultation. We expect these clauses to be carried and we will continue with the consultations as to the application of them. That has been put on the record strongly by the Minister.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator Coulter raised a question-dare I say, a very sensible question too-as to why people would be encouraged to attend hospitals on a day care basis when there are other services or facilities available to take care of them. I have advice that the Minister for Community Services and Health, Dr Blewett, has written to some State health Ministers-one of whom is Caroline Hogg, the Minister for Health in Victoria-indicating that it is desirable to expand the State services to which Senator Coulter has referred and that the Commonwealth is happy to work out a better funding formula to enable that to occur. We have added that extra string to our bow to meet the types of objectives we are setting out in this proposal; that is, that we do not clog the hospital system unnecessarily. This will enable people to be taken care of in their homes where they are among family and friends in a familiar environment. Thus, the strain on public hospital services will be reduced. </PARA>

I understand from the Victorian District Bush Nursing Association that already it is becoming somewhat stretched by providing services to day surgery patients.

<PARA> Page 21, after clause 38, insert the following new clause:</PARA>
<PARA>Limitation of effect</PARA>
<PARA> ``38a. The amendments of the Principal Act contained in sections 37 and 38 of this Act are, by force of this section, deemed repealed on 30 June 1990.''. </PARA>
<PARA>The intention of this amendment is to give effect to the claims which I and others in this place made in the second reading debate-namely, that the Government's proposals to reconstitute the reinsurance fund in the way in which it is intended will only temporarily relieve the problems of the aged and the others whom the Government is expecting to help. As I indicated, initially we were minded to refuse these sections outright. I understand that the Opposition was of a similar mind but has chosen to support these sections and to refer the matters to a committee. We are not opposed to that because we recognise that what the Government has done will, in the short term, help those funds that are in difficulties. But we stress again that it will not solve the problem in the longer term. </PARA>
<PARA> We have sought, successfully, to refer this matter to the Senate Select Committee on Health Legislation and Health Insurance. After it has reported on the general practitioners' reference on the first sitting day in August it will take on this reference dealing with reinsurance and report on that by the first sitting day in March 1990. The intention of this repeal mechanism is that these sections will cease to have effect by 30 June 1990 and the Government will have to give consideration to putting into place some better mechanism to serve the interests of private health insurance in Australia, assuming that the Government does have a commitment to a hybrid system of both public and private insurance. Between the first sitting day in March and 30 June, which is the end of the financial year, the Government will have before it the report of that Senate Select Committee and, hopefully, in devising some more satisfactory scheme, will take into account the recommendations of that Committee. </PARA>
<PARA> As I indicated in the second reading debate, the actuarial calculations in this area are very complex. A number of figures have been put before me, and I am sure before Senator Puplick and others, indicating estimates of price elasticity, premiums and the number of people who may or may not be insured under certain conditions. It is appropriate that those matters be considered by the Committee. In taking those things into account over the months that will be available to the Committee, hopefully the Committee will be able to make a recommendation which will lead to a much better solution to the problem which has emerged than the solution which the Government is now recommending. So I commend to the Committee the insertion of clause 38a and point out that it is complementary to the reference of the reinsurance matter to the Senate Committee and to the reporting date of that Committee by the first sitting day in March, which has already been agreed. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Opposition will support the amendment moved by Senator Coulter, which effectively provides a sunset clause on the Government's bandaid operations in relation to health reinsurance arrangements in this country. As I said yesterday, the Government's proposals in this legislation will do nothing to achieve long term improvements in the private health insurance system. They will do nothing to protect the insured aged from further increases in contribution rates. Indeed, they are more likely to make the system chronically worse by driving good risks out of the private health insurance system. Who can blame the young and the healthy for looking at their personal finances when faced with yet another rise and future rises in health fund contribution rates and deciding that they will have to opt out because they are no longer willing to pay that cost on top of the 1.25 per cent Medicare levy which the Government is ripping out of their taxable income without any relief and without their being able to do anything about it?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Between September 1983 and March 1989 the proportion of the population covered by private health insurance had fallen from something like 62.7 per cent to 46.2 per cent, meaning that-taking into account that drop in insured numbers and adding population growth-there are now 2.751 million more Australians dependent on Medicare than there were in September 1983. As I said yesterday, for every one per cent drop in those privately insured, the public sector ends up having to bear an additional cost of between $80m and $90m. The arrangements proposed, including the quick fix $20m sudden contribution, like some death-bed repentance, to the reinsurance pool, are not going to solve this particular problem. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Coulter, quite rightly, makes the point that there has been some toing and froing on the determination of how these provisions should be dealt with. We have indicated that that $20m quick fix was quite unreasonable. After all, in the last five years the Government has withdrawn something like $430m in assistance from those people who have had and maintained private health insurance, an amount equivalent to something like $2.74 per contributor per week. This $20m reinsurance contribution over the next 18 months will equal about 8c per contributor per week. I think that is a clear indication of the way in which the Government has proceeded in this matter. </PARA>
<PARA> The original view that these provisions should be opposed led to a situation in which the Government and some of its political supporters mounted a campaign which can only be described as outrageous, designed to put fear into the sick and the elderly; to indicate to them that the failure of the Senate to pass this legislation would somehow lead to real problems for them as individuals, prejudice their health care and prejudice their quality of life. That dishonest and disreputable campaign, using the aged and the sick for these political purposes, was not one of the more edifying spectacles of public policy conducted in the last couple of years. </PARA>
<PARA> I appreciate that concerns are held by people in the private insurance sector about this sunset clause, but the fact that somebody decides to get into bed with the Government does not guarantee a peaceful night's sleep. The Government is not going to get a simple blank cheque for an endless arrangement without proper review. I make it quite clear that the Opposition parties are absolutely committed not only to achieving better private health care arrangements in Australia but also to facilitating the entry of a greater number of people into private health insurance arrangements. We want to see more people privately insured. When we have the opportunity shortly to release our health and health insurance policies, that will be quite evident. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Coulter has rightly pointed out that a large number of these matters will now be the subject of inquiry by the Senate Select Committee on Health Legislation and Health Insurance. That will report, in terms of the timetable which was laid down the other day, if my memory serves me correctly, by the first sitting day of March 1990. Senator Coulter then said, speaking to his amendment, that between March 1990 and 30 June 1990 the Government will have to consider the advice and recommendations of that Committee and determine whether it wishes the system simply to lapse, which would be the effect of this amendment, or whether it wishes to relegislate in precisely the same form, in which case it will have to come back to the Parliament, or relegislate in some amended form on the basis of the evidence and advice that the Senate Select Committee will give as a result of its inquiry. </PARA>
<PARA> I think that is a perfectly proper way to proceed. We do not believe that the system proposed is a satisfactory one. The Government has now been given, in effect, a 12-month period to look quite closely at what it sees as the ongoing issues to be resolved in terms of health insurance and health care arrangements. It will then be the responsibility of the Government to determine whether it will relegislate or simply allow the system to pass out of existence. Needless to say, should the Government have the courage to call a general election prior to that date, the Opposition parties will be in a position to put in place our own health policies as far as this matter is concerned. It is perfectly proper that we should not consider ourselves bound on an ongoing basis by the unsatisfactory arrangements which the Government has made and is now putting into legislative form in the Community Services and Health Legislation Amendment Bill. It is for those purposes that we support the amendment moved by Senator Coulter. It will force the Government to face up to fundamental questions rather than to continue with its bandaid approach, which has been the hallmark of its approach to questions of health insurance and reinsurance arrangements in the last 12 months. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I recognise that in this chamber a coalition of parties is ranged against the Government. The Liberal Party of Australia, since we came to government in 1983, has had five shadow Ministers for community services and health and six different policies, some of which it could not make add up. The Liberal Party is opposed to us. Then, unabashedly and unashamedly, there is the National Party of Australia. It is opposed to us, and the less said about that the better. What I cannot understand is why the Australian Democrats are opposed to us, but they are. With this conjunction of opposition, I have to recognise that the Government does not have the numbers and is likely therefore to lose. But before we go down, if that be our fate, let me address some remarks to the Democrats as to why I think they ought, prior to casting their votes, to think again about this issue.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In this chamber, last night and today, the Democrats have taken from the Government important amendments that it wanted to put through for general practitioners and health reinsurance. The Democrats have sent those proposals to a committee to inquire into them. Thus the reforms the Government wanted to make have been delayed. Thus the outcome for the future for general practitioners and health reinsurance is uncertain. The organisations which have induced this uncertainty, legislatively and in the wider community, are not the Government but those who have voted together to bring about this result. What now is being proposed is not necessary because, when the Senate select committee reports at the end of its inquiry, if there were no carriage of this motion, the Government would be still in a position of having to make a decision based on the report and acting on that decision. But this means that the proposals will fall to the floor by 1 July. That imposes on the Government and, I believe, the community a number of undesirable events. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me go to the administrative undesirables before I go to the policy undesirables. The first administrative undesirable is that the report of the select committee will be due by 1 March. Honourable senators opposite expect us to have developed a response to that report and to have consulted widely. In the last division we were accused of not consulting widely enough. Albeit we consulted 23 different organisations, that still was not wide enough. Honourable senators opposite want us to consult widely and to conclude those consultations in time to have the parliamentary draftsmen draft legislative change, have us bring it to the chamber and get passage in both Houses, contend with the capricious nature of this chamber, get final passage, and have the legislation under royal assent by 1 July. </PARA>
<PARA> The Democrats have never been in government and may never be in government, but I put to the Senate that that is an unreasonable imposition to place on government and because of its tight boundaries on time, it imposes on the whole of the community a considerable anxiety as to the future of health matters and reinsurance. Whether we will be able to meet the timetable is a significant problem. </PARA>
<PARA> The second objection I ask the Democrats to consider goes to the very nature of this chamber. By seeking a sunset provision like this, this chamber can be said to be seeking to be the primary legislative body. This chamber is a review chamber. It is not where the Government is formed; it is where legislation proposed by the Government is considered, reviewed and sent back for further consideration by the Government. The proposed amendment tries to harness this chamber as the primary legislative source and the one which will control the fate of legislation. I think that is unreasonable. The Senate may review these provisions, by all means, but it should not put the Government in a position in which it cannot govern. I raise that as a principled objection. </PARA>
<PARA> But let me go to the practical effect. What are the policy objections? In this legislation we have concentrated on delivering to the health insurance industry long and strong signals that enable the industry to act in a stable and ongoing way to provide continuity and to be able to work its tables out so that people know what the payments will be and what they will be into the future. This sunset provision removes that long term security and stability of the industry and plunges it into a position in which it can work its actuarial calculations only for one year, because that is the only period for which it has any certainty. After the year is up, who knows what will happen? Who knows how the industry can spin its wheels and calculate its figures to see what the new set of fees will be? That is an unreasonable thing to impose not only for the health insurance industry but for those who are consumers and have voluntarily decided to take out extra health insurance. This anxiety has been raised by pensioner organisations, by the voluntary health funds themselves on behalf of pensioners and by the wider constituency of those health funds. </PARA>
<PARA> The Democrats should consider the sunset provision in view of the fact that instability and constant anxiety and capriciousness is bad government-or at least the Liberals and the Nationals should consider the provision in that light. They should deliver some stability and certainty to the industry so that it can go ahead and make its calculations. If there is a need later, after the inquiry and its report, to modify at the margin, we can do so; but not on a basis that they are chopped off after one year and the whole thing is plunged into some sort of chaos. </PARA>
<PARA> If this amendment is carried and goes back to the House of Representatives, the Government will seek to reject it there and the legislation will have to come back here again. I do not say that lightly. It is a significant problem. The Government will not resile from its position. We will then be required to have another debate on this issue. I say those things to the Democrats and ask them, before proceeding on this issue, finally to reconsider some of those principles and make a decision in the interests of the industry, the wider community and some degree of stability. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me conclude by referring to some of Senator Puplick's remarks. I find his remark that the Liberal Party is about better health care very odd indeed. That may well be the rhetoric the Liberal Party engages in. We just had a burst of it a minute ago. That is what members of the Liberal Party say, but political organisations are judged not so much by what they say but by what they do. What was the record of the Liberal Party during the Fraser years? Can anyone remember how many times Medibank, as it was then, was changed, the health arrangements were altered, people were forced into private health insurance that led, finally, to crippling burdens, and where the sense of equity that we have introduced in Medicare was removed from the community? Can we remember back in those days?</PARA>
<PARA> The Liberal Party says it wants better private health care. What is that code for? It is code for Andrew Peacock saying, `Yes, there is a need in the wider economy to cut government expenditure further'. He said this many times in the lead-up to his leadership challenge, but very little since his election because he wants to fudge and cloud this issue. Where will he cut expenditure? In set-piece speeches in which he has had a considered view to put-so he is not being doorstopped; he has not had a question popped at him out of the blue and made a false response-he has said that he will find cuts in the Medicare and health care areas, in the welfare area. That means that more and more of the burden of health costs go on to the shoulders of the wider community. Because the distribution of incomes is unequal, but the imposition of the burden will be equal, those who are least able to afford it will pay most and they will be put in real jeopardy. That is the Liberal Party's position. Why would a Labor Government, committed to social equity, connive to bring about that result? We will not do so. We will not be put in a position in which we shift the cost back on to those who can least afford it. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Puplick made the quite remarkable argument that he is concerned about the anxiety that has been created among less fortunate people in the community. That is a very patronising view, because it assumes absolutely that the pensioner organisations do not have a true perception of their self- interest, that the pensioner organisations that have been lobbying Senator Puplick, this Government and, I believe, the Australian Democrats do not know what they are lobbying the parties about. Of course, they know. Of course, they know the risk to their constituents that those sorts of changes, if brought about, would create. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Puplick's argument also presupposes that the voluntary health insurance organisations do not know what is in their real interest. He concluded by saying that he would not be bound by the ongoing values of the Labor Party. That may also be code for saying that the Opposition does not support the community rating principle. The Government wants to see the community rating principle continue. That principle requires a brief explanation. Because older people are more likely to get sick and require medical attention more often, some people are lobbying for the amount they pay for health insurance to be related to the frequency with which they go to hospital and for the cost of insurance not to be calculated right across the population, including all types of people, ages and income groups who take up private health insurance. That would mean that younger, fitter people would pay less while older people, prone to ill health, would pay more. There is a strong lobby to turn over the community rating principle and Senator Puplick has said that he does not want to be bound by the ongoing values of the Government. Why does he not come out and clearly say that he does not want the community rating principle enshrined, because that is what he is saying?</PARA>
<PARA> I can understand why someone who takes an administrative or a rationally logical and narrow approach-such as an Australian Democrat-would move a sunset provision like this. But to do so narrowly is to do so blinkeredly and to do so blinkeredly, without taking account of the wider landscape and the impact that a blinkered decision would have on that wider landscape, is bad policy, bad decision-making and just plain wrong. Therefore, I ask the three parties to reconsider their support for this amendment; I ask that it be defeated. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister is certainly a good speaker, but not a good logician. He pointed to the way in which the elderly have become concerned and picked up Senator Puplick for drawing attention to that concern in a paternalistic manner. Nonetheless, those very groups which lobbied me and, I guess, Senator Puplick, are very concerned about the long term consequences of what the Government has proposed. They have certainly said to me that they do not expect the changes included in this legislation to provide a long term solution, and they are looking to a long term solution. When I put to them the proposition that one way of achieving that was to get these matters off to a committee, get that committee to report by March and put in a sunset clause forcing the Government to reconsider this matter between March and the end of the financial year, they were totally in agreement because they recognised that there was no long term solution in what the Government was proposing.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The second point that the Minister made was that the industry needs some certainty. By God, the industry certainly does need some certainty. The industry on both sides of this debate is saying that it does not mind whether it has community rating, risk rating, or whether the Government does or does not put in money, but it wants to know exactly what the Government has in mind for the insurance industry, both public and private, over the next five years so that it can properly plan its premiums and claims regimen. The Government has certainly not maintained a stable regimen for the industry since it came to office. In debate yesterday both Senator Puplick and I pointed out the way in which the Government has run down the reinsurance pool. I mention those figures again: $100m in 1983, reduced to $20m in 1984 and 1985, down to $5m in 1986, and $1m in 1987, 1988 and 1989. It is not at all surprising that the older funds that now have more elderly patients among their ranks are finding it difficult to continue to meet the claims and are getting into difficulty because their premiums were based on a regimen which no longer obtains. It no longer obtains because the Government has changed the basic system. </PARA>
<PARA> The further irrationality in what the Minister said was that there was no need to have a sunset clause because the Government could take on board what the committee recommended and could then change the system in the light of that. If the Government is going to change the system the same instability will obtain. We are saying to the Government quite clearly that what it now proposes will provide a short term benefit, but a very short term one. The Government is going down this road because it is a way of simply getting it past the next election-if that election is about March next year-before the system simply collapses and further changes have to be made. It is a political exercise. We are saying to the Government that if the inquiry shows that the present system does have the seeds of long term stability, the Government can simply persist with that. It can reintroduce those clauses. We believe that that will not be the case, that the Government will have to change its system quite significantly. </PARA>
<PARA> Thirdly, the Minister claimed that the Senate is a House of review, but seemed to imply that in that review it is not within our ambit to change any part of the legislation. Clearly, if we are a House of review it must be within our ability to change legislation, to call legislation into question, to reject certain parts of it and to amend other bits. I have no difficulty at all with the belief that the Government is formed in the other House but the Senate has a perfect right when it is considering this legislation to put sunset clauses in certain sections to force the Government to reconsider those parts of the legislation which we do not think serve the public interest for a longer period. I am quite unconvinced by the Minister's words. He showed a remarkable lack of logic in his argument and we will certainly stick with the insertion of the sunset clause. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The criticisms the Minister made of this proposal can be quite easily answered. First the Minister said, `Oh, it is altogether a short timetable. It is too difficult for us to do something in three months. It is too difficult for this Government to consider a matter, to respond to it, to make policy decisions and to get legislation drawn up'. I say to the Minister that if he, his officers, his Department, the Attorney-General's Department and all the rest of them are so tired and incompetent that they cannot manage something in three months it certainly is about time that they gave the game away and allowed somebody who does have the capacity to move with expedition in these areas to get on with the job.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Secondly, the Minister said, `This is a House of review', by which he means, `Of course, you can have a look at all sorts of things but please don't do anything'. The legislative responsibility which lies upon this chamber, lies upon it quite simply because the House of Representatives under his Government and administration is not a legislative chamber at all. This piece of legislation was after all steamrolled through the House of Representatives under guillotine. If there is to be any protection of the rights of the people of Australia to have passed legislation which is decent, so long as the House of Representatives is treated with the contempt that it is by the Government, it will fall properly upon this chamber to discharge its legislative responsibility and to do so adequately. </PARA>
<PARA> I can understand Senator Cook's particular sensitivity in this matter. When it comes to things such as disallowing parts of ordinances and regulations and when it comes to export control orders or whatever it happens to be, Senator Cook is monumentally embarrassed by the fact that this chamber has the legislative power to take action-a power upheld in the courts. Senator Cook has always attempted to pretend that it is a power that did not exist and to tell this chamber that it did not exist. He is monumentally embarrassed to find that it does exist and that this chamber is prepared to exercise its proper constitutional authority as and when it sees fit. </PARA>
<PARA> The third question Senator Cook raised was: what is the position of long term stability? How will people know what the table arrangements will be? From a government that told us some time ago that there was going to be a one per cent Medicare levy and all of a sudden it was a 1.25 per cent Medicare levy-who knows what it will be next time around?-to start talking about certainty in particular matters of financial planning is just risible. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister said, `Well, it will go down to the House of Representatives and the House of Representatives will reject it and send it back here'. If that is so, we will wait; that is what we are paid for. We are paid to be here as legislators. If the House of Representatives wants to send the measure back to us, we will wait until it does, we will then consider it and we will make an appropriate determination. Nobody on this side of the chamber has the slightest objection to that. Nobody is in the least bit intimidated in that matter. </PARA>
<PARA> Then the Minister said, `What is the Liberal Party's record in these sorts of things?'. Let me simply remind the Minister that from the year ended 30 June 1977 to the year ended 30 June 1983 the previous Liberal Government contributed $525m to the reinsurance arrangement. From 30 June 1984 to 30 June 1989 his Labor Government contributed $48m. If he wants to compare contributions by various governments to assist to spread the burden and to provide some equity in the system, the facts speak for themselves. </PARA>
<PARA> This Government simply cannot claim any virtue on the question of social equity. The number of people dependent upon Medicare arrangements continues to rise; the number of people without homes continues to rise; the number of kids living in the streets of our cities continues to rise; the number of people living in poverty continues to rise; all of the measures of disadvantage continue to rise under this Government, which then claims that it has some sort of magic wand for social equity. Again, the facts speak for themselves. The electorate knows the truth of this matter and the hollowness of the Minister's claims. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, the Minister said, `Well, what is the position with community rating?'. He tried to draw all sorts of red herrings over the trail. Nothing that has been said by me, or by any spokesman on behalf of the Opposition and nothing that has appeared in any Opposition policy fundamentally derogates from the principle of community rating. The Minister, if he actually sticks to telling the truth, will find no capacity to confuse that particular issue in the minds of the Australian electorate. </PARA>
<PARA> I therefore conclude by saying that we are unmoved by what the Minister said in relation to Senator Coulter's amendment. However, I seek to raise with the Minister a question which can be answered by a simple yes or no. I ask whether the $20m is being paid directly into the reinsurance pool or whether any attempt is being made to pay it into the closed funds or to anybody else rather than putting it through the pool. I also ask whether money paid into the pool will be used to cushion the position of the closed funds or whether any attempt will be made to short-circuit that arrangement. The Minister can simply respond yes or no to whether that $20m is to be paid directly into the pool or is to be paid in some other fashion. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to speak to two of the Bills in this package, the Social Security and Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment Bill 1989 and the Social Security and Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1989. There are some important points that need to be made for the purposes of assessing the Government's performance in this area. The Bills implement the 12 April economic statement and deal specifically with family payments-namely, family allowances and the family allowance supplement, rental assistance and indexation of pensions, benefits and family payments. The changes announced in the 12 April economic statement were welcomed by the Opposition in many ways but they only went a small way towards redressing the severe losses that Australian families have suffered at the hands of this Hawke Government since it has been in office. But it has put the plight of families right back on the agenda. That has been largely at the instigation of the Opposition, the coalition parties, which through the document Future Directions has put great stress on families and the important role they play within the community. They are the very fabric of our society.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The coalition has always been aware of the importance of the family in Australian society. We recognise the changing needs of families in all their various configurations. It is important to note also that the family allowance was a Fraser Government initiative. It is good that this Government has reflected in its own policies the importance of this Fraser initiative. But simple financial assistance at the margin can never solve the problems that we face in the important area of obtaining social justice. The Government has failed in all its initiatives to meet its desired `fair go for all' policy. It is only under a coalition Government that we will see that fair go for all Australians established. It is only now that the Government, thanks to the Opposition, has been dragged reluctantly, if all too late, into recognition of the fact that Australian families are bleeding and have been haemorrhaging since the Labor Party has occupied the government bench. </PARA>
<PARA> For a family with a single average weekly income, a dependent spouse and two dependent children the real standard of living in terms of disposable income rose between 1977 and 1982. In recent years real disposable income has fallen to a critical degree. The tax cuts announced by Mr Keating on 12 April will mean slightly higher living standards for average families in 1989 compared with last year, but will leave them considerably below their real standard of living in 1982 and even 1977. The tax cuts, totalling $4.9 billion, are considerably less than the $10 billion the Government has collected in bracket creep alone, not to mention all the new taxes over the last several years including the soon to be debated superannuation taxes. Australia's debt has risen; everyone is concerned and aware of the monumental figures. What does this mean to Mr and Mrs Average Australia? There are slightly more broken down figures showing that, for example, in 1985 34c of every export dollar earned was paid in overseas commitments; now the first 63c in every dollar we earn is owed to the rest of the world. </PARA>
<PARA> A study carried out by the Institute of Applied Economic and Social Research at the University of Melbourne has demonstrated that 13 per cent of income units were in poverty in 1986 compared with 10.5 per cent only four years earlier. Today 2.6 million households-one in every eight-live in poverty. This is hardly a record of which this Government can be proud. </PARA>
<PARA> This package of Bills is aimed at giving support to families. We applaud and approve of that objective. But the most appalling fact is that about 800,000 children are living in poverty. The tragedy of child poverty has become a major issue in both social and political debate. These young Australians have been the real victims of the plummeting living standards over which this Government has presided for the past six years. We are told by the Brotherhood of St Laurence that, compared with other Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development countries, with the exception of the United States of America, we have the highest child poverty rate. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Hawke's claim that the Government has eradicated child poverty is a scandalous statement because it engenders a very real danger of complacency. Yet, the Government claims that it has eradicated child poverty in accordance with its much vaunted claim in 1987 that there would be no child poverty by 1990. The introduction of the family allowance supplement has assisted approximately only 30 per cent of these 800,000 children. The Social Welfare Research Centre at the University of New South Wales estimates that, even after housing costs are paid and other ameliorating influences are taken into account, some 400,000 children will remain in poverty. It is an appalling record for a country such as ours. Child poverty has become endemic to Australian society and simply will not be remedied by a limited income support system. It is too little and it is too late. We have to address other areas such as housing, employment, and education. Overall, we have to address the entire economic situation. </PARA>
<PARA> People need a roof over their heads. They need to be warm in winter. Housing poverty in Australia is concentrated particularly among families with dependent children-both couples and sole parents-and those in the rental market are most severely affected. Despite the housing crisis and the existence of 195,000 families on the public housing waiting lists around Australia, the Government took no action to increase housing assistance in its economic statement, except for a meagre rental allowance increase. As I said the improvements which these Bills will bring about in terms of the family allowance supplement are to be commended. But there is no way that the assistance package can tackle the enormous rent blow-outs that exist in Sydney and Melbourne alone. That, together with the average mortgage repayment which has increased by some $500 a month since 1983, means that people are finding it more difficult to obtain housing. Research done by the Salvation Army estimates that some four million families in Australia are affected by this problem. It is not just a matter of families tightening their belts a little; it is a question of making life extraordinarily difficult for them as they try to keep a roof over their heads. Major Elizabeth Johnson of the Salvation Army said:</PARA>
<PARA>Housing is the biggest social problem in our community. It is not just the case of people not owning their own homes-it is the case of people not having any home-it is the case of people being exploited-it is the case of people living in poor conditions-it is the case of people living in poverty after paying housing costs. </PARA>
<PARA>As I said, there are now 195,000 families waiting for public housing in Australia. The statistics on housing provided by the Australian Council of Social Service highlight the point. The waiting periods for public housing are extending. Twenty per cent of home purchasers are paying more than 30 per cent of their income in home repayments. Forty per cent of private renters pay more than 30 per cent of their income in rent. This is especially so for sole parents. The minimum threshold income necessary for first purchasers to buy into the market has risen from 85 per cent of average weekly earnings in 1982 to 145 per cent in 1987. It is no wonder that people need an increase in rental assistance. </PARA>
<PARA> Australians are now facing crippling high interest rates which the Prime Minister simply tells them they have to endure. It is no good blaming the banks, as many protesters-the Australians who are being hurt-have been doing in meetings around Australia. The Government determines what the interest rates will be. It is deliberate Government policy. There is no-one to blame but Mr Hawke and his Government. His only response is to say, `You've got to hurt a bit more'. Australia cannot afford the social cost of ignoring these problems. It cannot afford the long term health costs or the cost in terms of crime. Some people have to engage in criminal activities in order to survive and this is a tragic waste of human resources. But the Government does not say that it will assist these people. </PARA>
<PARA> I draw attention to the employment issues. Since 1982, the greatest proportional increases in unemployment rates have been in respect of families with three or more children. The duration of unemployment for people seeking full time work is now 47 weeks-a 23 per cent increase from March 1983. The Government claims to have created 1.2 million new jobs. This ignores the fact that we need at least 60,000 new jobs a year just to keep up with the population growth and school leavers. The Institute of Family Studies points to the increase in employment, which means that many one-income families have become two-income families. Many families have been put into this position not because they wish to be but because they can no longer make ends meet on one income-they have been forced to become two-income families. Despite all the rhetoric, the average unemployment level for the Hawke Government has been 8.5 per cent compared with 6.1 per cent for the Fraser years. </PARA>
<PARA> As I said, almost 40 per cent of long-term unemployment beneficiaries have three or more children, yet children are our most precious resource. Teenage unemployment is still higher than 20 per cent in some places in Australia. For example, 50 per cent of the unemployed in Ballarat are under 25 years of age, and the total employment rate for the area is twice the national average. </PARA>
<PARA> The disgracefully high numbers of children living in poverty demonstrate clearly the failure of the Government to address the real needs of young Australians. They expose the Prime Minister's promise made in the heat of the 1987 election campaign that `No child will live in poverty by 1990'. It was a political stunt of the cheapest and cruellest kind. Surveys have been taken on how credible the Government is when it makes statements concerning that expectation. An overwhelming number of people polled were cynical about the Government's statements and intentions. In a recent Saulwick poll, 85 per cent of voters said that it was unlikely that the Prime Minister's promise would be reached by next year. More than half believed that the proportion of children living in poverty had increased since the promise was made. Eighty-five per cent of Labor voters believed that the promise would not be met. Even the Australian Labor Party faithful do not believe any longer in the rhetoric of this Government. </PARA>
<PARA> Can anyone honestly blame these people for not trusting this Government? The economy is off the rails, average Australian families are experiencing crippling high mortgage interest rates and there have been critical reductions in their real disposable incomes. This is a policy which this Government trumpets as the only tool it has to arrest our deteriorating economy. This is the Government that has let people's anger be diverted to the banks. The Government tries to hide behind a shield when it is in fact implementing a high interest rate policy. Is it any wonder that Australian voters think children have suffered and that there is no way that the cheap election promise made in 1987 can ever be delivered? Australian living standards have been significantly eroded under Labor due to bracket creep, high inflation, high interest rates and massive increases in indirect taxation. It is significant that many of the benefits introduced in these Bills are indexed. That alone is an admission that inflation is something which this Government cannot control. </PARA>
<PARA> In considering the validity of the promise made by this Government to eradicate child poverty, and in looking at this package of financial assistance in the context of a problem that needs to be dealt with, I think it is significant to look at the Burdekin report into homeless youth and some of its significant findings. The Burdekin report conservatively estimates that 25,000, and possibly as many as 70,000, Australian children have no homes and are living in abject poverty. The April statement took no steps towards increasing assistance to the thousands of homeless children. At the same time it ignores the severe disadvantages suffered by Aboriginal children. The report states:</PARA>
<PARA> There has been an almost complete failure to satisfactorily address the needs of our children and many of these kids, I must tell you, are living in the most appalling conditions and in some cases, tragically, they are literally dying. </PARA>
<PARA>The strong report from Mr Brian Burdekin-the Commissioner for Human Rights and Equal Opportunity-of the inquiry into youth homelessness, is an indictment of this Government. The report, in criticising the implementation of policies concerning youth, says that there is a lack of information about the youth allowance; there is discouragement of inquiries by departmental staff attitudes; there are breaches of individual privacy and insensitive assessment processes; there are complex application procedures including the time and effort that are required to succeed and there is a requirement for multiple forms for identification and verification procedures. The report goes on and on. </PARA>
<PARA> As I said, this package of Bills deals not only with the question of family payments and the indexation of those payments, the family allowance and the family allowance supplement, but also with pensioners and with making changes to the automatic adjustment of social security benefits in line with the movement of the consumer price index (CPI). The automatic twice-yearly indexation of standard pension levels was introduced by the coalition government in May 1977. Each year pension rates were increased in May and November by the increase in the CPI in the six months to the previous December or June, as was relevant. In the 1986 Budget, the Government decided that pensioners should also share in the belt tightening, the same belt tightening that is producing unprecedented high interest rates for home mortgages. The Government expects that the delay in the twice-yearly CPI adjustments of an additional six weeks for wage earners should also be experienced by pensioners. In generosity linked to the fact that there could be an election some time later this year or early next year, plus the fact that the Government is well and truly on the nose with most pensioners, it has had a change of heart. </PARA>
<PARA> Given that as the background, the Government has decided that pensioners will not only be spared that six-week wait, but in future the CPI adjustments will be brought forward in three steps, so pension rises will be paid in March and September each year; that is, by 1990 pensions will be indexed every three months following the CPI announcements. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Because it did not have to face an election in the very near future. Senator Watson has made an excellent point. It is interesting to note the following promise made by the Prime Minister in his 1983 election speech:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Pensions will be adjusted on the basis of the immediately preceding six-month CPI movement to cut the present lag of four months to one month. </PARA>
<PARA>In its seven years of government, Labor has spectacularly broken that promise by blowing out the time lag to six months instead of reducing it to one month, and only by late 1990 will it have reduced it to one month from what it was in 1983, still two months behind schedule. While the repeal of the six-week delay and the speeding up of index- ation increases is welcome, Labor has done nothing to compensate pensioners for the massive monetary losses experienced since it came to power. Since 1986, the additional six-week delay has cost single pensioners $132.90 and married pensioners $108.60 each. The six-month pension indexation delay under Labor has cost the average single pensioner $845 and married pensioners $692 each. </PARA>
<PARA> Whilst we welcome the repeal under the veterans' affairs legislation of the 2 per cent discounting of Commonwealth superannu- ation and Defence Force retirement and death benefit pensions from 1 November 1989, Commonwealth superannuants will have lost up to $320 in the meantime. They will not get the 2 per cent back-it is lost for all time under this Government. Indeed, it was only the last line in the 12 April statement that dealt with this pension, so it would be fair to ask: `Was it an afterthought? Was there any real concern?'. I think not. The Government used the rationale that superannuation pensions had increased more than wages and that restraint imposed upon wage earners should be extended to superannuation pensions. However, according to the Superannuated Commonwealth Officers Association, under the Hawke Government superannuation pensions before tax have eroded by more than 5 per cent in comparison with the average wage. The warm inner glow booklet which accompanies the April statement, Towards a Fairer Australia, summarises the pension changes as follows:</PARA>
<PARA>These changes to pension and tax arrangements for pensioners demonstrate the high priority which the Government places on assisting the aged and other pensioners and of ensuring that such assistance is directed to those in greatest need. </PARA>
<PARA>In the past, automatic indexation has been related only to the standard age pension but with the April statement, additional benefits for mothers' allowances, family allowances et cetera, will also be increased, although they will be adjusted only once a year, in January, for CPI increases in the previous financial year. In the April statement the Government announced that pensioners for the next financial year, commencing 1 July 1989, can earn up to $25 a week for a single pensioner and $70 a week for a married couple, without paying tax or losing any of their pension. Yet the pensioner rebate levels will not be announced until the Budget is brought down. The income earned between 1 July and Budget day, likely to be in the third week of August, will be paid without knowledge of the new pensioner tax rebates, resulting in a free loan by some pensioners to the Government over at least a seven-week period. </PARA>
<PARA> This is yet another example of government by press release which has enmeshed this Parliament in so many poor pieces of legislation and which has caused uncertainty in the community and uncertainty for the citizenry. The Prime Minister, the Acting Treasurer, the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Dawkins), and the Minister for Social Security (Mr Howe) cannot grasp the complicated interaction of the social security and taxation systems. Many questions have been put on these issues in the lower House, and they have remained unanswered. We see, in this package of Bills before us today, the implementation of the 12 April statement. As I said, the Opposition welcomes the assistance that is given, but condemns it for being too little too late. It also says, and says firmly, that it is the action of the coalition which has firmly put the question of the family back on the agenda. The Government cannot solve the problems of pressures on families, on homeless youth and on pensioners simply by some tinkering with financial assistance at the edges. </PARA>
<PARA> It needs a properly addressed system of policies which will put this economy back on the rails and address the problems of housing and education-the real problems that the Australian people face. The anger of the Australian people against this Government is real. No end of subterfuge or trying to blame the messenger-be it the banks, the Burdekin report, Our Homeless Children, or anybody else-will save the Government from the people's wrath. We welcome the assistance that is given but the Government stands condemned for the false promises it made in 1987 to eradicate child poverty. It will not do it; it will use some specious method of benchmarks to try to say that it has been done. But the Australian people know it has not been done and it will not be done. This Government will pay for that when the election is called. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Before I go to the substance of what I plan to say this afternoon a few allegations need dealing with immediately. From what Senator Bishop has been telling us it is quite clear that she totally fails to understand the process in which this Government has been engaged, not for the last three months or for the last six or 12 months, but for some years. I will set out to explain that as carefully and as simply as I can. I should immediately challenge her description of the statement of the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) as scandalous, her accusation that the Government is falling into complacency and that we are tinkering at the edges. For this, I rely not on my opinion, not on the opinions of other members of the Australian Labor Party or, indeed, of the Parliamentary Labor Party, but on the opinion of Bishop Peter Hollingworth, the Executive Director of the Brotherhood of St Laurence, which is acknowledged as an independent expert on family poverty. Very recently on 7 May Bishop Hollingworth, when he gave the George Syme Oration to the Royal Australasian College of Surgeons, said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>In strict income security terms it is true that the Prime Ministerial promise that `no children shall live in poverty by 1990' will be achieved. This represents significant progress, and demonstrates that governments can meet some modest social justice objectives, even at a time of economic restraint when they are involved in public sector cutbacks and tax reduction in order to improve their economic efficiency. </PARA>
<PARA>The Brotherhood of St Laurence, of the Promise the Children campaign, also said:</PARA>
<PARA>This pledge, the most specific social commitment of the century, has been the subject of a historic package to provide a guaranteed minimum income for poor children whose parents earn less than about $300 a week. We congratulate the Federal Government on its work on child poverty, which represents a historic breakthrough in the national attack on child poverty. The Federal Government has now built a solid foundation of income security for Australian families. </PARA>
<PARA>How did this most specific social commitment of this century come to occur? I would like to describe exactly how this has happened. It goes back some time. As the Minister for Social Security (Mr Howe) noted in his second reading speech, in 1966 a decision of the Australian Conciliation and Arbitration Commission terminated the long held tradition established by the Harvester decision of 1907 of a male basic wage, which was supposed to fulfil the modest needs of a man, his dependent spouse and two children. There had been crucial flaws in the basic wage as it had been interpreted. These were that the income was never adequate for that prescribed family, that the basic wage was paid to dependent-free males and male heads of large families alike-there was simply no equity in this at all-and that it also allowed a separate lower rate for women on the assumption that women had no dependants. Therefore the basic wage had retarded the introduction of equal pay in most industries for many decades. </PARA>
<PARA> In determining a minimum wage, the Australian Conciliation and Arbitration Commission gave an impetus to pay equity and clearly laid at the door of the Government that the responsibility of ensuring that social security and taxation systems which transferred assistance to low income households with children was to be the successor to what had theoretically been the employer having that responsibility. </PARA>
<PARA> In 1970 Professor Henderson identified the implication of this for public policy making. His report of the Commission of Inquiry into Poverty was instrumental in moves during the Whitlam and Fraser governments, first, to convert tax deductions to rebates and, second, to cash out the rebates and combine them with child endowment to form the family allowance. There was no systematic analysis of such issues for some years, during which most social security payments declined in real terms. Dr Cass's social security review commenced with a thorough study of income support for families and children. It gave us a comprehensive and detailed approach to achieving an assured, adequate, equitable policy for the guidance of the Government. Since the production of that report, I believe in 1985, that document has been used as the basis of the policies which have been put in place over the last three years. </PARA>
<PARA> Dr Cass advocated short term measures, which have now been progressively implemented over the past two years. Firstly, there is the family allowance supplement, which of course is payable to the principal carer of children, directed to the mother in the majority of cases. Secondly, there is a child disability payment, which removes a previous distinction, which meant that many families with disabled children were not being acknowledged as in need of that payment and raised the quantum to $112 per month. Thirdly, there are differential rates for younger and older children, recognising the fact that teenage children are very expensive to maintain. Fourthly, there have been massive increases in payments, which I will go to in a moment. Finally, there has been the integration of family allowance and the family allowance supplement, providing predictability in the extra income upon which people can rely. </PARA>
<PARA> The Social Security and Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment Bill 1989, which puts into place the April statement initiatives of this year, introduces longer term recommendations of Professor Cass. For example, the family allowance increased only a very small amount-from $3.10 to $5.25-during the Fraser years. One small allowance in seven years was the only increase in that particular payment. During the time of the Labor Government it has been increased from $5.25 to $9 for the first, second and third children and $12 for the fourth child and subsequent children. This once again acknowledges the extra cost of older children and larger families. As was advocated by Dr Cass, this will pay a basic family rate-a flat rate-with special recognition for larger families. Almost two million families with a total of 3.8 children will benefit from this increased family allowance payment, which will be indexed. At the same time we have considerably increased and indexed the dependent spouse rebate and the sole parent rebate. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Bishop made really quite cutting remarks about indexation, which she believed was introduced simply as an admission of a failure to reduce or entirely eliminate inflation. It is in fact an acknowledgment of a fact of life-these payments will decrease in their value unless they are indexed. She tells us with great pride that the Fraser Government indexed pensions. I do not quite see what distinction there is between the worth of indexing age pensions and somehow or other the specious quality in indexing payments for families. In any case, this is an absolutely crucial measure which we now introduce. </PARA>
<PARA> At the 1987 election we promised that during Labor's third term an adequate living standard for children would be achieved by raising child payments to ensure that total assistance per child equalled at least 15 per cent of the combined rate of married pension and that the aggregate payment for older children would be at a benchmark of 20 per cent of the combined married pension rate. That standard was set, for the first time in Australia's history. That is what Bishop Hollingworth was referring to when he talked about-as I quoted earlier-`the most specific social commitment of the century and an historic breakthrough' and the fact that we have established a standard. </PARA>
<PARA> I have heard nothing whatsoever from the Opposition about any alternative standard or any analysis of whether the standard is adequate or otherwise. I have heard nothing about whether there should be a standard. I am waiting breathlessly to hear what exactly, if anything, its objection to the standard that has been established is. It was not done lightly. As I have said several times, the standard was set for the first time in Australia's history as a result of Australian research into the income needs of families with children, and it will be maintained in real terms by indexation. That is a matter from which I take considerable satisfaction. I believe that, among other things-at this moment I am not even looking at the equity and social justice of it-it will begin to return Australia to the pre-eminent position we had in international terms many decades ago in the way in which we were able to provide social assistance to our population. </PARA>
<PARA> For the first time we have a guaranteed income which is higher in real terms than that advocated by Professor Henderson. As I said before, we have guaranteed that the aggregate of payment to children up to the age of 12 will be 15 per cent of the combined marriage pension rate, that the aggregate of the payment to children aged from 13 to 15 will be 20 per cent of the combined married pension rate and that-although it is not covered in this Bill-for 16- and 17-year-olds the payment will be 25 per cent of the combined married pension rate. That payment is of enormous significance to homeless youth, who would otherwise, in many cases, have no income maintenance at all. The addition to what has been paid previously to those groups of people will bring them into the realms of real, non-taxed amounts of money which have made a substantial difference to a large number of Australian families and their children. </PARA>
<PARA> The figures quoted by Senator Bishop are ones which she has seen in the newspapers. What she failed to note was that they are 1986 figures, compiled before the introduction of the family allowance supplement at the beginning of 1987. She quoted 800,000 children living in poverty of whom only 30 per cent will be assisted by our measures. At this stage all those children, or their families, should be receiving the family allowance supplement and from 1 July they will receive the increased family allowance. That will make an enormous difference to their standard of living. For younger children the aggregate payment will be $33 per week each and, for older children, $43.10 per week. That is a substantial increase on the previous amount. </PARA>
<PARA> Our commitment to indexation is also breaking new ground. Payments which will be indexed are the family allowance, the mother's/guardian's allowance, and the others to which I referred earlier-the dependent spouse rebate, the sole parent rebate and, I believe, the payment for handicapped children. These payments will be indexed from the first payday in 1990 and then annually in line with consumer price index movements in previous years. The family allowance supplement, additional pension rates and additional benefits will be adjusted from the first payday of each calendar year to ensure that total payments are guaranteed as a percentage of the married pension rate, which is automatically indexed. </PARA>
<PARA> I come back to the point I was making before. This is the benchmark that has been established as a result of very detailed work done in conjunction with the Institute of Family Studies, produced by Professor Cass and decided upon by the Government as an appropriate benchmark, as I have also noted, higher than the one suggested by Professor Henderson; yet we have heard not one word from the Opposition about how it would deal with this challenge. I am particularly amused to discover that Senator Bishop believes that the plight of families is back on the agenda as a result of the production of Future Directions-that Future Directions is responsible for this. I am quite amazed. I was under the impression that the document Future Directions was seen only in the last few months and, as I have pointed out, the work which the Government has been doing on this question goes back some years. This legislation is not a flash in the pan. It has been in preparation for some years. </PARA>
<PARA> As I have said, we have introduced short term and long term measures and have set in place the means whereby the standards should be maintained through indexation so that never again will we be faced with a Budget process in which families get what is left over at the end. We have established and systematised a means whereby we have been able to assess what is required to assist low income families. We have produced the means by which we can assist them. We have also been able through this legislation to introduce a means whereby those payments will retain their worth. </PARA>
<PARA> Talking about Future Directions reminds me that it is accompanied by a most amazing jingle which does not seem to have a great deal of empathy with average Australian families, let alone low income Australian families. The jingle is addressed almost solely to the male of the species. It starts:</PARA>
<PARA>Son, you're an Australian. That's enough for anyone to be. Australia needs plain thinking men like you. </PARA>
<PARA>Further down it states:</PARA>
<PARA>I grew to be a proud man. </PARA>
<PARA>Once again, towards the end it states:</PARA>
<PARA>Son, you're an Australian. </PARA>
<PARA>I believe that that would be quite insulting to many Australian families. There is no doubt about the role of the Australian male, but when we talk about low income families-families in poverty, families in need of particular assistance-we are looking at a great number of families headed by women. We are looking at being able to provide to the principal carer of children, in the vast majority of cases a woman, that assistance, encouragement, secure income and confidence which, in many cases, we hope will take that person back into the work force, out of poverty and into independence. That is by far the best way that anybody has devised so far of lifting households out of poverty.</PARA>
<PARA> As the Minister said in his second reading speech, never again will the standards of living of low income families with children be subject to decimation through policy indolence and lethargy of governments. We will deliver for all children-whether they live in two or one-parent families, whether one parent, both parents or no parent works, or whether they live in institutions. That is the emphasis, the intention, of the package of legislation with which we are dealing today. </PARA>
<PARA> I wish to quote from the Institute of Family Studies' Families and the Tax Package, which states exactly what the Institute believes we are achieving as a result of the April announcements. The Institute states:</PARA>
<PARA>The Government's commitment to increase payments for children to specific benchmarks as a measure against child poverty has been fulfilled. </PARA>
<PARA>There is no doubt about that. There is nothing scandalous or cynical about it; it is a very straight statement of fact. In regard to one of the propositions which we hear every now and then from the Opposition which I believe has been thoroughly discredited, it might be interesting to note what the Institute of Family Studies thinks about income splitting. It has stated:</PARA>
<PARA> Income splitting would provide least assistance to lower and middle income families, especially those on only one income, the group it is purportedly aimed at helping. Indeed such families receiving less than about $19,000 per annum would pay more tax as a result. Sole parent families would receive nothing from such a proposal. </PARA>
<PARA> Approximately 48 per cent of the cost would go to families with incomes above $40,000 per annum and only 6 per cent would go to families with incomes below AWE. </PARA>
<PARA> The income splitting proposal would create very severe work disincentives for married women at a time when the labour market is expanding and requires greater flexibility and a higher skill base rather than new and inappropriate rigidities. </PARA>
<PARA>I include that information in response to Senator Bishop's suggestion of the inability of this Government to initiate interacting measures between taxation and social security which would deal with the problems of families on very low incomes. I have said it several times before but I will say it again: this package of legislation is the result of years of serious analysis and serious policy implementation. Its effects will be felt, maybe, in perpetuity-perhaps that is a little optimistic for any government to predict. </PARA>
<PARA> I now refer to other measures which are to be introduced as a result of this legislation. The Government has decided to ensure that the income test free area for pensioners will become 100 per cent tax free. This will be achieved by setting the pensioner tax rebates at appropriate levels. Pensioners will welcome this measure very strongly. There has been a great deal of anxiety and confusion about taxable income and income test areas. The cost of implementing this measure is not very large and it is well worth introducing. The Government has managed to bring forward the pension indexation increases in three stages-a matter that rankled with many pensioners-so that indexation rates will be brought forward in total by 12 weeks. The Government has made another decision, which has been welcomed very widely by pensioners, that about 750,000 of them will not be paying provisional tax. All pensioners receiving pensioner tax rebates will be exempted from paying provisional tax. </PARA>
<PARA> Other measures that are included in the Bill make it clear that the family of a disabled child is entitled to a child disability allowance regardless of whether the mother or the father cares for the child. That clears up some confusion. There is now an entitlement to a one-off double payment of benefit to ex-prisoners. This entitlement will be extended to former long term beneficiaries who reclaim unemployment benefit on release from prisons within three months of last receiving unemployment benefit. The plight of prisoners who leave prison with no support, no income, is one that has been recognised by this Government. </PARA>
<PARA> Reference has been made to privacy issues by Senator Bishop. Were she to read the Bill, she would be reassured to discover that it will increase penalties for the unauthorised disclosure of client information. The penalties currently provided by the Act on summary conviction for unlawful disclosure are up to six months imprisonment or a $1,000 fine. On indictment an offender can face a gaol term of up to two years or a fine of up to $5,000. This Bill would raise the fines for breaches of the secrecy provisions contained in the Social Security Act to $3,000 on summary conviction and $12,000 on indictment. It must be agreed that those fines provide a very substantial disincentive. </PARA>
<PARA> All members of the Government are extremely gratified by the fact that we have been involved in a process whereby Australian households on low incomes, be they beneficiaries or in receipt of low wages, currently are being substantially assisted, and will be substantially assisted in the future, by what we will be able to do. Many households now receive at least $40 per week tax free which they were not receiving 18 months ago. They can look forward to providing for their children in the knowledge that those payments will continue in line with the benchmark which we have established. Those families know that this Government has their concerns very much at heart. </PARA>
<PARA> We know perfectly well that by assuring incomes we are not eradicating all aspects of poverty. We have no doubt that housing is extremely important. This Government has invested a great deal more in housing than the previous one did. We know that lifting people out of unemployment and into independence is extremely important and many of our measures along these lines have been extremely effective. We know that making it possible for young people to obtain adequate education is one of the best ways in which we can increase opportunities for them. We know, too, that the health of the whole population is absolutely crucial to its overall well-being. In that respect, having heard another debate this morning, I am beginning to feel extremely alarmed about the Opposition's intentions. The future of our national, universal health scheme seems as if it may be in considerable doubt in the hands of other than a Labor government. This lack of recognition by the Opposition of the enormous significance of access by the community to good health services bothers me more than anything else the notion that whoever can pay for good health care gets good health care. I find that particularly disturbing in the context of this debate. This is a Bill which enacts the promises of the Government's April statement. I commend it to the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Does the Minister representing the Treasurer recall the campaign waged by the National Farmers Federation against the Government's 1985 initiatives to rationalise the taxation of fringe benefits? What do Australian Taxation Office statistics indicate about the amount of fringe benefits tax (FBT) paid by the farm sector? Has the incidence of the FBT been such as to place a major burden on Australia's farm sector?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I recall the National Farmers Federation campaign very well. I also recall that the then President of the National Farmers Federation played a high profile role in that campaign against both the capital gains tax and the fringe benefits tax. Of course, it provided Mr McLachlan with a vehicle for obtaining a high profile in the media and among conservative string pullers, on which he apparently continues to ride. I also understand that it used up a great deal of the National Farmers Federation's money and effort.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The statistics that are now available show-and anybody who knew anything about agriculture at the time would have known it anyway-that the FBT had very little effect on farmers; the constituency which Mr McLachlan was purporting to represent. The publication by the Australian Taxation Office Taxation Statistics 1986-87, published late last month, contains a number of tables of statistics on the FBT during the period 1 April 1987 to 31 March 1988. Total FBT collections for that period were $859m and, of that, $15.3m, or 1.8 per cent, was paid by taxpayers in the farm sector. Of course, that included companies and partnerships, as well as sole trader farmers. A little over $2m of that $15m was paid by public companies. So a maximum of $13.3m was paid by farmer taxpayers who can be genuinely regarded as farmers. That means that 1 1/2 per cent of total FBT was paid by--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;If the honourable senator wants to dispute the officially published statistics of the Commissioner of Taxation, that is his affair. Personally, I would not. One and a half per cent of the total FBT was paid by farmers, who account for about 5 1/2 per cent of the work force. Of course, that reveals that the farm sector-as anybody who knows anything about the farm sector or who was concerned about that sector would have known-was not one of those areas in which payments in cash had been converted into payments in kind in order to escape tax. The main area where this sort of thing was rife was among senior executives of large companies, such as Elders-IXL and the South Australian Brewing Co. Ltd-a couple of companies which Mr McLachlan would know all about.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Going back to the first part of the question, at that time Mr McLachlan supported incentives to dodge tax and he fought hard to retain those incentives by converting cash payments into payments in kind. He then used the subscriptions of ordinary farmers to fight a campaign to further his own interests and those of his rich fellow directors-mostly city-based-of companies such as Elders-IXL and the South Australian Brewing Co.</PARA>

I also note the Prime Minister's reference to `the constructive role China has played in our neighbourhood and on the international stage'. I ask: In spreading the so-called good word, has the Government taken into account that China's actions in its most immediate neighbourhood-I refer to its brutal repression of the people of Tibet-are worthy only of condemnation, not praise?

There is no doubt that the Australian Government over a period of years-as have all Australian governments over a period of years-has sought constructive relations with China, has sought to bring China into the sphere of influence, if you like, of countries of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development and has supported, for example, China's application to join various international organisations.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I direct my question to the Minister for Resources. In early 1988 the Government deregulated the market for domestically produced crude oil and removed export controls on crude oils produced in Australia. What have been the benefits of deregulating the crude oil market?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="3971" SPEAKER="Cook Sen The Hon P.F.S." NAMEID="RF4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="WA" MINISTERIAL="RESOURCES" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RF4">Senator COOK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is correct that the Government at the beginning of last year enacted significant micro-economic reform by bringing in a deregulation of the Australian domestic crude oil market. When we took office in 1983 the major proportion of domestic crude oil production was marketed in Australia under a voluntary crude oil allocation scheme whereby shares of production from each field were allocated to each Australian refiner. The price of these sales was set by the Government's import parity pricing policy, as it then was, and production in excess of the allocated quantity could be sold on the domestic free market or exported, although producers were required to obtain approval for each export sale. When we came to power there was a regulated market in Australia, carried on by the Fraser Government, in crude oil production.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In 1988 we enacted the most significant reform in crude oil marketing since the crude oil allocation scheme in 1965 or the import parity pricing scheme in 1978. We did this to bring efficiencies in the refining and distribution of Australian crude and to expose, in a declining self-sufficiency environment, Australian crude oil producers to much more of the international market so that they could read the signals of that market and take their place as exporters or importers, as the case may be, aware of the circumstances of the international climate.</PARA>
<PARA> The deregulation has spawned a number of particular advantages for the Australian refinery industry which I should mention. Not only have Australian producers now become proficient traders on the world market but also, in terms of the refinery area, British Petroleum Co. of Australia Ltd at Kwinana in Western Australia has commissioned a residue cracking unit capable of processing heavier imported crude oils. That is quite significant because Asian crudes contain a high wax content and we now have a capacity in Australia to deal with that. I cannot give the Senate a figure because that is a commercial in confidence investment.</PARA>
<PARA> Ampol Ltd has commenced construction of a platformer at its Lytton refinery in Brisbane which will produce high octane blend stock for unleaded petrol. Investment will be more than $100m and the unit is scheduled for completion in the second half of 1990. The Shell Co. of Australia Ltd plans to undertake investment of $200m for extension and upgrading of the Clyde refinery in Sydney and $400m for a catalytic cracking unit at its Geelong refinery. They are a number of efficiencies that our move to deregulation has induced in the refinery area.</PARA>
<PARA> The Department of Resources' most recent contact with oil producers and refiners to monitor their reaction to the deregulation environment, which is now coming up to its 18-month anniversary, has revealed that what they originally perceived with perhaps reticence and tentativeness is now hailed by them as a necessary, valuable and welcomed reform.</PARA>
<PARA> It is necessary to conclude by saying that this is yet another example of the Government's inexorable move to micro-economic reform of the Australian economy. This micro-economic reform of a market that was regulated under the Liberals and deregulated under this Government has brought about efficiencies and investment. It is a good example of achievement by this Government.</PARA>

Is it because the Minister knew that either of these bodies was likely to produce an unpalatably tough assessment-no doubt to do with deregulation, as we have just heard from Senator Cook-and, just as happened with the Inter-State Commission report on the waterfront, the Government would then be embarrassed because it would not be allowed by the unions to implement the recommendations?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4F4">Senator BUTTON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;If I might say so, that question has a superficial charm about it. But let us look at some of the detail. The answer to the question is yes, the Australian Manufacturing Council has commissioned a consultants' report-both international consultants and Australian consultants-to look at issues associated with both firm and structural competitiveness of the Australian manufacturing sector. That is not a study commissioned by the Government as such; it is commissioned by the Manufacturing Council. The cost of the study will be shared by Commonwealth and State governments and the private sector. A number of firms are contributing to that. The consultancy will undoubtedly focus on a number of issues which go to the competitiveness of individual firms and firm performance. I welcome that as a contribution to an ongoing discussion about these issues.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Why was it not referred to the IAC? I do not think any of the businesses involved or the State governments would have wanted to refer it to the IAC. I do not think the subject is within the province of the IAC in terms of the breadth of the inquiry that is being conducted. The Bureau of Industry Economics does not have the function of looking at these issues in the broad. We could set up, if you like, a competitive evaluation by the Bureau of Industry Economics, but a lot of the issues which are being looked at are not, in my view, susceptible to the wisdom of classical economists. That is why it is being done in that way.</PARA>
<PARA> Senator Lewis asked whether there is some apprehension that, if it were referred to the IAC, we might get a tough report. This Government has had plenty of tough reports. In respect of the traditional role of the IAC in looking at the burdens imposed on highly protected industries, on export industries, I believe that this Government has adopted something like 96 per cent of IAC recommendations. There have been differences. For example, the IAC represented a particular long term tariff level in respect of the chemical industry and the Government adopted a lower level. That is a very big industry. There have been exceptions like that where the Government, to use Senator Lewis's term, adopted a considerably tougher approach than the one recommended by the IAC. So again, if I might say so, Senator Lewis should do his homework before he couches a question in this form. As usual, as I expect from Senator Lewis, the question had a beguiling charm about it which concealed a lack of information.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I can certainly refute the allegations although previous experience suggests that it will not prevent Senator Sheil from making the same allegations again. I straightened him out on 31 May but then, as Senator Burns states in his question, Senator Sheil repeated almost exactly the same misinformation and was reported in the Gold Coast Bulletin of 9 June. I quote the paragraph which I think Senator Burns may also have quoted. Senator Sheil said that one can buy information from the Australian Bureau of Statistics and that:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>It includes everything from individual, family and household income . . . mortgage details, occupation, religion, rental payments, and even school leaving ages.</PARA>
<PARA>That can certainly be construed by a reasonable person as asserting that, if he wants to know all those details about anybody, all he has to do is ring up the ABS, pay and the Bureau will give the information to him. The statement can certainly be construed in that way. Whether Senator Sheil meant to have it construed in that way is, I suppose, a matter of opinion although his recidivism in this matter certainly suggests that his deliberate intention is to mislead the public about the degree to which information on the individual is available. Information about individuals is never made available by the ABS. The ABS makes available aggregated information about a large number of people on things like income stratification, levels of education and so on. It is correct to say that that sort of information is sold to the public.</PARA>
<PARA> As I pointed out before, there would be little point in conducting a census if that sort of information were not available to people in the private sector, State and local governments and so on. It is important for planning purposes, not the least of which, for example, is the provision of schools for education. In order to get a reasonable fix on that it is necessary to know how many preschool age children there are, where they live and what their ages are.</PARA>
<PARA> As I said, Senator Sheil's recidivism on this matter suggests to me that he is deliberately attempting to mislead the public. I would like to think that that is wrong and that he just failed to understand it yet again, but I guess the test will come as to whether he continues to make these baseless, scurrilous and-I think it is not too strong to say-subversive allegations. If the campaign which Senator Sheil appears to be running were successful, people would, as Senator Burns's question suggests, be reluctant to complete census forms accurately. Certainly some people would be reluctant to do so. That would mean that the bulk of aggregate statistics that comes out of a census would be less reliable than it would otherwise be. The consequences of that are negative for the Commonwealth, local and State governments and for a number of people in the private sector.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I heard Mr McLachlan on the wireless this morning. I can think immediately of one type of incentive which the abolition of capital gains tax would provide. Likewise, the watering down of capital gains tax as proposed by the Liberal Party of Australia would provide the same incentive, that is the incentive for directors and senior executives of public companies to provide themselves with what are euphemistically called executive share incentive schemes. In the Elders scheme, for example, the favoured few are granted 1c paid shares in the company. Incidentally, according to Elders's most recent annual report, of September 1988, Mr Ian McLachlan was a holder of 42,000 of those 1c paid shares.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Secondly, the abolition of capital gains tax would strengthen the incentive to make bonus issues of shares to shareholders and to allow holdings of those 1c paid shares to be treated as if they were fully paid for the purpose of such bonus issues. Incidentally, Elders offered or declared a one for five bonus on 28 September last year, including a bonus on those 1c paid shares, 42,000 of which are owned by Mr McLachlan. So he would have received 8,400 bonus shares as a consequence of the 1c paid shares he had previously taken up under what is, as I said before, euphemistically called the executive share incentive scheme. Those 8,400 shares would be worth a bit over $21,000 at yesterday's price. If Mr McLachlan were to sell those shares he would pay-this is only the bonus issue part of it-capital gains tax at the marginal rate of personal tax applicable to him. If, however, the capital gains tax were to be abolished, he would pay nothing. If the Liberal Party's proposal were to be implemented, if he held them for five years he would pay nothing; if he held them for one year, he would pay only 80 per cent of what he would be liable to pay under the existing law.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Hill said it was a good tax in 1981. I am sorry; I do not wish to defame Senator Hill. That applies only to the bonus shares which were issued as a result of the 42,000 1c shares previously made available to Mr McLachlan. If he sold all the 42,000 shares, the tax that he would evade or avoid would blow out to in excess of $100,000 capital gains tax. The executive incentive share scheme is a mechanism by which those who are in control of companies effectively diddle all other shareholders in companies. If the gains are to be exempt from capital gains taxation on the sale of the shares, that diddles all the other taxpayers as well. I do not think I need say any more.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question, which is addressed to the Minister for Consumer Affairs, relates to recently announced decisions of the Government concerning food processing. Can the Minister indicate what decisions have been made on food packaging and what steps the Government will take to ensure that consumers are not disadvantaged by those decisions?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="3976" SPEAKER="Bolkus Sen The Hon N." NAMEID="XE4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="SA" MINISTERIAL="CONSUMER AFFAIRS" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="XE4">Senator BOLKUS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Government announced last week a number of measures in the food processing and beverages industry after an interim report of the Industries Assistance Commission (IAC), which came down in February of this year. The decision of the Government is basically in two parts. In respect of the current laws on the mandatory composition and information labelling of food, the Government found a number of recommendations from the IAC and also had to assess those recommendations not in purely a financial cost benefit analysis but also in a broader context.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Government believes that information which is available to consumers is vital. The compositional standards are vital to the extent that they provide necessary protection to consumers. To that effect, we have not taken immediate action. What we have done in those two areas is to recognise that not only financial considerations but also long term health costs are involved, as well as the consumers' right to adequate protection. Having recognised all those factors and recognising also that we are dealing with an increasingly sophisticated area of production, we decided that these particular areas should be further examined by the current food law enforcement and regulating bodies. As such, all those other considerations which will give consumers adequate information and choice will be considered by the appropriate bodies. We believe that consumers have to make informed choices, taking into consideration nutritional health and dietary qualities.</PARA>
<PARA> The other part of the Government's decision was in the area of regulations specifying standard package sizes. In that particularly complex area we have decided that this part of the food law should be repealed. It should be noted that the area is a very complex one. At the moment, less than 50 per cent of this part of the food industry is standardised, but we find a number of anomalies. We find arbitrary, inconsistent, redundant legislation. We find that there is no real consistency between what is standardised and what is not. At the end of the day, the regulations in this area have done two things. First, they have led to confusion for consumers. Secondly, they have probably led to extra costs, not only to industry but also to consumers.</PARA>
<PARA> It should also be noted that in coming to this position the Government had to take into account the fact that quite often regulations in this area are used as trade barriers. So we have agreed to adopt and implement as policy the deregulation of standard package sizes. We are also concerned to protect consumers in this context. As a consequence, the Federal Bureau of Consumer Affairs will monitor the operations of deregulation in this area, in the first instance to assess whether difficulties accrue and secondly to suggest ways of addressing the problems. In that context, from time to time one can look at specific responses, but unit pricing might be one that can be considered if deregulation has unforeseen consequences.</PARA>
<PARA> We feel that the most appropriate way in which consumers can be protected is to ensure that there are effective, relevant and non-anachronistic codes to cover deceptive packaging. To that effect the Trade Practices Commission will play a role in implementing this part of the decision. Accordingly, the Government's decision in two parts will have the effect not only of protecting consumers but also of reducing costs.</PARA>

As I understand it, that sale did not proceed. There was no need on that occasion for an investigation. It would depend upon the view of the Minister for Defence as to what sort of environmental effect it would have. I do not know the answer to that. I will find out as soon as I can.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is more than I can say about Senator Chaney's lot-any of them. The first question relates to the Australia-Japan ministerial forum. As far as I know, there have been no discussions between the Japanese Government and the Australian Government about this issue. However, last time we were in Japan for a meeting of this kind Senator Richardson, Senator Cook and I met with representatives of the Japanese pulp and paper industry at some length and discussed a variety of issues with them. This may have been included in a segment of those discussions; I am unable to say at this time.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The major difficulty in setting up a large scale manufacturing facility producing unbleached paper is that in the absence of a significant world market for the commodity-Senator Vallentine is right in saying that is so-an Australian mill producing that sort of paper would be placed in the position of being tied very much to a single purchaser. This is not only because of the absence of a world market but because of the need for further technology in the change to paper grades of various kinds. That raises the question of how Australia might best be able to protect itself from any move by a purchaser in that situation to depress the price.</PARA>
<PARA> Senator Vallentine also asked about other initiatives that have been taken to develop domestic and international markets for unbleached paper and paper products. Quite apart from the Japan discussions, the Government is of course actively investigating the opportunities it might have of purchasing recycled or less bleached paper for its own use. I understand that, in line with this, the Department of Administrative Services is looking at potential use by the Commonwealth.</PARA>
<PARA> I make a couple of other points. In 1988 Australia imported pulp and paper to the value of $1.267m. There has been comment over several years that Australia is exporting a great deal of woodchips and then importing pulp and paper. The comment has been correctly made that Australia is missing out on the value added processing of the chips into paper and that this problem should be addressed. The best way of doing that is a matter for discussion within government and between companies and government. I do not think it is wise automatically to get carried away with the unbleached pulp syndrome without examining all the alternatives.</PARA>

Senator Gareth Evans announced yesterday at the Geneva Conference that Australia would be willing to accept up to 11,000 of the pre-cut-off date population, which is 20 per cent of the case load. However, Australia's participation in such a resettlement effort will be conditional upon other countries accepting commensurate resettlement obligations and there being broad adherence to all the other commitments outlined in the comprehensive plan of action. This off-take, which is in addition to the resettlement of people determined to be refugees by duly constituted screening procedures for those who arrived in South East Asia after 14 March 1989, and after 16 June 1988 in the case of Hong Kong, will be taken over three years and will be included within the Government's annual refugee and special humanitarian programs.</PARA></TALK.START>

The Government supports the principle that people who are determined as not being refugees under the 1951 United Nations Convention and the 1967 protocol relating to the status of refugees, to which Australia is a signatory, are expected to return to their country of origin under conditions of safety and dignity in accordance with international practice.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 9 June Senator Lewis asked me a question relating to the protection of small business operators' rights to access credit and financial information they believe essential to the success of their businesses in response to the introduction of legislation to control credit reporting. In response to that question, the proposed legislation has as its main objective the protection of privacy of individuals and their personal financial affairs and as such will affect information on consumer credit only. Small businesses will, therefore, continue to have access to commercial credit reporting information as a protective mechanism as this information will not be covered by the proposed legislation. It is envisaged that the amending Act will define certain categories of business to be credit providers. It is also expected that the Privacy Commissioner will have the discretion to deem other businesses, which ordinarily provide consumer credit, to be credit providers for the purposes of the Act.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 5 June Senator Janine Haines wrote to a Mr L. Eastwood, the Secretary and Executive Officer of the Parents and Friends Federation of Western Australia, in the following terms:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>Thank you for your recent letter supporting Senator Shirley Walters's Private Member's Bill and urging that I vote for the Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> It is unlikely that debate on the Bill will be finalised given that the A.C.T. has now become a self-governing territory and that the sale of video tapes is a matter for state and territory administration. The sale of such videos is the crucial issue as the Commonwealth powers extend only to import controls and do not cover the production of x-rated videos in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> The sale of x-rated videos in the A.C.T. is now a matter for the elected representatives in that territory. </PARA>
<PARA> I must say that, given the stance taken by Liberal Senator Jocelyn Newman on people exporting pornographic literature through the post to our Defence Forces overseas, I no longer feel inclined to support the legislation, even in principle! It not only won't work (because it doesn't cover locally made videos) it is clearly a blatant and hypocritical piece of grandstanding given Senator Newman's reported comments. </PARA>
<PARA>I do not wish to debate Senator Haines's views on whether she should have supported the legislation that Senator Walters brought in. I am concerned because I do not know whether this is a one-off letter or whether Senator Haines has used this excuse and the example of my stance on the Defence Force mail in other letters she may have written to other people who have inquired as to why she did not support Senator Walters's Bill. I am concerned on two grounds. First, it would imply that I support the export of pornographic literature through the post. This is quite untrue. Secondly, it would imply that magazines such as Pix, People, Ozbike and Playboy sent by families to our soldiers and confiscated are either pornographic literature or comparable with the x-rated videos sent through the mail in Australia which are banned in the States of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> I did comment to a journalist that it was hard to imagine Australian soldiers without such magazines. Many of them are also without the newspapers that have the sporting results of Australians back home. I did not suggest that Australian families should break the law in South Africa or Namibia, but I find it totally offensive that private mail passing between soldiers and their families has been opened, read, and censored by unknown persons. I would hope that all honourable senators would find that as offensive as I do. I assume that Senator Haines's letter was based on press reports. So that the Senate may judge for itself, I seek leave to incorporate my letter of 24 May to the Minister for Defence Science and Personnel in relation to a number of problems being experienced with the mail for the force in Namibia. The press reports were based on the letter which I released to the media. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The letter read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA>24 May, 1989. </PARA>
<PARA>The Minister for Defence</PARA>
<PARA> Science and Personnel,</PARA>
<PARA>Parliament House,</PARA>
<PARA>Canberra ACT 2600</PARA>
<PARA>My Dear Minister,</PARA>
<PARA> I write to draw your attention to criticisms which I have been receiving from the Army families of men serving in Namibia. </PARA>
<PARA> These are:</PARA>
<PARA> Mail is taking a minimum of 7 days, is erratic, and is usually taking 2-3 weeks and frequently 4 weeks. </PARA>
<PARA> Mail is being tampered with en route, to the extent that letters have been opened, items, including tapes, are going missing, and the men have been told to send nothing of value to Australia. Wives have also been advised not to post anything of value to Namibia. </PARA>
<PARA> Magazines have been confiscated. Some examples are Playboy and Ozbike. </PARA>
<PARA> Letters are being censored. </PARA>
<PARA> The promise of the former Minister for Defence Science and Personnel, Mrs Kelly, that Defence would meet the costs of postage to and from Namibia for both members of the force and their families, has not been honoured. </PARA>
<PARA> Australian newspapers are not being received by the men serving outside Windhoek and Grootfontein. </PARA>
<PARA> I received a letter dated 16 May from Australia Post claiming that ``arrangements for the acceptance and conveyance of mail to and from the Australian contingent are working well''. </PARA>
<PARA> I have now written to Australia Post asking that an urgent inquiry be conducted into the criticisms which have been raised with me by a number of families. </PARA>
<PARA> I ask that you also immediately take action to see that these matters are resolved. </PARA>
<PARA> I suggest that the following action is required:</PARA>
<PARA> 1. An ADF inquiry into the efficiency or otherwise of the postal arrangements. </PARA>
<PARA> 2. An insistence by you that Mrs Kelly's promise of free postage, in both directions, for those men serving in Namibia and their families is honoured. </PARA>
<PARA> 3. An explanation of who is censoring service mail and on what authority, and your direction that it cease immediately. </PARA>
<PARA> 4. The posting of representatives from the Army's Divisional Postal Unit to Namibia to take control of the arrangements at the Namibian end and to provide a service in the area of Australian money orders, postal orders and Commonwealth Bank facilities for the troops. </PARA>
<PARA> 5. Regular arrangements need to be put in place for the men in areas such as Oshakati and Ondangwa to receive Australian newspapers. </PARA>
<PARA> In view of the fact that these issues have a direct impact on the morale of troops serving overseas, I trust that you would share my concern at these criticisms and take the necessary action immediately. </PARA>
<PARA>Yours sincerely,</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="BE4">Senator NEWMAN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I draw particular attention to the fact that that letter lists six criticisms which had been referred to me by soldiers' families concerning the mail, one of which was the theft of magazines. I also listed five measures which the Minister should take to remedy the situation. None of these measures suggested breaking the law in South Africa or Namibia. I have asked the Australian Defence Force and Australia Post for an inquiry.</PARA></TALK.START>

The claim made in the press release was that information put out by the Australian Bureau of Statistics could be sheeted home to individuals. As Senator Walsh has left the chamber, he will miss this explanation as he did my last explanation on 31 May. Senator Burns also has left the chamber and he will miss it too.

Had Senator Burns read on in my press release he would have seen that if he had wanted a copy of the brochure advertising this, he could have applied to my office and got one. However, the one he would have got would not have been in colour. If he wants one in colour he can apply to the Australian Bureau of Statistics. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This interim report calls on the Government to emphasise its existing commitment to drug-free sport in Australia. Its recommendations deal with the mechanisms that are needed to ensure that athletes do not use performance enhancing drugs. They also deal with the controls that are required to reduce the ready availability of these drugs, particularly anabolic steroids, on the black market. The recommendations of this report flow from the inescapable conclusion that the use of performance enhancing drugs by sports people in Australia is widespread and is accepted as normal practice among some groups. This is a matter of considerable concern because of the serious health risks, often long term, associated with their use. Many of these do not appear until several years after the drugs have been taken. These effects are often not known or understood by the athletes using the drugs. Moreover, it is not always appreciated that the behavioural changes caused by some of these drugs, particularly some of the stimulants and the anabolic steroids, can result in a lack of judgment and increased aggression and that they may cause the persons taking them to become a danger to their fellow competitors.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In recommending actions intended to make it more difficult for Australian athletes to use performance enhancing drugs, the Committee is aware that a stringent drug testing regime for Australian sports people, if not accompanied by similar regimes in other countries, would reduce the international competitiveness of Australian sports people. However, in the Committee's view the health and injury risks associated with drugs used for performance enhancement are such that their use for this purpose must be prevented. Other countries should be encouraged to adopt the strict approach outlined in this report. The Committee is confident that the Australian Olympic Federation will accept the recommendations relating to the establishment of a completely independent drug testing commission and associated appeals body. The Committee hopes and has recommended that Mr Kevan Gosper, President of the Australian Olympic Federation, should use his influence to encourage other countries to establish similar and equally stringent procedures. </PARA>
<PARA> This interim report then falls into two parts. The first four chapters are concerned with general issues relating to the drugs being used, the extent to which they are being used, why they are being used, drug testing, and various matters relating to the supply of drugs. The second part of the report provides a detailed analysis of matters relating to the Australian Institute of Sport (AIS). As I have said already, the evidence demonstrates a widespread use and acceptance of performance enhancing drugs. These substances are used in virtually all sports, at all levels, and by both amateur and professional sports people. They are even used by children, in some cases with the encouragement of their parents. Drug abuse is more prevalent in some sports than in others. Weight-lifting and power-lifting are two examples of sports in which the use of anabolic steroids is widespread and in which an athlete is unlikely to be internationally competitive without their use. </PARA>
<PARA> Athletes are under intense pressure to perform. This pressure is not just something which they generate themselves, but is a result of community expectations, media coverage and, not least, the attitudes of their coaches and sports administrators who themselves are under considerable pressure. In using every means available to enhance their performance it is not surprising that some athletes are tempted or persuaded to use pharmacological aids, particularly given that normal practice often involves the consumption of large numbers of vitamins and other food supplements. A few extra pills may not seem to be any different, but, unfortunately, this is not the case. To illustrate the ease with which these substances can be obtained, I will quote directly from a letter from SAA Research, a company that has a post office box address in North Beach, Western Australia. It states:</PARA>
<PARA>Dear Sir Madam,</PARA>
<PARA> Thank you for your inquiry towards the availability of steroids in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA> If you have tried your doctor or a vet with little success we suggest you go to a gym where body builders or athletes frequent and ask the gym owner or instructor. They will be aware of a source of supply. We suggest you ask them for the name of a doctor or some-one who can fill your request. If you are positive you want to use steroids you will find no difficulty in approaching these people. If you hold any reserve at all maybe you should forget the whole idea of taking steroids. It takes more reserve to take them than to ask for them. </PARA>
<PARA> We have enclosed a price list you may use as a guideline so you don't get ripped off on the black market. You should also consider using the high quality supplements advertised in the booklet this will ensure a better result with your steroid course. </PARA>
<PARA> We hope that when you acquire the steroids you need that you will use them with care and respect for your body. </PARA>
<PARA>Yours in health</PARA>
<PARA>George Farquhar</PARA>
<PARA>S.A.A. Research Secretary</PARA>
<PARA>A book entitled For the proper use and understanding of Anabolic Steroids in Australian Sports (updated) has the following paragraph on its last page:</PARA>
<PARA>WANTED</PARA>
<PARA>SAA Research would like to hear from people interested in becoming distributors for our supplements and this publication. If you are a gym owner, athletic coach or football coach, or just somebody interested in a little extra income from your friends at the gym or club. </PARA>
<PARA> Please write to us at the above address for a special distributors price list and include a stamp so we can return your inquiry. </PARA>
<PARA>As discussed in the report, many athletes are using veterinary anabolic steroids because they are just as effective and much cheaper than those designed for human use. As I will mention later, the Committee has made recommendations to help stop this problem. </PARA>
<PARA> The best deterrent to the use of performance enhancing drugs is an effective drug testing program. The report describes the many deficiencies in existing testing programs and has recommended that a completely independent Australian Sports Drug Commission be established to take over the responsibility of developing sports drug policies and to conduct all aspects of all sports drug testing in Australia. The Commission should report the results of drug tests to the appropriate sporting federations for action but should itself prepare an annual report, to be tabled in parliament, listing all of the results and providing comment on anomalous results. For reasons detailed in the interim report, the Commission should conduct a minimum of 2,000 tests a year using a mixture of random, targeted and competition testing. In addition, tests should also be carried out for professional sporting organisations on a full cost-recovery basis. At the same time as the Commission is established, an independent tribunal should be appointed to adjudicate on disputed drug tests and the penalties being imposed. This tribunal should hear appeals from the Commission, the sporting federations and individual athletes. </PARA>
<PARA> A basis for the model proposed already exists in the organisation established in February of this year to take responsibility for the testing and associated appeals to be conducted by the Australian Commonwealth Games Organisation. This consists of a selection panel and an appeals tribunal. The membership of the selection panel would be Dr Brian Corrigan, Chairman, presently the Chairman of the Committee of the National Program on Drugs in Sport; Dr Ken Fitch, Deputy Chairman; and Mr Steve Haynes, Manager, presently manager of the national program on drugs in sport. The appeals tribunal comprises: Dr Ken Donald, Chairman, Deputy Director-General of Health and Medical Services, Queensland Department of Health; Mr Hayden Opie, a lecturer in law at the University of Melbourne; Ms Elaine Canty, a sports broadcaster and lawyer; and Ms Julie Draper, a co-ordinator of the national sports research program. </PARA>
<PARA> I view with extreme concern pressure which is now building up within the Commonwealth Games Association since the preparation of these recommendations for the testing in the lead-up to the next Commonwealth Games in Auckland in 1990 to be taken away from the drugs in sport program and the above bodies and placed under the control of, amongst others, Dr David Kennedy, from the Australian Weightlifting Federation. The Committee heard evidence that a weight-lifter was tested by Dr David Kennedy at the 1987 Moomba weight-lifting competition and was found to be negative for drugs. At that same time the weight-lifter was ingesting by his own admission up to 32.5 milligrams a day of Lonovar, an anabolic steroid, and receiving additional injections of Sustanon, a synthetic testosterone. The Committee intends to investigate how it is possible to test negative whilst taking this volume of anabolic steroids and testosterone, and I hope it is not necessary to conduct a parallel investigation into the Australian testing procedures leading up to the 1990 Auckland Games. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee has also recommended that a meeting be convened of all Commonwealth and State Ministers responsible for sport and health matters and that this meeting should adopt a definition of doping to be accepted by every sporting organisation receiving public funding; develop appropriate funding and charging policies for the proposed Australian Sports Drug Commission; agree that a fixed proportion of all public moneys allocated for sports funding be directed to the Australian Sports Drug Commission for testing and other programs; set standard penalties to be adopted by sporting bodies for offences relating to the use of performance enhancing drugs; make the supply of veterinary anabolic steroids for human use an offence; make anabolic steroids prepared for human use a schedule 8 drug; and finally, develop a uniform licensing system for gymnasiums and health centres in Australia with a requirement being that anabolic steroids and other drugs not be available, admitted, or used on the premises. These measures, with others recommended in the report, should serve to restrict the use and availability in Australia of performance enhancing drugs, particularly anabolic steroids, which are the most commonly abused drugs at present. </PARA>
<PARA> The second part of the report is concerned with matters relating to the Australian Institute of Sport. The Institute has been very proud of its random drug testing program and has argued to the Committee that the existence of this program has shown that performance enhancing drugs have not been used there. The analysis of the AIS drug testing program presented in chapter 11 of this interim report shows, however, that the program can be given no credibility at all. The selection and testing procedures were carried out in such a careless way that no action could have been taken if any athlete had tested positive. For example, the AIS drug testing files showed that four athletes were drug tested several days before they were actually selected for their respective tests. A charitable view of this general approach is that it seems to have been one of having a drug testing program for appearances sake, with little worry paid to its effectiveness. The nurse responsible for collecting the test samples was never given proper supervision and even the person in direct charge of the program, Dr Peter Fricker, did not seem to be concerned about keeping the necessary documentation. Without this proper documentation the whole program was worthless. Of the 99 specimen identification forms examined by the Committee, for example, only 10 had a signature from both a chaperone and area supervisor, as required by the testing protocol. Two of these, it is worth noting, had been supervised by the replacement nurse, not by the person normally responsible for conducting the tests. The ineffectiveness of the AIS drug testing procedures is demonstrated by the fact that athletes formerly at the Institute have admitted that they were taking banned substances while there. Moreover, two athletes, while scholarship holders at the Institute, were, with the full agreement of the administration, given anabolic steroids for medical reasons, in one case to speed up recovery to allow him to compete. The sensitivity of this matter is recognised by the doctor concerned, who went to exceptional lengths to ensure that no written record of what was happening was kept on official files. Instead he kept separate records, which he afterwards personally destroyed. </PARA>
<PARA> Despite the investigation undertaken by my Committee into the medical practices at the AIS, I was alarmed to be informed recently that a Dr R. A. Reid indicated on Institute letterhead that he was providing oral cortico-steroids to an athlete on 17 March 1989. This is in clear breach of the International Olympic Committee guidelines and I am at a compete loss to understand why, after such an intensive inquiry by my Committee, the AIS medical staff have still not resolved to adhere to IOC guidelines on banned sporting drugs. </PARA>
<PARA> The report provides an analysis of the attitude and response of the administration of the AIS to the very serious public allegations that were made concerning drug use at the Institute. The Committee has concluded that the response of the administration to these allegations was inadequate. The Institute's solicitors conducted an inquiry following allegations made in a Four Corners program in November 1987 and after writs had been served on the Australian Institute of Sport by three weight-lifters, alleging that they had been administered anabolic steroids while they were scholarship holders at the Institute. Although the Australian Institute of Sport Board received a verbal briefing from the solicitors on the inquiry, the full written report was not requested by anyone associated with the Institute until this Committee requested a copy. The solicitors' report raised matters which, in our view, required further examination. Indeed, in the case of the weight-lifting squad at the Institute, significant problems seem to have existed which were ignored. </PARA>
<PARA> The most serious allegations concerning drug use at the Australian Institute of Sport were made about the weight-lifting area, and involved the head coach of weight-lifting, Mr Lyn Jones. A large part of the Committee's efforts have gone into examining these allegations. The Committee has concluded that Mr Jones was less than truthful in the evidence that he gave to the Committee, and that his knowledge of performance enhancing drugs was much greater than he was prepared to admit. There is no doubt that anabolic steroids were being used at the Australian Institute of Sport weight-lifting unit and that a trade in these drugs was taking place within the unit and to other athletes. These allegations were made not only against Mr Jones, but also by Mr Jones and his supporters against his accusers who were former AIS weight-lifters. Irrespective of the arguments accepted by the Committee, both sides agreed drugs were being used and bought and sold by weight-lifters for a period going back to 1982. This practice and its associated trade were allowed to flourish from 1982 until the Four Corners program of November 1987. By his own admission Mr Jones did not seek to inform the relevant authorities of his certain knowledge that one weight-lifter had taken anabolic steroids in 1983-84 and had competed while doing so. He took no action until November 1987 on his suspicions that two other of his weight-lifters may have been purchasing banned drugs overseas in 1982. </PARA>
<PARA> On the basis of the evidence presented to it, the Committee has concluded that Mr Jones supplied and administered anabolic steroids and other banned substances to athletes at the AIS and believes that these drugs could have been purchased using public moneys. A detailed examination of the financial management practices of the AIS has confirmed that control weaknesses existed which could have been exploited by unscrupulous persons to purchase these banned substances. The Institute is already tightening up these procedures to ensure stricter control and accountability, so that the identified weaknesses will be removed. It is possible that to some extent protection within the financial administration of the Institute must have been afforded to Mr Jones to enable him to fund purchases of these drugs and to obtain supplies from within Australia and overseas. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee accepted the view of Mr Don Talbot that he was opposed to the use of sporting drugs and his statement was supported by his actions whilst Director of the Australian Institute of Sport. Of the other two officers able to protect Mr Jones-Mr Peter Bowman and Mr John Scarano-the Committee found Mr Scarano to be an honest and efficient officer. In relation to Mr Bowman the Committee made only one recommendation relating to the Australian Institute of Sport and that was that an investigation be held into the purchase of medical supplies without medical authorisation. The Committee also believes that it is possible that Mr Jones imported banned substances into Australia and that he used members of his weight-lifting squad to assist him. When considering the motives for Mr Jones's actions it should be realised that all sports involve a combination of both strength and skill. In sports such as weight-lifting and power-lifting, the emphasis is very much on strength. The Committee has received information from many sports medicine practitioners and persons experienced in power-lifting and weight-lifting on the effects of anabolic steroids. When used in medically unsafe doses, steroids can cause increases in strength of around 30 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Chris Turner, Secretary of the Australian Drug Free Powerlifting Federation, stated to the Committee that there was a 30 per cent increase in performance in the Australian Powerlifting Association compared with his drug free association. If sporting drugs such as anabolic steroids can increase strength by as much as 30 per cent, and as the difference between first and last in a major international event may be only one or two per cent, it is clear that coaches in strength sports are confronted with a straight forward decision: to reject drugs and lose or seek to exploit drugs more effectively than their fellow coaches and win at the risk of disqualification. In view of the negligible risk of detection and disqualification under the drug testing at the AIS and in Australian weight-lifting under Dr Fricker and Dr Kennedy respectively, the Committee formed the view that this latter alternative was the approach adopted by both Mr Lyn Jones and his assistant Mr Harry Wardle. It should be pointed out that Mr Lyn Jones is no longer employed at the Institute, his contract not being renewed after it expired in December 1988. Mr Harry Wardle remains at the Institute as a strength coach despite the conclusions of the AIS solicitors in their post-Four Corners report, a report which I presume has since been shown in full to the new AIS Board. </PARA>
<PARA> It should be emphasised here that if Australian weight-lifting follows the drug free path, it will not be possible for Australia to have any internationally competitive weight-lifting squad until honest and updated testing arrangements are put in place around the world. One of the areas that will be looked at closely by the Committee is the role played by weight-lifting and power-lifting in other sports, because of the extensive use of weight training across a wide range of sports. Weight-lifting and power-lifting are both sports that are drug dependent as far as current international and national competitions are concerned. The Committee will have to consider whether or not to recommend to the Government and the Australian Olympic Federation that weight-lifting remain as an Olympic sport. It is clear that weight-lifting and weight-lifters play a large role in the use and supply of performance enhancing drugs, particularly anabolic steroids, to competitors from other sports who share the same facilities. I also note in passing that attempts by the Drug Free Powerlifting Association to clean up its sport have recently been hindered by moves from the Australian Amateur Powerlifting Federation itself to register the Drug Free Powerlifting name. This will be subject to further investigation by the Committee. </PARA>
<PARA> Specific allegations concerning the purchase and supply of drugs had also been made against two track and field coaches at the Australian Institute of Sport, Mr Merv Kemp and Mr Craig Hilliard. The Committee was unable to substantiate these allegations and reached no conclusions about whether the alleged incidents had taken place, but noted that on a number of occasions Mr Kemp had taken actions in an attempt to ensure that deficiencies in existing drug testing procedures were remedied. A matter of great concern to the Committee was that AIS track and field coaches did not take action when confronted with evidence that athletes either were taking anabolic steroids or had been involved in an attempt to interfere with a drug test. The report describes in detail an incident in Belfast in 1986 in which an Australian official and an athlete at the AIS attempted to substitute a clean urine sample for one from an athlete that they thought might test positive. A number of coaches at the Institute were aware of this attempted interference but did not inform the AIS administration of what had happened. The Committee has also concluded that Dr Ken Maguire, while employed by the Institute, ignored his responsibilities to the Australia Institute of Sport by not passing on information that a track and field athlete was taking a banned substance. In fact, he arranged a clearance-time test for this athlete so that she could determine how long before a competition she would need to stop taking a substance and still test negative. </PARA>
<PARA> In short, the Committee found that many areas of the Australian Institute of Sport have been unsatisfactory, in terms of its handling of matters relating to the use of performance enhancing drugs. Clearly, some further actions are still required following this report. However, the Committee is of the firm view that the establishment of an Australian Sports Drug Commission, as recommended in the report, together with the follow-up actions referred to, will mean that, no matter what has happened in the past, the Institute can be given a clean bill of health so far as the future is concerned. These follow-up actions will be monitored during the second stage of the inquiry. As this is an interim report, the Committee will continue to gather information on the health risks associated with sporting drugs and will be taking evidence from people who have themselves experienced some of the serious side effects of these substances. We will be conducting detailed investigations into high risk sports such as weight-lifting and power-lifting. The Committee will also start its examination of professional sports, although this may be truncated, depending upon the willingness of these sports to subject themselves to the scrutiny of the proposed Australian Sports Drug Commission and its associated appeals body. For example, the New South Wales Rugby League is a major professional sport which has already gone some way down this track towards independent testing. We will also be continuing with our detailed examination of the black market, which is currently the major source of supply of performance enhancing drugs. </PARA>
<PARA> The recommendations made in this interim report should be implemented as soon as possible. Without urgent action it is clear that persons with a vested interest in the sports drug market will increase their existing control of some sports. For this reason the Committee will not be particularly sympathetic to any bureaucratic impediments which may be contrived to frustrate or delay the establishment of a truly independent Australian Sports Drugs Commission, a body which will place Australia in the forefront of a world campaign against drug abuse in sport. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to make some comments about the Interim Report of the Senate Standing Committee on the Environment, Recreation and the Arts entitled Drugs in Sport. To the extent that the report runs over 500 pages, it is not easy to summarise the deliberations and recommendations of the Committee in 30 minutes. It is inevitable that I retrace some of the ground covered by Senator Black. From the outset, I record Senator Black's personal contribution and dedication to this Committee and his diligence in pursuing the terms of reference. He ensured that we had appropriate and suitable evidence and witnesses.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Committee has been subject to some criticism. If time allows me I will also deal with that. Not the least of that criticism came from two Premiers who, if one takes a moment to think about it, have very good reasons for criticising any Senate standing committee likely to provide information to the Senate. In relation to the Australian Olympic Federation (AOF), I do not want to be emotive about its criticism but if one reads the report and if one were less than generous one could draw some conclusions as to why it, as well as I, have criticised the Committee. I am sorry that the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories (Senator Richardson) is not at the table. If he were I would say that it does not reflect generously on the Government that it has taken virtually a month for this report to be tabled in this Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> I will now turn to the heart of the report. As Senator Black has said, it is an interim report. That is why I raise the matter of the Government's involvement. In the view of the Committee it was important that we have an interim report because it deals with some fundamental and consequential matters touching upon the Australian Institute of Sport (AIS). We felt it important that that part of the Committee's deliberations be tabled as quickly as possible. The evidence demonstrates that drugs, particularly anabolic steroids, have been readily available and readily dispensed at the Australian Institute of Sport, particularly amongst weight-lifters. The evidence leads inexorably to the conclusion that Mr Lyn Jones, the head coach of the weight-lifting division, regularly and consistently provided his lifters with anabolic steroids. The drugs were purchased both in Australia and overseas by Mr Jones and, in my view, his athletes. </PARA>
<PARA> On the basis of evidence provided to the Committee it is my view that Mr Jones was not the only coach to provide performance enhancing drugs to his athletes. At the very least, other coaches knew of drug taking and did absolutely nothing about it. For instance, Mr Kemp was well aware that Gael Martin was taking drugs when a scholarship holder at the AIS and he did absolutely nothing about it. Mr Hilliard had reason to believe that one of his athletes, Mr David Smith, was using banned drugs and did nothing about it. Mr Kelvin Giles, previously head coach, track and field, was well aware that one of his athletes, Sue Howland, when using AIS facilities was using anabolic steroids and did nothing about it. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Kemp, Mr Giles, Mr Hilliard, Mr Rice, the head coach of track and field at the AIS, and Mr Bowman, then coordinator, track and field, at the AIS, were all aware that Ms Jane Flemming, a scholarship holder at the AIS, had provided a urine sample to Mr Maurie Plant, an official of the Australian Athletics Union (AAU), at his request, for his stated purpose of substituting a urine test sample for Sue Howland in June 1986 at a pre-Commonwealth Games meeting in Belfast. Mr Kemp wrote to the Australian Athletics Union, for whatever reason, but like the others he did nothing to inform the AIS administration. To this day no action has been taken by either the AIS or the AAU. Evidence provided to the Committee demonstrates that Ms Howland provided her own sample which ultimately tested negative. </PARA>
<PARA> I have no doubt that both Dr Fricker and Dr Maguire well knew of drug use at the AIS. In my view, it would be quite impossible for them not to have known. Dr Maguire gave evidence of his knowledge of Sue Howland's drug use and Dr Fricker gave evidence of his knowledge of Gael Martin's drug use. But I believe that both have a much wider knowledge. Frankly, it is improbable that Sister Beasley was not aware of drug use at the Institute. It is clear to me that Dr Maguire ordered testing at Ms Sue Howland's request for the purpose of giving her knowledge as to when she would cease her steroid schedule so as not to test positive. Page 446 of the report states:</PARA>
<PARA> The Committee concludes that the medical reasons advanced for ordering the testosterone to epitestosterone ratio by Dr Maguire are not convincing and are contradictory to evidence from other medical experts. Similarly, his discussion of the testosterone level results did not contribute to the Committee's understanding of his purpose in ordering the tests in the form that he did. The most telling evidence is that the results were apparently not used in any subsequent consultation. </PARA>
<PARA> Ms Howland's evidence, in contrast, is consistent and easily understood. In wishing to establish the clearance times for Andriol, she sought to have the same test as used in a drug test taken before, during and after a course on Andriol. She would have no reason to be concerned about the androgenic effects of Andriol (a testosterone) because she would use an anabolic steroid during training and only change to testosterone for a short period nearer to a drug-tested competition. She obtained the results subsequently from Macquarie Pathology without Dr Maguire's assistance and the results of the testosterone test are consistent with her explanation. </PARA>
<PARA>. . . </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee concludes that Dr Maguire arranged the testosterone tests for Ms Howland for the purpose of establishing her clearance time for Andriol and that this was done at public expense. Mr Giles is implicated with this action to mislead the Committee. Ms Howland's evidence is judged to be a consistent and true account of events. </PARA>
<PARA> I now turn to testing at the Institute. Due no doubt in large part to the very considerable costs, drug testing at the Institute has been on a comparatively small scale. At 30 June 1988 there were 294 athletes on scholarships at the Institute with a testing rate of one or two athletes a week. It is now two. An athlete could expect to be tested about once every three or six years-hardly a disincentive to drug taking. Of more concern is the manner in which the testing has been conducted. The testing requires three people to sign the specimen identification form, one of whom is the area supervisor, who is responsible for ensuring that the sample is properly collected and sealed so it cannot be tampered with. For very obvious reasons, the area supervisor must be identified on the form. A chaperone-obviously of the same sex as the athlete, one would assume-is required to witness the urine collection to ensure that the urine collected in the bottle was passed by the athlete. Again, the chaperone's name must be identified on the form as a witness. Finally, the athlete is required to sign the form confirming that these events took place. I direct the Senate's attention to page 467 of the report which states:</PARA>
<PARA> Of the 99 Specimen Identification Forms on the AIS file provided to the Committee, only 10 contain the signature of both a chaperone and an area supervisor in accord with accepted procedures. Two of these 10 were supervised by the replacement nurse. Another two of these 10 tests involved a longer delay between selection for testing and the time of giving a urine sample than the allowed 48 hours. Overall, less than 10 per cent of all tests in 1986 and 1987 met the accepted standards and the Committee believes, as a result, that the integrity during this period of the entire AIS testing program is questionable. </PARA>
<PARA>The Committee is saying there that in the event that any of the athletes had tested positive and appealed against that positive test, it is of the view that, under normal circumstances, the appeal would have been upheld. Under those circumstances, it is not unreasonable to draw the conclusion that it was possible for sink testing or for tampering of tests to have taken place. It is not without significance that allegations of sink testing and other tampering were made to the Committee by Mr Hambesis, a weight-lifter, Gael Martin and Sue Howland who were quite precise in the evidence that they provided. I quote from the Committee's determinations:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . because of the lack of proper documentation, in many cases there is no evidence that the urine sample was actually provided by the athletes being tested. Even if samples were found positive it is highly unlikely that any action could have been taken when area supervisors or chaperones were not recorded or had not signed the required forms. As discussed later, Dr Fricker himself was party to these lax procedures, quite apart from his overall responsibility for the drug testing program. The comments made above by Dr Fricker about Ms Howland and Mrs Martin's appalling lack of understanding of dope testing are much more appropriately applied to himself, as his statement that International Olympic Committee procedures were used is just not true. </PARA>
<PARA>There was other disturbing evidence in respect of testing at the AIS not least the fact that one athlete in particular who was selected for testing was turned away when he presented himself to be tested. The records show that four athletes selected randomly for testing were actually tested before they were selected. One can speculate as to how that happened. Many pass-holders have access to the AIS facilities and they have not been tested. In fact, Dr Maguire gave evidence that he had complained about this to the administration for a very long time, particularly because he had reason to believe that some of the athletes were drug users. At the time of the taking of the evidence nothing had been done to put that right. As from 17 April, as I understand it, testing by the Australian Institute of Sport is to include all those who are facility pass-holders and overseas athletes who, up until this point, have been able, when visiting Australia, to use the facilities and be certain and comforted in the knowledge that they would not be tested. </PARA>
<PARA> I now refer to the financial administration of the AIS. The Committee has considered and examined with some care the financial administration of the AIS because of concerns that AIS funds may have been used to purchase performance enhancing drugs. The Committee has not established that to be the case beyond reasonable doubt; however, the system of financial management has in the past made that possible. From my reading of the evidence, it clearly points in that direction. As recently as 1987-88 Price Waterhouse noted two instances when Mr Lyn Jones purchased medical supplies without a doctor's authorisation. I give one example which in my view is symptomatic of the problems of the AIS. One receipt presented by Mr Lyn Jones to the AIS for reimbursement amounted to $90 for the supply of vitamins and food supplements which had not been authorised by medical staff and which was allegedly from a pharmacy operated by Mr Colin Bova in Burwood, New South Wales. The handwritten receipt showed the Bova chemist as being in Victoria. Of course, there is no Bova chemist in Victoria. Bova chemist has denied issuing the receipt. </PARA>
<PARA> If one wanted to conjecture, it would not be unreasonable to draw the conclusion that the receipt is a forgery and that the person making out the receipt merely mixed up the States. It is hardly likely that a chemist in New South Wales would write `Victoria' on his own receipt. Mr Peter Bowman was then the Administrator of the AIS. The Committee expressed this view:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . Mr Bowman had no personal involvement in the approval of the payment of the $90 receipt, supposedly from Colin Bova Chemist but said by Mr Bova not to be from his pharmacy. Mr Bowman noted that the receipt was for a small amount which had been approved under `a proper delegation' and was more concerned over this than over the fact that public moneys could have been misappropriated. </PARA>
<PARA> The committee was more concerned that Mr Bowman had not sought to closely examine the contents of the Price Waterhouse report prior to his appearance before the Committee, given that much of the substance of the report's adverse findings directly related to his activities as the then head of financial administration at the AIS. The Committee finds that Mr Peter Bowman has displayed a disregard for the proper public accountability for the expenditure of public moneys inconsistent with his former position as Company Secretary and Administrator of the AIS. </PARA>
<PARA> Price Waterhouse noted two incidences in 1987-88 where Mr Jones had been able to initiate purchases of medical supplies without a doctor's authorisation. These incidents occurred under the administration of the current management team. Chief Executive, Mr Ron Harvey, `was not aware of that'. </PARA>
<PARA>Logically, the Committee then recommends:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . that the AIS investigate the approval of medical supply purchases without medical officer authorisation, contrary to AIS policy, with a view to disciplinary action. </PARA>
<PARA>It is not possible for me to go through all of the findings of the Committee; however, there is one matter that has been noted by the Committee which is of some concern and about which there is a recommendation-that is, the use of animal steroids, particularly by athletes in gymnasiums. We have knowledge of hulking young men asking veterinary suppliers for a dose of steroids for their dad's racehorse. This practice is of great danger to the athletes not only in terms of the quantities supplied but also in terms of the quality of the supplies. </PARA>
<PARA> There has been considerable criticism of the AOF for its drug testing from 1 January, not the least being from myself. Mr Gosper's response was to threaten to write to the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) seeking to have me removed from the Committee. It shows a good understanding of Senate procedures. It might be how the Australian Olympic Federation deals with critics, and it might be how Shell deals with critics, but it is not the way in which the Parliament conducts its business. It shows an abysmal lack of understanding of parliamentary procedures by Mr Gosper. </PARA>
<PARA> There are other criticisms of people such as Dr Millar, Director of Research at the Lewisham Institute of Sports Medicine. His athletes were notified in November 1987 that they were to be randomly tested from 1 July 1988, thus allowing them to cease using anabolic steroids by that time and so avoiding detection while obtaining their full benefits. In other words, the Australian Olympic Federation had given adequate and ample time for those athletes using anabolic steroids to cease using them so as to ensure that at the time of testing those athletes would test clean. It is interesting to note the comments of people such as Darren Clark, the Australian 400-metre champion, who stated:</PARA>
<PARA>If it was up to me I would have them go out and test them straight away and get rid of them. </PARA>
<PARA>Mr Clark was suggesting that the Australian Olympic Federation should be trying to find the cheats, not quarantine them. The report stated:</PARA>
<PARA>Mr Hurst, Mr Clark's coach, went further to suggest that:</PARA>
<PARA>I cannot see any reason for taking steroids after Christmas, after New Year, because the selection trials are usually in March and the State titles are in February. That is the testing period; that is the high competition phase. Presumably nobody would take drugs during the competition period, so the time to test them would be in the September to December period. </PARA>
<PARA>Mr John Coates, Vice-President of the Australian Olympic Federation, responded to this criticism in part by stating:</PARA>
<PARA>We brought in our doping policy on 6 November [1987]-and I am aware this is a criticism from Dr Millar-and we brought in a life ban for the first time. We thought it only proper that we give notice that we would start testing on 1 January. I do not think it would have been the right thing to do by the athletes to have tested the very next day, which would have then resulted in a retrospective doping policy-retrospective by two or three months. As I said, the purpose of a strong doping policy such as ours is the deterrent element. It is not to catch athletes. We want to make it quite clear to athletes that, if they had been taking drugs for sport enhancement, then they stood a very grave risk of being selected by us, and we gave them due warning. I think that was the proper thing to do. </PARA>
<PARA>That is the way in which Mr Coates interprets events. The report further states:</PARA>
<PARA> Dr Ken Fitch, Chairman of the Medical Commission of the AOF, indicated that `only legal, ethical and logistic factors' necessitated a six week period to make practical arrangements before testing could begin. These arrangements included setting up the tests and requiring National Sports Federations to agree to allow the AOF to test their athletes, obtain lists of potential Olympic athletes and seek their consent to testing. </PARA>
<PARA> Dr Fitch's evidence is contradicted by a memorandum from Mr Coles (AOF Secretary-General) to Executive Directors and Secretaries of National Sports Federation in June 1987. </PARA>
<PARA>The Committee draws the conclusion-having now learned by its own diligence and not by the generous and willing cooperation of the Australian Olympic Federation-that the athletes had six months notice. The Committee observed:</PARA>
<PARA> It is quite clear that potential Olympic athletes were provided with an opportunity to use anabolic steroids during the non-competitive, training phase of September to December in 1987, provided they ceased the use of the steroids in time to avoid detection in a random testing program beginning in January 1988. The performance-enhancing effects of steroids used in this manner would continue, to a diminishing degree, throughout the competitive season of February to April in 1988. In effect, drug-assisted athletes could be assisted to gain selection in the Olympic team over their drug-free competitors, and then perform below their previous standards at the Olympics because of the AOF testing program. Two classes of athletes were created; the drug free athletes who were disadvantaged, and the drug-assisted athletes who gained funding, prestige and selection but who performed poorly at tested international events. </PARA>
<PARA> It is also clear that the AOF could have begun a random program in, say, September of 1987, and withheld announcing any test results until May 1988, as indicated in the memorandum. The first of January 1988 was an arbitrary date which did not take into account the practical realities of steroids use. </PARA>
<PARA> There were good reasons for not applying for newly announced life bans from the day they were approved on 6 November 1987. However, this was a separate issue from the implementation of the testing program which was foreshadowed six months earlier. A life ban might only have applied from 1 January 1988, even if a random testing program had been operable since September 1987. </PARA>
<PARA>The Committee concludes:</PARA>
<PARA> Considering the extensive questioning of the AOF about the six weeks notice given to athletes that testing would begin, and the defensive position adopted by the AOF, the Committee views with concern the fact that six months notice was given and that AOF officials were aware of this when giving evidence. It is absurd that the Committee only found out about the six months notice through a routine request for the minutes of a relevant meeting. The Committee views the attitude and conflicting evidence of the AOF with scepticism, and can only conclude that the prime consideration of the program was not to prevent drug use but to allow affected athletes to pass drug tests during selection trials. </PARA>
<PARA>I can imagine why Mr Gosper is not happy with me. The Committee will continue to take evidence and to pursue its inquiries. In the few minutes I have left I make the point that the community as a whole has done very little, in terms of its considerations, its debates and its deliberations, about the use of performance enhancing drugs by athletes in Australia, not only at the elite level but also by casual weekend athletes and, sadly, by young children. In this day and age there are enormous social pressures on Australian athletes to use drugs. As we all know, Australians do not tolerate failures lightly. Athletes returning from the Olympic Games who are unsuccessful can expect perhaps a polite nod and a small clap. We seem to love the winners but we dismiss the losers ever so quickly. I continue to be reminded of Stephen Holland in 1976 coming back from Montreal, where he smashed his own world record but achieved a bronze medal. He came third. When he got off the aeroplane he was asked why he had failed and the media wrote him off as a failure. </PARA>
<PARA> What pressure is society putting on these athletes? That is the very reason we now have the Australian Institute of Sport. In the 1976 Montreal Games and the 1978 Edmonton Games Australian athletes did not achieve the level of success that was expected of them. We had too many losers and not enough winners. We had to do something about it so that we could again feel proud and stand in the reflected glory of our athletes; so that we could be proud to be Aussies, cheering from the comfortable position of a lounge room chair with a tinny in our hand and the television heated up. We ask ourselves: Why is it that athletes attempt to take performance enhancing drugs? We have only to look at the worldwide competitive pressures on our elite athletes. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee had evidence from one young lady who was lined up for a 400-metre event in one of the eastern European countries. In her words, she felt as though she were competing against men. The women had all the physical attributes of men: they had deep voices, Adam's apples, enormous thigh muscles and muscle mass generally, acne and all the traits that one would find as a result of the use of anabolic steroids. In fact, one athlete told us unofficially that she was rooming with a girl who used to have a shave every morning when she got up. Our drug-free athletes are expected to bring home gold medals after competing around the world against other athletes, who in some cases are given drugs by their coaches with the endorsement of their countries and, in other cases, are given drugs frivolously and freely by their coaches and those who support them. </PARA>
<PARA> We have only to look at the financial rewards involved these days. I think Senator Black observed in his comments that the difference between gold and glory and failure and obscurity can be but a part of a second in a hundred metres. The difference between Ben Johnson winning and coming fourth was but part of a second. If he had come fourth he would have received no financial reward. If he had come first and his use of anabolic steroids had not been detected he would have been the beneficiary of in the range of $16m-for but part of a second. When our drug-free athletes see other athletes being administered anabolic steroids in careful and controlled doses under the supervision of doctors, assured by the best of medical advice that there will be no medium to long term effects, there is an enormous temptation for Australian athletes to say, `Why do we not at least try to compete on the same playing field?'. The difference between getting the glory and winning a gold medal for their country or coming home in obscurity can be but part of a second, so there is a temptation for them to be like everybody else. </PARA>
<PARA> Perhaps one of the problems that confront us all is that there is no proper and enlightened understanding of the effects that these drugs can have on our athletes. There is a great need in Australia not only for that education but also for an indication of the temptations to which athletes are subjected to take performance enhancing drugs. We talk about an even playing field as the excuse for not using them; yet if we compare the advantages of athletes in advanced economies with athletes in Third World economies we can see that there is no even playing field. There is an enormous gulf between the advantages given to one athlete and the advantages given to others. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My contribution, on behalf of the Australian Democrats, relates to the veterans aspects of these four Bills now before the Senate. Senator Powell will address the Democrats' concerns about the Social Security and Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment Bill 1989 and the Social Security and Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1989. My comments will be confined to the Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment Bill 1989, which effects what are described as certain minor amendments to relevant legislation and provides repatriation benefits to service personnel joining the United Nations Transition Assistance Group in Namibia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We have particular concerns about this Bill. The Australian Democrats' attitude to this veterans legislation has been strongly influenced by the case of Beryl Ann Bagshaw Farrow. Beryl Ann Bagshaw Farrow was born in 1919 in Richmond, Surrey, in the United Kingdom. In March 1939, when she was 20 years old, she joined the auxiliary territorial services as a driver. Until February 1941 her duties were mainly clerical, but in that month she was posted to a training centre which trained personnel to drive ambulances. She was instructed in first aid and motor mechanics. During the next three years she served as an ambulance driver at various locations in south-east England. She worked very long hours in extremely difficult and dangerous circumstances. As a part of her work, Beryl Farrow was subjected to air attacks and operated in areas which were being bombed continually. In June 1944 she was transferred to London, where she drove six-ton lorries, delivering mail and supplies. Between June 1944 and early 1945 she had to change her billet four times because of bomb damage to the houses where she had been living. She was instructed that in the event of air raid warning, she was to keep driving until she saw the bombs falling, and only then to take cover. Beryl Farrow was demobilised in November 1945. She came to live permanently in Australia in 1948 and was granted Australian citizenship in May 1973. </PARA>
<PARA> I relate the story of Beryl Farrow because her circumstances alerted us to a problem with part of this Bill. For her service to her country, Beryl Farrow was awarded the War Medal, the British Defence Medal, the Efficiency Medal and the King's Badge. When she felt it appropriate, Beryl Farrow applied for a service pension. Under the provisions of the Veterans' Entitlements Act 1986 a veteran must prove service as defined in section 36 of the Act. That section states that, for the purposes of the Act, a person must have:</PARA>
<PARA>established . . . service within that country, being service in respect of which the person has been awarded, or has become eligible to be awarded, a campaign medal;</PARA>
<PARA>Beryl Farrow believed her British Defence Medal to be a campaign medal as it was something she was awarded for her active service in the protection of her country. But she was denied the service pension. The Department of Veterans' Affairs claimed that the British Defence Medal was not a campaign medal for the purposes of eligibility for a service pension. Beryl Farrow took her case to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal for its ruling in this matter. None of the facts in this case was disputed, but the contentious issue was the definition of a campaign medal. The Administrative Appeals Tribunal ruled that her Defence Medal was a campaign medal. Its report, dated 9 February 1989, ruled that a campaign, according to the Shorter Oxford Dictionary, was:</PARA>
<PARA>a continuous series of military operations, constituting the whole, or a distinct part, of a war. </PARA>
<PARA>The Administrative Appeals Tribunal found that operational air crews, such as those which took part in the Battle of Britain or the bombing missions flown from bases in England and Europe, were actively involved in a military campaign. The Tribunal took the view that not only the aggressors but the defenders on the ground were participants in the campaign. It found that the defence of the United Kingdom was a distinct and well defined part of the military campaign. The Administrative Appeals Tribunal ruled that the award of the Defence Medal for participation in the defence of the United Kingdom was a medal in respect of service in a campaign and therefore represented the award of a campaign medal. </PARA>
<PARA> The Commonwealth was found to be liable to pay the service pension to Beryl Ann Farrow, the payments to be backdated to 23 February 1987. Clause 11 (c) of this Bill seeks to define a campaign medal. It states:</PARA>
<PARA>`campaign medal', in relation to service during the period of World War 2 from its commencement to and including 29 October 1945, means:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) any of the following medals:</PARA>
<PARA> (i) 1939-45 Star;</PARA>
<PARA> (ii) Atlantic Star;</PARA>
<PARA> (iii) Air Crew Europe Star;</PARA>
<PARA> (iv) Africa Star;</PARA>
<PARA> (v) Pacific Star;</PARA>
<PARA> (vi) Burma Star;</PARA>
<PARA> (vii) Italy Star;</PARA>
<PARA> (viii) France and Germany Star; or</PARA>
<PARA> (b) any other medal declared by the regulations to be a campaign medal in relation to service during that period.''. </PARA>
<PARA>The reason the Government is proposing this clause is to tighten the eligibility of veterans for the service pension. The term `campaign medal' was not defined in the Veterans' Entitlements Act of 1986. The Beryl Farrow case has effectively pointed out something that the Department had previously overlooked. It is no surprise that the British Defence Medal is not included in the list of campaign medals; this is despite the Administrative Appeals Tribunal decision that it is a campaign medal. </PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Democrats' concern is that, although the Administrative Appeals Tribunal has ruled that recipients of the British Defence Medal are eligible for a service pension, this clause tries to cut them out of what we believe to be their right, and what the Administrative Appeals Tribunal believes to be their right. For this reason, we propose that clause 11 (c) of the Bill be deleted. I will move an amendment, hopefully to achieve that effect, in the committee stage. </PARA>
<PARA> The Veterans' Affairs Department, in its arguments to the Tribunal, claimed that, even though Beryl Farrow's war service was highly meritorious, people who had done very little for their country could also have received the Defence Medal. One should not disqualify one applicant who qualifies for the service pension simply because there may be a hypothetical recipient who does not deserve one. It is interesting that the Department has not appealed against the Administrative Appeals Tribunal ruling. As I have said, at the committee stage the Democrats will move an amendment to delete that clause which seeks to deprive other people like Beryl Ann Farrow of their entitlements. We consider this to be unjust and inappropriate. </PARA>
<PARA> It is not known just how many recipients of the Defence Medal are still alive. The British Government claims to have dispersed all of its records of those who were awarded this honour. The Returned Services League of Australia has approached us to amend this Bill in the manner I have explained because it feels, as does the Administrative Appeals Tribunal, that it is not fair or just to deprive one person of the benefit of a service pension just because a person not deserving of the pension could receive one. Who decides whether a person is or is not deserving of one?</PARA>
<PARA> The Government's amendment seems to be another event in the practice of recent years of so tightening eligibility under the Veterans' Entitlements Act that in some cases deserving persons, such as Beryl Farrow, will not be eligible. Other persons equally deserving of the service pension could be prevented from receiving it if this clause goes through as the Government plans. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course, we do not support the delaying of the Bill or preventing its passage through the Parliament, because of the urgency of the amendments affecting members of the Australian Defence Force currently serving this country in Namibia. We are disappointed that the Opposition has indicated that it will not support the deletion of clause 11 (c). Therefore, we believe the Opposition will support the Government in passing legislation which may well give rise to very significant injustice and which is in contravention of the appeals mechanism. The Administrative Appeals Tribunal has ruled in favour of this pertinent case and the benchmark has been established. </PARA>
<PARA> We are equally disappointed that yet again, in the final analysis, the Opposition has gone soft on veterans' issues and has failed to support Democrats' amendments designed to deliver to the veteran community what they believe to be their just entitlements. I can cite at least seven cases in the last 18 months where the Opposition has voted with the Government to deprive veterans of what they consider their just entitlements. It is not surprising that members of the veterans' community have become very angry, particularly with the position taken by the Government and the Minister in relation to their entitlements. It is not surprising that, despite the assurances offered by Mr Tim Fischer in the other place and at public meetings, they are increasingly doubting the Opposition's challenge to the position of the Government when it has proved its support for the Government's position on a number of extremely significant occasions. </PARA>
<PARA> We have given notice that if the Opposition, in conjunction with the Government, defeats this Democrat amendment we will move a contingency amendment which varies the date of implementation. That amendment was introduced in the lower House by the Opposition itself, yet I am advised that it will oppose it here today. Yet again we find it difficult to come to grips with what is purported to be the logic behind the Opposition's action when it proposes an amendment in the other place but fails to support that same amendment in this place. In the same way, we found it difficult to come to grips with the Opposition's logic in relation to the Defence Service Homes Amendment Bill when it moved, as a second reading attachment, the Democrats' amendments to that Bill but minutes later failed to support them in the committee stage. Our contention is that the veterans and service communities are quite capable of reading through the hypocrisy and inconsistencies which the Opposition particularly is displaying in relation to these matters. The Australian Democrats have no further objections to this Bill other than that which I have outlined in relation to clause 11(c). It is not my intention to delay further the passage of these Bills. As I said, I will move those two amendments in the committee stage of the debate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment Bill and the Defence Service Homes Amendment Bill amend the Veterans' Entitlements Act, the Defence Service Homes Act and the Australian War Memorial Act. The very important amendments, which it appears were not seriously addressed by Senator McLean, relate to the servicemen who are serving with the United Nations Transition Assistance Group (UNTAG) in Namibia and will now enable them to have full repatriation cover and defence service home loan eligibility. There are also some technical administrative adjustments which deal with realigning the Australian War Memorial Council and other Commonwealth statutory bodies in relation to their powers to make investments without ministerial approval. They also include an amendment to exclude from the definition of `income' under the income test for service pensions the restitution made by the Federal Republic of Germany to victims of Nazi persecution. The Bills also include an amendment to clarify the Repatriation Commission's power to set charges for treatment provided to community patients in repatriation hospitals, and provide remedies for anomalies in relation to a deceased claimant's legal personal representatives.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> According to Senator McLean, the Bills provide for an adjustment to the criteria for entitlement to the service pension. In this place we are all very aware of the special pleading that the Australian Democrats produce on occasions such as this to convince-they hope-the Australian community that their hearts bleed more than anybody else's for the veterans' community, the pensioner community or whoever is the cause of the day. We had that last week with the nursing mothers and tax deductability. We are having it at the moment with home birthing and midwives. Another current cause is Commonwealth ex-service men and women who have not seen dangerous service. They have not faced danger, but it would appear, according to Senator McLean, that they expect a greater degree of care than we are prepared to give to our own Australian service men and women. That is another matter which I will also address when we come to the committee stage of the Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to particularly address the amendments that relate to our men in Namibia. For me, those happen to be the most significant amendments in the legislation. They relate to the repatriation benefits for our soldiers serving with UNTAG in Namibia. Schedule 2 of the Veterans' Entitlements Act will classify the Namibia area as `operational', and all those who serve there will therefore be entitled to full repatriation benefits, medical and financial. Before the Government congratulates itself on its promptness and generosity in this matter, let us have a look at the real record of events. These men in Namibia are facing an extremely dangerous situation. The ceasefire, the South African withdrawal and the withdrawal of the South West Africa People's Organisation guerillas was not smooth. We have already had some armed clashes. We have had political difficulties between the parties in which some of our soldiers have been inadvertently caught up. There are unplotted minefields on the Angolan border and throughout the northern part of Namibia. In his speech in Parliament, Minister Beazley admitted the likelihood of casualties. He said:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . the ADF and the Government accept that there may be casualties among our contingent. </PARA>
<PARA>I understand that the Army fears quite a serious percentage of likely casualties. These dangers and the possible consequences for the men and their families mean that they need to have the security of knowing that the benefits and compensation are already in place. </PARA>
<PARA> We should not forget that this Australian commitment to Namibia was pledged by the Fraser Government in 1978. Australia and the Australian bureaucracy have known about this commitment for more than 10 years. Yet it is only now, three months after the first contingent has left our shores, that we see the legislation which puts those conditions of service and repatriation benefits legally in place. With all the planning that went on, even down to the colour that the vehicles would be painted, I would have expected this legislation to have been sitting there ready to be dusted off and brought to the Parliament so that when the men went they knew exactly what the situation was. It was already well known to the Government that this legislation would have bipartisan support, but it was not in place when the contingent left. </PARA>
<PARA> Let it not be forgotten that there is another force of men serving unsung and unhonoured overseas in a peacekeeping force. It is in a debate such as this that I hope this Parliament will remember them. I am referring to the men on the Iran-Iraq border in the United Nations Iran-Iraq Military Observer Group (UNIIMOG). After initial delays in finalising the disability allowance package for these men, I pressured the Government. Three months after the 15 men had left with very little notice-they went within a week of being told to go-the Government promised in the Senate that it would give them the allowances that were necessary for the work that was intended to be done. I draw the attention of the Senate to an answer given by Senator Richardson in the Senate on 29 November 1988. He said:</PARA>
<PARA>The intention is that the package of allowances developed to cover service with UNIIMOG be paid while the duty is in progress . . . </PARA>
<PARA>He went on to say later in his answer:</PARA>
<PARA>Every effort is being made to provide allowances for UNIIMOG members in the shortest time possible . . . </PARA>
<PARA>It is now nine months since the first men went to the Iran-Iraq border. The first contingent has now been home for three months. The second contingent has been in place for three months. The danger money for our soldiers on the Iran-Iraq border has still not been finalised. In my questioning of the Department of Defence during the Estimates Committee hearings in April, I received answers which demonstrated that the matter had slipped from high priority in October 1988 to medium priority in April 1989. Clearly, Minister Simmons must learn that honouring the promises of his predecessor is part of his new job. When will we see the danger money being paid? When will it be decided? I remind the Senate that these men on the Iran-Iraq border are Nobel Prize-winners for peace. They are commonly regarded as the finest soldiers that we have. They are unarmed but they face similar dangers to their colleagues in Namibia. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Deputy President, I draw your attention to what some of these dangers are along the Iran-Iraq border. There have been artillery and rocket launcher exchanges. One of them extended over a 50-kilometre front. There have been mine incidents within metres of Australian soldiers. There have been large minefields for which, as in Namibia, there are no maps. There has been extensive flooding in Iran so some of the mines have floated away and relocated. There are unexploded bombs and artillery rounds, including in many areas, we believe, chemical devices which still have not been recovered. Elements of our contingent are under guard at all times by the regime. They have no recreational facilities. Mail may take two to three weeks to arrive at a location, and telephone calls get through only if the Iranian telephone exchange is in the mood-and that rather depends on how the Australian press has reported the Iran situation in our newspapers. </PARA>
<PARA> In many ways Australian soldiers in Iran-Iraq are in as difficult a situation as the 300 men we have sent to Namibia. I feel that a case could have been made out to provide them with the allowances and tax free status that apply to our troops in Namibia, but they have not been granted. The Minister, Mr Beazley, seems to think that the fact that the forces are not carrying arms makes the difference. Perhaps those who carry arms might feel themselves to be in a somewhat safer position. While the Government capitalises on Australian soldiers' fame as peacekeepers, it will not produce the money to support them or their families. The Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories (Senator Richardson) recently answered a question from me by saying that the Department of Defence, in conjunction with the Department of Industrial Relations, is examining recently received data on the difficulties experienced on the Iran-Iraq ceasefire line with a view to assessing the need for further compensation. This Government has had far too much time to assess the need for further compensation. The compensation is danger money and the soldiers have received none of it to this date. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;They are members of the Defence Force but clearly are not members of a union. If they were, this Government would listen to them. This Federal Government listens only to unionists. The damage to morale is very serious. Men in Iran-Iraq feel that they are neither recognised nor appreciated for the sacrifices they are making. They feel isolated and shamefully neglected. This attitude has not been restricted to the Iran-Iraq contingent. I believe that the Government's lack of attention to the well-being of the force in Namibia is something for which it should be condemned. When the forces were going away to Namibia on, I think, 3 March the former Minister for Defence Science and Personnel, Mrs Kelly, sent each man a list of all the conditions of service to which he would be entitled. One of them related to postal assistance. In her statement the Minister said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>Defence will meet the costs of postage to and from Namibia for both members of the force and their families. </PARA>
<PARA>It appears that the Government forgot to tell Australia Post. While our men in Namibia have free postage back to Australia, their families first of all have to pay the Australian postage to get mail to an address from which it is sent off overseas. It is a question of attention to detail. In that area the Government has let the men down. </PARA>
<PARA> But, probably more importantly than that, there has been, until now at least, very erratic mail. Australia Post assured me that mail would take four days in each direction plus an allowance for transfer time. But the mail has been always more than seven days late-usually two to three weeks late, and quite often four weeks. Mail has been tampered with. Goods have been stolen out of mail packages, including family tapes. As I mentioned in a personal explanation here today, a number of what we would describe as girlie magazines have also been removed. I understand that these are described as erotic magazines by South Africa and Namibia and therefore are against the law. Families who send those do so at their own risk but I have to question why the Australian Government has allowed our forces private mail to be tampered with by any authority en route to the men who are serving this country. Servicemen who are members of the First Division postal unit could have been sent to Namibia to deal with the mail at that end and we should have been able to arrange a service whereby the Australian soldiers' mail from their loved ones in Australia went straight through to the men in the field without interference by any other person or authority. As the shadow Minister I am concerned that I have not had a response from the responsible Minister as to how this has been allowed to happen and what action he has taken to see that the situation is improved. </PARA>
<PARA> This is the first time since World War II that our soldiers' mail has been censored. Not even in the most political days of Vietnam was the mail of our soldiers or their families censored. I also remind honourable senators that, apart from the phone, which is not always available or reliable and which costs quite a bit of money, mail is the only link between these men and their families. They need that link to retain the high morale which we expect of them in the field in representing Australia. I have written to Australia Post and to the Minister, Mr Simmons. I hope that the matter will be dealt with swiftly. </PARA>
<PARA> Whilst the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) tells us that these men will do Australians proud, his Government is providing no extra funds whatsoever for this contingent. My questioning of members of the Department of Defence at the Estimates committee hearings revealed that funding for the contingent will be in the order of $28m and will come from within the defence budget. No extra funding for this extra task will be provided by this Government at all. No real growth is planned for the defence budget for 1989-90. The answers to my questions in the Estimates committee were quite specific. No extra funding has been provided by the Government for this extra job. Funding will be needed at the rate of $28m. Inevitably that means that other things have to be dropped off. It means less training, and less minor and personal equipment. We already have a $28m shortfall in uniforms for the Army alone for the next two years. The Army does not know where it will find $28m simply to put its members in uniform. One wonders what the Government expects them to do. We have reached a stage where many servicemen provide their packs, compasses and boots. It looks as though soon they will be asked to provide their uniforms from either the opportunity shop or the disposals store. We have a very real problem in keeping these men in Iran-Iraq. As a nation we are very proud of them. I am sure the Government is truly proud of them; certainly the Opposition is. But when a government fails to provide the resources for them to do their job and fails to look after them and their families as effectively as it should while the men are away, I think that it should be condemned. </PARA>
<PARA> Recently we had another little example of the Government's mean spirit in regard to our soldiers when Senator Richardson, in answer to a question of mine, revealed that this Government was not even prepared to let the Australian Army have the honour of leading the Sinai force-which would have been at no cost to Australia. We could have had a lieutenant-general from Australia leading the multinational force in the Sinai. Instead that honour has gone to New Zealand which found that it had a general to spare. We have 44 generals and could not find one. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally I would like to draw attention to the amendments to the defence service home loans scheme, which is part of this package of legislation. Amongst other things, the upshot of the legislation is to tighten up the non-portability of loans taken out before 9 December 1987 by excluding eligible veterans who have already discharged their loans. The ridiculous situation therefore continues where there are two classes of home loan which have to be regulated. Those whose duty it is to move every two or three years are not entitled to take the home loan with them without ministerial permission. I hope in the committee stage of this legislation it can be explained to me under just what circumstances the Minister's permission will be either granted or withheld. </PARA>
<PARA> It is appropriate that I should draw attention to another con job-I hesitate to use the term, but I cannot think of an alternative one-that is being perpetrated on Australian servicemen who have joined the Defence Force since May 1985. Last month the Minister for defence science and Personnel, Mr Simmons, produced, like a rabbit out of a hat, a new defence service home loans scheme which is intended, one assumes, to make the post-May 1985 enlistees feel that they are loved and cherished by the Government. Instead, when we read the fine print, we find that, although the interest subsidy has been increased to cover a $40,000 loan, the interest payable will be at market rates less 40 per cent. At the time that the Minister announced the measure, the subsidised interest rate was already 9.6 per cent. As we all know only too well, that rate is moving inexorably upwards. Whereas servicemen used to be subject to a 6.85 per cent subsidised interest rate, the next generation of soldiers are already liable to pay at least 9.6 per cent and, as I said, that rate is going up. </PARA>
<PARA> The most serious criticism that I have of the new scheme is that it means that a serviceman will no longer have a subsidised interest rate for 25 years, which has been the case with the existing scheme. The new scheme means that the serviceman will get the subsidised interest rate only for the period in which he is serving in the Force, less six years that he had already served to become eligible. In other words, if a serviceman serves, as so many do these days, particularly other ranks, for only 10 years, he will receive a subsidised rate for only four years. To go from a 25-year subsidised interest rate to something like a four-year period is a seriously retrograde step. This is grossly unfair to the current generation of servicemen and it will clearly do nothing to encourage retention of personnel in the defence forces. Only somebody who did not understand the Defence Force could possibly imagine that that could be a retention measure. On the surface, it looks as though the longer one serves, the better it will be. But the current scheme is much better. That scheme is to be removed. Anybody who has joined the forces since May 1985 will no longer be eligible for the existing scheme. This poor shadow of a scheme is now being introduced as if it were something better, which clearly it is not. </PARA>
<PARA> In so many ways we are seeing that the Government is not prepared to look after our servicemen. By way of an aside, I wonder what the Westpac Banking Corporation has to say about the new scheme because I understood that it had contracted to take on board all those people who had become eligible to join the existing scheme but had not yet taken up their loans. On the basis of those calculations, Westpac paid a premium to take over the defence service home loan business. The Government has now announced that it intends that anybody who was in the defence forces prior to May 1985 will be able to opt out of the existing scheme and transfer across. I regard that as most unlikely because people will see that the new scheme is not as good as it at first appears. I would have thought that the Commonwealth could well be deemed to be in breach of its contract with Westpac by making that opportunity available to the pre-May 1985 enlistees. </PARA>
<PARA> Time prevents me from mentioning all the amendments. As I said earlier, some of those amendments are administrative in character. It was important that I single out the areas in which the Government should have given attention to soldiers and their entitlements. These matters are of great concern to the Opposition. The Government and the bureaucracy have shown inefficiency in many areas and ignorance of the needs of servicemen and ex-service men and women. What makes it worse for me is to see the Government constantly patting itself on the back for providing these repatriation benefits while, in reality, the courage and loyalty of our soldiers who are risking their lives overseas are being rewarded by a government with half measures, delayed benefits and bureaucratic bungling. The Opposition does not oppose the legislation, but it warns the Government that its record is dismal and that Australian soldiers and veterans deserve better. We in the Opposition are extremely proud of our servicemen and we honour their service. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This afternoon we are debating a range of Bills which deal with social security and veterans affairs matters. As a member of the Government, I support the legislation. Before speaking to the details of the Bills, I wish to put them into an overall perspective in regard to this Government's policies and philosophies. The Hawke Labor Government came into office in 1983 at a time of deep recession in Australia. Under the previous Liberal Government, dole queues were swelling, inequality abounded and poverty was rife. The reality is that the Liberals in government did as much to reduce poverty in Australia as Burke and Wills did for orienteering. The Liberals had a pitiful record on helping families, assisting pensioners and social justice.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In seven years of coalition government, the number of children in pensioner and beneficiary families increased from 383,000 to over 800,000. The number of children depending on social welfare more than doubled. Only once in seven years of that Liberal Government was there an increase in family payments for children. Only once, in 1980-that was an election year-did payments for pensioners' children rise from $7.50 a week to $10 a week. We can conclude that, as a result, children were forced to bear the cost of the coalition's economic and social ineptitude. Over that seven-year period of the previous Liberal Government, child payments declined by more than 35 per cent; there was a 35 per cent cut in real terms in respect of payments to the children of pensioners and social welfare beneficiaries. </PARA>
<PARA> In marked contrast, the Hawke Government has increased payments for families every year that it has been in office. Payments in respect of the children of pensioners and beneficiaries have gone from $10 a week in 1983 when the Government was elected to a figure now of $24 a week for children under the age of 13-a 140 per cent increase. For older children-that is, children aged 13 to 15 years inclusive-the figure has gone from $10 a week when the Government was elected in 1983 to $31 a week. The social security and veterans affairs legislation that we are debating this afternoon will increase further those payments in respect of the children of pensioners and beneficiaries. </PARA>
<PARA> Importantly, the legislation will also increase payments for other families under the family allowance supplement scheme. Under this legislation, from July this year family allowance supplement payments and payments for children of pensioners and social welfare beneficiaries will rise from the present $31 a week to $34.10 a week for children aged 13, 14 and 15 years. That is the record of this Government-increases in payments for the children of pensioners and social welfare beneficiaries in every year the Government has been in office. That is our record and it is in marked contrast with the period under the Liberals when families were ignored. Under Labor, there have been increases in payments every year, whereas the coalition ignored families. Let us face it: the Liberals did as much for families in their period in office as Captain William Bligh did for industrial democracy. Under Labor, not only has the family allowance supplement risen but also the basic family allowance will rise by as much as 71 per cent in some cases. The family allowance will increase again from next month. It will increase to a figure of $9 a week for each of the first three children in a family. For larger families, the increase will be to $12 per week per child if there are four or more children in the family. </PARA>
<PARA> When the history books are written the Hawke Labor Government, based on these figures, will be seen as a government of vision, reform and compassion. The family allowance supplement scheme, when introduced in 1987, was a path breaking reform, a key part of Labor's attack on poverty. These Bills today mark further milestones in Labor's assistance for families in social reform and in the welfare of children. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bills will ensure that family payments-that is, the family allowance supplement for lower income families and the family allowance payment for most families-will increase every year from now on. For the first time ever all family payments will be indexed to the consumer price index each January, beginning next year. There will be automatic increases. They will apply not only to the family allowance but also to the disabled child allowance, the mother's and guardian's allowance, the sole parent rebate, the double orphan's pension and the multiple birth payment. All of those will face, for the first time ever, automatic cost of living rises from next January. Households with children no longer will have to rely on ad hoc or discretionary increases provided from time to time. Such families are guaranteed an adequate income for future years. </PARA>
<PARA> Family payments began, of course, with the introduction of child endowment in 1940 by the Menzies Government. But not once since that payment was introduced during the Second World War was there a cost of living rise to upgrade it for the higher cost of living in Australia. This Government has done it. It has brought in cost of living rises automatically every January in respect of family assistance payments. Also as a result of this package and as part of the April statement measures, the dependent spouse rebate will be increased. That will increase by about $170 per annum. That rebate against taxation will also be increased in line with cost of living rises, in line with inflation. </PARA>
<PARA> It is estimated that in my State of South Australia alone some 170,000 families will benefit from the increase in family payments. The payments will be made in respect of some 315,000 dependent children. I estimate that on a weekly basis the impact of this package alone-the family allowance increases and the rise in the family allowance supplement-will add of the order of $840,000 weekly to the purchasing power of South Australian families. In my State alone that figure accounts for an extra $43m going into households with dependent children. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn now to look at the national level and the impact these April statement measures will have on Australian families. I use the example of a family earning a gross income of $20,000 a year or about $380 per week with two dependent teenage children. A single income family in that position will pay no net taxation from July next. Such families will have zero income tax liabilities from the beginning of the next financial year. By net tax I mean their personal income tax liabilities less their family assistance payments. A single income family with two teenage children will have zero effective average tax rates if they are on around $20,000 per year. The taxation liability for such families will come to $2,117 after allowing for the increase in the dependent spouse rebate. The family on around $20,000 a year with two dependent children does not face a Medicare levy payment so the total tax bill calculated from the schedules is $2,117. </PARA>
<PARA> On the other hand, as a result of the increase in family assistance payments under this package, the family will receive a very significant boost in family payments. Again, a family with two dependent teenage children will get $936 per annum in family allowance payment. Such a family on $20,000 a year will also qualify for part of the family allowance supplement. That family will get $1,658 per annum, making a total family assistance of $2,594. That compares, of course, with a personal income tax liability that I have mentioned of $2,117. </PARA>
<PARA> As a result of the policies of the Hawke Labor Government such a single income family on $20,000 per annum with two dependent teenage children will in fact get back from the Government $477 more than it will pay to the Government in personal income tax. That can be likened to the concept of a negative income tax which has been discussed not only in this country by some social welfare groups in the past but also overseas. It has been discussed very widely in North America and parts of western Europe. In effect, from the beginning of July next Australia will have a negative income tax for a number of our families. Families earning below $20,000 per annum or $380 per week, with a single breadwinner, will have negative income tax. As a result of the April statement measures there will be very large improvements in the disposable income of many Australian families. </PARA>
<PARA> For example, a family in the same circumstances as I have mentioned but with two young children-that is, children who are not teenagers-will get from this package an extra $21.25 a week. That is the increase in, if you like, take home pay or disposable income after the reductions in personal income tax and the increases in both the family allowance supplement and the family allowance payments. An increase in disposable income of $21.25 per week is a significant figure. It comes out to over $1,100 per annum. Of course, that figure is a conservative one and a family with teenage children will get more. </PARA>
<PARA> The package itself highlights the Government's strategy very well-that is, to grant increases in the disposable income, the take home pay if you like, of Australian families by focusing on tax cuts and family assistance payments rather than encouraging workers to go out into the labour market to try to generate and obtain very large increases in money wages. As a matter of interest that $21.25 extra going to the family is equivalent to the breadwinner obtaining a wage rise of $36.15 per week. This is part of the Government's strategy to reduce cost pressure on industry, to reduce the need for large money wage rises, by giving tax cuts and boosting family assistance payments. As a result of employees not having to seek large wage rises, there are significant savings for industry. In turn, assistance is given to improving Australia's international competitiveness. </PARA>
<PARA> They are some of the measures taken by the Hawke Labor Government in the April statement. They are provided for in these Bills today, particularly the measures to boost family allowance payments and the family assistance supplement. That is in marked contrast with not only the rhetoric but also the actions of the Liberal Party when it was in government. In government, the Liberals showed that they were economically, politically and ideologically incapable of looking after Australian families. A decade ago the Liberals said that they would protect family incomes and they failed. Today this Labor Government is boosting family assistance enormously. It is against this record that the Government will continue to make further improvements to create a fairer, more just and more prosperous Australia. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Of the Bills in this package of legislation which the Senate is considering in this cognate debate, my remarks will be addressed to the Social Security and Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment Bill 1989 and the Social Security and Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1989. The first Bill deals basically in large measure with developments in the family package for families and children, increases in family allowance, simplification of that family allowance system, integrating the family allowance supplement payments, a range of indexation, and rebate rises in that whole area. I will return to that major area of the legislation shortly.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> For the aged in our community the first Bill brings forward the pension indexation increases in three stages and increases the pension rebate so that the income test free area will become tax free, relieving the confusion and financial stress which has been in the system for a considerable time now. This simplification will mean that single pensioners will have to wait longer before they have that tax free status for their income test free area, whereas married pensioners will achieve that in the 1989-90 financial year. Single pensioners will not achieve it until the 1990-91 financial year. That is an unnecessary additional stress for single pensioners. The Australian Democrats find it difficult to work out why that should be the case. </PARA>
<PARA> The indexation catch-up is particularly welcome. The Senate will recall vividly no doubt, as it has been reminded many times since, that in the 1986 Budget the delay of six weeks was implemented along with a number of other stringent measures in the economic circumstances, with only the Australian Democrats opposed to it. Ever since then we have, along with pensioner groups, pushed for that delay to be redressed. On this occasion not only has the delay been redressed but also indexation has been brought further forward. This is a matter of justice for the group of aged in our community who, since 1986, have borne the brunt, particularly through this delay and through other stringencies which they and others in the community have had to meet in the face of economic circumstances. During that period the Democrats have been most concerned to express their view that many of the most disadvantaged in our community have had to bear an inordinate amount of that burden. </PARA>
<PARA> In making significant remarks on the family package elements of this legislation I would like to set the scene in which all of this is happening by drawing heavily on the submission entitled Federal Budget Priorities put out by the Australian Council of Social Service (ACOSS) to the Australian Government. That submission came to us and the Government in April of this year. It sets the scene very well. With regard to the economic environment, the ACOSS submission points out that, as we all recognise, major economic difficulties are facing this country but due largely to severe cuts in Government spending the private sector now enjoys a greatly increased share of national resources. By a series of measures the private sector has had resources channelled to it and this often provides little or no benefit to the country. In many ways it can be shown to be causing severe economic damage. I will make some specific remarks on that later. The ACOSS submission states:</PARA>
<PARA> Grave misuse of resources has occurred through excesses in areas such as share and property speculation, currency trading, takeovers, asset-stripping and international tax avoidance. As a result, disappointingly little sustained progress has been made towards genuine economic restructuring which would improve our capacity to produce competitive exports, replace imports and create jobs. In addition, corporate debt levels have risen alarmingly, especially through excessive overseas borrowings. </PARA>
<PARA>At this point I wish to point out that at least the New South Wales Labor Party seems to have cottoned onto those issues which ACOSS outlines and which the Democrats have been pursuing for some time. I go on to the further point that is made in the submission in setting the economic scene. It states:</PARA>
<PARA>Two major causes of this misallocation of resources have been excessive business and financial deregulation and, despite courageous reforms, the continued bias of the tax system towards unproductive and speculative activities financed by massive borrowing. </PARA>
<PARA>I will interpolate there that this has occurred largely in the private sector from overseas transactions negatively geared to the disadvantage of the revenue of the Government which then has to cut its spending. That point is made further on in the submission where it states:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . it is important to bear in mind that Government spending has already been cut by about 15 per cent (that is-</PARA>
<PARA>in quantitative terms-</PARA>
<PARA>about $12 billion) over the last four years . . . It is now lower than at any other time for the last 15 years or so. No other Western country has even approached this size of expenditure reduction in recent years. </PARA>
<PARA>This needs to be put in the context of what the alternative government puts to us now via its new shadow Treasurer, Dr Hewson. This is shown in all of his interviews which we have read since his appointment a relatively short time ago. An article in the Bulletin of 13 June states:</PARA>
<PARA> He says that in welfare, for example, he will be able to cut without hurting the needy. He says he will target welfare money better. He concedes that the Hawke Government has done this. When asked about the Government claim that it has cut as far as it can fairly go, he says that's a matter of judgment. </PARA>
<PARA>When we look at what this Government has already done in terms of cuts we find that the alternative situation looks rather gloomy. That does not give us a great deal of comfort. Calls for cuts extend beyond the Treasurer (Mr Keating) to what is clearly the constituency of the Liberal and National Opposition. They include calls for cuts from the Business Council of Australia, through Brian Loton, calls in its Budget submission by Mr Will Bailey of the Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Ltd for a consumption tax which we understand would be greatly to the detriment of the low income people in our community and particularly welfare beneficiaries and a call backed up by Eric Mayer from National Mutual Life for an economic viewpoint which only augurs worse for those disadvantaged in our community. </PARA>
<PARA> The ACOSS economic picture goes on to point out that contrary to public myth-I would add Opposition party myth-the Government's total revenue from taxes and other sources is no higher than it was four years ago. As the earlier comments made demonstrate that is in large measure due to the sort of tax regime which the Government has implemented and to its failure to plug those gaps which have been exploited in the corporate sector. Although revenue from personal tax has increased ACOSS says that this has been offset by reductions in revenue from other sources. It is predicted in the Government's own Forward Estimates that expenditure in 1989-90 will be more than $3 billion lower than in 1988-89 when measured as a proportion of gross domestic product. That sort of economic environment is one which we must acknowledge. Within the package of legislation before us today at least some measures are being taken to pick up from where those cuts have been made or where increases which might have been expected in the normal course of events have not occurred. </PARA>
<PARA> In setting the social environment the ACOSS submission points out that middle income Australian families with dependent children have suffered a decline in living standards in the last four years while that process has been going on. It is that group which the family package embodied in this legislation helps. In its post-Budget documentation ACOSS acknowledges that with the headline on the front of its Impact magazine `A Big Help for Families' which clearly this package is. Let us not forget the families which have suffered over four years of restraint-restraint at their expense. In the social context ACOSS goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA>Of even greater concern, however, is the increasing number of Australians who do not have secure employment and housing. They are largely the victims of the social and technological changes from which most other Australians have benefited substantially. They are the one who suffer most, for example, from rapidly increasing house prices and rentals and from the perceived need to restrain employment growth for fear of ``over-heating'' the economy. </PARA>
<PARA>The submission goes on to state:</PARA>
<PARA> It is sometimes alleged that low-income people have been protected from a decline in living standards over the last few years. The truth is that recent Budget cuts have reduced the income of many sole parents and young unemployed people by as much as 25-50 per cent. Indeed, a substantial number of people have been entirely deprived of income support by recent changes in the social security system. </PARA>
<PARA>Some of the people severely affected have been amongst the most vulnerable in our community. ACOSS mentions particularly many women who have been recently widowed or separated, many sole parent families, the long term unemployed, the young unemployed and disabled people. The submission further states:</PARA>
<PARA>Contrary to Government claims, even aged and invalid pensioners have suffered a decline in Government income support due to the additional 6 week delay in CPI indexation of pensions which was introduced several years ago. </PARA>
<PARA>As I have said, that is redressed in this package but we must remember that that deprivation has been going on since 1986. Whether or not that had to happen and whether or not we are now addressing the issue, the Democrats heartily agree with ACOSS that it is now more essential than ever that assistance be provided to those people who are in the greatest need. It is in that context that we address our remarks to this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> We are told, and we accept, that the Government has met the benchmarks which it set for itself in terms of its child poverty promise. Along with ACOSS and other groups, we wish to comment on those benchmarks. Earlier in the debate, Senator Giles made some comments about the benchmarks. The Democrats acknowledge the setting of those benchmarks as important. However, we go further, as Senator Giles exhorted the Opposition to do, and say that they are not the ultimate solution. I do not imagine the Government believes they are either. </PARA>
<PARA> In a debate such as this, while we are saying that something is being achieved, we must also say what still needs to be achieved. The ACOSS view that the benchmarks need to be increased must be given some credence, especially in light of the fact that the Brotherhood of St Laurence has pointed out that the family package will help only some 30 per cent, at the outside, of those children who are living in poverty. Obviously, more needs to be done. The ACOSS benchmarks, which call for a $5 increase in the six to 12 years age group and for an $8 increase in the 13 to 15 years age group in order to account for family costs such as schooling, which vary across the age groups, need to be taken into consideration. A good deal more is yet to be done about the single parent families. It will take about an extra $15 per family to get them out of poverty in a general sense. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Giles also referred to the process in which the Government has been engaged in the development of this package. The Democrats acknowledge that process, but within the context which I have mentioned. We acknowledge that to some degree the establishment of the benchmarks following the promise regarding child poverty is of itself a political benchmark. However, the Government must not rest on its laurels. We must look at those most disadvantaged in our community, those who need more assistance. I would like to focus on the three significant groups: sole parents, the unemployed-in particular the young unemployed-and the young homeless. </PARA>
<PARA> Sole parent families are families, but they have not done well out of this package. The Government has made a general attempt to help families, but I repeat that even the Brotherhood of St Laurence, which has said some very good things about what the Government is doing, has said that only 30 per cent of children living in poverty will be helped. It is of some concern that the Opposition barely pays lip service to the fact that sole parent families are families and therefore need consideration. Future Directions itself, with its picket fence politics, with its average family on the front cover, is a slap in the face for those sole parent families which are trying to struggle through. The image is wrong. We need to look at the facts: Sole parent families now constitute 14.6 per cent of all families, following a 75 per cent increase between 1974 and 1986. The majority of those single parent families result from marital separation, divorce or widowhood. The myth that a rash of young single girls have run out to get pregnant in order to get on the gravy train of benefits is just that-a cruel myth. That must be recognised. In June 1988 there were still nearly 450,000 children in sole parent families dependent on the social security pension. Even after the April statement, a single parent with one child was still $11.50 below the Henderson poverty line. It is important that sole parents speak for themselves. The Brotherhood of St Laurence in its document Promise the Children quoted some sole parent families. One reads:</PARA>
<PARA>I get the kids up late and give them a late breakfast so they don't need lunch. I can only afford two meals a day. </PARA>
<PARA>That parent has two pre-school children. A person who has two older children states:</PARA>
<PARA>The children only have gum boots. I hope it rains when school starts, then no one will know they don't have shoes. </PARA>
<PARA>I just hope that family lives in Sydney. Another quotation is from a sole parent speaking about her nine-year-old daughter:</PARA>
<PARA>At the moment my daughter is suffering from severe depression and she's on anti-depressants. It's due to my financial situation -She's taking my burden on her. </PARA>
<PARA>There are other stories. Another reads:</PARA>
<PARA>My daughter wanted to go on a school excursion. It cost $4.60. I said, ``stay home, it's too much money''. </PARA>
<PARA>This is the type of story that comes from these families, which, although they may have only one parent, are families nevertheless. Of course, in most cases those parents are women. The issue for sole parents is one of equivalence. I would like to put on the record some comments from the Council of Single Mothers and Their Children on this issue. The Council states:</PARA>
<PARA> Research into poverty has consistently shown that one-parent families are the family type most vulnerable to severe poverty . . . the Henderson poverty line, does not adequately take account of the income needs of one-parent families. </PARA>
<PARA>We are looking at another benchmark issue. The Council continues:</PARA>
<PARA> Social Security income support should be based on the equivalence of income needs between a sole parent household with one child and a married couple. </PARA>
<PARA>In other words, a household comprising two people. The Council goes on to state:</PARA>
<PARA>This equivalence measure was recognised by a wide range of community groups at the ACOSS National Consultation Congress on Income Support for families with children (December 1986) . . . </PARA>
<PARA>We need to begin to look at the equivalence issue if we are ever going to get the children from these families out of poverty. The equivalence issue has been recognised in some areas of the social security system, such as the income threshold for the payment of the family allowance supplement and the application of the Medicare levy. However, it is not recognised in other Government systems, particularly in the social security income support system and the taxation system. The Council states:</PARA>
<PARA>The Australian Institute of Family Studies has consistently indicated that one-parent families will remain the group most vulnerable to poverty unless specifically targeted measures are introduced. Within the present income support system, the mechanisms for adjusting sole parent pensions for adequacy is the Mother's/Guardian Allowance. </PARA>
<PARA>We welcome the indexation of the mother's/guardian's allowance-it does not come in until 1991-but we are concerned about the failure to increase the mother's/guardian's allowance because it is the only payment which distinguishes the female headed sole parent family, whose family costs are the same as other family costs, from other families. It may be that, with one adult and one child, food costs are marginally lower although, of course, it would depend on the age and appetite of the child. The costs of establishing the household, housing costs, transport costs and general family costs would not be significantly different, yet there is only a sole parent on a sole parent's benefit to meet those costs. In terms of the equivalence issue, a sole parent with one child after the April statement will get $160.25 a week, which is about 77 per cent of the married rate of pension. Therefore, if we accept that that equivalence rate is one that we should be shooting for, then we have some way to go. We believe that is perhaps the only way we can get that significant group of children out of poverty. The Council of Single Mothers and Their Children is calling for an increase to $20 in the coming Budget with a commitment to increase it further by 1991 to $30. It was also calling for half-yearly indexation. Well, annual indexation has been brought in, which will go some way towards that. </PARA>
<PARA> In the areas of sole parenting and equivalence we have to look at the specific problems that female parents in particular, and lone parents generally, have in exercising work force options. Being an only parent in a household is a job in itself. There is a great deal to do if one is going to get out of that situation. I know the Government has established some programs to get women into employment. Unfortunately all the messages that I have got thus far are that they are slow in starting, they are often not reaching particularly those women in isolated areas or those with low self-esteem, mainly because of the rather structured labour market orientation of most of the Government's programs in this area, and also that the problems with child-care options are still in the system. This is difficult for all sole parents, but particularly for female sole parents. </PARA>
<PARA> The question of community attitudes to sole parents is one that the people in this place should address. I am most concerned about the lack of discussion on that and the image which is portrayed by the Opposition, which gives sole parents the feeling that there is not a great deal of sympathy from the political end towards understanding the difficulty where community attitudes are significantly against such a group, which bears a very difficult burden. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, I want to address the treatment of sole parents by the Department of Social Security. I, on behalf of the Australian Democrats, have previously protested against the draconian measures which are available to and are used by the Department all too often, especially when they are directed towards sole parents, and particularly females. Some of these are generated by the general view of the Government that we need to save money. Nobody wants to see fraud perpetrated, but we must ask what some of the savings that we assume we are making will cost. There has been a rash of very inhumane gaolings of women, some of them with very small children, and a large number of prosecutions. But when we stack up questions of fraud against questions of survival, the first question we should ask ourselves is: Why do people who have children to raise find it necessary to misrepresent their situation?</PARA>
<PARA> I am pleased to say that the question of debt recovery is being addressed by a Senate committee and I look forward to its results. I want to put on the record a `special of the month' that has been offered by the Department of Social Security to some of these women. A constituent brought a copy to me. It states, `For the month of June we are offering you a chance to finalise your debt in one payment'. This letter was written to a woman who owes the Department some $4,000 in overpayments as a result of her misrepresenting her situation. She is told, in this special offer, that if she can find $2,000 before 30 June, she will save almost $500. I think this is a fairly cruel approach by the Department. If this woman had $2,000, I am absolutely certain she would not have been in the position of allowing herself to be overpaid $4,000. If she had access to that sort of money, she would not have had to take the desperate measure which most law-abiding citizens in our community would not want to take, and that is to engage in at least a form of fraud, even for survival. But for the Department then to offer this monthly special and to say, `Hurry, hurry, if you do not get in before 30 June, then you will lose the chance to save $500', I think is quite cruel. It is also discriminatory against those who do not have access to $2,000. Perhaps she will beg around her family, her neighbours or somebody else and drag the money together, but those who cannot do even that are, of course, even further discriminated against. </PARA>
<PARA> The other group about whom we are most concerned are the unemployed. I have said often in this place that the Democrats find it abhorrent that there seems to be a general feeling out there, particularly in the political and economic communities, that we cannot afford to lower our unemployment level too much because we have this overheating economy. Articles such as that in the Australian Financial Review on Friday, 9 June, express some concern about the continued buoyancy in the labour market driven by a strong increase in women's employment and part-time jobs, which of course are better for women and which are more available to young people because often they are relatively unskilled. The pressure on the housing industry being perpetrated by the high interest rates lends strength to the arm of those who do not want to see unemployment go down and the pressure on the economy go up any more, and who want to see ordinary people put the lid on the economy. Other than people in the New South Wales branch of the Australian Labor Party, who have seen the light, they do not want to see our international potentates have to pull in their overseas borrowing, they do not want to put a tax on luxury imports, they do not want to give incentives for savings and they do not want to give tax deductability for home buyers-that is, not if they want to live in their own homes. We are saying that the ordinary people ought to be given more consideration. </PARA>
<PARA> The young unemployed and, in particular, those who through their unemployment or as a result of trying to find employment, find themselves homeless are a particular group we are concerned for. This concern has been consistent as it is more than a year since I first moved amendments to improve access to the young homeless allowance. We will be doing that again in the committee stage of this legislation, because we believe now, as we did then, and as Commissioner Burdekin of the Human Rights Commission believes, that we have a commitment to support the young people in our community under the Declaration of the Rights of the Child. For that reason we are picking up three of the recommendations of the Burdekin report with reference to the young homeless allowance in an attempt once more to get this Parliament to give some leadership in this area. We will be very interested in the response of the other parties in this place to that. </PARA>
<PARA> In the last few minutes at my disposal I will outline the nature of the amendments which we will be moving. We will be moving an amendment to the first Bill for six-monthly indexation. As I have said, that is something which the Council of Single Mothers and Their Children has asked for and we certainly believe that that is the least that can be done. We welcome annual indexation. It is way overdue, and we believe that six-monthly indexation ought to be possible. The fact that there is annual indexation does not necessarily give great cause for congratulation when there is quarterly indexation of public funding for political parties. We will also be moving amendments to encourage the Department to improve its 008 telephone facilities and to waive the waiting period in the second Bill where annual leave payments have been used. I now move my amendment to the motion for the second reading of the Social Security and Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1989, which states:</PARA>
<PARA> At end of motion, add: ``, but the Senate, noting that:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) rental assistance payments take no account of the wide variations in the costs of rent around Australia and within individual States; and</PARA>
<PARA> (b) beneficiaries have limited discretion in the matter of where they live;</PARA>
<PARA>expresses its concern about the unfair implications of the present arrangements and urges the government to implement a rent assistance system which would provide payments in relation to the `market' rent in the area in which a beneficiary lives''. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We are debating a package of four Bills: the Social Security and Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment Bill 1989, the Social Security and Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1989, the Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment Bill 1989 and the Defence Service Homes Amendment Bill 1989. I compliment Senator Newman on her tour de force in handling the Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment Bill. She covered a lot of ground, which I will not go over again except to make just a couple of points on the provisions to allow our contingent serving in Namibia a full range of repatriation benefits and access to the Defence Service home loans, which are good and welcomed. But the fact that they were late and our boys had sailed overseas must have made them feel unappreciated and unloved at the time.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The provisions to cover the War Memorial are largely administrative. I always have a pang of fear when I find that another department is being given the power to invest money without the permission of the Minister. This sort of thing seems to be happening more and more not only with Federal government departments but also with State government departments. As long as the Auditor-General can keep his eye on it, he can make sure that it stays within bounds. I do not think that anybody could argue about the restitution provisions for the victims of Nazi persecution nor could he argue about the adjustments to the entitlements for service pension beneficiaries. </PARA>
<PARA> The section that concerns the veterans in the Social Security and Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment Bill is the restoration of some of the benefits that veterans have lost over the years. Honourable senators will remember that benefits were taken from veterans, widows and other dependants in 10 areas. Dental treatment was restricted, allowances for travel for treatment of war caused disabilities were reduced and access to pharmaceutical benefits was reduced. Part of this Bill in some way makes up for that. We welcome the indexation that has been granted and the speed with which the Government passed to veterans, war widows and people in other categories the consumer price index increases. </PARA>
<PARA> This Bill also restores the 2 per cent Defence Force retirement benefit, which was cut out some time ago. To my mind cutting out that 2 per cent was clearly a breach of contract by the Government. If the veterans could have afforded to take the Government to court, I am sure that they would have won. This is in the same category as the case decided yesterday. The Government had cut back the pharmaceutical benefits prescription fee by 10c a prescription. This caused a great loss to pharmacists in Australia. Yesterday the court put down a decision and the Government was found to be in breach. This was similarly the case with pathology services. The Government unreasonably cut back on the provision of pathology services and the pathologists took the Government to court. They won their case too. Had the veterans taken the Government to court on the grounds of breach of contract for cutting that 2 per cent I am sure that they would have won. </PARA>
<PARA> The provisions in the social security legislation Bills are really a result of the 12 April economic statement. The social security Bill covers family payments, pension and benefit indexation, child disability allowances and benefits for double orphan pension recipients. Some time ago the Government introduced its policy statement entitled Towards a Fairer Australia, which was full of rhetoric but was left wanting until now when we are debating the substantiation of the Government's actions. </PARA>
<PARA> To assess how families stand in Australia today it is necessary to look at some figures. The disposable weekly income of a family with a dependent spouse and two children is much lower now than in 1977. Indeed, a double income family would need $71 a week to make up the difference and a single income family would need $56 a week. The tax cuts announced on 12 April, which will not take effect until next month, will be eroded not only by inflation but also by the effects of bracket creep putting people in higher tax brackets, not to mention the other inescapable increases such as sales tax, which has increased almost 150 per cent and counting under this Government. The Medicare levy, which has been increased, and other adjustments to the dependent spouse rebate and the concessional rebate will also increase the amount of tax families have to meet. </PARA>
<PARA> All these changes are on top of the capital gains tax, fringe benefits tax and a broadening of indirect taxes which extend their effect right to low income families because everybody has to pay them. The Labor policy may be towards a fairer Australia but Australia as a society is a lot less fairer than it has ever been and the Government's policies are increasing the polarity between the rich and the poor and the disadvantaged. The number of people considered to be below the poverty level is increasing. Today 2.6 million households-that is, one in every eight-are living below the poverty level. Included in this number are 800,000 children. Child poverty is now a major issue in Australia despite the promise of the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) two years ago that no child would be living in poverty after 1990. Child homelessness has become a social blight and exposes these children to crime, drugs, acquired immune deficiency syndrome and sexual abuse. There is a huge feature page on youth homelessness in Brisbane in today's Courier-Mail. </PARA>
<PARA> The area of housing presents a desolate picture and housing poverty is concentrated amongst families with dependent children. The private rental market is the most severely affected. Around Australia there are almost 200,000 families on public housing waiting lists. The Government offer of small increases in rental subsidies is not an adequate response to this problem. Housing costs vary from place to place and should be addressed on this basis despite the constitutional problems involved. For example, housing costs on Thursday Island are a lot different from housing costs in Sydney. </PARA>
<PARA> The high interest rate policy pursued by this Government has increased average mortgage repayments by at least $500 a month since 1983 and the rates have now gone from 13 per cent to 18 or 19 per cent, which averages about $2,000 more than nine months ago. The Government has not recognised the correlation between poverty and unemployment. As a proportion of the unemployed, those with children have increased from 37 per cent to 46 per cent in the last six years. But the greatest proportional increase in unemployment rates has been for families with three or more children. The duration of unemployment for people seeking full time work is now 47 weeks. That is an increase of 23 per cent since March 1983. The Government claims to have created 1.2 million new jobs. This figure takes no account of the fact that Australia needs at least 60,000 new jobs a year to keep up with population growth and school leavers. To precipitate further family breakdown, wives have been forced to go out to work in order to make ends meet. </PARA>
<PARA> It is obvious that families bear the brunt of unemployment. Nearly 40 per cent of long term unemployment beneficiaries have three or more children. In addition, teenage unemployment is still over 20 per cent and even worse in some areas. The Government policy mix is out of kilter with the problems it has created, as shown by the growing number of people who are living in caravan parks around Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> I will not go on for long because we will adjourn early tonight. I just wanted to make those points. One of the amendments to be introduced is for the provision of 008 numbers so that people can contact their government departments. I welcome that initiative. It is one which we brought in last week with the telecommunications Bills, but it was rejected because the Australian Democrats did not want to see it go into that legislation. So now an amendment is to be moved every time one of these Bills comes up. I suppose they want to claim credit for it. City people are able to ring the whole gamut of government departments for the cost of a local call but country people, who should have similar access to departments, do not have that advantage. With a department such as the Department of Social Security, which is a real growth area with more and more people needing to contact it, this initiative will be useful. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am almost speechless after Senator Sheil's contribution. I do not think that I have heard such a gathering of myth and legend in one speech in a long time. I suggest that Senator Sheil read other people's contributions to this debate and check all of his claims for accuracy. I support this package of legislation-the Social Security and Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment Bill, the Social Security and Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2), the Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment Bill and the Defence Service Homes Amendment Bill. In particular I will address my remarks to the comments about the commitment to families and the changes from which families will benefit as a result of the legislation being passed by this place. Apparently Senator Sheil does not take any notice of what bodies such as the Brotherhood of St Laurence and the Australian Institute of Family Studies have to say. Before he leaves the chamber I will remind him that the Brotherhood of St Laurence stated:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>We congratulate the Federal Government on its work on child poverty, which represents a historic breakthrough in the national attack on child poverty. The Federal Government has now built a solid foundation of income security for Australian families. </PARA>
<PARA>Senator Sheil should attend to that statement because what he has said is wrong and takes no account of the facts of the legislation, let alone the changes that have been implemented by the Government since it has been in office. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;If Senator Sheil wants to stick with the speech that was worked out for him by somebody else, which has been repeated ad nauseam in this place and which takes no account of changes to figures and so on, he can continue to do that but he will not persuade me, or anybody else on this side, or many Australians.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Government, in introducing the legislation, has achieved benchmarks. It has written them into legislation; they are enshrined there. While I did not hear all that Senator Giles said, I am absolutely sure that she covered those matters most comprehensively. I would only endorse the remarks of my colleagues Senator Giles and Senator Maguire as to the details. That establishment of benchmarks is very important. The Henderson Commission of Inquiry into Poverty recommended benchmarks. In fact, the Government has introduced benchmarks that exceed Henderson's proposals. I do not believe we can overlook the importance of that fantastic contribution. Not only are those benchmarks now written into legislation and established for all time but they are also indexed so they can never be eroded to less than their current level unless, of course, the Opposition gets into government and develops some of the peculiar proposals of Dr Hewson, the shadow Treasurer. I will come to that later. </PARA>
<PARA> This is a very significant piece of legislation. If I have one minor complaint it is that we are being asked to address it, speak to it and debate it in this place with the session almost over and not sufficient time to acknowledge and spell out the importance of this matter. It is an absolutely fantastic and significant piece of legislation. It puts those benchmarks for children into legislation. It indexes the payments so those benchmarks can never be eroded. The attack on child poverty to which this Government has been committed, is committed and will continue to be committed is unmatched and is something of which we can be totally unashamed. If any criticism could be offered to the Government-and it is a mean one-it is perhaps that more might have to be done in days ahead. But to suggest that what we have done in the legislation does not address child poverty is not only specious but also little-minded and, in the end, wrong. The Institute of Family Studies, describing Labor's commitment to these standards of adequacy, stated:</PARA>
<PARA>Probably most significant of all, the linking of the rates of payment for FAS-</PARA>
<PARA>that is, the family allowance supplement-</PARA>
<PARA>to those for the married rate of pension, along with the widening of eligibility for low income working families, effectively produces a guaranteed minimum income scheme for all children. </PARA>
<PARA>We know that for younger children the payments have been established and increased from $22.25 to $33 and, for 13, 14 and 15-year-olds, from $22.25 to $43.10. The payments constitute 15.3 per cent and 20 per cent of married rate pension respectively. That is the absolutely fantastic core of the legislation. It is vital, significant legislation. Senator Sheil might note this figure: more than 530,000 families with 1.1 million children will benefit. He might go away and work out whether the figures which he muttered in a speech written many years ago are accurate. </PARA>
<PARA> As I have said before, the standards exceed those recommended by Professor Henderson in his Commission of Inquiry into Poverty. He recommended 12 per cent, 15 per cent and 18 per cent in terms of one, two and three children. The Government has gone to 15.3 per cent and 20 per cent. The important thing is that the payments, particularly the family allowance, not only have been increased but also are to be indexed. With the family allowance supplement, automatic adjustment has been arranged to make sure that the standards of child payment of 15 and 20 per cent of those benchmarks will be maintained; indeed, with the arrangements, they may sometimes be exceeded. </PARA>
<PARA> I will run over these latest commitments and put them against the Government's commitment to children. From 1983 right through there has been an increase for children in low income families every year-in 1983, from $10 to $12; in 1984, $12 to $14; in 1985, $14 to $16; in 1986, $16 to $17; and in 1987, $17 to $22 for younger children and $17 to $28 for 13, 14 and 15-year-olds. In 1988, it went from $22 to $24 and $28 to $31 respectively. In 1989, the top payment-recognising, as the Government always has, that teenagers cost more than youngsters-has gone to $34.10 per child for 13-, 14- and 15-year-olds. </PARA>
<PARA> Those increases have been associated with the increase in the family allowance, which has gone from $5.25 to $9 per week for the first child, together with the indexation of family allowance levels. Currently, a family's income would have to be about $53,000-plus before it would be ineligible for family allowance for the first child. We must remember that for all subsequent children that family's income increases by $2,500 per child. That means that the prospect of families with more than one child, particularly large families, being able to enjoy family allowance and now the increased family allowance is very much higher. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has addressed, first of all, the problem of income support and child support for families on the lowest income scale. With this package it has extended that, along with the tax cuts, to encompass families in the middle income range. That is a quite remarkable achievement, particularly in times of economic stringency. It also acknowledges the contribution Australian wage and salary earners have made. I would not endorse much of what Senator Powell said, but I would endorse her comment that pensioners, by having their pension increase deferred by six weeks, have also contributed. That must be acknowledged. While nobody is happy at losing income, many of the pensioners to whom I spoke were not unhappy to do their bit to contribute to this country's recovery. In fact, that has happened. </PARA>
<PARA> Some of the benefits which Senator Powell sees today and supports in the legislation are due entirely to the Government's economic management over the past three years, particularly in 1986-87, when this country was faced with great challenges. Those people who tightened their belts and contributed to the recovery during that tough time now stand to be acknowledged for that contribution. They will appreciate the increased benefits through tax cuts and family payments. In the short time that we have allotted to us, I cannot go through the details of benefits in this package. But I suggest that Senator Powell might look more comprehensively at the benefits for sole parents. We can always find some small part to complain about, but the Government has been very aware of the need to assist sole parents. </PARA>
<PARA> The most important way in which we can assist any pensioner-excluding age pensioners-is to provide the opportunity for training, education and employment. Nobody wants, or looks forward to, a life of perpetual poverty on a pension. A pension provides, if not perpetual poverty, a restricted income, and the prospects and opportunities for a family are consequently reduced. In particular, the Government has targeted supporting parents by way of the jobs, education and training program. The three relevant departments are combining to provide opportunities and assistance for sole parents to get back into training and education, and are addressing the necessary consequence of adequate child-care. </PARA>
<PARA> This package cannot be seen as assistance for families separate from all the other things the Government has been doing since it came to office. It has to be taken in association with the changes in the health area with the introduction of Medicare and the exemption from the Medicare payment for a couple with an income of just over $16,000, with the allowable income increasing by over $2,300 per child. Single persons earning an income of below $9,500 are also exempt. The Medicare payment provides a guarantee of health coverage for people without their having either to take the risk of having no insurance or to pay much more for private insurance than they would for the Medicare levy. Thousands of Australians have exercised their option under Medicare and appreciate that that covers their needs. That has been of benefit to families too, as have the Government's education policies and our child care policies, which are absolutely unmatched. All of the provisions introduced by this Government since it came to office in 1983 have been unmatched. </PARA>
<PARA> Much of the early work was to redress the disasters left by seven years of Fraser-the huge unemployment levels we faced, the dreadful economic downturn and the failure of payments to assist adequately families and children. The Opposition's saying that it has put families on the agenda and shamelessly suggesting that we are not doing enough demonstrates considerable gall. I do not understand how Opposition members can do that. I believe Senator Bishop started her remarks today by saying that it was the Opposition that put families on the agenda, in its Future Directions document. The kindest thing I could do is chuckle; the worst is something more than that. That is a farce! Families have been on the agenda of this Government in its campaigning and in its policies since before it came to office. It has been part of the thinking, planning and development of this Government all the while. I do not dare think that it has reached its peak; I would like to see it progressing ever onwards and upwards. The commitment to the family which is very much the focus of this legislation addresses the promise and the challenge to which the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) committed this Government; concern to assist children out of poverty. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like to turn to what the Opposition has to say in this area. There is lot of evidence about the outcome of the former Government's policies. Senator Maguire may have spelled out some such evidence that suggested that, when in government, the Opposition's policies were disastrous for families. It made one increase in payments for families in its seven years in office, as I recollect the data, but it did even less to assist families by way of payments for children. It also left this country with massive unemployment when it went out of office. I note that Senator Sheil thinks that the creation of 1.2 million jobs-he is not quite right; it is now 1.4 million-is not of much benefit to families. I do not know how he can sustain that argument. This has been one of the fantastic achievements of this Government. What does the Opposition tell us it will do if it ever gets into government again? Senator Bishop says that Future Directions has put the family on its agenda. As I have said in other places, if we read that document, provided one talks about a nuclear family, with two children being reared behind a picket fence with roses over the gate, one could probably describe such people as a family. Otherwise families do not exist in the document. </PARA>
<PARA> Another important area for families is child-care. The Future Directions document devotes less than two column inches to it. The document itself is of no comfort to us. The Opposition made five promises in that document, which were reduced to three by the time Mr Howard spoke about it. So the promises made in the document were cut by the Opposition before it even spelt out exactly what they meant. Dr Hewson is now promising what he would do when the Opposition gets into government. He is in a particularly interesting situation to set out details of such promises. The Opposition seems to argue, as does Dr Hewson, that it will cut spending; it will expand spending; and it is not quite clear in what areas it will do either of those. </PARA>
<PARA> It is interesting that one of the principal objections raised in this place by the Opposition is that the Government often does things for cost containment, as though this is a blot on and a slur against the Government. The Opposition seems to argue that what we should do is expend more, but it then says that it plans to cut expenditure. Dr Hewson is better than most because he has said that he will cut expenditure in the areas of social security, health and education. That is very challenging, particularly if we consider what might be of advantage to families in those areas. How does Dr Hewson propose that families will benefit from cuts in social security, health and education? If he has any idea of what he means by that, he has not made it clear to people on this side of the chamber or in the other place. Mr Howe, in the other place and in a number of public forums, has challenged Dr Hewson to say what exactly he is planning to do. The best response we can get from Dr Hewson is that perhaps the Government could target more accurately. We have been given some strange figures. We have been told that if we spend $26 billion on all the people in Australia, by dividing, multiplying and parsing, we will eventually come up with a figure for the needy of $26,000-or maybe he meant $13,000 per head. This is outrageous. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not think Dr Hewson gives any comfort by those comments. He indicates that he does not know what is happening in the social security area. He says that he will cut expenditure, that he will tighten things down. But he does not say by how much. He does not acknowledge that that is exactly what the Government has achieved dramatically to this point. Since 1983 social security outlays have fallen from 6.9 per cent of gross domestic product to 6.2 per cent in 1987-88, with a projected 6 per cent this year. What is Dr Hewson's offer? Is he offering 5 per cent? How does he plan to do that? He seems to suggest that this Government is extravagant in its expenditure. He does not seem to appreciate that social security outlays have fallen under this Government, while payments to people who are eligible have increased dramatically, as this package of legislation indicates. </PARA>
<PARA> The other thing he does not seem to appreciate is that since 1983 the proportion of pensioner beneficiaries has fallen from 41.9 per hundred people in the labour force to 35.9 per hundred in June 1988. He does not appreciate that there used to be 600,000 people registered for unemployment benefit; that has fallen to 400,000. The Government would say that is still too high and we are working to reduce it. But it is a remarkable drop and it is a figure that Senator Sheil has not mastered. People gaining work represents a double benefit for government. No longer do those people have to survive on the unemployment benefit-which represents a saving in expenditure for government-but also they are in the work force and thus they are paying tax and contributing to revenue. </PARA>
<PARA> I would have thought that one could take no comfort at all from the Opposition's comments, let alone those of the shadow Treasurer, Dr Hewson. He does not understand what is happening in the Department of Social Security-to take just one area that he has targeted and made wild comments about. Generally, his only proposals are for cuts in social security. Perhaps Senator Walsh is sharper than I, but I certainly think his comments in the Sydney Morning Herald of 29 May 1989 should give Dr Hewson some reason to pause. The Minister for Finance, Senator Walsh, has suggested that Dr Hewson, because of his lifestyle, is hardly likely to have any appreciation of which people are genuinely needy. Dr Hewson has also indicated that he does not understand what `targeting' means. He certainly does not appreciate how much this Government has been able to achieve. While reducing the number of people on pensions and benefits, it has been able to increase the payments to all those who are eligible. He also does not appreciate the restraint and reduction within the Department of Social Security, nor does he seem to appreciate the extraordinary contribution of the people in that Department. </PARA>
<PARA> From time to time we might find one person who, one way or another, has had a less than courteous response when attending one of the Social Security offices around the country. I would certainly be pleased to place on the record that the majority of people in the Department have worked flat out and marvellously over the last six years to cope with and address the number of changes that have been required of them by government and to make those changes clear to the people who seek assistance when they come into Social Security offices. There has never been a period in the history of the Department of Social Security when as many changes have had to be mastered and dealt with. I certainly commend the Department and, if not all, the majority of people who provide assistance to thousands of people in the community who benefit. </PARA>
<PARA> In summary, the Brotherhood of St Laurence has established a high credibility in commenting on matters of poverty in this community. That organisation has commended the Government for establishing its benchmarks. The Institute of Family Studies has said how comprehensive and how effective the proposals in this legislation are. Those proposals represent a quite splendid and principled commitment to the alleviation of poverty. This commitment has never been established by any government; it certainly has not been addressed as effectively and as splendidly as it is in this legislation. We have, by way of the Opposition's comments, nothing more than a suggestion that perhaps Future Directions is the way to go because it mentions the family. This Government was concerned about the family prior to being elected to office in 1983. It has addressed the needs of the family in a comprehensive way by providing all sorts of services in its legislation. The family is not a novelty for the Government; it is not something new; it is part of this Government's commitment. If people want to see proof of that, they should read this legislation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The quickest way for me to close this debate would be to endorse most of what Senator Crowley has said in response to Opposition speakers. I anticipate that much of what is in contention will be discussed in the committee stage, so it does not need to be addressed now. Briefly, at this stage I need to make a number of points in response to some of the basic points made by some Opposition speakers during the debate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The first point that needs to be tackled is the one made by Senator Bishop, Senator Powell and Senator Sheil. They claimed that the family package has helped only 30 per cent of children who were previously living in poverty. Senator Crowley made the point rather convincingly that their speeches must have been written a few years ago. That figure of 30 per cent applies to those children who were lifted above the Henderson poverty line by the first family package in 1987. Since then there was an increase in 1988 and this legislation encompasses a further big increase. When making assessments such as this, one needs to point to the relevance of the Henderson poverty line-a relevance that has been disputed not only by the Government but also continually by official Opposition spokespersons. </PARA>
<PARA> The second point that needs to be addressed-I think it was made by Senator Bishop-is the claim that Australia ranks second worst in the world in terms of the number of people living in poverty. It should be recognised that the figure that was quoted came from a Luxembourg study on income distributions that was conducted in 1981. That study spelt out the situation in 1981. Without going into a massive political debate, people should recognise that, in that period, another party was in government. </PARA>
<PARA> In this brief summary, the third point that needs to be tackled is the claim that somewhere in the vicinity of 800,000 children are now living in poverty. We know where that figure came from as well. We would have expected some degree of honesty in this respect. The Government figure relates to the number of children living in poverty before the introduction of the family package. This fact has been widely acknowledged-Senator Crowley also referred to this in her contribution-by organisations such as the Brotherhood of St Laurence and other independent organisations. The magnitude of the Government's performance in this area can be measured by the fact that over 530,000 low income families and 1.1 million children are encompassed by the Government's plans. I have dealt only with the family package. When we take into account the fact that over one million Australians have found employment in the course of this Government's period of office and recognise that employment security is the most basic part of income security, we can then see the massive inroads that this Government has made in this area. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me signal the Government's position in relation to some of the amendments that will be moved later today. I anticipate that Senator Powell will move an amended amendment in respect of the 008 national line. I also anticipate that the Government will be able to accept that amendment. Basically, the Department of Veterans' Affairs already has a national 008 line for its clients. The Department of Social Security has an extensive and very proud record of use of its 008 lines. But, as we discovered in the debate last week on telecommunications legislation, the technology involved with 008 lines is moving very quickly. It may well be that an appropriate strategy can be linked to the changing technology which will give 008 lines the flexibility to lock into a number of either national, State or regional lines. Accordingly, the amendment which will be moved by the Australian Democrats will be acceptable to us. However, it should be stated that all of the other Democrat amendments that will be moved during the committee stage will be opposed by the Government. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government will oppose the amendment moved by the Democrats to the motion for the second reading which refers to rental assistance payments and so on. That amendment does not take into account the Government's announcements in the last Budget which have led to a major restructuring of the rent assistance program. The Government has encompassed a system whereby payments can be linked to market rental. Even though the Democrats' approach has a superficial attractiveness, we need only look at a similar system to that of the Democrats which operated in the United Kingdom to see the inherent dangers in their proposal. We would finish up with a system under which market rents would increase. All sorts of discriminatory flow-ons would result because of the lack of a well thought out system. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has targeted rental assistance. There will be add-ons for children in recognition of the fact that families with children have high housing costs. The Government will take into account the cost of housing through the rent threshold. This measure was also adjusted by the Government yesterday. As I have said, we reject the Democrats' amendment. </PARA>

<PARA>Many of these are machinery type amendments but all have the effect of implementing half-yearly indexation of the mother's/ guardian's allowance, the family allowance, the family allowance supplement and the orphan's pension, which benefits have been indexed on an annual basis by the Government. As I said at the second reading stage, we acknowledge the improvement in the indexation situation. One of the most significant means of causing a decline in social security benefits over the years has been the lack of indexation. Therefore, any indexation is important. However, it seems to the Australian Democrats that half-yearly indexation would be much more effective. All of these benefits are given to areas of need. They are payments which in large measure still are inadequate, particularly in the context of a community in which it is quite obvious that the rich are getting richer and the poor are getting poorer. </PARA>
<PARA> We do not accept the Government's argument that what we are proposing cannot be afforded-not when we see the avenues that are still open to this Government to increase its revenue from the corporate sector. It could address the problems of our current account deficit by tackling the issues of negative gearing on foreign borrowings and limiting imports of foreign products where they are not part of the productive development of our economy. The Government has failed to implement those measures; therefore we feel that it does not have firm ground on which to object to moves as we propose, which will give some further minimal advantage to the most disadvantaged in our community. </PARA>
<PARA> I stress that, for a chamber comprising politicians to have passed legislation which indexes on a quarterly basis the funding for parliamentary elections and then to turn around and fail to index on a half-yearly basis the mother's/guardian's allowance, the family allowance, the family allowance supplement and orphan's pensions, has, at the very least, a selfish, if not nasty, ring to it. I have moved these amendments on behalf of the Australian Democrats in the interests of fairness and equity while at the same time acknowledging that indexation is with us through this legislation but in what we consider to be an inadequate form. I also remind the chamber that quarterly indexation has been the policy of the Australian Democrats for the past 12 years, and it will continue. Perhaps here we are suggesting something like a halfway house which will go to the advantage of the disadvantaged in our community. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Briefly, the last time Senator Powell came up with a proposal such as is contained in these amendments was in 1986 when she said that child payments should be indexed thereafter. Just to highlight the fact that, although her motives may be commendable, implementing them may not work out the way that she would want, had we indexed the 1986 figure of $22 a week, child payments currently would be $26.34. However, the level of child payments at the moment is $33 for younger children and $43.10 for older children. So, even though indexation may have an attraction, it does not necessarily deliver what the Australian Democrats would want; in fact it could run counter to their position.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The second point that needs to be made is that twice-yearly indexation would have a number of not only administrative costs but also spin-offs that I am sure the Australian Democrats would not like to see. For instance, it would make the whole eligibility and take-up situation twice as difficult for people to conform with. Under half-yearly indexation, we would have more administrative problems. We would probably need to reassess clients three times a year, assuming calendar year assessment remains. As a consequence, people would drop in and out of the system much more frequently than we would like. One has only to look at countries such as New Zealand, which has confusing take-up eligibility criteria, to see that what we have done over recent years has been to streamline the system as much as possible. We believe the annual assessment regime is the most appropriate and the simplest one. Accordingly, we oppose the amendments. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1"> -Because of the sittings of a joint parliamentary committee and other concerns, I have not entered this debate on the Social Security and Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment Bill and associated Bills until now. That is regrettable, because I have had a very keen interest in this area for many years. I ask honourable senators to recall 1976, though I do not think anybody else present was in the Senate at that time, when the then Government abolished tax rebates for children and introduced the family allowance scheme. Had the then Government simply abolished tax rebates for children, there would have been a tremendous outcry. But what the Government then did was to apply the money thus saved to a family allowance paid directly to the carer, mainly the mother. It was an exercise which transferred money out of the hip pocket into the purse. I recall getting up in this place at that time and saying that I agreed with that concept but that there was a need to ensure that the family allowance was indexed; otherwise the Government, through inflation, would be stealing the money out of the purse of the mother. Of course, that is what happened. I remember the then Leader of the Opposition, who was also the Australian Labor Party spokesman on social security, agreeing with me at that time. I could go to Hansard and drag it out, but honourable senators can take it from me that he agreed with me.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Since then successive governments have stolen out of the purses of the mothers of Australia in the order of $12 billion. The Government makes great play of its family package, trumpeting it throughout Australia. What it does not say is that it is giving back only a minuscule amount of the money that has already been stolen because of the failure to index family allowances and because of other aspects dealt with in the taxation debate last week. I feel that the Government should acknowledge that, and also acknowledge that even this latest change will not restore the family allowance to its 1976 value. It is not doing that in this legislation. It is not even up to the 1976 value. </PARA>
<PARA> I acknowledge what the Minister for Consumer Affairs, Senator Bolkus, said about this legislation increasing one of the child payments beyond the level that would otherwise apply following indexation. I was not dealing with that particular aspect; I was dealing with the aspect of family allowances. I feel that there is merit in indexation. The question is whether that indexation should be on a yearly basis or a half-yearly basis. I am of the view that that mechanism which enables people to maintain their standards of living and which is capable of being properly implemented ought to be implemented. I listened to what the Minister said. I am not sure that I can see any major administrative problem which would attach to adjustments on a half-yearly basis. In respect of the family allowance supplement, I understood him to be saying that people would be phasing in and out of eligibility, but that happens on an annual basis in any event. I do not see that there would be an enormous problem with that on a half-yearly basis. There is no problem with the family allowance, which is a universal payment. Adjusting it on a six-monthly basis will be as easy as adjusting it on a 12-monthly basis. It is just a matter of punching a few numbers into a computer, a matter of five minutes work by somebody in the Department of Social Security. So I really cannot see the argument there. </PARA>
<PARA> I understand what Senator Bishop has been saying about the Opposition not having had time to put this matter to its appropriate meetings and so forth. I am in the fortunate position of not having to go through that particular process, although I can assure the Committee that I argue with myself regularly. I understand the predicament of the Opposition completely. It is very awkward to have in front of us amendments such as this which are not able to be considered at length. But I have considered it, and I am going to support it. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Bishop has expressed concern about not being able to take things through due process. I must say that we do have a problem in the Senate in the dying days of both of the parliamentary sessions. The Government sends its House of government home and then says to the Senate, `But you are only a House of review. Don't change anything. You are not there to look at legislation again'. The Opposition sends home its lot in the other place-the `A' team as I think it calls itself-as well. The Opposition is effectively saying to us, `Well, of course, we will stay here and collect our money, but don't dish up any amendments to us because we can't get a party meeting together'. There are a lot of unicameralists around in the last couple of weeks of a session, whether it is the end of the autumn session or the end of the Budget session. As far as I am concerned, we in this chamber are here to do our work. The Australian Democrats are here to do our work, and we will continue to do it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I did get to Senator Bishop a summary of our proposed amendments last week. I am sorry that they were not in fully drafted form, but I had no communication asking me to explain them. I would have been happy to do so. I thought she would be able to contact the relevant people in her party. If she now says that absolute caucus democracy is essential before any decision can be made, then I suppose I have to believe her. But I think we have to think about what the role of the Senate is. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister for Consumer Affairs (Senator Bolkus) makes the rather feeble excuse that we cannot index half-yearly because it would be awkward-there are all sorts of income tests, take-up problems and so on. We index the age pension half-yearly and we seem to manage. Therefore, I suggest that other benefits should be able to be indexed half-yearly as well. </PARA>
<PARA> Before I even made a maiden speech in this place I called for indexation. I am really flattered to think that honourable senators have bothered to dig my speech out. It caused some uproar in this chamber and I think it caused Senator Walsh to find the appellation `fairies at the bottom of the garden' for us at that early stage. The fact that I called for indexation as soon as I came into this chamber does not mean that that was all that we were calling for then or all that we would have continued to call for. That is a rather ridiculous argument. It does not exclude the possibility of asking for indexation and adequacy. We continue to do that. I did that in my speech in the second reading debate. While I acknowledge what the Government is doing, there are other issues. One of them is more frequent indexation and another is adequacy. I will refer to Bettina Cass and the Social Security Review. What has happened to age pensions in the legislation is good, and I acknowledge that. It is overdue, but it is good. But it is not even adequate yet. Cass says that and the Government admits it. We all know it. But we do not just say that we cannot have indexation in case it muddies the waters as far as adequacy is concerned. That would be ridiculous. We will continue to push for both, I can assure the Government, and we will divide on these amendments. I will tell honourable senators why. In 1986 we were the only members who divided on the question of the delay to the age pensions. Finally, after all this time, that delay has been redressed. We will divide again on this issue to be firmly on the record that we believe that more frequent indexation is necessary and possible. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Powell stated that the Liberals ought to have been able to do something about considering her amendments in our party room despite the fact that the House of Representatives has not sat for nearly two weeks. Just for the record, I think it is important to mention that I said that, because these amendments required an additional expenditure of money, it was essential for the issue to be discussed in our party room. The Australian Democrats are in the wonderful position of being able to promise the world and never having to deliver it. Therefore, they are able to make extravagant statements, move amendments that require vast expenditure of money and say that somebody else ought to appraise the matter and come to a decision. The coalition parties act in a responsible manner. We like to appraise and consider any proposal to expend additional amounts of taxpayers' money.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to respond to all the points made. The Australian Democrats remind me of the political journalists who, over the space of six months or so, have managed to predict an election date which on every occasion is different from the one they predicted the time before. Then, once the election is called, they say, `There you are, we told you'. No-one accuses Senator Powell of stating that there should be only one government program delivery in the area of social security and veterans' affairs. No-one would ever accuse the Democrats of limiting their priorities in that way. We say that the Democrats set their benchmark for this issue in 1986. They made it very clear that they wanted $22 per week, indexed. I said earlier on that, had this been done, younger children would be $7 a week worse off and older children would be $17 a week worse off under the Democrats' proposal. The Democrats just have to accept that in this particular instance maybe they did not ask for enough.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator Harradine made a couple of significant points. In respect of those I think I should bring the discussion to a very quick conclusion and quote from the Institute of Family Studies. On the night of the April statement it said of that package:</PARA>
<PARA>The package appears to redress the erosion of family incomes since 1976 through tax bracket creep and the failure to index family benefits. The indexation of family benefits is an historically significant feature which will ensure that these payments will not be eroded in the future. </PARA>
<PARA>In every year of this Government's term of office there have been quite important targeted increases in child and family payments. In the April statement, as the Institute acknowledges, through the package there has been a major achievement in terms of the maintenance of the adequacy of those payments. </PARA>

The issue has been addressed quite directly in these recommendations of the Burdekin report. It seems to us, as it does to Mr Burdekin obviously, that one of the key areas in which we need to move and move quickly is that of income support for our young people. Not all people who would qualify for the young homeless allowance are necessarily homeless under the same definition as the homeless children who have gained much more publicity and attention since the release of this report. They are homeless, however, in the sense that they are not living in a family home. We are saying that adequate income support must be made available. </PARA>
<PARA> Almost two years ago in Victoria, groups of youth workers and others concerned about this issue came to Canberra. It was interesting that Senator Cooney, Senator Patterson and I attempted to have a press conference to support the proposals of this group to make access to the young homeless allowance easier and less restrictive. We were talking about access, not so much about adequacy, although that is also a problem. I want that to be on the record, after the last exchange. The media were not at all interested because members of all political parties across the spectrum were pursuing a social justice issue. It was not a media event at all. I am aware that people around the chamber are concerned about this issue, as are people throughout the community. </PARA>
<PARA> The amendment is slightly different from those we moved last year; if anything it is more conservative, but it picks up the three recommendations of the Burdekin report. The allowance should be available equally to children under 16 and young people 16 and 17 years of age. The Burdekin inquiry and other forums drew to our attention the fact that many young people under the age of 16 are homeless and income support is essential to them. Therefore, we do not believe that they should be excluded. The other recommendation picked up in this amendment is that during the assessment period, which is essential for the assessment of individuals applying for the allowance, a special benefit should be paid so that income support is available during that process. One of the problems with the young homeless allowance has been the tortuous nature of the assessment and therefore the long period during which there is no income support. </PARA>
<PARA> We also picked up the further recommendation that the criteria for homelessness should be extended to include a test of independence. The test recommended by Burdekin and picked up by us in our amendment is that a person who has lived away from home for three months should qualify for the allowance without the need to meet the other criteria which exist with regard to that allowance. Those other criteria relate to various proofs of homelessness, various statements from parents and so on. In our proposed new subsection 8b we are saying that a benefit should be paid in the assessment period but in proposed new subsection 8c we say that the application would have to be suitably supported by a youth worker or a social worker from the Department. We are not saying that any young person should just be able to go up and get a benefit. We believe an application would need to be supported by appropriate people. </PARA>
<PARA> The amendment is more conservative than those we moved last time because last time we were trying to do away with the longer waiting period. Nevertheless, if this Parliament is to show any leadership in this area, it should move in the area of income support for a significant group of young people but, perhaps more importantly, a very deserving and needy group of young people. We are as aware as anybody that it is not just a matter of income support. Many measures are needed, not the least of which are family supports because of the stresses on families which often lead to this homelessness. However, this is one area in which we can move. The Victorian Government is showing its credentials in announcing an $11 1/2m package. It is not a perfect situation. It is over a four-year period and therefore somewhat thin, but at least, should we move on this, we could say there would be support elsewhere at different levels of government and certainly in the community. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Government also opposes the amendments, for two sets of reasons: the first general and the second more specific. In terms of the general reasons, the Government is concerned about getting it right. To get it right we will not be involved in ad hoc reactive decision making. What we have in process is the development of a social justice strategy for young people which will be announced in the Budget context. We also have in process a working party of Commonwealth and State officials working on the inquiry into homeless children. That particular working party is reporting today at a meeting of Commonwealth and State welfare Ministers.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In essence the major issues involved are not just the levels of income support payments concentrated upon by Brian Burdekin in chapter 14 of his report, Our Homeless Children, but a whole range of interrelated issues such as promoting participation by young people in worthwhile activities, reinforcing parental responsibility and so on. There are also questions about Federal and State responsibilities and roles, as well as community roles, all of which have been highlighted by organisations such as the Brotherhood of St Laurence. These issues are very much at the forefront of the Government's considerations in developing its social justice strategy for youth. </PARA>
<PARA> Specific problems-I instance just two-arise out of the amendments from the Australian Democrats. Under the proposed subsection (8a), for instance, every child who qualified as homeless would automatically be entitled to young homeless allowance regardless of age and regardless of work or activity test requirements. One could have 10-year-olds who were not living at home being paid an allowance by the Commonwealth. </PARA>
<PARA> It is very much a broad amendment which may have as its motivation the right sentiment but it has particular problems in implementation. Proposed subsections (8b) and (8c), for instance, create a completely new discretionary benefit with not one iota of criterion of eligibility for the benefit. Very briefly, the proposal would cause the Government two significant problems. As I said, there are no criteria for eligibility. Under this Democrats' amendment a social worker could properly determine to pay the benefit to a young person who lived at home. The proposal would give unlimited discretion to any social worker employed in the Public Service. That of course would have all sorts of problems in terms of appeals, the roles of social workers, the discretionary powers of social workers and so on. </PARA>
<PARA> It is very much a general amendment, the bottom line of which-it may be that the Australian Democrats have not assessed it closely enough to work this out-is, for example, that proposed subsections (8b) and (8c) would permit payment of a homeless allowance to a young person who was living in a house supplied by his or her parents and provided with regular maintenance by his or her parents. That could be done on the recommendation of a social worker and in the circumstances in which that child was away for three months and asserted independence. In essence we have problems with the amendment. We are concerned about developing a cohesive, coherent, broad response to the problem. We warn the Senate that the amendment, as now framed, would cause unforeseen problems that have not been foreseen by those who moved it. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I hope the Minister was not suggesting in his criticism of proposed subsections (8a) and (8c) that appropriate social workers would collude in fraud in the way he seemed to be in his criticism of this part of the amendment. We are talking about special benefits provision. That is what special benefits are: they are special, they are not ongoing and they have to be subject to some kind of assessment. We have suggested that a social worker do that assessment. It would be a poor assessment if the social worker did not establish where the provision of the accommodation was coming from. I hope that the Minister was not casting a cloud over social workers in that context.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I do not think there is much credibility in a response which says, `Shock, horror, this might mean a 10-year-old who does not live at home gets income support'. That is precisely the reason that we believe a lower age limit should not apply. If there is a need for income support it should be available. That does not mean that we are saying that 10-year-olds should not live at home. We all know from reading this report, Our Homeless Children, and from other information that this sort of situation arises and we feel there is a responsibility. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1"> -I feel that there are aspects of this amendment which need to be thought through in greater detail. I am not disposed at this stage to support it. I agree with what was said by Senator Bishop and also mentioned by the Minister for Consumer Affairs (Senator Bolkus)-that there needs to be an overall response to this major problem of homeless youth. I acknowledge that in what Senator Powell is doing she is attempting to address that issue. But I feel that the implications of the amendment need further consideration.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> While the Government is considering its response to the homeless youth question, as Senator Bishop has said, other questions need to be considered. These include family support questions and others which no doubt Senator Powell is completely aware of. I have raised a number of them in this place over a number of years; they are on the record. I raised one the other day about the unemployment rate among young people and the very high burden of unemployment that is experienced by young girls aged 15 to 21. Those girls are bearing the greatest burden of unemployment in this country. I mentioned at the time that because of the Government's policies, the high interest rates and so on there were many mothers going out into the paid work force. They are taking jobs which would otherwise be available for their daughters. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Giles says that they are not. That is the reason I am raising this issue-because I expected that response. When I asked my question the other day I heard some catcalls from the Government side of the chamber to the effect, `Oh, what you want to do is get all the women out of the work force'. The people who have said that ought to read an article that I wrote 21 years ago about women in the labour force. I argued that it was not a question of choice. That does not enter into it. Individuals, whether they be men or women, should have a true freedom of choice. What we are faced with today is that many women do not have that true freedom of choice to do what they want to do, and that is be full time home-makers and carers. That is what we are faced with. I warned people about that in 1968. There were posters all around the place with the words `Mother's liberation' on them. It was largely an employer stunt to get cheap labour into the work force.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> One of the problems that we have been faced with over a long period is the entrenchment of a system which is developing to the stage where the Government's policies are based on an assumption that it requires two incomes for a family to live at a reasonable standard. I reject that. I believe that the whole of the Parliament should reject that concept. It is unfair and it is discriminatory against those mothers who wish to choose to be virtually full time home-makers, and it is taking away jobs from young girls. I invite the Committee to study the unemployment figures and see the enormous burden that is being carried by today's youth. I am not saying that that is the only or even the major reason for the problem of homeless youth in Australia. That will be a matter for debate at a later stage. I agree with what Senator Bishop and the Minister have said-that is, that the responses to that problem must be fully considered and urgently attended to, and some interim measures must be applied. </PARA>

We believed that it was much more apposite to embody that kind of direction within each department's Act. It is ironic that the first department that we are dealing with in this respect-the Department of Social Security-has a fine record of providing 008 facilities for its clients. I am informed that all of its country and regional offices in Tasmania, Western Australia, Queensland, Northern Territory and Victoria have 008 services. New South Wales seems to be lagging behind. I am sure my colleague Senator McLean will keep a weather eye on what happens there. Some more work also needs to be done in South Australia. The Department has used national hotlines effectively and I understand that it intends to continue to do so. This is an equity issue for people who live in rural areas. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like to comment on Senator Sheil's initiative in reminding the chamber of the telecommunications legislation. I made a public statement about this aspect of Australian Democrat policy about a year ago. Following the debacle of the wheat legislation, it is obvious that National Party members and senators put their heads together and said, `What can we do for our constituents?'. It is good when people who have perhaps a 60 per cent majority actually sit down and think about what they can do for their constituents. I am very pleased that they signalled that they would be prepared to agree to these amendments. </PARA>
<PARA> Given the good record of the Department of Social Security in providing services at regional offices, I believe the wording of the amendments is appropriate. We welcome the Government's support for amendment No. 1 regarding the Department of Social Security and amendment No. 4 regarding the Department of Veterans' Affairs. This will ensure that, in the interests of equity, people who do not live in metropolitan areas or in regional centres will have this kind of access. We also welcome the initiative of the Opposition in flagging its support last week for this kind of approach. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is interesting that Senator Powell thanks the Opposition for flagging its interest in this matter. I think we did much more than that. The Opposition put forward very strong views in the debate last week on the telecommunications legislation. The Australian Democrats saw fit not to support the Opposition on that occasion. In that debate Senator Powell said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>It is interesting to ask a question that I have asked before, but this time I ask it of the Opposition. Has the Opposition costed this proposal-that is a question often asked of the Australian Democrats-and is there any perception in the moving of this amendment of the economic costs, since most of the other amendments we have been given here have been put on that basis?</PARA>
<PARA>It is important that the real attitude of the Democrats be pointed out from time to time. They seem to have a set of double standards, which suits them agreeably. Because of the Opposition's attitude, we will not be opposing the Democrats amendments. We have noted that the Government will agree to them. But I will be seeking leave at the third reading stage to move a motion which would refer the question of costing and other related matters to the Senate Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration so that they can be properly dealt with. </PARA>
<PARA> We see amendments brought into this chamber again and again by the Democrats which are bandaid in effect or ad hoc in nature. On this issue where they chose to refuse to support us, when we moved a strong amendment in this area, and to bring it forward, as they say, department by department as the relevant pieces of legislation come before this chamber, it is important that the matter be referred to a committee and dealt with so that we can see the proper costing of what is involved. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I ask Senator Bishop to note, first, that, as I said, the proposed amendment of the Opposition to the telecommunications legislation was inappropriate and very badly worded and would not have satisfied the need; and secondly, that this amendment, as it is framed, actually puts the question of where the given department, whichever one it is-in this case there are two departments-places this activity in its overall framework of the costs and benefits that it sees for its clients, unlike the thrust of the Opposition's amendment last week which was an exhortation, which would have had to have been implemented, according to the Opposition, apparently posthaste and therefore without the opportunity of the department concerned to give any consideration to the costs and ramifications in the short term.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Democrats are very concerned about sending off a reference of this nature to a Senate committee, especially given that the amendments will be passed and therefore will be implemented, which, as I say, is in the hands of the department concerned. It seems to us to be a fairly futile reference. To take Senator Bishop's concern and complaint about our earlier amendments, this is a move on which we have not been consulted and I am not sure whether the Committee itself has been consulted. It is therefore very difficult for us to support a reference to a committee when we do not have any knowledge at all of whether the committee is willing or able to accept that reference. Given that we do not believe that the reference is necessary, it does not move us to support Senator Bishop's foreshadowed proposal. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I cannot let stand the Democrats' claim to being the superior draftsmen on this issue. I do not think that is a satisfactory reason for their having rejected the proposal in the telecommunications legislation. I would have thought that in the light of Senator Powell's comments on that occasion, she was concerned about the costing. Whether this goes into operation before or after we have an inquiry, it would be beneficial for us and taxpayers generally to acknowledge how much it is costing. In making these remarks, I acknowledge that the Department has already moved in all States except New South Wales and Victoria to have a thorough system of 008 numbers operational, and that it is moving to remedy the situation in New South Wales and Victoria.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA> `` `or (c) if the person became unemployed involuntarily-the number of days in the period referred to in subparagraph (1) (f) (i) or 28, whichever is the lesser.'.''. </PARA>
<PARA>When the April statement came down the Australian Democrats were concerned with a number of aspects of the way the costings were done, and particularly that a good many of the savings would be made in the area affecting the unemployed, including the restructuring of the Jobstart program; the strengthening of the unemployment benefit work test, which basically amounts to the Government's work for the dole program-people will be forced to take part time employment and to travel, whether or not that will impede their ability to accept appropriate employment-and also the deferment of unemployment and sickness benefits for annual leave payments on termination of employment. </PARA>
<PARA> We are not particularly concerned so much with that, although it does have some problems, but we are particularly concerned-that is why we have decided to move these amendments-that someone who is involuntarily unemployed should have to use up his annual leave payments for a period of up to four weeks, when he is still entitled to them, and then serve the one week waiting period. This amendment seeks to remove that one week waiting period for the involuntarily unemployed-our amendment applies only to them-who have to use up their annual leave entitlements before going on to the unemployment benefit. </PARA>
<PARA> When the issue of the payment of unemployment benefit arrears came up in 1977 we note that the Government, then in opposition, was strongly opposed to a waiting period which was attached to that payment in arrears. We believe, in moving this amendment, that a party which in opposition was very much opposed to this in principle, will also accept our view that people who are involuntarily unemployed and use up their annual leave entitlements should not have to serve a further waiting period before receiving the unemployment benefit. </PARA>
<PARA> We are concerned about the involuntarily unemployed, particularly those in the over 50 and 55 age groups, because the statistics show that they are the least likely to be re-employed. The use of the annual leave entitlement, the bit in this legislation that we are attacking, means that many people may not be able to make repayments on their houses, their cars or whatever. They will have to be in abject poverty before they will be entitled to the unemployment benefit. That is of concern, especially as this represents a major saving-$51m now and $61m in the next two financial years. We think there is a considerable degree of inequity in that and it is a very ungenerous approach, especially when we realise that many people who become unemployed will have taken their annual leave. So it is inequitable to the extent that the only people who will have to use it up in this way are those who will not have already taken it before they become unemployed. </PARA>

<PARA> (1) Page 4, paragraph 11 (c), lines 1 to 18, leave out the paragraph. </PARA>
<PARA>As I outlined in my speech during the second reading debate, the Australian Democrats do not accept the fact that the Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment Bill delivers justice. We have moved an amendment to paragraph 11 (c), which involves its deletion for the reasons I cited earlier. As I mentioned during the second reading debate, the Administrative Appeals Tribunal (AAT) upheld and ruled that those who have been awarded the British Defence Medal do in fact qualify for veterans entitlements under the Veterans' Entitlements Act. Paragraph 11 (c) attempts to exclude those people. We consider this to be quite inappropriate and unjust. For that reason, we propose the deletion of paragraph 11 (c). </PARA>
<PARA> In moving this amendment, I cite the fact that there is grave concern in the veterans' community that particularly over the last three years there has been a serious erosion of veterans' entitlements. In fact, there have been a series of rallies. There was a very substantial rally in Tweed Heads about 18 months ago attended by in excess of 2,000 veterans focusing severe criticism on the Government performance in relation to this portfolio. There was a rally the day after Anzac Day in the Sydney Town Hall attended by the shadow Minister for veterans' affairs, the honourable member for Farrer, Mr Tim Fischer, and me. Unfortunately, that rally was not attended by the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Mr Humphreys). That only served to fire up further anger in the veterans community about what it sees as being a very substantial erosion of its entitlements. </PARA>
<PARA> I draw the attention of the Committee and of the veterans community as a whole to the fact that those entitlements could not be eroded were it not for the support of the Opposition in that process of erosion. Over a period of 18 months I have been approached on three separate occasions to propose a series of amendments on each occasion that the Veterans' Entitlements Act has been before the Senate. All of the amendments that I have proposed, including this one, have been at the suggestion of the veterans. This amendment is moved at the suggestion of the Returned Services League of Australia (RSL), which I know has also approached the Opposition. The RSL believes that the proposal contained in paragraph 11 (c)-that is, the exclusion of those people who have qualified for the Defence Medal-is quite unjust. It believes that that is the feeling of the veterans' community. Yet again, we see an amendment, moved at the behest of the RSL, defeated by the vote of the Opposition in conjunction with the Government. We will not divide on this but I do want it profoundly on the record that the process of erosion, which is quite real and which is the object of the anger in the veterans community, has only occurred because of the combined vote of the Opposition and the Government. </PARA>
<PARA> It is obvious to me that the Opposition, despite what it says, is really soft on veterans' issues. On every occasion that Opposition members have been presented with an opportunity to support amendments which convey the real wishes of the veterans' community, they have crossed the floor-they have not opposed the legislation. In fact, they have constantly looked across the chamber and seen themselves as the incoming government. That situation presents them with two options: to promise to right these terrible wrongs-empty and hollow election promises-or to go in off the dirty winnings. It is absolutely vital that the veterans' community yet again register its disapproval at this amendment servicing its needs being defeated, as have all other previous Democrat amendments, by the combined vote of the Opposition and the Government. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On behalf of the Opposition I wish to speak briefly to the amendment moved by the Australian Democrats and also to the foreshadowed amendment. We are dealing with a question of pension eligibility for certain Commonwealth veterans on the basis of campaign medals. At the outset, I must say that there is no way that I can accept Senator McLean's claim that the Opposition is soft on veterans' matters. We have had a long and honourable record in supporting veterans-long before the Democrats even came on the political scene. Whilst it is not unreasonable to expect no more generous treatment for Commonwealth veterans than for Australians, in the light of the current McGirr Inquiry into Commonwealth and Allied Veterans' Entitlements, the Opposition feels that paragraph 11 (c) should perhaps be delayed. In the other place, my colleague the shadow Minister for veterans' affairs, Mr Fischer, moved an amendment, which simply sought to delay the implementation of paragraph 11 (c) until the report on the McGirr inquiry was released. In the committee stage of the House of Representatives debate, the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Mr Humphreys) gave the following assurance on behalf of the Government:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>. . . I can state quite categorically that the Government will not take any pension entitlements established before the commencement of the Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment Bill. </PARA>
<PARA>The Opposition welcomed that assurance and has had time to study it, as I would have expected of the Australian Democrats. The result is that the Opposition is not prepared to support the amendment moved by Senator McLean to omit paragraph 11 (c). The Opposition moved the amendment in the House of Representatives simply to make sure that no-one would lose any existing entitlements as a result of the passage of paragraph 11 (c). Consequently, the Minister's assurance has been of some comfort to us. </PARA>
<PARA> We do not support the Democrats' first amendment because it appears to allow a situation where Commonwealth veterans who did not ever see a dangerous situation as combatants will be eligible for a pension, unlike Australians who are not. The service pension was extended to Commonwealth veterans in 1975. It was intended to be awarded to those who had actually incurred danger. However, the recent Administrative Appeals Tribunal decision appeared to change the situation to widen the eligibility beyond that enjoyed by Australian veterans. We do not support that widening and thus cannot accept the Democrats' amendment, which would have the effect of giving Commonwealth veterans a privileged position vis-a-vis Australian veterans. The Democrats then decided that they would move our original amendment as an alternative. It is typical of the Democrats. I believe that the motive behind this action is simply a cheap political stunt. They had no intention of supporting our amendment when they discussed this matter during the passage of the legislation through the House of Representatives. </PARA>
<PARA> Putting aside such a matter of politics, we do welcome the assurance that the Minister gave in the other place. We want to concentrate instead on the main purpose of the legislation, which is to ensure repatriation benefits for our men in Namibia. We in the Opposition salute them. They are a proud force doing a difficult job. They are separated from the people that they love back home in Australia and we send them our best wishes and proud support. </PARA>

However, month after month one can sit here listening to the empty rhetoric of Senator Newman, but find that minutes later, when Opposition senators can deliver, they will walk across the floor and vote against the very amendments that we have moved at the request of the veterans community. They intend to do so now. We have heard the empty rhetoric and we are now going to see the physical display of what follows the empty rhetoric-the crossing of the floor to bring down amendments that have been moved at the request of the veterans themselves. We have seen it over and over again, no more hypocritically than when Senator Newman moved a batch of five amendments in relation to the defence service homes legislation at the second reading stage when they would have had no effect at all-she knew they would have no effect-yet seconds later voted against similar amendments in committee when they would have had effect. It is important that Australians and veterans understand what is happening here. Their entitlements are being eroded by the process of the Opposition supporting the Government. That has been going on over the last two years since I came to this place. That is the reality.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am very pleased to be the President of the Australian Parliamentary Association for the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF). Australia is currently in the position where we can initiate one of the most positive advances to protect the future of our world-its children. We have the opportunity to show just how important immediate action is to ensure a breakthrough in a vital area of the protection of the physical and mental growth of the world's children. Such an advance is vitally important for the future prosperity and peace of the world. It is so important that late last year UNICEF proposed a special summit of political leaders to be called to consider how the major opportunities for protecting children might be seized over the next decade. The suggestion of a world summit for children has met with a positive response from many areas. Over 50 heads of state or governments, including Prime Minister Hawke, have endorsed the concept. The centennial conference of the Inter-Parliamentary Union in Budapest in April, with over 500 parliamentarians from around the world, unanimously urged for such a summit to be called. The recent Dakar summit, with 45 heads of the French-speaking world and delegations present, supported the idea of a summit for children.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The issue of children is so important that it has been included on the agenda for discussion at the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association meeting in Barbados in October. The 9,000 Commonwealth parliamentarians it represents, including all of us, will be asked, `What can you do individually and collectively to promote the survival and rights of children?'. I and my fellow members of the Australian Parliamentary Association for UNICEF firmly believe that we need not wait until October to be asked. I urge the Australian Government, and especially Prime Minister Hawke, to take a world initiative by calling on the Secretary-General of the United Nations to issue invitations for a summit-level meeting. Should the Secretary-General believe that such a summit should be held apart from the United Nations General Assembly, Australia could demonstrate our commitment to programs for the protection of today's children and tomorrow's world by hosting the summit. This is in keeping with the Prime Minister's actions to remove poverty in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> There can be few arguments against the urgent need for a world summit for children, which must obviously include Presidents Bush and Gorbachev. Despite a child survival and development revolution begun by UNICEF in 1982 that uses low cost technologies such as oral rehydration therapy to prevent death through diarrhoeal dehydration, an expanded children's immunisation program against six major diseases, and other basic health care measures which saved around three million young lives last year, over 14 million children still died unnecessarily. It should be remembered that 250,000 children die each week from preventable causes. One death in every three in the world is the death of a child under the age of five. </PARA>
<PARA> Simple low cost measures such as immunisation and oral rehydration therapy are saving two million children's lives each year. Since 1950, the annual child death toll has been cut from 25 million to around 14 million, despite a 25 per cent increase in births. The daily child death toll has been cut by 5,000 in the 1980s-from 43,000 in 1980 to 38,000 in 1987. Families have fewer children when they become more confident that their existing children will survive. Ninety per cent of the growth of a human brain and much of the growth of a human body is completed in the first five years of life. There is no second chance. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us consider UNICEF's immunisation program. Immunisation coverage for children throughout the developing world, in Asia, Africa and Latin America, has leapt from 5 to 50 per cent in the last 10 years, and is now saving the lives of 1.4 million children each year. Measles, tetanus and whooping cough have killed more than three million children in the last 12 months, and another 200,000 have been permanently disabled by polio. Almost all could have been spared by a $14.28 vaccination. In the last five years, measles, tetanus and whooping cough have killed 25 million children-more than the entire Australian and New Zealand populations put together. For about $US500m a year-about the same cost as 10 advanced F14 fighter planes-UNICEF estimates that a permanent immunisation system could be set up in the developing world. Such a system will be essential when vaccines are developed against malaria and the acquired immune deficiency syndrome. </PARA>
<PARA> The target of immunisation for all children by 1990 now seems achievable, with over 70 governments and more than 400 voluntary organisations committed to the goal. The technology and knowledge is available to save most of these children by the year 2000, but without a global political alliance this aim will never be achieved. Further, the human tragedy of millions of children surviving, whilst their brothers and sisters die, but growing up in circumstances in which they will never fulfil the mental and physical potential with which they were born, is one we cannot forget. These children will never derive maximum benefit from educational opportunities, and will have restricted ability to work productively and be rewarded accordingly. How then, can we expect them to protect the health and normal growth of their children and the generations to follow?</PARA>
<PARA> This self-perpetrating cycle must be broken, and a commitment to real development given by all nations, otherwise the lives and future of our world is threatened. The agenda for a world summit for children will undoubtedly focus on the term `real development'-a development that puts people first, or, as UNICEF calls it, `adjustment with a human face'. Priorities must be moved towards the poor, which places a responsibility on the major industrialised nations to review trade, aid and financial policies in relation to the developing world. </PARA>
<PARA> Only through a world summit focusing specifically on children will the burden of debt and recession in the developing world be lifted. UNICEF's figures show that at least half a million children aged under five died in 1988 as a result of the debt crisis in Africa alone. Unlike drought, flood or famine, this tragedy cannot easily be captured by the media and brought to the public's attention. A summit of world leaders will help to present this frightening subject to the public and give a major impetus for action. </PARA>
<PARA> I urge the Leader of the Government in the Senate (Senator Button) to ask Mr Hawke to support the call by the Australian Parliamentary Association for UNICEF for Australia to take the lead in ensuring that such a summit is convened, so that each child born can have the same opportunity to survive and develop to its full potential. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I realise the importance of this evening for New South Welshmen and for those north of the Tweed River, and I shall be as brief as I can. Last week in the Senate I raised the catastrophe in Victoria which masquerades under the cloak of WorkCare-the Victorian Government's compulsory accident compensation scheme. I mentioned that the unfunded liabilities of that scheme now well exceed $3 billion; the figure could be closer to $4 billion. I also gave the Senate a striking example of how the system is being rorted and the lack of management systems either to identify that rorting or to rectify it. Tonight I want to describe the inherent inbuilt structural weakness in the scheme which has led it to the edge of bankruptcy and which has caused it to be held in total disrepute. All Victorians will suffer as a result. For Victorian taxpayers, there is the staggering figure of between $3 billion and $4 billion in unfunded liabilities. For the recipients of the scheme, there are also major problems.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The WorkCare work force now totals tens of thousands of persons. At the end of 1987-88 it totalled 82,100. Many of those people have genuine work-related claims, but a significant proportion do not. I have received a letter in recent days from a doctor who puts the percentage of those who do not have genuine work-related claims at about 20 per cent. Today's press in Melbourne reported the case of a railway worker with a diagnosed knee injury involving 2 per cent incapacity who has received full WorkCare compensation-100 per cent compensation-simply because the system of WorkCare as it operates in Victoria deems partially incapacitated or disabled people to be totally incapacitated for WorkCare payments reasons if the person is unable readily to find alternative work. In the case of that railway worker with a 2 per cent disability, it was reported in today's press that the railway authority had offered that person alternative employment within the system; but that person refused it and instead took a redundancy package. Full compensation flowed from that action. </PARA>
<PARA> That is a classic example of the reason why the number of WorkCare claims has risen from 53,825 in 1982-83 to 82,100 at the end of June last year. It has produced a system whereby claimants are implicitly encouraged to live a lie. Under the system, if the claimants who are not genuinely and fully incapacitated want to receive benefits, they have to live a lie to themselves, their doctors and their families. That is a very sad and debilitating situation in which to place any person. Many people under the WorkCare system are in need of help; but they need proper counselling help. Yet under the WorkCare system, because of the procedures adopted and involved, it is impossible for them to seek that proper counselling management and assistance because they would be taken off WorkCare. It places them in a fundamental dilemma-the dilemma to which the doctor to whom I referred earlier spoke of in her letter to the WorkCare authorities in Victoria. That letter has received no response at all. </PARA>
<PARA> Today many claimants under the WorkCare system are receiving more by way of compensation than they were being paid in the job in which they were allegedly incapacitated, either in full or in part. Again I believe that that causes some major difficulties. Certainly, the Victorian taxpayer has been meeting the cost of an enormous increase in WorkCare claims that has brought WorkCare to the edge of bankruptcy. The Victorian taxpayer is facing potential and inherent costs of the order of $3 billion to $4 billion. The sad thing about the whole situation is that it is not benefiting those people who really need other forms of medical assistance but who cannot get that assistance because the system does not allow for it. </PARA>
<PARA> In conclusion, I will briefly mention another example which illustrates the gross mismanagement that is occurring in the system. Today I was advised of a WorkCare pay-out to an employee when either an accident report was not filed or the report had been lost within the labyrinth of the WorkCare system and, in particular, within the Department of Labour in Victoria. It has taken my Victorian State colleague Mr Phil Gude no less than 17 letters over a couple of years, through freedom of information requests to the Commonwealth Ombudsman and through other sources, to ascertain that probably no accident report was filed in the first instance. The point I want to make is that the system of administration in WorkCare in Victoria is appalling. There is no accountability and no management control. Therefore, the net result is that the recipients of WorkCare are suffering; the Victorian taxpayer is suffering; and the internal integrity of the whole system is being brought into disrepute. The only solution to this problem is to scrap the WorkCare system that was introduced four or five years ago by the Cain Government and to get back to the drawing boards to establish a new, comprehensive, compassionate, yet responsible workers compensation system in Victoria. </PARA>

<PARA> (1) The Minister for Aboriginal Affairs has made no commitments in relation to the filling of the position of Chief Executive Officer for the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission. The position of Chief Executive Officer will be a Ministerial appointment in common with similar positions in many other statutory authorities.

<PARA> Note: Departmental Circular Memoranda are of a permanent nature and remain in force until cancelled. They should be reviewed by the sponsor every 2 years and repromulgated only where a significant change of content is necessary.</PARA>
<PARA>13 JUNE 1989</PARA>
<PARA> DESINE CONTRACT-ACQUISITION GUIDELINES</PARA>
<PARA>INTRODUCTION</PARA>
<PARA> 1. The Defence EDP Systems Integrated Network Environment (DESINE) provides a standard environment for hardware and software products with capacity for interoperation and distribution of data and processing within a proven and coherent network architecture. A full description of the DESINE environment is outlined in DCM 59/89. The Defence Information Systems strategy is to facilitate functional decentralisation of information systems services through the implementation of DESINE. IBM Australia Ltd is the prime contractor for the supply and support of hardware and software acquired from the DESINE contract for the five year period, 1989 to 1994, and will do so in conjunction with its subcontractors and to meet contracted Australian and New Zealand content provisions.</PARA>
<PARA>PURPOSE AND DISTRIBUTION</PARA>
<PARA> 2. This Circular Memorandum (CM) states the procedures to be followed in the acquisition of equipment and services following the award of the DESINE contract and describes the scope of application of that contract. In due course this CM will be replaced by a Defence Instruction (General) and Departmental Instruction. Pending issue of this DI(G) and DI, this CM is to be distributed widely in the Department and Defence Force as the operative document.</PARA>
<PARA>SCOPE AND NATURE OF THE DESINE CONTRACT</PARA>
<PARA> 3. Under the terms of the DESINE contract, IBM is contractually bound to supply to Defence, to provide early access by Defence to Open System Interconnection (OSI) developments and products through appropriate programs such as its Early Support Program and to make new technology and upgrades available to Defence. Also under the contract Defence has an obligation to purchase equipment and/or services from Schedule A to the contract if they are capable of satisfying the requirement fully or in part, unless an exemption has been granted. In this respect the DESINE contract differs from a period contract, which is a standing offer to supply, and a contract is not formed until an order is placed.</PARA>
<PARA> 4. The benefits of the DESINE contract include:</PARA>
<PARA> a. the contracted availability of a range of proven hardware and software products needed to implement a proven network architecture, leading in turn to improved interoperability. This range of products has been evaluated as having the highest overall cost effectiveness available;</PARA>
<PARA> b. savings in training and other support costs;</PARA>
<PARA> c. increased contingency and back up potential;</PARA>
<PARA> d. the contracted availability of acceptable new technology and of products compatible with Defence OSI aims;</PARA>
<PARA> e. increased Australian/New Zealand (ANZ) industry participation;</PARA>
<PARA> f. a simplified procurement process for the supply of contracted products; and</PARA>
<PARA> g. availability of maintenance for 10 years after equipment delivery.</PARA>
<PARA> 5. The overall benefits resulting from the contract will be cumulative to Defence. In this context the cost of individual equipments Defence is committed to procure from the contract may on occasion be higher than those of competitors, due to transient factors and ANZ content. Also, while the discount applied to some products from the contract may be low, this is balanced by others having a high discount thereby leading to a high cost effectiveness across the range of products.</PARA>
<PARA> 6. The DESINE contract is the first source for procurement of new Defence computing requirements. Schedule A to the contract consists of two parts: The DESINE Standard Product List (DSPL) and its Addendum.</PARA>
<PARA> a. The DSPL is the main body of Schedule A to the contract and lists products which satisfy the environment.</PARA>
<PARA> b. The Addendum to the DSPL lists some additional products which may facilitate inter-working of existing systems with DESINE systems, along with additional products which may offer benefits to Defence. Items from the Addendum are available only for the individual purposes attributed in the Addendum.</PARA>
<PARA> The scope of the DESINE contract does not include hardware or software suitable specifically for embedded or specialist systems (see paragraph 17).</PARA>
<PARA> 7. IBM is required to propose additional products to both the DSPL and its addendum, including technology updates. Following consultation with Departmental representatives, FASIS has authority to add or delete products on the basis of their cost, Australian/New Zealand industrial content, utility and acceptability to the DESINE environment.</PARA>
<PARA> 8. Services are available for equipment installation and associated support services from the DESINE contract but overall project implementation is the responsibility of the Defence project manager.</PARA>
<PARA> 9. IBM is responsible for:</PARA>
<PARA> a. the integration of all equipment supplied from Schedule A for the DESINE environment;</PARA>
<PARA> b. the provision of support services and maintenance for all equipment supplied from Schedule A;</PARA>
<PARA> c. ensuring that all equipment supplied from Schedule A meets specified functional and performance requirements; and</PARA>
<PARA> d. the project management and coordination of the supply and delivery of all equipment ordered from Schedule A including that from subcontractors.</PARA>
<PARA>Contract Administration</PARA>
<PARA> 10. ISP Division is responsible for administration of the DESINE contract and for maintaining the DESINE network architecture. FASIS is the contract delegate, responsible to VCDF and DEPSEC (A&amp;L). Annex A lists the delegate's responsibilities under the contract.</PARA>
<PARA>PROCEDURES-GENERAL</PARA>
<PARA>Project Approval</PARA>
<PARA> 11. Sponsors of proposals are to obtain project approval by following standard Departmental procedures, including the use of the SPECTRUM project management package set up to facilitate such procedures, when appropriate.</PARA>
<PARA>Development of Functional Requirements</PARA>
<PARA> 12. Functional requirements are to be developed before any acquisition approval is sought. The degree of documentation and the extent to which functional requirements are reflected in technical solutions or specifications will vary for different applications and expenditure levels. There is no provision under the DESINE contract for the contractor to develop functional requirements.</PARA>
<PARA>Establishment of Options</PARA>
<PARA> 13. To convert the functional requirement into options which meet the project aims and objectives, the Departmental manager may use the following resources:</PARA>
<PARA> a. project staff;</PARA>
<PARA> b. ISP Division staff; or</PARA>
<PARA> c. external consultants.</PARA>
<PARA> 14. In determining whether Schedule A hardware or software has the potential to satisfy the requirement, users should first consult with IBM, using:</PARA>
<PARA> a. representatives assigned by IBM to support Defence users; or</PARA>
<PARA> b. IBM's DESINE Project Office (DPO), which will be collocated with ISP Division.</PARA>
<PARA>Identifying Specific Equipment</PARA>
<PARA> 15. Once tasked with advising on a solution to a functional requirement, IBM will present a proposed hardware and software list, allocate a project manager (if appropriate) and provide a quote and a timetable to Defence.</PARA>
<PARA>EXEMPTIONS</PARA>
<PARA> 16. Under certain circumstances, it may not be appropriate to purchase hardware or software listed under Schedule A to the Contract. However such potential exemptions will need to be examined against Defence aims for its DESINE environment. This section describes the grounds for exemption and the process for seeking exemption.</PARA>
<PARA>Exemptions from the DESINE Contract</PARA>
<PARA> 17. Acquisitions exempted from the DESINE contract include:</PARA>
<PARA> a. Embedded Systems. Meaning for these purposes, equipment in those systems which are integrated or qualified specially for use in a weapon or a weapon platform together with those systems (except general purpose computers not utilised in the weapon platform) used for their support and training. Embedded systems also include equipment which is integral and dedicated to manufacturing equipment and robotics applications.</PARA>
<PARA> b. Specialist Systems. Those where security, compatibility and interoperability considerations are paramount for systems used in cooperative manner with allied defence organisations or in accordance with international agreements.</PARA>
<PARA> c. Final Extensions, Minor Enhancements and Component Replacements for Existing Systems. Final extensions, procured under certificate of exemption and whereby IBM is advised; minor enhancements and component replacements for systems for which there is an endorsed and documented Migration Plan. Guidance on contract exemptions for existing systems is at Annex B. Advice of the approval of a final extension is to be forwarded to IBM, copy to FASIS, by the authority discharging this responsibility.</PARA>
<PARA> d. Unforeseen Urgent Operational Requirements. Unforeseen urgent operational requirements which cannot be satisfied in a timely fashion from the DESINE contract.</PARA>
<PARA> e. Unsuitable Contract Solutions. Solutions from the contract which are clearly unsuitable in terms of function, or time, or project cost where project cost includes all aspects of the introduction of the system, rather than just the equipment price, and is interpreted as described in paragraph 5.</PARA>
<PARA> f. Requirements not met by Schedule A of Contract. These include hardware and software which are not available under Schedule A to the contract. Note that applications software development and project integration are not available under the contract.</PARA>
<PARA>Procedures for Exemptions</PARA>
<PARA> 18. Authorisations to assess applications for exemptions from the contract will be established by VCDF and DEPSEC (A&amp;L) on the advice of FASIS. The total functions to be discharged by those authorised are shown at Annex A. Those with this authorisation will be responsible for documenting justification of contract exemptions.</PARA>
<PARA> 19. Should a case for a contract exemption be established, the option concerned and alternatives should be forwarded for consideration of the effects of the exemption, and of the alternatives, on Defence aims for DESINE, the principal aim being that for a coherent network architecture. The authority for approval as to whether the exemption is acceptable and whether alternative procurement to the DESINE contract may proceed is:</PARA>
<PARA> a. for command and tactical systems-HQADF; and</PARA>
<PARA> b. all other systems-FASIS</PARA>
<PARA> DESINE exemptions guidelines and procedures will be issued separately by HQADF and FASIS.</PARA>
<PARA> 20. Exceptions to the processes to obtain approval for the exemption as described in paragraph 19 will be embedded systems; those existing systems for which a migration plan to DESINE has been approved under the master planning process or by FASIS; and those projects to be considered by the DSCD. A chart showing the broad processes for exemptions is attached at Annex C.</PARA>
<PARA> 21. In some instances collective authorisation of contract exemptions together with approval of DESINE exemptions will be possible as part of the master planning process. This will be so when sufficient detail of the requirement, its solution and the implications of a DESINE exemption are available during this process. Similarly, the extent of intended utilisation of the DESINE contract can be established in some cases in the master planning process.</PARA>
<PARA> 22. At the DSDC, or other earlier meeting to consider the future of projects to be taken by the DSDC in due course, FASIS will provide advice on the contract and DESINE exemptions if such exemptions are sought. HQADF and DSTO will provide DESINE exemptions advice also on command, and tactical systems and urgent operational requirements, and on scientific systems respectively.</PARA>
<PARA>ORDER PROGRESSION</PARA>
<PARA>Requirements with a DESINE Contract Solution</PARA>
<PARA> 23. When the detailed hardware and software selections necessary to satisfy a functional requirement have been made from Schedule A, approved orders are to be placed directly with the IBM DESINE Project Office. This applies regardless of whether the items required are supplied by IBM or by subcontractors on the DESINE contract. The IBM Project Manager will coordinate delivery of the items.</PARA>
<PARA>Projects with a Partial DESINE Contract Solution</PARA>
<PARA> 24. In the case of acquisitions such as capital procurement projects, where only part of the total requirement comprises computing equipment or services which may be capable of being supplied from Schedule A of the DESINE contract, the normal processes for seeking information from a range of sources will continue, ie invitations to register interest (ITR), requests for proposals, quotation or tender (RFP, RFQ, RFT) etc. Until the relevance of DESINE to the requirement is determined, any documentation issued to industry must include an appropriate statement regarding the existence and implications of the DESINE contract and a copy of the documentation must be forwarded to IBM simultaneously with release to industry. This statement will also advise potential suppliers of non DESINE contract solutions that Defence, in considering the relative merits of such solutions, may be influenced by how closely they comply with the longer term Defence aims for the DESINE environment. Where appropriate, IBM will offer equipment and services available from the DESINE contract Schedule A to interested prospective prime contractors under terms and conditions no less favourable than would apply if they were being supplied to Defence direct.</PARA>
<PARA> 25. Bids containing a non-DESINE contract solution versus a DESINE contract solution received as a result of these competitive processes will be assessed by the DSDC where subject to DSDC processes and by the paragraph 17-21 process for others.</PARA>
<PARA>Non DESINE Contract Solution</PARA>
<PARA> 26. The paragraph 24 statement, including its reference to the DCM on the DESINE environment, describes how Defence may consider compliance with longer term DESINE and OSI aims should there be no partial or full DESINE contract solution available.</PARA>
<PARA>Partial or non DESINE Contract Purchases from IBM</PARA>
<PARA> 27. In cases where IBM has been approached direct with a functional requirement to determine whether there is a Schedule A solution available and IBM offers a partial Schedule A equipment solution together with other products, or a totally non-Schedule A solution, only the Schedule A equipment is to be ordered under the DESINE contract. Normal procurement procedures are to apply to meet the remainder of the requirement utilising the paragraph 24 statement as necessary.</PARA>
<PARA>Alteration of Schedule A During Competition</PARA>
<PARA> 28. In cases where there is competition between IBM and other potential suppliers, there will be no new products or applications added to Schedule A which could affect the competition outcome.</PARA>
<PARA>MAINTENANCE AND SUPPORT SERVICES</PARA>
<PARA> 29. A summary of services available under the Contract is attached at Annex D.</PARA>
<PARA> 30. A range of maintenance and support services is available as described in the DESINE Contract. Project managers should select the level of service best suited for their system and this should be stated in the purchase order.</PARA>
<PARA> 31. No provision exists under the Contract for the maintenance of existing IBM or subcontractor supplied hardware and software purchased prior to the DESINE contract.</PARA>

<PARA>GUIDANCE RELATED TO EXISTING SYSTEMS</PARA>
<PARA> 1. In considering exemptions relevant to the provisions of paragraph 17c, the following broad definitions will apply:</PARA>
<PARA> a. Final Extensions. Extensions for which a DESINE solution would yield no gain to the user and any associated users, and which will complete the system until it reaches its end of life as per the migration plan. Normally would not exceed 1/3 cost of system procured prior to 28 February 1989.</PARA>
<PARA> b. Minor Enhancements. Those which normally would not exceed about 1/10 cost of system procured and which can extend the capability of the system but not its end of life as per the migration plan. Generally, minor enhancements after a final extension are unlikely to occur.</PARA>
<PARA> c. Component Replacements. Replacements which do not appreciably extend the system capability, and are needed for the system to reach its planned life as per the migration plan.</PARA>
<PARA> 2. These meanings are intended for Department of Defence guidance only for those authorised by VCDF and DEPSEC (A&amp;L) and not as an interpretation of the DESINE contract. Defence will apply exemptions under the contract depending on individual cases and instances which are outside the spirit of these guidelines should be referred to FASIS for consideration.</PARA>

<PARA>ENVIRONMENT (DESINE)</PARA>
<PARA>INTRODUCTION</PARA>
<PARA> 1. The aim of the DESINE concept is to provide a standardised computing environment for the Defence Organisation. This will provide Defence with the strong central control of policy and technical standards necessary to support the decentralisation of information systems along functional lines. A brief outline of the DESINE concept is at Annex A. A glossary of terms and definitions is provided at Annex B.</PARA>
<PARA> 2. Defence is committed to the evolution to Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) as the products compatible with the International Standards Organisation's (ISO) OSI Basic Reference Model become commercially available. The DESINE RFT required a commitment to the implementation of OSI. Due to present limitations in the availability of OSI standards it is not yet possible to obtain full network management facilities across multivendor networks interconnected using OSI standards.</PARA>
<PARA> 3. DESINE will facilitate Defence implementing solutions based on the Australian Government Open Systems Interconnection Profile (GOSIP) as and when it is proclaimed as an Australian standard. GOSIP is based on existing OSI functional standards and other profiles to obtain levels of interworking with non-GOSIP systems and to avoid undesirable diversification.</PARA>
<PARA> 4. Thus the DESINE concept for Defence computing extends beyond the products selected as a result of the tender evaluation. The DESINE concept applies to all aspects of computing suitable for standardisation.</PARA>
<PARA> 5. The benefits of the DESINE contract include:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) the contracted availability of a range of proven hardware and software products needed to implement a proven network architecture, leading in turn to improved interoperability. This range of products has been evaluated as having the highest overall cost effectiveness available;</PARA>
<PARA> b. savings in training and other support costs;</PARA>
<PARA> c. increased contingency and back up potential;</PARA>
<PARA> d. the contracted availability of acceptable new technology and of products compatible with Defence OSI aims;</PARA>
<PARA> e. increased Australian/New Zealand (ANZ) industry participation;</PARA>
<PARA> f. a simplified procurement process for the supply of contracted products; and</PARA>
<PARA> g. availability of maintenance for 10 years after equipment delivery.</PARA>
<PARA> 6. The DESINE contract is the first source for procurement of new Defence computing requirements. Schedule A to the contract consists of two parts: The DESINE Standard Product List (DSPL) and its Addendum.</PARA>
<PARA> a. The DSPL is the main body of Schedule A to the contract and lists products which satisfy the environment.</PARA>
<PARA> b. The Addendum to the DSPL lists some additional products which may facilitate inter-working of existing systems with DESINE systems, along with additional products which may offer benefits to Defence. Items from the Addendum are available only for the individual purposes attributed in the Addendum.</PARA>
<PARA> The scope of the DESINE contract does not include hardware or software suitable specifically for embedded or specialist systems (see paragraph 17).</PARA>
<PARA> 7. This DCM will be replaced by a DI (G) in the future. Procurement procedures for acquisitions under the DESINE contract are covered in DCM 60/89, which will also be replaced by a DI (G).</PARA>
<PARA>AIM</PARA>
<PARA> 8. This DCM describes the initial Defence Standard Computing environment established as a result of the DESINE tender evaluation which resulted in contract number C59/78320W, signed with IBM on 28 February 1989.</PARA>
<PARA>THE ENVIRONMENT</PARA>
<PARA> 9. The environment is based initially on IBM's Systems Application Architecture (SAA), includes OSI standards and other relevant standards endorsed by international bodies. The products available from the DSPL are consistent with this environment.</PARA>
<PARA> 10. This environment enables the implementation and development of Defence information systems and networks incorporating international standards. Notwithstanding, there may be special measures required to migrate existing systems to the environment.</PARA>
<PARA> 11. The commitment to OSI is carried into the contract with IBM. Clause 8.8 of the Contract states:</PARA>
<PARA>`The Contractor agrees to maintain the development of Open Systems Interconnection and to periodically notify Defence of these developments. The Contractor further agrees to provide Defence with early access to the developments and products through appropriate programs such as the Contractor's Early Support Program to enable Defence to consider the acquisition of additional equipment pursuant to Clause 7.'</PARA>
<PARA>Selected Network Architecture</PARA>
<PARA> 12. Defence is committed to the adoption of ISO communications networking standards as the standards, and products implementing those standards, become available. The initial network architecture, which provides comprehensive network management facilities, incorporates available OSI features and will be updated regularly to support international standards as these are implemented. In implementing networks, Defence has access to products which implement OSI standards as they become available through the contract. In addition, interoperability with a wide range of other systems is supported using networking products available from the contract.</PARA>
<PARA> 13. The selected hardware and software are supported by IBM's System Network Architecture (SNA) and associated networking products. These provide the network management services required by Defence but not yet encompassed by the OSI Reference Model or existing standards. This enables a high degree of interoperation between systems implemented using hardware and software from the DSPL.</PARA>
<PARA>Selected Equipment-Hardware</PARA>
<PARA> 14. The hardware products on the DSPL cover the entire spectrum from micro (PCs including laptops) to mainframe. These are complemented by a full range of peripheral equipment such as data capture devices and laser printers. TEMPEST and ruggedised versions of some equipment are also available.</PARA>
<PARA> 15. Currently the hardware architectures are:</PARA>
<PARA> a. the S/370 represented by the 3090, 4300 and 9370 families of processors;</PARA>
<PARA> b. the new generation of PC represented by the PS/2; and</PARA>
<PARA> c. the PC represented by the PC-AT and compatible families of processors.</PARA>
<PARA> 16. The DSPL will be updated quarterly with the latest compatible hardware technology as appropriate to the Defence requirement.</PARA>
<PARA>Selected Equipment-System Software</PARA>
<PARA> 17. The operating system software for the S/370 hardware architecture is MVS and VM. The PC architecture supports MS-DOS and the equivalent PC-DOS operating systems. The PS/2 architecture is supported by the OS/2 Extended Edition Operating System and is available for multitasking solutions.</PARA>
<PARA> 18. The software on the DSPL will be monitored continually and amended to ensure Defence is served by the latest compatible software appropriate to Defence requirements.</PARA>
<PARA>Application Software Packages</PARA>
<PARA> 19. A variety of packages including PC based wordprocessing, spreadsheet and database packages is included on the DSPL.</PARA>
<PARA> 20. Large scale and specialised application software packages are not the province of the DESINE contract. To meet these requirements separate procurement may be required. Requests for prices/quotations should indicate a preference for packages which will operate on equipment selected from the DSPL.</PARA>
<PARA>MIGRATION OF EXISTING SYSTEMS TO THE ENVIRONMENT</PARA>
<PARA> 21. Managers of existing systems will be required to determine whether a migration path to the environment is required. Endorsed plans for migration or the explicit exemption from such migration are to be identified in their associated Office Master Plan. For some of these systems migration will occur after end of life of the present contract. Others will need to have specific paths developed including the development of special interfaces. Migration plans are to be developed for endorsement in advance of any exemption request.</PARA>
<PARA> 22. Studies of the larger Defence systems may be required to identify a migration path to DESINE. A specific study by a Defence working group will be conducted on the need for migration of UNIX based systems to DESINE, or for the incorporation of UNIX into the environment.</PARA>

<PARA>ANNEX A</PARA>
<PARA>AN OUTLINE OF THE DESINE CONCEPT</PARA>
<PARA>Background</PARA>
<PARA> 1. During 1981 the Defence Computing Infrastructure Study Working Party (DCISWP) concluded that Defence should decentralise administrative computing conditional upon:</PARA>
<PARA> a. Improved long-range strategic planning of administrative computing.</PARA>
<PARA> b. Implementation of strong central control of policy and technical standards.</PARA>
<PARA> 2. Those `technical standards' were further defined in terms of a standardised computing environment, referred to as DESINE. The concept of DESINE was subsequently defined in the DESINE Implementation Study report as `an approach to standardisation of Defence computing that would allow:</PARA>
<PARA> a. decentralisation along functional lines, and</PARA>
<PARA> b. effective vertical and lateral interaction between differing functions.'</PARA>
<PARA> 3. The means by which this was to be achieved was through `a network architecture selected by open tender for implementation in the first instance by a contractor . . .', a network architecture being defined as a set of rules and protocols which enables the interoperation of distributed computer systems. When implemented, a network architecture is a range of special hardware and software products which specifies the relationships between different elements of the network (computers, terminals and associated software) and provides communications facilities.</PARA>
<PARA>DESINE Implementation Policy</PARA>
<PARA> 4. Defence policy for the implementation of the DESINE concept may be distilled to the following key directions:</PARA>
<PARA> a. Defence is committed to support the philosophy of the International Standards Organisation's (ISO) Open Systems Interconnection (OSI);</PARA>
<PARA> b. the Environment is being implemented through a range of compatible and proven hardware and software products which in total comprise a network architecture; and</PARA>
<PARA> c. the prime acquisition vehicles for the establishment of the Environment will be the Supply Systems Redevelopment Project (SSRP) and the Sector/base level element of the Manpower System Redevelopment Project (MSRP), with other projects being included as they are approved.</PARA>
<PARA>Long-Term Computing Strategy</PARA>
<PARA> 5. The implementation of DESINE constitutes the essence of the long-term Defence Computing Master Plan. The Department's long-term strategy is to facilitate the functional decentralisation of computing services through the implementation of DESINE.</PARA>
<PARA>Implementation Plan</PARA>
<PARA> 6. Practical steps to implement the DESINE concept involved establishing a five year period contract with a contractor for the provision of computing hardware and software. The contractor selected as a result of open tender is IBM Australia Ltd.</PARA>
<PARA> 7. The original strategy had been for this Contract to cover only administrative computing requirements. The RFT broadened the application of the contract to cover operational computing systems not classified as embedded or specialist systems.</PARA>
<PARA> 8. The essential elements required by the RFT were:</PARA>
<PARA> a. a proven network architecture, including support for international standards, to the extent these were available as proven products.</PARA>
<PARA> b. a full range of equipment from basic terminals and microcomputers through to mainframes, including software; and</PARA>
<PARA> c. an interface to existing UNISYS mainframes.</PARA>
<PARA> 9. The products selected by the evaluation will be used to replace existing equipment when it reaches the end of its economic life, and provide new equipment for SSRP, MSRP and most other large, medium and small computing systems.</PARA>
<PARA>Establishment of Standards</PARA>
<PARA> 10. The objective of the RFT evaluation was to establish a contract with a contractor for the supply of hardware and software which provided the basis for a standard computing environment, initially for a period of five years. The selected supplier is responsible for providing equipment for:</PARA>
<PARA> a. the replacement of existing systems when they reach the end of their economic life, and</PARA>
<PARA> b. the establishment of new systems for various functional elements of Defence.</PARA>
<PARA> 11. The standards established during this initial five year period will guide the Defence information technology development for many years. Defence is building an operating, standard, computing environment from proven current equipment and software building blocks supplied as a result of the DESINE contract.</PARA>
<PARA> 12. The most important criterion was the capa- bility of the whole environment to support the management of Defence information with integrity and coherence using compatible and interoperable equipment, to standards which are consistent with present and future international standards. The successful contractor demonstrated that it can offer the most substantial and stable total environment, in terms of current products and strategic direction.</PARA>

<PARA>Page 2939 RHS</PARA>
<PARA> Senator Newman-I ask for details on the $25m stated by the Department for Unix based systems. I asked for a break up listing hardware costs, software costs, software development costs, any consultancy costs, communication costs, training costs, et cetera. I wanted a total cost identification over the life period of all Unix based systems.</PARA>

<PARA> As the systems acquired through expenditure of the above amounts are still in use it is not possible to provide a final total cost over the life period of the systems. However it is estimated that, on average, the systems have a remaining life of eight years and that a further $12m to $15m will be required for maintenance and support.</PARA>
<PARA>Question 161</PARA>
<PARA>Page 2942 RHS</PARA>
<PARA> Senator Newman- . . . Is the Minister aware that SAA is not a commercially available product and that even the first major SAA application, Office Vision, will not be available until early 1990? The industry and the computer press have continually reported this fact.</PARA>
<PARA> Response: SAA is not a product. SAA defines a set of standards for the complete system development environment within the IBM processor product range. The solution established by the DESINE tender evaluation is covered by SAA, with some variations determined by Defence.</PARA>
<PARA> Defence understands that Office Vision will be available to customers as follows: for PS/2, September 89, for S/370, December 89, and in June 90 for AS/400.</PARA>
<PARA>Question 162</PARA>
<PARA>Page 2943 RHS</PARA>
<PARA> Senator Newman-Could the Minister advise me whether the reports in the computer press that some DESINE subcontractors have already withdrawn from the DESINE contract are true?</PARA>
<PARA> . . . I would be grateful if I could be informed of the names of the companies and the reason they decided to withdraw?</PARA>
<PARA> . . . perhaps the Department is able to indicate whether there is any concern at this action so early in the life of DESINE and whether any further withdrawals are anticipated?</PARA>
<PARA> Response: As of 30 May, no notification of any DESINE sub contractor withdrawal has been received nor is any expected.</PARA>
<PARA>Question 163</PARA>
<PARA>Page 2944 LHS</PARA>
<PARA> Senator Newman- . . . can the Minister . . . provide me with a copy of the terms of reference of the Unix working party?</PARA>
<PARA> Response: A copy of the working party terms of reference is attached. The report is scheduled for completion by September 1989.</PARA>
<PARA>TERMS OF REFERENCE FOR UNIX WORKING PARTY</PARA>
<PARA>Background</PARA>
<PARA> 1. Pending establishment of DESINE standards some areas of Defence, civilian and military, adopted UNIX as an interim standard for certain applications. The future of UNIX based systems and the potential role of UNIX itself now needs to be considered. The migration of existing systems based on other interim standards is a separate consideration.</PARA>
<PARA> 2. None of the shortlisted solutions for DESINE was based on UNIX, however, all three offered some support for UNIX. This would provide some support for existing systems, allow the use of application software packages running under UNIX, and exploit its capabilities as an engineering/scientific workstation.</PARA>
<PARA> 3. The Working Party will review current investment by Defence in UNIX based systems and their future, including possible migration to DESINE. The study will also consider the potential benefits that might be brought to DESINE by the integration of UNIX with the environment.</PARA>
<PARA>Terms of Reference</PARA>
<PARA> 4. The terms of reference for the Defence UNIX Working Party are as follows:</PARA>
<PARA> a. Current Systems. Determine the current inventory of UNIX based systems in Defence in terms of equipment and application software packages. Determine the cost, function and subsequent upgrade requirements.</PARA>
<PARA> b. Interconnection Options. Report on whether current UNIX systems need to communicate with other systems, what communication interconnections are required to interface current UNIX systems to DESINE, what DESINE and third party options exist, whether UNIX systems will be capable of interconnection with DESINE systems using OSI standards, and whether all workstations are visible in a network environment.</PARA>
<PARA> c. Migration Path. Report on whether there is a migration path for UNIX based systems to DESINE.</PARA>

<PARA> Question 165</PARA>
<PARA> Page 2953 RHS</PARA>
<PARA> Senator MacGibbon-The nomination of the Garden Island Dockyard is just a fiction because Garden Island does not do submarine overhauls.</PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4E4">Senator Richardson</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not have a response to what the honourable senator has said about Garden Island. I will get one for him but I will have to take that on notice, as I am not certain of it at the moment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Response: On 27 January 1989 the Department of Defence issued an Invitation to Register Interest (ITR) in performing Oberon submarine depot level maintenance at a site other than Cockatoo Island. The ITR specified that the task be performed in one or other of the locations where the submarines are home-ported, that is Sydney NSW or Fremantle WA. The responses to that invitation have been analysed within the Department and a recommended short list has been sent to the Minister of the organisations who will be invited to respond to a Request for Tender (RFT). The content of that list is currently `Commercial-in-Confidence'.</PARA>
<PARA> Garden Island Dockyard (GID) was invited to respond to the ITR and did so. The assessment of the Department is that GID has the potential capability to refit Oberon submarines after some investment is made in personnel, management systems and facilities. Whether GID has the workload capacity is an area under close examination at present given current projected surface ship work at GID. That examination is being done within the Department and by GID itself.</PARA>
<PARA> The formation of Australian Defence Industries (ADI), of which GID is a part, gives GID management much more flexibility than formerly to handle varying workloads. The effect of this flexibility is one of the factors under examination from the capacity viewpoint.</PARA>
<PARA> Question 166</PARA>
<PARA> Page 2954 LHS</PARA>
<PARA> Senator Crichton-Browne-. . . Can the Minister confirm whether, as a result of damage or otherwise, when travelling to a depth of 600 feet the vessel is taking four litres of water per minute through leaks in the port gland? Can he also advise whether there have been problems with the antifouling on the HMAS Swan which has caused it to be replaced as a result of inappropriate applications?</PARA>
<PARA> Response: Water leakage of the order of four litres per minute through an Oberon submarine propeller shaft gland is not a matter of concern; some leakage is to be expected. Leaks of this magnitude are a function of the design of seals and bearings and OXLEY's leakage is unrelated to her recent intermediate docking in Western Australia.</PARA>
<PARA> There have been no problems with HMAS Swan's antifouling paint attributable to inappropriate application. Selective removal of old paint, preparation of surfaces and repainting is a normal component of a refit work package and some work of this nature is being done on HMAS Swan during current refit.</PARA>
