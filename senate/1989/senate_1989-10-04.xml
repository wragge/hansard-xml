<TITLE>Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme</TITLE>
<PARA>To the Honourable the President and members of the Senate in the Parliament assembled, we the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth that:</PARA>
<PARA> The Government's attack upon the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme has cast grave doubts over the future viability of our community pharmacies and their ability to provide much-needed service to the community, including particularly those in rural areas;</PARA>
<PARA> The proposed changes to the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme will further jeopardise the viability of pharmacists;</PARA>
<PARA> The latest decision to slash PBS payments to pharmacists by an average of $1.05 per script is simply unacceptable and will force the closure of many pharmacies.</PARA>
<PARA> Your petitioners respectfully request that the Senate urge the Government to ensure adequate remuneration levels for pharmacists, so that they may be able to provide a high quality health care service which is the right of every citizen of Australia.</PARA>
<PARA> As in duty bound your petitioners will ever pray.</PARA>

<TITLE>Pornography</TITLE>
<PARA>To the Honourable the President and members of the Senate in the Parliament assembled: The humble petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth: That we the undersigned, having great concern that Canberra is now the ``Porn Capital'' of Australia and because of the spread of moral pollution in our nation, call upon the Federal Government to introduce immediate legislation in support of existing State Legislation:</PARA>
<PARA> 1. To provide strict controls over the importation, production, sale, hire or mailing of video-cassettes particularly in the A.C.T., with the open sale and/or hire of only G, PG, and M-rated video cassettes; and the total prohibition of the sale or hire of R rated video-cassettes, so that R rated films can only be viewed in an adult theatre by persons over 18 years. We totally reject the concept of ``X'' rated or ``N.V.E.'' rated video-cassettes, which would allow the legal sale and hire of hard-core pornographic videos for viewing in the homes of our nation, which would endanger our children; and</PARA>
<PARA> 2. To give whole-hearted support to Senator Walter's Private Member's Bill to implement the recommendations of the Select Committee on Videos; and</PARA>
<PARA> 3. To dramatically improve the Federal Attorney-General's Guidelines for Classification of Video tapes/discs, which restrict the importation, production, sale or hire, screening in private homes and especially mailing by Australia Post, so as to include the total prohibition of any pornographic, obscene or blasphemous video cassette, or film which exploits or degrades women as sex objects, or which contain child pornography, bestiality, sodomy, group sex or violent sex acts with women, such as rape and pack rape, sadism and torture, etc., or which promotes homosexuality or lesbianism;</PARA>
<PARA> Your petitioners therefore humbly pray that your Honourable House will protect our society, especially women and children from moral pollution and its harmful effects.</PARA>
<PARA> And your petitioners as in duty bound, will ever pray.</PARA>

<PARA> (a) notes that a quorum was not present during debate on a matter of public importance on 3 October 1989, and as a result the Senate was counted out;</PARA>
<PARA> (b) notes that the matter of public importance in question was the action of the Minister for Defence (Mr Beazley) in calling in the ADF to deal with the situation at Nurrungar over the weekend: that is, the use of Australian troops against Australian citizens on Australian soil in defence of a US military base which ties Australia into the nuclear war-fighting strategies of the US Government;</PARA>
<PARA> (c) notes that the Government would have good cause not to want a motion of this kind debated because of its implications for the way in which the Government is dealing with the issue of public concern about the role of the Nurrungar monitoring base;</PARA>
<PARA> (d) notes the actions of Senator McKiernan in the Senate Chamber on 3 October 1989 when the quorum bells were being rung, in signalling to Senators approaching the Chamber not to enter it, thereby discouraging or preventing the formation of a quorum;</PARA>

<PARA> The document read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA>AUSTRALIAN FEDERAL POLICE REGULATIONS (AMENDMENT) STATUTORY RULES 1989 NO. 139</PARA>
<PARA>These Regulations provide for services that may be rendered by the Australian Federal Police at the request of, or under an agreement with, a member of the public or a body corporate; or in relation to a prescribed authority of the Commonwealth. The Committee is concerned about the privacy implications for these arrangements, as the services expressly include reporting on convictions, reporting on a check of fingerprints, and reporting on harassment, violence and threats of violence.</PARA>
<PARA>AUSTRALIAN TELECOMMUNICATIONS CORPORATION REGULATIONS STATUTORY RULES 1989 NO. 150</PARA>
<PARA>These Regulations provide for circumstances where the duty imposed on Telecom employees not to disclose certain information gained in their course of employment, does not apply. The Committee is concerned about a provision which permits disclosure of ``the affairs or personal particulars'' of a person in certain circumstances.</PARA>

<PARA> That the Senate-</PARA>
<PARA> (a) notes that:</PARA>
<PARA> (i) on Saturday, 30 September 1989, the Minister for Defence (Mr Beazley) authorised some 50 Australian troops to be deployed as reinforcements for civilian police engaged in controlling a gathering of protesters at the US- controlled Nurrungar `Star Wars' ground stations or Joint Defence Facility,</PARA>
<PARA> (ii) the protesters were present on the base's perimeter with the permission of the landowners, the Kookatha people, and</PARA>
<PARA> (iii) the object of the peaceful and passive protest was the belief of many citizens that the base is an important element in both the defence and attack capability of the US in relation to thermonuclear warfare and that the Australian people may have been misinformed about the role of the Nurrungar base, which is officially acknowledged to be a nuclear target;</PARA>
<PARA> (b) deplores the action of the Minister for Defence in having so deployed trained soldiers against unarmed civilians, including children;</PARA>
<PARA> (c) further deplores the fact that some citizens were attacked with mace gas by State police acting under authority of the base's Australian and American controllers;</PARA>
<PARA> (d) recognises that the deployed personnel in fact proved incapable of protecting the base's installations against harmless spray painting by the fortunately peaceable demonstrators who penetrated the defences; and</PARA>

<PARA> (a) notes that the Cabinet will on Wednesday, 4 October 1989, again be discussing the sensitive subject of mining in the euphemistically named conservation zone, which is entirely surrounded by the National Estate listing of Stage 3 of Kakadu National Park;</PARA>
<PARA> (b) notes that Stage 3 of Kakadu National Park contains the headwaters of a river which feeds through Stages 1 and 2, which is a World Heritage area, and that it is biologically more desirable to preserve an entire, integrated ecosystem, rather than to preserve a bit downstream and to allow mining in the most sensitive part of the river upstream;</PARA>
<PARA> (c) urges the Government to fulfil its responsibility to look after Aboriginal interests and urges the Government not only to respect the Jawoyn's wish for a sacred site at Coronation Hill, but also to give them significant economic assistance to improve their appalling living conditions, their health and their educational standards; and</PARA>
<PARA> (d) reminds the Government that its decision on Stage 3 mining will be critical to the conservation vote in the next election and that the Government should be prepared to pay to protect the environment in view of the increasing acceptance by the electorate of such moves.</PARA>

<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="IG4">Senator VALLENTINE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Last Thursday, 28 September, Senator Crichton-Browne accused me of being at home having a nice week with dad and the kids, so I feel the need to explain to the Senate why I was not present in the chamber last week. This is the first time that I have applied for leave of absence from the Senate since the last Federal election. Many senators are legitimately absent from the Senate for various reasons, and I do not criticise them. For example, Senator Knowles was absent from the Senate last Friday, Senator McKiernan was absent last Friday, and Senators Durack and Coulter were due to speak at the same conference at which I was speaking in Perth on Wednesday, that is, the Pathways to the Future Conference.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Due to the difficulties with the pilots dispute I believe that many senators have been unable to move around as freely as they would like. It is a fact that senators choose from time to time to take up engagements in their electorates and, as a consequence, they are prepared to miss one parliamentary sitting day. That was obviously the case with Senator Durack, who was ready to speak at the conference in Perth last Wednesday, and also Senator Coulter. Neither of those senators actually made it to the conference in Perth due to the pilots dispute because they realised it would have taken up more time than they were prepared to be away from the Senate, I presume. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="IG4">Senator VALLENTINE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Right. The other point made by Senator Crichton-Browne as far as I was concerned was that I did not choose to travel on a VIP flight last Thursday to be present in Canberra. The fact is that I was not notified of the VIP flight leaving Perth. Again, I am not criticising other senators for their choices in these difficult times and I am not criticising Mr Beazley's officer, who is attempting to move people around the country during the pilots dispute. I was not notified of that VIP flight last Thursday. I could have chosen all day Thursday to make my way to Canberra, but I had an important meeting in Perth on Saturday. I then would have been in the same position as Senator Knowles and McKiernan, of having to fly on Friday to get back to Perth. I thought that was not a good use of my time. I believe it is very important to address constituents' issues. During the days that I was away from the Senate, I addressed over 800 people in two public meetings in Perth. I consider that to be very important.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA> (f) censures Senator McKiernan for his actions in abusing the parliamentary processes of the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA>I think it is very important that a motion of this sort is brought on as quickly as possible after the events around which it centres. There is a significant question involved here of abuse of procedures by an officer of the Australian Labor Party, the government party, who should have known better. His actions in causing the abuse of the Senate are a matter for censure in this motion and it is something that this place needs to take particularly seriously and to debate expeditiously. If this sort of thing is to continue to happen, I suspect that we may have to follow the example of the House of Commons and abolish the right of individual senators to call a count. That has not been a practice in the House of Commons since 1971, I presume for fairly good reason. I can only assume that what was happening in the House of Commons is what is happening here more and more, especially recently, and that is that quorums are called quite frivolously and frequently more as a matter of disrupting procedures and interrupting a speaker than simply to assure the Senate that there is the appropriate number of senators in or around the place. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr President, quite an extraordinary event occurred in the Senate yesterday. A debate on a matter of public importance was brought to a very premature close. It was closed before the mover of the motion, the first speaker, had even finished addressing the motion and the Senate was forced to adjourn for lack of a quorum. Neither the Opposition, which called the quorum that led to the count-out when only two of its senators were in the chamber at the time, nor the Government, which actively through the actions of its Whip encouraged its senators to stay out of the chamber, has anything to be proud of. It was not only an appalling action; it was also a very bad precedent indeed to be setting, and a very bad comment, I think, to the people of Australia about how senators perceive their role in this place and what importance they give to a sensible debate in this place. </PARA>
<PARA> I am reminded of the fact that last Wednesday somebody asked me why I was planning to leave an intelligent debating chamber like the Senate to go into what passes roughly for a zoo in the House of Representatives. I would have thought that anybody who believed that the Senate was a considered debating chamber where the rules were observed would have changed that opinion after yesterday's events. The Opposition has, in less than the last 24 hours, claimed that it was accidental, that it did not really mean this to happen. This makes one wonder, of course, why an Opposition member called the quorum in the first place. The Government of course has tried to justify its action by claiming that it wanted to bring events to a close here quickly in order to get on with Estimates committees. This raises the additional question of why Opposition members were prepared to sit back last Tuesday and last Thursday-both of which were Estimates days-and take part in a debate on the pilots strike brought on as a matter of public importance by the Opposition and not to get in the way of Senator Lewis indulging in an adjournment debate on Thursday. I think a little consistency, as well as some reasonable behaviour in this place, may not go amiss. </PARA>
<PARA> We all know why quorums are called in this place. They are called for a variety of reasons. Occasionally it may be that a speaker who is listed to speak is caught out by the fact that the previous speaker finished earlier than anticipated, is not in his place in the Senate, and the party to which he belongs wants to give him the opportunity to come here. That seems to be not a particularly excessive abuse of the use of quorums. </PARA>
<PARA> They are also, of course, called, and called much more frequently for this purpose than the previous one, in order to interrupt a speaker, probably for two reasons-to try to divert that person's train of thought to put him at a disadvantage, presumably in the hope that he will forget what he was going to say anyway and move on to something else. It also, of course, takes four minutes out of that individual's speaking time and that is the major reason why oppositions call quorums. It tends also to be Opposition members who call quorums when they are listening to a speech, the contents of which they do not support. That is, of course, why nobody ever calls a quorum when a member of his own party is speaking, no matter how few other senators there are in the chamber. </PARA>
<PARA> It is a device used increasingly not to ensure that we have the required 26 senators in this place, but to interrupt a speech and, more importantly, to take time away from a speaker's allotted period of time which varies according to the sort of debate we are involved in and, therefore, to give that speaker less time to put forward an argument. This was particularly important yesterday given the nature of the debate and given the fact that 20 minutes is the amount of time allocated for the lead speaker in a matter of public importance debate rather than the normal 30 minutes that is allocated to a second reading stage speech or to a debate of the kind that we are currently engaged in. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Jenkins was on her feet speaking as the mover of the motion relating to Nurrungar. The first quorum that was called on her was called about seven or eight minutes into that 20 minutes; the count and the ringing of the bells took up four or five minutes. Approximately three minutes later a second quorum was called but two Opposition senators had left the chamber. That took another four minutes out of her speaking time, leaving her with very little time to mount the argument that she was going to put. Had the House not been counted out, as it was at that stage, something like six Labor and Opposition members would have had their full time to speak to rebut an argument that she had been unable to put in its entirety. </PARA>
<PARA> Yesterday's debate on Nurrungar-its existence, its purpose, the peaceful protests there over the weekend, the actions taken by the police in using mace and by the Minister for Defence (Mr Beazley) in calling in the troops-was clearly not to the liking of either the Government or the Opposition. What Senator Jenkins was saying, the issues she was raising and the questions she was asking were all clearly things both Government and Opposition senators preferred not to hear and which they did not want raised publicly-questions of who authorised the troops to be brought in; what authority the South Australian police had to act inside the base and who gave them that authority; why security was apparently as light as it was; why the Government argued that something terribly secret and meaningful could be discovered by the protesters if they got inside the base; and why, therefore, it was necessary to take the sort of action that the Minister for Defence took. </PARA>
<PARA> The point needed to be raised as to just exactly what Nurrungar is all about. Is it merely an insignificant part of the verification procedure which, of course, would have accounted for the fact that security was so light but which would not have accounted for the draconian measures taken either by the South Australian police or by the Minister for Defence in bringing in troops? If, however, that action was felt to be necessary, quite clearly Nurrungar was more than the Government has been saying, namely, a low key verification system. It was quite clearly then something far more important in the scheme of Star Wars, making it quite possibly a first strike base. Then one has to ask why the base was not more properly secured. </PARA>
<PARA> Those questions were obviously the sort that the Opposition did not want raised and that the Government did not wish to have to answer. So twice during the first 15 or so minutes of the debate the Opposition called a quorum. On the first occasion, a sufficient number of senators answered the quorum bells for the debate to continue. The second time, through a neat and timely piece of collusion between the Government and the Opposition, too few people came into the chamber and, indeed, some were actively discouraged from entering by the party Whip. What clearly happened was that the Government saw the opportunity presented to it by the Opposition and grabbed it. </PARA>

The Leader of the Australian Democrats has just alleged collusion between the Government and the Opposition with respect to withholding of a quorum. One of the points I made when I suggested that Senator Haines should not speak on her motion to suspend Standing Orders was that she might talk herself out of our support. I must say that I take particular exception to Senator Haines making that allegation when I have given her, her Deputy Leader and her Whip the clearest possible personal assurance that there was no collusion between the Government and the Opposition. And I repeat that now. In those circumstances, I find the statement unparliamentary.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thank you, Mr President. Whether Senator Chaney believes that there was collusion or not, I would point out that collusion does not have to be willing. The simple fact of the matter, as I continue to say, is that the opportunity was presented and the Government took it. The fact is that had the opportunity not been presented the Government would not have been in a position to act upon it. The Opposition provided the weapon and the Government used it and that is quite simply what occurred yesterday. The Opposition gave the Government the opportunity to take action which is almost unprecedented in this place-to call a debate to a premature close by willingly excluding its members from the chamber. Before the second quorum was called, all remaining senators except Senator Knowles and Senator Newman, who called the quorum, left the chamber. If that is not providing a neat opportunity and begging for it to be picked up, I do not know what is. We do not need to have an overt conspiracy for there to be a conspiracy of interests and that certainly is what we saw here yesterday.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The second quorum was able to be counted out because there were too few Opposition senators in here, several of whom I saw in the passage moving away from the door when they realised that it was a quorum. Honourable senators should ask Senator Durack how close he got to the door yesterday before he turned around and went away again. There was at least one Liberal Party senator in my view who got to the door during the ringing of those bells and turned around again. In case we hear that oft repeated remark that it is the responsibility of the Government to maintain a quorum in this place, may I remind honourable senators that Odgers makes it perfectly clear that it is the responsibility of the Senate as a whole to maintain a quorum. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;According to Australian Senate Practice, which is what we usually observe in this place, it is the requirement of the Senate as a whole to maintain the numbers in this place. Therefore, individual senators cannot excuse themselves from involvement in all of this. In any event, as it happened, the Government was busy excluding its own senators with Senator McKiernan standing part way between the Democrat benches and the Hansard table, making hand signals to those Labor senators who were about to come in the glass doors and hustling them out. Indeed, those senators were still hovering around the corridors and passages after the Senate had been counted out.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> What we saw in here yesterday was, in fact, an absolute travesty. What a way to run a supposedly democratic institution-keeping people out of the chamber in which debate is supposed to take place. Anyone in Australia who thought there was still a shred of commitment to free debate, democratic expression of opinion and civilised rules of behaviour in this Parliament, has been disabused of that belief as of yesterday. To stop a legitimate debate on Nurrungar, the Government was prepared to use the childish behaviour of the Opposition in calling quorums to manufacture an adjournment. It should not try to argue that it was because Estimates committees were being held up. Estimates committees were held up last week, on both days on which they sat. In any event, the primary responsibility of this chamber is to debate issues as they arise. That is why we have standing order 64. Opportunities are listed daily on the Senate Notice Paper for individual senators to raise matters of public importance. </PARA>
<PARA> If it was good enough last week to hold up Estimates committees for a debate on the pilots strike, it was certainly good enough this week to hold up Estimates committees in order to debate the events at Nurrungar over the weekend. </PARA>
<PARA> I point out that early in the morning we made an offer to the Government to limit that debate to four speakers. That is not abnormal in this place. We quite frequently make agreements between the parties to put a speaker aside or to curtail debate in order for other business to be brought on. </PARA>
<PARA> I think the personal invective that has been directed at another senator in this place, Senator Vallentine, indicates just how much personalities come into what is supposed to be a rational behaviour pattern in this chamber. How can we, as representatives of the electorate, claim to be upholding democratic processes if we allow the sorts of procedures that happened yesterday to occur, if abuse is hurled across the chamber at somebody simply because another senator's views are different from those held by others in this place? I thought the whole democratic electoral system was about allowing a diversity of opinions to be expressed in this place without people being hounded either in the chamber or out of the chamber. </PARA>
<PARA> The electorate, I would have thought, had the right to expect behaviour of senators in this place that was a little above kindergarten level, yet that is what we have seen here today and yesterday. People have drowned out other speakers and the device of counting the Senate out has been used to curtail a debate. What we saw yesterday was a gag, pure and simple, and one to which the Opposition, despite its ritual protests about gags and guillotines in the past, was at least an accessory. Had it not called for quorums to be formed, the Government would not have been able to engineer the adjournment of the Senate. Indeed, had Liberal and National Party senators answered the quorum call in any numbers, instead of hovering in passages and lobbies, as Government senators were doing, the business of the Senate would have proceeded. </PARA>
<PARA> I understand that Senator Knowles tried to convince at least one person from the Channel 10 Good Morning Australia program yesterday afternoon that it all happened because Liberal senators did not have time to come back to the chamber. That was what I was told by the person at Channel 10 to whom she alleged to have spoken. Her colleagues, it was claimed, had all gone to meetings and did not have time to get back for the second quorum call. It seems to me that if that is what Senator Knowles said, it simply compounds the nonsense that went on yesterday. The reason we extended the time for which the bells would be rung for a quorum when we moved into this enormous building, from three minutes, which was the case in the old House, to four minutes here, was so that people could get from the furthest place in this building to the Senate chamber without missing a division or a quorum call. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Stone asked me how many Democrat senators answered the call. Six out of seven Democrat senators were in this place in answer to that quorum call, compared with two Opposition senators at the beginning of the call, and I think another five later. I have not checked the names that were listed a little later; certainly there were considerably fewer than the 34 senators that the Liberal and National parties have between them. As for the argument that they did not have time to get back from wherever they were, we allowed four minutes for movement in this place for a division or a quorum to ensure that, no matter where people were, unless they got stuck in a lift or unless their bells were wired the wrong way around, both of which have happened in this place, they would have the opportunity to get from wherever they were to here if they wanted to. The fact is that they did not want to, so that at least is a nonsense.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Anyone who argues, as I said earlier, that it is the role of the Government to maintain a quorum is asserting something that is simply not supported under the rules. I refer people to Odgers on page 196 of Australian Senate Practice in which he states quite clearly that that responsibility rests with the Senate. That includes those honourable senators lurking in passageways and lobbies. Indeed, in the House of Commons, when quorum calls were still allowed, the very fact that members were standing in corridors near the chamber was given as sufficient reason for the Presiding Officer not to make a count, especially if the reason for calling the quorum was deemed to be frivolous. </PARA>
<PARA> If we pride ourselves on following the precedents established by the House of Commons-by and large that is what we do-there is no doubt at all in my mind, first of all, that the second quorum, called as it was so quickly after the first one during Senator Jenkins's speech on Nurrungar, was frivolous, and probably malicious as well, although that does not rate a mention by Odgers, and, secondly, that there were sufficient people hanging about in the lobbies or corridors around this chamber for the numbers to have been made up. The precedent from the House of Commons could-I will not go as far as saying should-have been followed and the Acting Deputy President could have refused to make a count the second time a quorum was called. He did not and so the farce continued. </PARA>
<PARA> Clearly, the aim of the Opposition in calling quorums was to prevent Senator Jenkins from speaking, or at least from speaking for her full time. The Government used this tactic to end the debate altogether, at least for that day. It was possible, of course, under the Standing Orders for the whole thing to be re-run from the point at which it finished. But that, I think, was superseded by the abuse of procedure that we saw happen in this place yesterday. By deliberately discouraging Labor senators from entering the chamber, the Labor Whip abused the normal procedures of this place and the normal procedures of his office. The reason parliaments have Whips is in order to get as many people as are required where they should be. In the case of quorums and divisions honourable senators should be present when required. We allow pairing, certainly, and the Whips ensure that that is maintained. The only people who have any justification at all for not being in the Senate chamber for either a quorum call or a division are those who are absent or who have been paired. </PARA>
<PARA> To see Senator McKiernan standing in the middle of this Senate chamber actively waving Labor senators out of this place or away from this place was one of the most astonishing things that we have ever run into in this place. As for the behaviour of Opposition and Labor senators in effectively gagging a debate on a matter which is of considerable concern to the people of Australia, I can say only that, if that is their attitude to democracy, we are going very much the way of dictatorships and banana republics. We all know what the numbers do in this place: if one has the numbers one wins; if one does not have them, one loses. But to have a gag imposed in this way is, I think, unique to this House since Federation. That means that we have seen officers of political parties in this place, and the Senate as a whole, hit the depths of propriety and challenge the very reason for having a Senate, having a parliament, having debating opportunities for individual senators, and indeed groups of senators for that matter-opportunities presented to them under the Standing Orders so that they can raise matters of importance to themselves and to the country. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator McKiernan is deserving of censure for the part that he played yesterday in ensuring that there were not sufficient numbers in this Senate to ensure that the debate and the proceedings of this chamber could continue. But the Opposition is not without blame in that it provided, wittingly or unwittingly-and in the case of Opposition members I sometimes wonder where their wits are anyway-the Government with the opportunity to use that particular gag procedure. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr President, on 2 October an article in the Melbourne Herald quotes Senator Norm Sanders, sitting up the back there, as saying that he is a great fan of bogong moths. He goes on to say `the moth symbolises the ineffectuality of much that happens in Parliament House'. He must have been talking about Senator Janine Haines's performance today, because this morning is stunt morning. First of all, Senator Vallentine reads up Odgers' Australian Senate Practice on how to get thrown out of this place. She then comes in, almost gets thrown out, has Senator Chaney intervene, but then carries on again and in the end we all had to throw her out. So that was the first part of stunt morning.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We also knew that this motion was probably coming up and that a further stunt would be run. But I do not criticise that. A bit of group therapy is always good for everyone; we need a circuit breaker in this place. When we are arguing with each other and things get very heated, a censure motion or something like this washes the slate fairly clean, and after a few hours of grumbling we can get back to negotiating, talking to each other and no-one bears a grudge more than a day or two. So the motion that Senator Haines has moved today is very much a healing motion rather than a disruptive one. </PARA>
<PARA> But let me go back and put a few truths on the record in case anyone was misled by the very smarmy speech by Senator Haines. First of all we were operating yesterday under threats. Because we would not put poor little Senator Vallentine on the speaking list-she being one out of 76 in this chamber-we were threatened with disruption by that senator. That was the first operating principle that we were operating under yesterday, because we would not put Senator Vallentine on one of her pet projects. Independents in this chamber get a better run than anyone else. They get extra staff; they get phones to their desks; they get consulted. I pity some of the poor backbenchers on both sides here; they never get the same amount of speaking time or the run that Independents get in this place. So let us hear none of talk about the `poor old Independents'. They get a damned good run in this place, and Senator Vallentine, because she did not get her way once, threatened yesterday to disrupt this chamber. </PARA>
<PARA> Now I turn to the second great hypocrisy, and coming from Senator Haines it was a beauty. Does she deny that she approached me in the past suggesting a quorum be called in this place to have it collapse. Of course she has. I specifically remember the time and her speech to me on that subject. So she has done that in the past. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr President, that could have been put to me in two contexts. I will say this for Senator Haines. It could have been a sort of a flibbertigibbet comment in the corridors as she passed me by; I took it seriously at the time. They come in here and say `This is unprecedented'. This place has been deliberately counted out three or four times in my memory. I remember the Carrick government trying to count the place out over the Tasmanian forest issue, at around about 7 or 7.15 at night. Senator Haines would remember that. The Democrats and the Labor Party kept the quorum. On the adjournment, this place has been counted out deliberately before. So there is no precedent involved here, and again I say I can remember that conversation. One of the only abilities I have is a good memory, and I can remember the conversation she had with me-`Oh, get someone to call a quorum and count the joint out so we can all go home'. And then she came in here today wanting to censure another senator for something she has done herself.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I really should relate the history of this matter of public importance, because it is a very interesting one. I was sitting in my office yesterday and in came a matter of public importance dated 3 October 1979 from Senator Vallentine. I took some notice of the fact that someone had managed to whack it in 10 years ago for discussion that day. But it was in Senator Vallentine's name. Let us have the truth about what happened in the following two hours. I do not know, but let us postulate what happened. They got dirty over there in the Democrats and said, `You can't pinch our key plank; it's our turn to bring forward an MPI'. What happened? The same matter of public importance-it had the same wording-appeared under the name of Senator Jenkins. The same matter appeared, word for word. That happened because Senator Jenkins and Senator Vallentine are key poll rivals in the Western Australian Senate election next year, and the Democrats needed priority. I do not blame them; there are more of them here. They have been on these issues longer than the Johnnies-come-lately on the opposite side. So what did they do? They pinched the matter of public importance. How did they do it? I postulate: Did they threaten? Do they deny that they threatened not to stand in their places and leave only two people standing for this debate? Of course they did. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Knowles says that it was collusion. Never! So we had this sorry spectacle yesterday of the peace camp and the Parliament totally at war with each other. Who had the monopoly right over peace? Who had the monopoly right to discuss these issues? Senator Haines said that we were not willing to debate this matter. Let me say that we put up eight speakers. We were happy to have eight speakers, not four, as the suggestion went. Every Government speaker-Senator Schacht, Senator McMullan and I-was here throughout the debate. We had spent time preparing for this debate and had had briefings. We were quite happy to have the debate, as it looked like it was going to transpire. We were sure that we were going to come right over the top of those opposite and belt the living daylights out of the rubbish they were putting forward. So I do not accept the charge that this place collapsed on the basis that we were afraid on this issue. We are not afraid on this issue at all.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Let me move to the Government's duty on quorums. In general it is our duty to maintain the quorum in this place-not the Opposition's; not the Democrats'. That is a very strenuous problem at the moment. As I have had to point out in this chamber before-not that it relates to yesterday's events-the quorum is 26. We have 32 members in this chamber, including the President and nine Ministers. So not even the back bench can maintain a quorum in this place. Quorums are a second problem inasmuch as the time it takes to get from the Executive wing to here-as most people who have been to my office would know-is three minutes. Quite often when quorums are being called one can have a meeting that one has brought people from all round Australia for and talk to them for 10 minutes out of the hour that was allocated. But there is a precedent that says that the Government does not always have to keep a quorum. We know that those circumstances existed in the past. In a moment I will come to whether or not the precedent was justified yesterday. But there is a precedent for the particular actions of the Government. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me move to another ridiculous point. Senator Haines alleges that there was collusion. Senator Haines must be as blind as a bat if she did not see the reaction on this side of the chamber when the first quorum was called, when virtually four minutes of Senator Jenkins's speech was disrupted. We on this side all reacted with anger to the calling of that quorum, because we could see what was about to happen; we are going to have three quorums during Senator Jenkins's speech. She was allocated 20 minutes. Because she takes so long to wind up in a speech, she had not even reached the main subject yesterday. So we were going to have 20 minutes, 12 minutes of which was going to be taken up by quorum time and a build up, never getting to the substance of the thing. A lot of us said, `Well, that's enough; why should we have to put up with this?'. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me move to the second point made by Senator Haines. Senator Haines says the Liberals left the chamber. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Jenkins interjecting-</PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="UI4">Senator ROBERT RAY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Jenkins has given some good speeches here, but the one she made yesterday was not the most inspiring. If I were not on duty, I would have left too. There is no evidence to suggest that the conservatives on the other side left the chamber for the purpose of calling a quorum. I think there were about 11 or 12 people here at the time. Therefore, there was no need for one or two to leave if we wanted to call a quorum for any particular point. Again, I think that was just a bit of dross in respect of the honourable senator's speech.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The question has been raised about Estimates committees. I want to spend some time on this because this was central to our thinking. Note that I use the word `our'-not Senator McKiernan's-thinking on this subject. When a second quorum was called, we said, `Well, why should we be dragging people all over the building for the rest of the afternoon?', knowing that the two hours that Senator Jenkins had deliberately decided to take up yesterday-she took it off Senator Vallentine-would be added to the time taken last night by the Estimates committees. It is well known that Estimates Committee B went to 2 o'clock in the morning. Estimates Committee C finished at 10.30, mostly because the Minister concerned was ill. It probably would have gone longer, but in deference to the Minister the Committee was able to cooperate and get its work done. </PARA>
<PARA> It is all very well for people to come and say, `We're going to add in an MPI'. I noticed Senator Jenkins at an Estimates committee meeting yesterday; I was most appreciative of the fact that she was attending out of hours, so I do not lay this charge against her. But it is basically members of the Government and the Opposition who have to sit here till 2 o'clock in the morning while the rest snuggle up at home sound asleep, getting their beauty sleep. This issue could have been raised today by way of a matter of public importance or, I guess, on the adjournment. But a whole series of events convinced the Government that it was not worth keeping a quorum in this place: firstly, a desire to get the Estimates committees under way; secondly, the unseemly spectacle earlier in the day of the two peace groups going to war over who would get the matter of public importance; and, thirdly, what a waste of time it was going to be if nearly every speech, except for the side that calls quorums, was going to have eight or nine minutes taken out. We do not call quorums. So, Senator Jenkins was going to have 10 minutes out of 20 and I would probably have got 10 minutes out of 20. It was becoming a pointless exercise and I do believe that the use of quorums in those circumstances is unjustified. </PARA>
<PARA> The calling of quorums is justified under a number of banners-usually someone is not here, someone is being particularly obnoxious or someone is being punished for a prior offence. But just to use it to cut eight or so minutes out of a substantial speech reduces this chamber to nothing more than a farce. The moment someone puts a lucid argument and makes points, what happens? A quorum is called, the debate is interrupted and this chamber does become extremely ineffectual. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Haines said, `People ask me why I am leaving this intelligent chamber and going to a less intelligent chamber', but then went on to berate the intelligence of this chamber. I am not going to go through her motives as to why she is leaving this chamber. We will leave that for another time and another debate. But, really, the intelligence of this chamber varies. When it is good, it is very good and when it is bad, it is awful. So far in five weeks we have amended one piece of legislation-a health Bill-to such an extent as probably to render it useless. We have done nothing else, and on we wander. So do not--</PARA>

It is like the string of nine premiership losses suffered by Collingwood, Mr President-just a bit of bad luck on the way through!</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I come only to the final point before I sum up. I find the latter part of this motion quite strange. First of all, it alleges that the conduct of Senator McKiernan was an abuse of the parliamentary process. This chamber will probably agree with that-no court of law would; no court of law would take notice of a couple of hand signals. For all the honourable senators opposite know, and we know better, a good defence lawyer would say that he was trying to swat a few bogong moths when he was waving his hands. Nor does it know and nor has it assumed correctly that it was Senator McKiernan alone that made that decision. Quite clearly it was not. </PARA>
<PARA> I urge that if this motion is carried my name be placed at least at equal billing with my good colleague from Western Australia, because it will be well deserved. I am pretty miffed that I have not been censured yet. After all, we would censure anything. Lately, if one moves in this chamber one gets censured. It is the latest stunt. If a Minister does not answer a question, he gets censured. What honourable senators have done, of course, as I have pointed out before, has totally devalued the censure motion. A fluid combination of opportunistic numbers decides that X will be censured or Y will be censured. Occasionally a clever move will be made, such as one by Senator Macklin a few weeks ago, who stymied two censure motions in one go by including both sides of the chamber. Once again, it just depends on the fluidity of the numbers. The censure motion means absolutely nothing. </PARA>
<PARA> On point five, and certainly on point two, Senator McKiernan was not abusing the parliamentary processes of the Senate. That has not been established. Anyone who votes for the motion does this place a disservice because that has not been established here. The processes of the Senate have been variable in the past. Both the Carrick led Senate team in 1982 and, on at least three occasions, the Government have deliberately cut short the sitting. No censure motions were moved on any of those occasions. But because the peaceniks-the Democrats-have got a bit miffed, they want a bit of group therapy, they want a circuit breaker put in. What happens? They censure poor old Senator McKiernan. We can see how distraught he is at the prospect of being censured. It is a legitimate tactic open to the Government, one it would not use very often, but one which I think we used under provocation yesterday. </PARA>
<PARA> I sum up by saying that this was not preplanned. We had all our speakers ready for this debate and we were quite confident that we were going to give the Democrats a creaming. Whether that confidence was justified, we will never know, or we may find out next time the matter comes up. There was no collusion between the Government and the Opposition, none whatsoever. Our decision was made on the spot; whether it is right or wrong we are sticking with it as a decision. Senator Haines may deny that she suggested to me once that we could call a quorum and collapse the Senate. All I can say is that that is my clear memory of a conversation I once had with her. I ask the rest of the Democrats whether any of them has ever suggested the place be collapsed by way of quorum. Senator McLean says no. Senator Macklin is trying to search his memory. Probably he is pretty certain that he did too. They are willing to put on the record a censure of a senator for something they have contemplated or suggested themselves. History will judge Senator McKiernan to be a more consistent person, if this motion is carried, than the Democrat senators. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Opposition will support the general thrust of this motion, although it will move an amendment in relation to the latter part of it. Before I do that I want to put on record something about the behaviour of the sanctimonious Democrats in relation to quorums and count-outs. The last time this place was counted out was on 1 June 1988. On that occasion 23 senators were present at the time of the count-out. Not one single member of the Australian Democrats was present. The time before that was on 10 December 1987. There were 23 senators present at the time of the count-out. Senator Coulter was here; not one other single member of the Australian Democrats was present. The time before that was 19 February 1986. There were 18 senators at the time of the count-out. Senator Vigor was present. He probably had been there since the bells rang for prayers that morning, but not one other member of the Australian Democrats was present. The time before that was 29 May 1985. There were 25 senators present at the time of the count-out, and not one single Australian Democrat. The previous occasion when this occurred was on 21 May 1985. There were 14 senators present at the time of the count-out, and not one single Australian Democrat was present.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> On the last five occasions that the Senate has been counted out for want of a quorum, since May 1985, Senator Haines and Senator Macklin were not present for one of those last five count-outs. When we come to the question of who actually turns up to answer those quorum bells, if we look at each of those occasions when quorums have been called in the last couple of years, we will find that it has been the Opposition parties which have consistently attempted to keep the quorums in this place. On 1 June 1988-as I say, 23 senators were present at the time of the count-out-of the 23 senators present, 21 were members of the Liberal and National parties; the other two were the President, occupying the chair, and the Whip, Senator McKiernan, who was on duty in the chamber at the time. During the previous count-out, of the 23 senators present, 16 were members of the Liberal and National parties and two were members of the independent group-Senator Vallentine and Senator Wood. It must have been an odd day because it was after 10.30 p.m. and Senator Vallentine was still here, so there must have been something in particular going on at the time. </PARA>
<PARA> These examples simply reflect on the moral outrage shown by Senator Haines today, because on the five previous occasions when the Senate has been counted out, Senator Haines's name does not appear in the Journals of the Senate as having attended to her responsibilities in the terms that she has described today-her deep and abiding commitment to answer quorum bells whenever she hears them rung. I do not know, like Joan of Arc, what sorts of bells or voices Senator Haines responds to these days, but if she wants to put herself at the stake, like Joan of Arc, on these particular issues, we are perfectly happy to accommodate her. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Ray has not done much better. We know that these days in the United States when one faces a murder charge one can plead the so-called `twinkies defence', `I was affected by eating junk food, Your Honour; I am not responsible for my actions'. Senator Ray has introduced into this chamber the latest version of that, the bogong defence: `It was the moths that done it'. As far as poor old Senator McKiernan was concerned, all he was doing was waving at these poor little creatures as they moved about the table; it was not so much a matter of `out, out, damned spot' as `out, out, damned moth', and all of the poor benighted members of the Labor Party gazing like waifs through the glass doors thought in fact that they were being instructed to go away when in fact it was only the moths who were the centre of Senator McKiernan's attention in this matter. The bogong defence will have, I suspect, its run on many occasions because it has now become a term of art that Senator Ray has introduced in this matter. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to go, however, to a couple of the substantive points raised in relation to the alleged collusion between the Government and the Opposition to count out the Senate yesterday. Collusion is defined in the dictionary as `a secret agreement for a fraudulent purpose or a conspiracy'. I say to the chamber quite directly that there was no discussion of, collusion in, assistance with, or facilitation of the Government's desire to adjourn the Senate yesterday on the part of the Opposition; far from it. In exactly the same way as Senator Ray has indicated the Government's interest in debating the matter of public importance, the Opposition parties, when originally presented by the Democrats and by Senator Vallentine with a speakers list of four people-a Democrat, Senator Vallentine, one from the Government and one from the Opposition-regarded that as so totally unacceptable that we insisted, as did the Government, on having a proper debate. We had Senators Newman, Tambling and MacGibbon ready to participate in that debate. </PARA>
<PARA> We regarded it as an outrage that parties representing Senator Vallentine's couple of per cent and the Democrats couple of per cent of the vote, should believe that they were entitled to 50 per cent of the speakers on an important and significant matter touching on our national security and defence. It was, in fact, very much at our insistence that the debate was expanded and provision was made for three Opposition speakers on that particular matter. We were ready for that debate, willing to participate in it and looking forward to participating in it. </PARA>
<PARA> As to the actual matter of the quorum and the messages sent out, may I say to the Senate that on the second occasion that the quorums were called, a message was put on the pager by our Whips in these terms: senators required to make quorum. It was only at that stage that it became apparent to a large number of people that there was an attempt on the part of the Government to close down the chamber yesterday. That message that Opposition senators were required to attend the Senate to keep the quorum was placed on the paging system by the Opposition Whip and senators were summoned to the chamber. Senator Knowles has quite rightly explained the difficulties that were occasioned as far as that was concerned and the fact that there was a failure on the part of the Government to honour its obligations to keep the numbers in the chamber. In fact, this led to the chamber being closed down. </PARA>
<PARA> Now I make a couple of points in relation to the general thrust of this motion. The first parts of the motion-that is to say, paragraphs (a), (b) and (c)-are parts of the motion that the Opposition parties will support. We believe that it is important to establish that the count-out is not a device to be used by either a one-party majority or a majority consisting of the Government and the Democrats or the Opposition and the Democrats-whatever it happens to be-to prevent the minority parties or any individual senator from properly participating in the debates and exercising their rights to speak in this chamber. It is important that the quorum and the count-out should not be seen as a device to actually terminate parliamentary debate. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="TI4">Senator PUPLICK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Ray makes the point about the use of quorums during particular debates. If senators believe that matters which are to be brought before the chamber are of such compelling interest that, in fact, they command wide attention, then, in fact, it is quite legitimate for people to be summoned to the Senate chamber to listen to them. That device is a legitimate one. As Senator Chaney rightly points out, it has been the practice of the Labor Party in government to empty this chamber whenever possible of Government representatives.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator Ray will recall that the other day, during the course of a debate on a piece of legislation regarding pharmacy, I had to draw attention to the fact that there was not a single Minister present in the chamber. Senator Ray had to make arrangements to find a Minister to come into the chamber. It is frequently the case that when we open in the morning with prayers, the Labor Party members do not turn up. The Labor Party deliberately keeps the chamber as threadbare of numbers as is possible. It is a proper and legitimate device to ensure that people will come to the chamber to observe what is required in terms of duty in the chamber. But the count-out, as a deliberate device to stifle and prevent a minority viewpoint being expressed, is not a legitimate device. We do not accept it as a legitimate device and it is for that reason that we believe the first part of the motion should be supported. </PARA>
<PARA> We, however, accept the argument put forward by Senator Ray that Senator McKiernan was merely an agent acting under instructions from his weightier leader and, in fact, he was simply part of a conspiracy-a collusion between himself and Senator Ray-for the purpose of facilitating what the Government saw to be the business of the day. We will therefore move that paragraphs (d), (e) and (f) be deleted from the motion and the following substituted in place thereof:</PARA>
<PARA>(d) notes that it is the clear responsibility of the Government and its Whips to maintain the quorum in the Senate and censures the Government and its Whips for their failure to do so. </PARA>
<PARA>That, I believe, is the correct procedure. It accommodates Senator Ray's desire for a bit of self-flagellation in the matter and we are happy to include it in the terms of the censure motion. </PARA>
<PARA> I make the point in conclusion, Mr Acting Deputy President, that we were prepared to participate, and indeed were participating, in the debate which took place. The decision to close down the chamber was clearly made by the Government as a strategic decision. When it became apparent to us that that was the tactic, our Whips took necessary steps to attempt to notify the people in our parties that they should report to the chamber. Indeed, in the chamber at the time of the count-out were both the Leader of the Opposition, Senator Chaney, and his deputy, Senator Lewis, so those people most adjacent to the chamber and those people with the senior responsibilities in the chamber attended as soon as a message was made available to them by the Whips. In fact, our Whips were here and Senator Newman, the next speaker in the debate, was present at that particular time. So I make that point: we wanted the debate to continue; we regarded it of sufficient importance to have taken the necessary steps to ensure it was not simply restricted to the Democrats, Senator Vallentine and one speaker a side from the major parties in the chamber. </PARA>
<PARA>  I make the point that we do not believe that the count-out is a legitimate weapon to be used to prevent minorities or individual senators from expressing their point of view. It has been a deliberate strategy on the part of the Government to keep the numbers of Ministers and Labor Party senators in the chamber to a minimum. We object to that and we have used the quorum as a device to make sure that that is not something which goes without being noted.</PARA>
<PARA> I make the point that the Democrats' own record of attendance in the Senate when the count-out has previously taken place is absolutely appalling. Let me repeat that record. It needs to be on the record. On 1 June 1988, not a single Democrat was present; on 10 December 1987, Senator Coulter was present; on 18 February 1986, Senator Vigor was present; on 29 May 1985, not a single Democrat was present; and on 21 May 1985, not a single Democrat was present. Not on any of those occasions was Senator Haines present-not once. In terms of the matter before us that needs to be put into the perspective in the way I have done. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that the arguments which have been put forward by Senator Haines in relation to her excuses about collusion are quite unsustainable. I note for the record, Senator Ray having made it perfectly clear, that the idea of the use of the count-out as an illegitimate device to close down debate which the Government does not like is one which the Leader of the Australian Democrats (Senator Haines) has in fact suggested to the Manager of Government Business or has at least made passing reference to in terms of Senator Ray's earlier description of it. The sheer hypocrisy of the way in which Senator Haines has dressed up this motion is absolutely transparent. I move:</PARA>
<PARA> Paragraphs (d), (e) and (f), leave out the paragraphs, insert the following paragraphs:</PARA>
<PARA> (d) notes that it is the clear responsibility of the Government and its whips to maintain the quorum in the Senate; and</PARA>
<PARA> (e) censures the Government and its whips for their failure to do so. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I hope I will not detain the chamber for very long on this matter but I do feel a need to say a couple of things about it in the light of what has been going on here this morning and, indeed, what went on here yesterday. This morning we have heard Senator Haines whipping herself into a fury, and I think it is fair to describe it in that way, about what she has described as collusion between the Government and the Opposition to have the Senate counted out yesterday. I simply wanted to say to Senator Haines that that is totally untrue. It is a total misconstruction of the events of yesterday afternoon. Not only do I think Senator Haines's remarks this morning leave a great deal to be desired but also I have to say that I think Senator Ray's defence of the Government's position yesterday leaves even more to be desired.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Yesterday we had a matter of public importance eventually placed on the Notice Paper by Senator Jenkins, it having originally been proposed, as Senator Ray quite accurately pointed out, that a matter in exactly the same words would have been placed on our paper by Senator Vallentine. That was eventually replaced, as I say, by Senator Jenkins's motion. </PARA>
<PARA> That motion was on the matter of the disgraceful events which occurred over the weekend at Nurrungar-the childish, immature behaviour of a group of people at and around the installation there in central Australia. I must say in passing that Senator Jenkins, who I understand was personally involved in that, has not exactly covered herself in glory in the process. Therefore, when that matter was raised in the Senate yesterday afternoon I certainly, and I make no bones about saying so, rose to my feet and left the chamber because I simply cannot bear to sit here and listen to the hypocritical cant that comes from these people here on my left on matters such as the joint installation at Nurrungar-total cant.

The debate upon it should have been heard out. I am not in any way dissenting from that point of view. Of course it should have been.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I strongly agree, therefore, with that part of Senator Haines's remarks which criticised the Government very strongly for not allowing that to occur.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As Senator Walters quite rightly points out, they should not judge others by their own behaviour. The fact is, as I said a moment ago, when this matter came on I left the Senate. I certainly was not going to sit here and listen to Senator Jenkins rabbit on about these matters. I was actually in my room; I had a visitor. We were talking about the matter under discussion and the bells rang. I noted the fact that the bells were ringing and I presumed, rightly as it turned out, that it was a quorum. Indeed, in due course `quorum required' appeared on the screen on my television set; so I knew again this was as I thought: a quorum was proceeding.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I operated, as one would normally expect, on the assumption that the Government would form the quorum, as it is its duty to do, and therefore took no notice of the bells. A little while later my beeper sounded in my pocket. When I pressed the appropriate buttons a message came up on the screen which said, `Senators wanted in chamber to make quorum'. I thought this was very strange, and that I must be picking up a Labor Party message on my beeper; so I took no notice of it again. I went on talking to my visitor and a bit later two things happened. I began to notice on my screen a few people on our side coming in, including Senator Chaney. I know Senator Chaney came in, I cannot remember now who the others were, but a number of people came in and I thought, `What the blazes is going on?'. At the same time I got a second message on my beeper that Opposition senators were wanted in the chamber. There was a difference between the two messages-the second one was that Opposition senators were wanted in the chamber to form a quorum. By that time, of course, it was all over. By the time I got out of the door the bells had finished ringing. </PARA>
<PARA> That was the series of events as they personally affected me, and any suggestion from Senator Haines or anybody else that there was collusion between the Government and the Opposition is not merely untrue but almost unparliamentary, as I think Senator Chaney said earlier, in view of the personal assurances that I understand he has given-and I certainly also would have given-to Senator Haines on the matter. I suggest to Senator Haines that instead of coming in here this morning and detaining us with a vast amount of rodomontade on all sorts of irrelevancies and false premises-the falseness of which has indeed been duly exposed by my colleague, Senator Puplick, in terms of the Australian Democrats' own record on these matters-she might have done well to remember the old adage that if one has to choose between conspiracy and a stuff-up, one always chooses the latter. There is not the slightest doubt that yesterday was a confusion, let us say. </PARA>
<PARA> I assure Senator Haines, through the Chair, that there was certainly no conspiracy. But there was a kernel of truth in Senator Haines's remarks, as I have already said, in accusing the Government of not only allowing but also actively moving to ensure that the Senate was counted out. That is the single element of Senator Haines's remarks with which I agree. I would describe that as a pretty cheap shot by the Government. I agree also with Senator Ray's comment that it was not just Senator McKiernan who should have been blamed, because I understand it was Senator Ray who initiated it. Instead of having a censure motion on Senator McKiernan we could certainly have had a censure motion in the terms which have now been suggested by way of amendment by Senator Puplick and for which, of course, I propose to vote. If we had had a little more commonsense from Senator Haines and a little less hot air we might have been at this point a lot earlier. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr President, the Opposition has indicated that it intends to move an amendment. I am not quite sure whether the terms of the piece of paper that I have here are the ones that Senator Puplick actually read out. The amendment states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>. . . it is the clear responsibility of the Government and its Whips to maintain the quorum in the Senate and censures the Government and its Whips for their failure to do so. </PARA>
<PARA>I indicate that we will seek to amend that amendment to leave out the first occurring `the Government and its Whips' and substitute `or senators' because it is our view that the obligation to maintain the quorum is an obligation of the Senate. I also indicate that whether or not the Government supports the amendment we will oppose the deletion of (d), (e) and (f) of Senator Haines's motion. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to raise a number of points that have occurred so far in the debate, but prior to doing that, as I have indicated on a number of occasions in the past, I think there is an amazing lack of logic in the way that this House conducts its business with regard to quorum issues. For example, when a senator draws attention to the state of the House and the presiding officer indicates there is no quorum present, it is not possible to conduct the business of the House. However, in an amazing lack of logic, what happens at that stage is that the clock keeps going. A much more reasonable and operational exercise would be for the clock to stop along with everything else and, when the quorum is formed, that person's time would start again. In other words, the time taken to form the quorum would come out of the time of the House; it would not come out of the time of the person speaking at that time. It has nothing to do with the person addressing the House. It is not the fault of that person that there is not a quorum. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Vanstone interjecting-</PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="2I4">Senator MACKLIN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I exempt Senator Knowles from that. When she is speaking, there is a good reason to call a quorum. There is no standing order governing the practice. It just happens to be done that way. It is about time this chamber resolved that that is an absurd way of proceeding. There is an absurd lack of logic. When a quorum is not present, the person speaking is not allowed to continue to speak and, therefore, he should not have to forfeit the time taken for a quorum to be formed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator Puplick, having delved into his myriad of files-or probably somebody else's myriad of files-drew out the fact that the House has been counted out on a number of occasions in the past. Of course, that was done during an adjournment debate. As all honourable senators here are very much aware, when the motion is put, `That the House do now adjourn', no new business is able to be introduced. In other words, that time is then devoted generally to speeches on matters of constituent interest. However, there is no responsibility on anybody to adhere to that. That is the very real reason that Senator Puplick was able to say that the Opposition does well under this operation because the majority of speakers in the adjournment debate are from the Opposition. Members of the Government are not likely to stand up and lambast their own government. At least, they do not do it in here; they generally do it on television. </PARA>
<PARA> The exercise in which Senator McKiernan engaged on behalf of the Government was facile. It is quite simple to find out whether or not he was waving off the moths or waving off his own people. That is for Senator McKiernan to tell the chamber. Presumably, since his name is mentioned, he will engage in this debate and he will tell the chamber whether or not he was in fact directing his senators to stay out. I invite him to do so because, fairly obviously, he was indicating to his senators to stay out. He knows he was doing that. I have no objection to linking Senator Ray to that. It was fairly obviously a direction from Senator Ray. Everybody in here knew that Senator Ray had directed Senator McKiernan to do it. But if Senator McKiernan was silly enough to take the advice and do that, he has to take the responsibility. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator McKiernan, as the operational Whip in the chamber at the time, has to take the responsibility for his actions. I am quite sure that he always takes responsibility for his actions and does not shuffle them off onto Ministers. Hence on this occasion he must take responsibility for whatever he was doing. Our motion indicates that at that time Senator McKiernan was clearly signalling to Australian Labor Party senators to remain out of the chamber. If he does not believe that, and believes that he was merely standing on the floor here waving his arms around because he did not have much else to do at the time, he can say that-not only to this chamber, but to the rest of his constituents in Western Australia. I am quite sure that when next there is an election for the Labor Party Whip in the Senate, they would prefer that somebody other than a person who stands in the chamber waving his arms aimlessly is elected. What he was doing was quite clearly directed at Western Australian senators. I invite Senator McKiernan to come into the debate and to say clearly whether or not he was directing his senators to stay out of the chamber so that we may all be clear that the Government was engaged in that exercise. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="2I4">Senator MACKLIN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am sure he was doing it at Senator Ray's directions. Senator Ray clearly indicated to the chamber that he was not about to say whether he had directed him or not. He used a hypothetical exercise, but Senator McKiernan is the only one who can tell us what actually happened.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The other point made by Senator Ray by way of defence-and I must admit that I do enjoy Senator Ray's defence of the indefensible; it is always entertaining and worth listening to, I suppose, in that sense-was that it was going to be a retribution exercise with regard to Independents. I operated as a whip for quite a number of years in this place, during which time most of the rules which now apply were developed. I first became a whip when my Party gained the balance of power in 1981. At that time, not only were we not allowed to call for quorums to be formed, but also we were not permitted to engage in almost anything in debate. By a reasonably hard won exercise, the Senate adjusted to the presence of a grouping of senators from other than the major parties. </PARA>
<PARA> In regard to matters of public importance, there was a standing agreement-it may have been abrogated since I left position of the whip-that when a matter of public importance was introduced either by ourselves or by the Independents on an issue on which we agreed there would be at least a couple of speakers representing our point of view and the rest of the speakers would be from the Government and the Opposition, representing the opposing point of view. Senator McKiernan can enlighten the Senate as to whether that arrangement also has disappeared. </PARA>
<PARA> The other arrangement that was agreed to was a reasonable distribution of matters of public importance and non-government business time. During my early years as a whip it was absolutely chaotic. A general agreement was reached whereby the time available for matters of public importance, urgency motions and non-government business would be distributed among the various groups in this place in direct proportion to their numbers. Hence, an Independent had a one in 76 chance of having a matter of public importance discussed. That worked out to be about once in the life of a parliament. Our chances were seven in 76, and so it goes on. The allusion to two hours by Senator Ray is probably better dealt with by my Whip since I was not involved in any of those discussions. When Senator McKiernan joins the debate, I invite him to inform the chamber whether both of those general operating rules have now disappeared. If they have not, I believe that what occurred yesterday represents a direct breaking of those types of agreements. </PARA>
<PARA> It becomes obvious, I think, to everybody in this place, if ever they bother to add up the figures, that the processes in this chamber can break down pretty rapidly unless there is reasonable agreement across parties as to how we conduct business. Undoubtedly, from time to time, in the heat of the moment those types of agreements will break down. It may be that yesterday was one such time. If it was, I think it needs to be rectified, but if it was not-if, indeed, it was a deliberate and new attempt to institute something that has occurred a number of times previously, all during the adjournment debate, all late at night, in an attempt to bring a particular debate to a halt-fairly obviously, this chamber will become unworkable in the future. It is interesting to go back over the various occasions that Senator Puplick referred to. Senator Puplick mentioned various adjournment debates, but did not tell us he was here on all of those occasions. I am sure he was; probably holding up the exercise--</PARA>

It was on a matter of public importance introduced under the Standing Orders of the chamber and at any time new business was able to be introduced. What we are confronting is an abuse of the processes that have occurred here. Senator McKiernan, either on his own behalf or induced by Senator Ray, engaged in a silly exercise yesterday, either waving his arms around aimlessly as he stood in the middle of the chamber or directing his senators to stay out when there was a call under Standing Orders for a quorum to be formed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator Ray, by using his defence which Senator Puplick referred to as the `bogong defence', has, I think, cast very serious aspersions on Senator McKiernan's sanity.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I had hoped not to speak in this debate because we have now taken up an hour and 40 minutes of fairly scarce legislative time that I had hoped would have been spent restarting our consideration of the ATSIC legislation. In light of the fact that the Australian Democrats have indicated that they wish to move a further amendment to the amendment that has been put forward by Senator Puplick on behalf of the Opposition and in light of a couple of the comments made by Senator Macklin, I wish to make some further response. I reject totally the suggestion which was implicit in what was said by Senator Haines, and I think more explicit in what was said by Senator Macklin, that to participate in counting out the Senate on the adjournment is in some way superior to doing so in the circumstances which applied yesterday.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> What the Australian Democrats are putting forward is that senators have certain rights of debate and one of the rights is to bring forward a matter of public importance which normally ensures that for two hours a group of senators gets a chance to speak on a selected topic. For the private senator, the senator who is operating in this place without perhaps the support of his or her party or who might be without a party, the adjournment debate is in fact an essential part of the political armoury. It is the private member's ultimate guarantee of an opportunity to speak. I believe that to suggest that the adjournment debate is not important is quite wrong and ignores its importance. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="EF4">Senator CHANEY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;A number of my Opposition senators are assisting me. They keep pointing out that the Democrats-and Senator Jenkins is a Democrat-the nuclear disarmers and so on are frequent users of the adjournment debate. I would simply say in response to Senator Macklin that I do not believe that it is desirable to be counting out the Senate on the adjournment to silence senators notwithstanding that it is very irritating to be here late at night listening to debates that perhaps are not of particular interest to us.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The second point I want to make concerns the calling of quorums. It was touched on by Senator Puplick in his comments on behalf of the Opposition. In the last six years we have seen a quite intentional attack on the institution of parliament and an attempt made to reduce the value of debate in this and the other place. If a serious matter is addressed by the Opposition in either chamber, it is almost universally the case that the Government senators, or in the other place the members of the House of Representatives, will absent themselves from the chamber. That is no more than a technique to reduce the apparent value and importance of the debate which is taking place. I believe that it is part of a clear intention on the part of the Australian Labor Party to reduce the value of the Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> In those circumstances, I think the calling of quorums is very legitimate. The suggestion from Senator Ray that it is unfair to remove minutes from a speech of limited duration has some merit, but it need have no merit at all if the quorums are being kept in an adequate way. In other words, the amount of time that is taken for a speech is a function of the failure of senators or members in the other place to keep the House. </PARA>
<PARA> That brings me to my third point, which is that I think it is the primary obligation of government to keep the House. Opposition senators have consistently said, `We will sit when the Government requires us to sit', and we have done so. When in government we accepted it as our primary obligation to keep a quorum. Those senators who were here under the leadership of former Senator Sir John Carrick will recall his absolute requirement that there be a quorum of Government senators available to ensure that the Senate could be kept. That was seen as a clear responsibility on the part of Government senators and it was imposed upon us. </PARA>
<PARA> In those circumstances, I think that the amendment moved by Senator Puplick is the appropriate amendment, and we would withstand and resist the amendment moved by the Australian Democrats. In doing that, I would make it quite clear to the Australian Democrats that, if at any future time I think that the calling of a quorum is being used as a means to prevent debate, I will, as I did yesterday, respond to the quorum call. I do not normally respond to quorum calls. I have come to the door of the Senate and left because I have found that the bells were ringing not for a division but for a quorum. I have done that in the belief that the primary obligation to keep the quorum is with the Government and that since it is normally in the Government's interest to do so that will occur. When I received a message from the Whip yesterday that it appeared the Government was going to withhold a quorum I immediately came to the chamber and Senator Austin Lewis, the Deputy Leader, came with me. We happened to be close to the chamber. As has been documented three times now-this is the third time-a second message was put out to Opposition senators to indicate that they should respond to the quorum. </PARA>
<PARA> I again make the point that I made in the course of Senator Haines's speech when I took a point of order. When there have been such clear assurances on the part of the Opposition that we had no part in any cooperation of any sort with the Government in bringing about the termination of the Senate sitting yesterday, I think it is an extraordinary breach of the conventions of this place that our word is not accepted by the Democrats. If a senator makes a bald assertion of that sort, I think the proper requirement of this place is that the senator is accepted as telling the truth. I find it quite offensive that there should be any doubts about this matter when those clear assurances have been given. </PARA>
<PARA> I agree that it was unfair to single out Senator McKiernan as the villain. He was in this case the monkey rather than the organ grinder. That was made quite clear in the speech which was given by Senator Ray. I say that as an ex-Whip and without any malice towards Senator McKiernan. I have done a bit of monkeying myself in this chamber with a very effective organ grinder in former Senator Withers as our then leader. We commend our amendment and oppose the further amendment moved by the Australian Democrats. </PARA>

While I certainly do not say that there has been collusion between the Opposition and the Government on this matter, I think there was a very convenient overlap of interests which allowed Senator Newman to call a quorum and Senator McKiernan, acting as the monkey for his organ grinder, to wave his fellow senators away from the chamber.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This incident reminded me very much of what happened on 22 November last, after the Government announced its decision to extend the leases on the Pine Gap and North West Cape bases. The decision was announced in some secrecy and the following day, when we debated it in this chamber, the Opposition carried the Government's arguments for it. Not one single Government senator spoke in the debate. Of course, the Australian Democrats and Independents were left to provide the real opposition to the decision in this place. </PARA>
<PARA> If a quorum had not been called yesterday and the Senate had not been counted out, we would not be debating this matter today. We would be able to get on with the consideration of the very important Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission legislation, which awaits us and which has been hanging around this chamber for a very long time. It was a most disgraceful episode yesterday. It was nothing but a waste of the Senate's time to have to raise this matter today, but the reason that it has to be raised in the Senate-and thanks for giving us the opportunity on a broadcast day-is that the matter of Nurrungar has been a matter of great public interest. It is a matter that has achieved a lot of publicity in the newspapers recently. It is a matter on which 500 Australian citizens have been arrested at a place that was very difficult to get to because of the pilots dispute. Those 500 people represent very many more in the Australian community who are extremely concerned about this particular issue. </PARA>
<PARA> There has been serious criticism of the Government in the newspapers over this matter. The Opposition is not going to criticise the Government on this matter; in fact, the Government and the Opposition have a very bipartisan approach to defence issues. It is left to the Democrats and Independents to carry the real arguments against bases such as Nurrungar, Pine Gap and North West Cape. This is what the Sydney Morning Herald said in yesterday's editorial,  the heading of which was `The fault at Nurrungar':</PARA>

The fact that the Government chose to use troops against Australian citizens for the first time in Australian history is a matter of great public importance and should be debated in this chamber not only in this motion but also in the matter of public importance that was raised yesterday. The whole question of how Western democracies deal with peaceful protesters is one that needs to be debated at length. We cannot continue to have this subject gagged by the Opposition and by the Government in a collusion of interests. I have no hesitation in saying `a collusion of interests', because I have seen that happen time and time again in this chamber. In America the civil guard, which is not a military force, is used.

<PARA> I refer to a parallel instance which occurred in this chamber yesterday in relation to a question I asked Senator Ray on Nurrungar. In that particular question I asked the Minister some questions in relation to the speech of the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) of 22 November last year relating to this American base in South Australia. In his response to me yesterday he sidestepped the issue. I asked him why the Minister for Defence (Mr Beazley) persisted in repeating that the base was used for arms verification purposes only when our eminent arms analyst, Professor Desmond Ball, had called this statement by the Prime Minister hyperbole. </PARA>
<PARA> I went on to quote the statements of two United States military generals and asked Senator Ray directly whether he disagreed with those statements. He sidestepped the issue by merely referring me back to the statement made by the Prime Minister on 22 November 1988. He tried to sidestep the issue further by bagging Jo Vallentine in relation to a matter that relates particularly to point (c), a fundamental question in relation to Nurrungar, that is the difficulty of getting information due to the military secrecy which surrounds these bases. Senator Ray was referring particularly to information that Senator Vallentine was trying to extract about the possibility of a melt-through on a nuclear-powered submarine. This illustrates perfectly the difficulty of getting that information. Had Senator Ray wished, he could have just as easily referred to the difficulty of the Senate standing committee getting just this information. Also, he could have pointed out that the committee did not finally discount the possibility of a melt-through on such a submarine. </PARA>
<PARA> I have one or two points left about the difficulties in relation to Senator Haines's motion which I would like to put to the chamber.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It must have been a mosquito or a gnat. I certainly challenge Senator McKiernan to say something about the rather odd hand gestures that he was making yesterday. Senator Puplick said that the Opposition was prepared to debate this matter yesterday. There was one Democrat on the speakers list, Senator Jenkins, who had put the motion. The rest of the speakers on the list, Government and Opposition speakers, would have been indistinguishable from one another. The Opposition would not have been doing any opposing on that.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to raise a point of order in terms of the latitude which Senator Dunn is taking in talking to a censure motion which deals with the specific question of the count-out of the chamber yesterday. We have now had the best part of 10 minutes debate on the issue of Nurrungar, the joint defence facilities, nuclear ships and all the other bits and pieces, which I put to you, Mr President, are simply not relevant to the fundamental issue which is before the Senate, which is the censure regarding the close-down of the chamber yesterday. If this is to be a free-for-all debate on the issue of the matter of public importance which was listed yesterday, in fact that is an interpretation of the Standing Orders relating to a censure motion which makes the whole thing totally meaningless.</PARA></TALK.START>

I would point out to Senator Puplick that points (a), (b), (c) and (d) all begin with the word `notes'; that they raise the question of what happened yesterday-namely, that a quorum was not present and that a matter of public importance debate on a particular issue was being pursued; that they raise the question of why the Government would have wanted that motion not to be debated yesterday; and that they note the actions of Senator McKiernan in ensuring that senators from his side of the House did not come in here in sufficient numbers to make up that quorum. The subsequent two parts of the motion certainly call for a censure. However, it is worth pointing out that the first four parts are as integral and important a part of the motion we are debating today as the two parts relating to the censure of Senator McKiernan and I would ask you to allow Senator Dunn to discuss those points.</PARA></TALK.START>

Senator Puplick talked about the Opposition senators who were prepared to speak on the debate yesterday without a point of order being raised against him; I would expect the same. I will conclude my remarks by referring to the speakers list. I have made the point that as there would be very little difference between the Government and the Opposition, it becomes even more important to have Independents and Democrats speaking on these important issues and raising motions such as the one that Senator Haines has raised today.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Earlier on Senator Ray went on at length about how Independents get a good run in this place. If Senator Ray was able to speak on this matter, I expect to be able to speak on it without a point of order being taken against me. I merely wish to make the point that in the absence of any genuine opposition to the Government on its defence policies and in view of the public interest in this matter, as was shown in Sydney Morning Herald article of yesterday, it becomes all the more important to give Independents that opportunity to speak.</PARA>

I have sat here, as no doubt you have, and listened with such patience as I could muster to Senator Dunn quite deliberately transgressing the Standing Orders by talking not to the matter of substance in the motion before the Senate, which is a censure of the Government or, as it was originally drafted, of Senator McKiernan, for certain procedural events which occurred yesterday.

I believe that any honourable senator should be allowed to address the terms of the motion that are, in fact, before the chamber. Quite frankly, I think the fact that part of that motion includes a censure is incidental. The Senate gave leave for this motion to be debated. If it had not wished the entire motion to be debated, I suggest it would have sought to delete various items and said, `No, we will discuss only (d), (e) and (f)'. As it was, it allowed (a), (b), (c), (d), (e) and (f) to be debated. I think that Senator Dunn is entitled to address any part of the motion of which Senator Haines gave notice this morning.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There are three things which enable this place to function effectively: the Standing Orders; longstanding agreements arrived at between senators and Whips; and short term agreements arrived at at Whips meetings each morning. They are the glue which holds the process together. As Senator Macklin said, occasionally when that glue becomes unstuck, we move into a period of non-cooperation and things founder. Senator Ray suggested that yesterday the glue came unstuck, things became messy and there was a state of war between the peace lovers in the Senate. In fact, he misrepresented the events of yesterday. I would like to put the record straight as to what did occur prior to the matter of public importance discussion yesterday afternoon.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator Vallentine proposed a matter of public importance which was accepted at the Whips meeting. At the Whips meeting it was suggested that four senators speaking for 20 minutes would be satisfactory. Later in the morning Senator Reid, the Opposition Whip, rang me and drew my attention to the fact that if we proceeded with Senator Vallentine's matter of public importance we would be contravening an agreement between the Independents, the Opposition and the Government--</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="3I4">Senator McLEAN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;No. It was an agreement by which we proceed in this place. Senator Schacht should be patient as this answers his earlier question. The fact was that Senator Reid rightly drew attention to the fact that Senator Vallentine was exceeding her entitlement under an agreement. The way out of that was for us to assume the matter of public importance as being ours, which we did. But this was done in a quite amicable way. It became our matter of public importance and, therefore, Senator Vallentine had to withdraw hers. We had to submit ours, which we did.</PARA></TALK.START>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="3I4">Senator McLEAN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Identical wording. As I said to Senator Ray, in a discussion we had in the vestibule, we identified with the issue. The wording was quite acceptable to us, and so it became our matter of public importance. Under another agreement that we normally have, under those circumstances we would have had two speakers on the list. That is the normal practice. That was not the case when the speakers list appeared. On our interpretation or perception of the situation the speakers list had become loaded. Originally, at the beginning of the day, there was a subtle agreement that the speakers list comprise four senators speaking for 20 minutes, but by this time it was in fact a speakers list which was loaded against a matter of public importance which was ours, and so we started to react. I think that it was a fairly reasonable reaction. The glue had started to become unstuck. Senator Vallentine was going to be our second speaker and was acceptable to us as a second speaker. However, the glue was becoming unstuck and the pattern of interaction was beginning to change. It started to get out of hand and by the end of the day it was a disaster.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That was the sequence of events. There was no war between the peace lovers. In fact, there was a quite amicable arrangement by which an issue with which we all agreed was brought before the Senate under a most important standing order under which, in fact, we are enabled to carry out our duty-that is to pursue matters of public importance. We saw this as a matter of absolute and profound public importance. Let me explain why. Outside the chamber in the previous 48 hours we believe we witnessed a profoundly important breach of democratic right. We saw it in those terms and, therefore, we brought it to the chamber as a matter of public importance. We hoped to debate it, only to find that we were confounded in that process by another equally significant breach of democratic right. </PARA>
<PARA> I have not been in this place very long; so, frankly, what has prevailed here previously is fairly irrelevant to me. But, as a newly elected senator, I am both alarmed and offended by what occurred here yesterday. It was simply an offence against my exercising, on behalf of my constituents, what I am elected to do. The questions of collusion, gesture and all the other things are secondary to that absolutely vital issue: we were attempting to have debated in this chamber what we saw as a breach of the most fundamental of democratic rights in this country; in other words, the arrest of innocent protesters by police, supported-to use the words of the Minister who was asked a question about it yesterday-in that process of arrest by troops using offensive weapons. To that we reacted strongly. We react equally strongly to the second breach of democratic rights. It was an offence against this chamber, an offence against the Parliament, and was unacceptable. Those who carried it through deserve censure. We truly see it as having been an abuse of procedure. If we, as a chamber, are prepared to accept it--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr President, with considerable reluctance I rise to make some comments in this debate, which seems to have gone on for rather a long time. We ought to be dealing with a lot of other important things. But, in response to the last speaker, I say that it is not normal to canvass in this chamber what happens at a Whips meeting. I would not do so. The suggestion of four 20-minute speakers came to me by my clerk when I was in the joint party meeting yesterday morning. It was not a matter I had heard about previously. I asked my clerk to contact Senator McLean to ask whether or not the Australian Democrats intended to support Senator Vallentine's matter of public importance. If they did not, there was no point in my getting my speakers ready to speak in the debate. So it was important that I knew.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I knew that we had an informal agreement-one of the things Senator McLean has just referred to-about the order of matters of public importance and who would have priority. According to my interpretation of that, Senator Vallentine was not due for a matter of public importance at this stage. So it was important that I knew whether or not the Democrats would support her. After I got an answer as to what they were going to do, I received the request for speakers. The Liberal and National parties have 34 Opposition senators. We were faced with a proposition of two speakers from the Australian Democrats' list, one from our side and one from the Government. I do not know what the Government thought about being allowed only one out of its 32 senators, but in the circumstances I regarded one out of our 34 as not well balanced and that we ought to have had a speakers list that adequately dealt with this very important topic. I will not canvass the rest of the matters and what else happened yesterday except to say personally that there was no collusion and I do not appreciate being accused of being involved in that when it was clearly not the case. As for what happened in the morning about the speakers, we did not reneg on any commitment as to the speakers list. </PARA>

<PARA> That this Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>I table the explanatory memorandum and seek leave to have the second reading speech incorporated in Hansard. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The speech read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA> This Bill will enable the completion of this Government's major and innovative reforms over the last 2 years to modernise the legislation which governs the Australian Federal Police to streamline and enhance its administration and management. The Bill represents one of the most significant initiatives in policing in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> Far reaching proposals of the nature contained in the Bill are normally not easily accepted by the persons they will affect. It is, I believe, indicative of the sense of commitment to effective law enforcement in Australia that the membership of the Australian Federal Police, and their Association, the AFPA, have accepted the changes outlined in the Bill. On behalf of the Government I take this opportunity to congratulate both the Association and its members and to restate the commitment of the Government to the development of the Australian Federal Police not only as the premier law enforcement agency of the Commonwealth but one that can be looked up to throughout the world. </PARA>
<PARA> There have been some concerns expressed as to the potentially wider implication of these proposals for other public sector employment. My colleague, the Minister for Industrial Relations has confirmed that during the discussions that led to this Bill those particular concerns were canvassed. He has stated that fixed term appointment in the Australian Federal Police is a response to a set of unique circumstances and should not be seen in any way as providing a basis for moves to fixed term contract employment in other areas. </PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Federal Police is the Commonwealth's premier law enforcement agency. At the national level, the Australian Federal Police will be an investigative agency with a pro-active focus. The Australian Federal Police has, in recent years, been shedding non-investigative functions, such as guarding diplomatic premises, so that it can concentrate on its investigative role in relation to the fight against drug trafficking, organised crime and fraud against the Commonwealth. </PARA>
<PARA> This Government is also concerned to ensure that, while the Australian Federal Police continues to develop to meet the everchanging challenges confronting it, its administration and operations continue to maintain the highest standards of effectiveness, public accountability and integrity. </PARA>
<PARA> In January this year the Government implemented the Career Structure Review of the Australian Federal Police through major amendments to the Australian Federal Police Regulations. Those amendments:</PARA>
<PARA>broadbanded the rank structure to reduce the number of ranks from 9 to 5;</PARA>
<PARA>removed the barriers to promotion on merit and accelerated advancement by removing certain eligibility prerequisites for promotion;</PARA>
<PARA>ended the role of seniority in relation to promotions at any rank;</PARA>
<PARA>allowed lateral entry to ranks above constable in certain circumstances;</PARA>
<PARA>streamlined the procedures relating to promotion and promotion appeals;</PARA>
<PARA>provided for the appointment of non-citizens on probation; and</PARA>
<PARA>allowed persons who are appointed as constables, sergeants and superintendents to be paid at greater than base salary level. </PARA>
<PARA> While the Australian Federal Police currently has high educational standards, these amendments to the Australian Federal Police Regulations will facilitate the achievement of even higher standards to enable it to even more effectively respond to the ever increasing sophistication of criminal activity. </PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Federal Police Legislation Amendment Act 1989 was enacted in the Autumn Sittings of the Parliament. That Act inserted Part VA into the Australian Federal Police Act 1979. Part VA provides for existing and former police members of the Australian Federal Police to lose certain superannuation rights and benefits if convicted of an offence involving corruption and sentenced to life imprisonment or a term of imprisonment longer than 12 months or, if a police member is found guilty of a relevant disciplinary offence and dismissed from the Australian Federal Police, as a penalty for that offence. </PARA>
<PARA>A Unified Workforce</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Federal Police Amendment Bill (No. 2) provides for the creation of a unified workforce. As far as is practicable, all AFP personnel-police and staff members-will be employed under the Australian Federal Police Act rather than utilising officers of the Australian Public Service who are currently appointed or employed under the Public Service Act 1922. Hitherto only police members have been appointed under the Australian Federal Police Act. </PARA>
<PARA> This change is regarded as crucial to the long-term development of the Australian Federal Police because it will greatly improve the Commissioner's flexibility in determining the overall staffing composition of the Australian Federal Police and the utilisation of its employees, both staff and police, effectively. It will also enable, wherever possible, that positions which do not require police powers, be filled by staff members which will result in a better utilisation of scarce police resources. Another benefit is that it will allow the development of a professional and dedicated workforce which is purpose-designed for the unique task of Federal law enforcement. Also it will be a workforce which is structured to encourage the sharing of a common purpose and set of values. </PARA>
<PARA> Upon commencement of the legislation, existing Public Service Act staff will be offered fixed term appointments as staff members of the Australian Federal Police under the Australian Federal Police Act. Alternatively, they will be able to take advantage of the mobility provisions of the Public Service Act. If they choose to be appointed to the Australian Federal Police under the Australian Federal Police Act they will retain their mobility rights within the Public Service for their first term. At the end of that term they will have the choice of electing to be credited with the accumulated adjustment payment, this is the payment to be made in recognition of fixed term employment and which I will later describe in more detail, or they may choose to return to the Australian Public Service. </PARA>
<PARA> All police members will be taken to have been appointed under the fixed term system provided for by the Bill unless they notify the Commissioner that they wish to resign from the Australian Federal Police. </PARA>
<PARA>Chief Executive Powers</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> The Bill provides the Commissioner with Chief Executive powers in relation to the composition of the Australian Federal Police and the terms and conditions of service of police members, other than himself, and of staff members. The Commissioner is given the power to determine terms and conditions for all members and staff members subject to the Minister giving the Commissioner general policy guidelines. In relation to members who are not Deputy Commissioners, senior executive commissioned police officers or senior executive officers, the Industrial Relations Commission will continue to determine most terms and conditions through awards. There are certain limits on the jurisdiction of the Industrial Relations Commission because of the Government's recognition of the unique nature of the Australian Federal Police as a disciplined force comprising police and staff members. </PARA>
<PARA> While the Commissioner will be provided with chief executive powers over the terms and conditions of employment of the force, staff members' employment (other than senior executive level staff members) will continue generally to be governed by Industrial Relations Commission awards. In addition, on such employment aspects as promotions and invalidity retirement, staff members will retain the right of appeal to the Merit Protection and Review Agency which will have a recommendatory power in relation to the Commissioner's decisions in these areas; the MPRA will also be given a recommendatory review role for SES level non-appealable promotions. In respect of disciplinary matters, staff members will have the right of appeal to the Federal Police Disciplinary Tribunal now afforded to members. In respect of general non-economic grievance matters, staff members, like police members, will have recourse to an AFP review panel especially established for that purpose. The panel will make recommendations to the Commissioner. </PARA>
<PARA>Fixed Term Appointments</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> The Bill abolishes tenure and replaces it with a fixed term appointment system for all police members, including deputy commissioners, and staff members of the Australian Federal Police. The very nature of policing lends itself to a fixed term tenure system. The stress of policing often leads to burnout among members who do not want or cannot progress to management positions. The fixed term appointment system will enable police members and staff members to leave the Australian Federal Police and enable the Commissioner not to re-appoint police members or staff members who are not performing at the required level. There will be an administrative appraisal system to recommend whether a police member or a staff member should be re-appointed on the completion of a term appointment. It is noteworthy that the Fitzgerald report has also recommended that term and contract appointments be introduced for the Queensland police force. </PARA>
<PARA>Australian Federal Police Adjustment Payment</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> The Bill provides for the entitlement to an adjustment payment which recognises the fact that the person's appointment is for a fixed term. The Australian Federal Police adjustment payment will be 12 1/2 per cent of accumulated salary over the period of the police member's or staff member's fixed term appointment or appointments, on the basis that it will be treated as an eligible termination payment. Police members or staff members will not be eligible for the adjustment payment where they resign from the Australian Federal Police prior to the end of their terms of appointment or where police members or staff members have their appointments annulled during the period of their probationary service. </PARA>
<PARA>Consequential Amendments</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> This Bill also contains amendments to the Complaints (Australian Federal Police) Act 1981, the Superannuation Act 1976, the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act 1977, the Crimes (Superannuation Benefits) Act 1989, the Industrial Relations Act 1988, the Merit Protection (Australian Government Employees) Act 1984 and the Public Service Act 1922 as a consequence of the restructuring of the Australian Federal Police by the Bill. </PARA>
<PARA>Financial Impact Statement</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> Currently the Australian Federal Police incurs very high invalidity costs. With the introduction of the unified work force there will be greater flexibility for redeployment of staff under the Comcare arrangements. Additionally, members will have the opportunity at the end of their fixed term appointments to make career changes with the financial support offered by the accumulated adjustment scheme, thereby avoiding the stress related illnesses so common in the force. Future cost benefits will accrue from reduction in invalidities and the absence of retrenchment provisions in the Australian Federal Police Act. </PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Federal Police adjustment Scheme (AFPAS) payments will be in the order of $5.4m in current dollar terms in the year 2020, based on an AFPAS payment of 12 1/2 per cent of a police member's or a staff member's accumulated salary. This payment will be taxed as an eligible termination payment. The first significant payment of AFPAS estimated at $0.8m, will occur in 1991-92. I commend the Bill to the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-Yesterday I gave notice of a motion to appoint a select committee to be known as the Select Committee on Air Safety Issues Arising Out of the Pilots Dispute, seeking an inquiry into the implication for Australia's outstanding record of aviation safety of any changes to procedures or regulations introduced since the commencement of the pilots dispute and reports of mistakes or breaches of normal operational standards during the same period which could jeopardise the safety of air travellers, and that the Committee report to the Senate on or before 25 October 1989.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I should perhaps say that today has not been the best day for having discussions with the Australian Democrats. They seemed to be in a state of considerable perturbation all of yesterday and this morning following the matters which have been the subject of some 2 1/2 hours of debate in this chamber. This morning the Democrats indicated that they were not disposed to support this motion. I had a subsequent discussion with Senator Ray, who can of course speak for himself in this place, and he indicated that whilst the Government would oppose the motion if it were moved today, he was prepared to consider the possibility of an inquiry and would also ensure that the matter would be brought on for debate on Friday of this sitting week. I think that is a very sensible approach on behalf of the Government and I propose to have discussions with the Government about the inquiry. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like to make it clear that, after a period in which we have seen a good deal of stunting in the chamber for all sorts of good political reasons, the Opposition regards this as a very serious matter. It is quite clear that we have a very unusual set of airline services in Australia at the moment. There have been a series of reports, a number of which we have raised in the Senate and some of which we still await answers on, about problems of safety standards. We believe that it is an appropriate role for a Senate committee to simply examine whether the normal procedures that are laid down by the Government are being followed. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not wish to abuse the leave which has been given to me by the Senate, but I want to touch on the need for early reporting. The Opposition's concern is simply that the important time to ensure that safety standards are imposed is now. We do not see this as an academic exercise, but rather a severely practical exercise at a time when, as I say, the airline system is under very considerable stress. I will therefore take up the matter with Senator Ray and the Minister responsible and we can deal with the matter in substance on Friday morning. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-As Senator Chaney has alluded to, we have not had discussion around the chamber on this particular issue. The Government would not normally oppose an inquiry into air safety. My main concern is with the reporting date 21 days hence and thus whether that inquiry could be a real inquiry or not. I acknowledge two points made by Senator Chaney: firstly, that there are changed circumstances now; and, secondly, that maybe some of the more technical questions could not have been answered immediately at Question Time yesterday. I think we should have discussions between the various parties in the chamber and the responsible Minister to see whether we can set up a reasonable inquiry. There was opportunity, of course, at Estimates Committee B yesterday for this to be followed up.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Given that Senator Chaney has forgone his opportunity this morning I will not seek to block him on Friday. If he moves for the suspension of Standing Orders to bring this matter on, we will automatically accede because we do not want him to forgo his rights in this chamber. Let us see what turns up in the next two days. We will see whether we can organise some discussions to get agreement; if not, we will battle it out on Friday. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Madam Temporary Chairman, it is ridiculous, is it not, that we have about six minutes left before the break for lunch. I will try to start the arguments on our amendment No. 59. I remind the Committee that when we last met we had introduced that part of the argument which went to our general proposition, that this is an inappropriate clause in that it confuses the duties which properly lie with the Department with those duties which properly lie with the statutory authority. I am not going to repeat those arguments. The Committee has voted on that principle in the previous three amendments and we have lost each division. I will not go back over that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Clause 226 relates to two proposed amendments to the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act 1976. They are interesting and quite unusual proposals from the Government. The first is to alter the secrecy provisions that exist within that principal Act by amending section 23e. The second, subclause 226 (3), proposes a new section 64b relating to land council trust funds. The secrecy provisions are interesting. The principal Act contains at section 23e some provisions relating to secrecy. It identifies certain people as `an authorized person; a member of a Land Council; or a member of the staff of a Land Council' and then provides some protection against the unauthorised disclosure of material that those people may have learned. Section 23e then goes on further to create some exclusions from that particular duty. Section 23 e subsection (3) of the principal Act states:</PARA>
<PARA>Subsection (2) does not prevent the communication of information or the production of a document by a person authorized by a Land Council for the certain purpose-</PARA>
<PARA>. . . </PARA>
<PARA>to the Minister, to the Permanent Head of the Department . . . </PARA>
<PARA>And it is proposed now to add a new class of persons to whom those disclosures may be made. In other words, what is proposed here is that the secrecy provisions in the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act which confer protection are to be diminished slightly by the addition of a new class of person. I draw the attention of members of the Committee to page 87 of the Bill we are considering and the proposal to add after subsection (3) of section 23e of the principal Act a new paragraph (ba) to provide that certain senior officers or delegated officers of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission should fall within that class of persons to whom that part of the principal Act shall apply. </PARA>
<PARA> What is curious is that the effect of this amendment would be to put the Chief Executive Officer and the staff of ATSIC on a par with departmental officers. We have already argued that that is one more example of the confusion in the Government's mind between the proper role and function of a statutory authority like ATSIC and a department of state such as the Department of Aboriginal Affairs. But a curious anomaly appears to arise now if one looks at the principal Act and the amendment and tries to read them together. If section 23e (3) (ba)-I am sorry to use that convoluted language, but that is what we are talking about-is inserted as proposed what will be the position of the commissioners of ATSIC? They are not among the designated persons proposed to be added. If the elected commissioners are not to be authorised to receive confidential information they may not be able to be told of matters for which the Commission has a responsibility and about which the Commission has to make decisions. </PARA>
<PARA> I draw the attention of members of the Committee to clause 7 (h) of the Bill we are considering. We have already discussed this clause but members of the Committee will recall that that clause enables the commissioners to take action to protect Aboriginal heritage. How are they going to do that? If some of their officers acquire these new duties and responsibilities under the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act and obtain certain capacities to receive certain confidential information they cannot then pass it on to their own commissioners because the commissioners are not among the people designated to receive that information. If they do receive it I think from memory they are liable to a penalty of $2,000 and/or 12 months gaol. So it is a fairly substantial prohibition against the improper release of confidential information. How will the commissioners discharge their duty under clause 7 (h), that is the clause which enables them to protect Aboriginal heritage, when their own staff, apparently-as we read it-will not be able to tell them things communicated to them by the land councils?</PARA>
<PARA> Before we can consider this further and come to a vote we have to have that matter explained to us by the Minister and by the Department. Later I wish to talk about the proposal in relation to trust accounts and the Aboriginal Benefits Trust Account, which is a matter itself of some concern to members of the Committee, but I see the time and I therefore will try to come back to that later at a more appropriate time. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister for Consumer Affairs. I refer to last night's hearing of Estimates Committee B in which the Minister undertook to consider whether the Government would release a legal opinion obtained from the Attorney-General's Department as to the validity of a direction given to the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) by the Minister for Transport and Communications, Mr Willis. Will the Minister make the opinion available? Does he now concede that the proper processes for the waiver of fees under the Civil Aviation Act were not followed and that the direction is clearly beyond the Minister's power? Is it a fact that, despite the Prime Minister's public statement three weeks ago that the Government would waive landing and navigation fees otherwise payable by the airlines, it was not until 28 September last that the Minister issued the direction? Was this delay occasioned by the refusal of the CAA to accept any responsibility for waiving charges even though its Act specifically allows it to do so? Is it a fact that no direction at all has been given to the Federal Airports Corporation? In these circumstances, as the purported fee waivers are clearly invalid, will the Government immediately seek to recover the millions of dollars already outstanding?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Oh, Senator Newman, was it? Senator Newman had asked for it and Senator Alston, having done his tour of the Parliament that night, came in and also made inquiries about it. So we had a double-pronged question from the Opposition very late last night. Just before lunch today in running into Senator Alston I got a repeat request. I assured Senator Alston that we had been in touch with the Minister's office and that I was waiting for a response. That response has not come through, but as we said last night, we will try to get a response as soon as possible.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The second part of the question canvassed the legality or otherwise of the action taken, arising from the advice that the Opposition has requested. As was made clear last night by departmental officers, their understanding is that the Government has acted in accordance with the law. The interpretation of section 62 (2) of the relevant Act indicates that the Government has done so.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RF4">Senator COOK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I can say to Senator McKiernan that yes, it is true, and it is another example of the successful micro-economic reform engaged in by the Hawke Government. The September issue of the Agriculture and Resources Quarterly released by the Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics indicates that commodity exports are expected to grow strongly in 1989-90 by 9 per cent, to take our export earnings to $39.8 billion from commodity exports alone. That follows a 6 per cent increase in commodity export growth in 1988-89. Last year the growth obtained mainly because of increased prices. In the forecast period the growth will be because of a mixture of prices and greater volumes. Because greater volumes play a part it is clear that the efficiencies effected within the economy and within the mining sector, under this Government's policies, have contributed to the ability to win and expand those markets.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> For mineral exports, the forecast for growth is even better. It is forecast at 15 per cent for 1989-90 or $23.5 billion, compared with a 9 per cent growth in the previous year. If one looks at the particular commodities one can see that in coal we are expecting growth in total exports of 103.5 million tonnes, up from 99.3 million tonnes in 1988-89, or in earnings terms this year $5.5 billion instead of $4.6 billion last year. In aluminium and alumina we are expecting exports to increase by 4 per cent this year and to reach five million tonnes. In liquefied natural gas (LNG) we are expecting $360m in earnings in 1989-90, and for that to increase three times in the next few years. Indeed, at peak production Australia is expected to supply 12 per cent of the world's production in LNG. Nickel exports are forecast to rise slightly to $780m in 1989-90 from $770m last year. Iron ore exports are expected to rise from $1.8 billion last year to $2.2 billion this year, an increase of 23 per cent. In crude oil and condensate, production is expected to reach a record level of 560 million barrels a day this year, and additional production from the North West Shelf and the Timor Sea has the potential to more than offset marginal decline in Bass Strait production this year. In gold, exports are forecast to be worth $2.9 billion this year with total Australian production increasing by 13 per cent over the previous financial year.</PARA>

They do not like the information because they do not like to see a healthy forecast for the Australian economy in the next 12 months. We expect that gold exports will be Australia's fourth largest commodity group this year and account for 7 per cent of the total value of all commodity exports. On mineral sands, we expect a rise in production of 11 per cent to earn $591m in exports this year, copper exports to rise by 3 per cent and zinc exports to rise by 6 per cent. All in all, across the sector of mineral commodities we are looking at growth and increased earnings because of better prices being able to be negotiated and better volumes being able to be traded.

If one looks at today's announcement by Australian Airlines one sees that from 9 October it will be announcing regular schedules and offering additional flights. I am not able to say what that will represent in terms of seat capacity, but of course it will represent a substantial increase in seat capacity provided for Australian passengers.

<PARA>There is no doubt about it. She has called on the Federal Government to do so. The Federal Government will not do so; the Federal Government's response to child poverty, particularly to children in this area, has been to pursue an integrated strategy to provide assistance and opportunities for sole parents who are amongst, as I said, the most disadvantaged and the poorest groups in the community. We have done so not only in terms of financial assistance but also in terms of assistance through the jobs, education and training program Newstart and particularly the child support scheme, which Senator Crowley asked about. I raise the child support scheme because this scheme in particular is a radical reform which has led to a massive shift in the level of maintenance available to sole parents. What the child support scheme has meant is that both the custodial and non-custodial parent will have to bear full financial responsibility for their children. There has been an increase of 40 per cent in the numbers helped under this scheme compared to those helped under previous schemes. It has been a major assistance scheme for children living in sole parent families.</PARA>
<PARA> The scheme itself has been operating for some time now but because of the limitations of the Federal Constitution it can only apply to children of marriages. That of course was up to last Sunday, when all States but Queensland adopted stage 2 of the child support scheme and accordingly in all States but Queensland children of parents who have not been married are now covered by the child support scheme. What this in fact means is that Mrs Nelson not only wants children in these situations-as I said, the most disadvantaged groups in the community-to get no Federal benefit but also has denied them access to resources from the non-custodial parents. It is something that on this side of the Parliament we cannot agree with.</PARA>
<PARA> The reason why the Queensland Government has not adopted the child support scheme, stage 2, has been literally a lack and a failure of leadership. In the last 22 months there have been five Ministers for Family Services in Queensland and there have been five other Ministers with whom they have had to meet-Ministers for justice-to work out a common position. Not only have they not been able to meet each other to adopt a response to the child support scheme, stage 2, but they have not even prepared legislation to introduce in Parliament to that effect. Even if they had prepared that legislation the Queensland Parliament meets so briefly that it would not have had time to introduce it. So the short response is: this Federal Government--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am aware of the Wilderness Society's position on this. It does quite actively seek a ban on the imports of rainforest timber. The Prime Minister, I think, made the point in his environment statement in July that the preservation of tropical rainforests is, of course, given the countries involved, a complex one and obviously it is a very sensitive issue. It is not such a sensitive issue in Australia now, given that we have stopped rainforest logging in the wet tropics, by virtue of World Heritage listing. We have, of course, a national rainforest program now, involving an expenditure of $22m. We have allocated $1m for the Tropical Rainforest Institute in Cairns. Internationally it is much more complex and, while Australia has donated some $250,000 to a plan for a very large reserve in the Amazon Basin, there are some difficulties in looking at a ban.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We would need first to have all the information available. We would need to know what alternatives there are, particularly in the building industry, to the use of rainforest timbers. There are other types of timbers that could be used. There is some steel that could be used, et cetera. We would need to know what impacts would result from switching to them. So that we might obtain all of that information my Department has just let a consultancy to Coopers and Lybrand, acting with a company called Fortech. We hope that the results of that study will be available late this year or early next year. But certainly not until all the information was at hand would the Government consider any sort of ban, and I would not share the confidence that the gentleman to whom the honourable senator has referred has expressed.</PARA>

It is not an industry in which the losses would be easy to calculate because of the secondary effects, which are much harder to see than the more obvious. In some areas of Australia the effect on the tourism industry has been dramatic and in other areas it has been nowhere near as bad. So I would not attempt to place a figure on it; I have no idea. However, the Government is at the moment consulting with the industry to look at what it believes would be an appropriate figure for a recovery phase for the industry.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank Senator Foreman for his question. The question of the safety and wholesomeness of imported food is an issue which has been addressed by government for quite some time now. In fact, it also has been the subject of an inquiry by a working party for quite some time. Recently four Ministers-the Minister for Resources, Senator Cook, the Minister for Community Services and Health, Dr Blewett, and the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, Mr Kerin, and I-responded to the problem with a comprehensive overview of the situation which addresses the sorts of problems that exist now and tried to lay down a program for future action in this area.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> A whole host of problems have arisen in this area. I must say that a small proportion-not a major proportion-of imported food poses a serious health risk and problems in this area have arisen from products as diverse as Peter's Drumsticks to Kraft beefsteak and vegies. In terms of contamination, some of the problems have been listeria, glass fragments, salmonella and so on. So, as I said, there has been a significant risk from a small proportion of imported food.</PARA>
<PARA> The Government found that the currently operating arrangements were not adequate to ensure either the safety or the wholesomeness of imported food and it also felt that they do not provide an adequate level of protection to consumers. At present, only a small number of high risk foods are systematically checked at the point of entry and, as for the rest, there are random checks at the point of sale by either State or local officials. We have judged that this sort of response has been inadequate to address the problem. In terms of new arrangements, the Government has been concerned to get in place a uniform and effective program based on full recovery which could also act as a deterrent to importers, make sure that they play the game by the rules and ensure that all food sold in Australia complies with Australian food standard regulations.</PARA>
<PARA> We have also been keen to ensure that we have not deviated from trade obligations and our proposal puts us very much in line with what operates in New Zealand, the United States of America, Canada and the United Kingdom. Under the new arrangements, an imported food risk advisory committee with representation from government departments, scientists, industries, importers and consumers will classify imported food for testing. There will also be further discussions with exporters and importers in the States. The new system will apply to both processed and unprocessed food and products will be classified as high, medium or low public risk. Obviously, those of high risk will be subject to inspections on arrival in Australia. As for the others, there will be systematic checking as is necessary. The Government believes that our response in this area, for the first time, presents Australian consumers with a comprehensive and uniform response to an area which has been of concern to quite a number of people in the community. Uniformity across the country will ensure that importers, manufacturers and others have only one set of laws with which to comply.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The implication is there in the interjection which Senator Crichton-Browne has just made. There have of course been a great deal of uninformed comments on the arrangements that have been made by the Civil Aviation Authority and these allegations are, in a sense, part of a concerted campaign to destabilise public confidence in an attempt by the airlines to provide the necessary services. If that occurs there is a danger that the efforts of the airlines to rebuild their services will be undermined. I want to make the point that through various public announcements the Government has bent over backwards, including releases from the Minister for Telecommunications and Aviation Support, Ros Kelly, and the Civil Aviation Authority itself, to assure the public that the Civil Aviation Authority will not authorise any operation in Australia unless it is completely satisfied about the safety of that operation. The head safety regulator, Mr Colin Freeland, held a press conference for 45 minutes in Parliament House recently. It was publicly advertised and, unfortunately, this did not get the degree of attention which one might have expected from the Opposition or, for that matter, from the media. The CAA is fully available to any quarter wanting information regarding safety aspects of current arrangements. If there are legitimate concerns I suggest that people seek briefings from the CAA on them. As far as I am aware there has not been one contact from the Opposition to the CAA on any of these issues. Senator MacGibbon's question comes up in the context of saying five or seven examiners have resigned from the CAA recently. I do not know what that means in terms of the overall composition of the work force of the CAA. I will endeavour to find out for the honourable senator just what percentage of the total examiner complement of the CAA that represents.

However, I will pass the honourable senator's request on and if the Minister has anything to add to what I have said I will let him know.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I was not aware of such rumours circulating in the business community. I can certainly assure the Senate and the business community that there is absolutely no truth in these rumours. The Government is well satisfied with the way the affirmative action legislation is operating at the moment and, according to the latest figures we have, over 95 per cent of the 484 employers required to report in this round have done so. As I have said in this place before and as the Minister for Industrial Relations, Mr Peter Morris, has also indicated, the affirmative action legislation is working and working well. It is gaining acceptance from the business community and we welcome this. Far from suggesting that there should be penalties or any change in the legislation, I am pleased to inform the Senate that on 11 September Mr Morris, speaking at the launch of Portfolio magazine's Affirmative Action Awards, which have been introduced to provide some recognition of the excellent work that the business sector is doing in implementing affirmative action, said:</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is addressed to the Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="UI4">Senator ROBERT RAY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is not the practice of the Australian Government actively to recruit a specific set of refugees. Certainly, all people who come to this country as refugees have their claims tested individually-not en masse, not as a class, not as a region, but individually. Quite clearly, some of those people who have left East Germany, as I have seen in the media interviews, have expressed an interest in coming to Australia. If they qualify as refugees under the United Nations definition of 1951 and the 1967 protocols they will be eligible to come to Australia. Our overall program this year is to take in 12,500 refugees with a 1,500 contingency reserve, which I point out is the highest per capita intake of any Western country. For instance, the United States of America will take 125,000 refugees only in this financial year. Those people coming from East Germany probably fall into two categories: those who wish to apply for refugee status and those who wish to come to Australia under the normal migration program, who again will be treated in a non-discriminatory way.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> To some extent the East Germans are in a slightly separate category because they have a safe guaranteed country. There are many refugees around the world who do not have that, especially in our own region, and we might initially be more sympathetic to them. Again, there is no bar on it, but the Federal Republic of Germany has guaranteed every East German citizen safe abode in that country. It has offered them citizenship and it has offered them jobs. We are not debarring anyone from East Germany. We take approximately 2,000 refugees a year from eastern Europe. The predominant group so far in the last few years has been from the Soviet Union and from Poland; most of those from Poland are eventually processed out of Italy.</PARA>

I thank the Minister for that, but I ask him: Is the Australian Government doing anything to facilitate their applications administratively in the way that it has facilitated applications from other areas of the world? What security, health and police clearance arrangements would be available to ensure that such refugees were genuine, and to what extent would we be required to depend on East German authorities for such clearances?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="UI4">Senator ROBERT RAY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As usual, Mr President, the supplementary question contains far more meat than the preliminary question. Senator Michael Baume asked whether we will apply a special program to East Germans. No, we will not. The situation in East Germany is not analogous to that in Sri Lanka or the Lebanon; quite clearly it is not. As for the necessary checks, the honourable senator has put his finger on precisely why we treat each claim individually. It is not possible to do security checks; I am hardly likely to write to Mr Honecker and ask for a security clearance for any of the people who have gone to the Federal Republic. Of course, health checks are done. Where people cannot meet the health requirements, we try to remedy that before they come to Australia. We do not just wipe off refugees directly. The necessary checks will be done.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I think the last implication made was that there could be a few bogus refugees who could later be involved in other activities. If any such people are discovered, of course they will not be given passage to Australia. Indeed, I do not think they would last very long in the Federal Republic. Of course, the discovery of such people is not an easy task, as successive West German governments have found.</PARA>

These figures are 18 months old and the one exception is Perth, although I understand that is on the borderline now.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Please be quiet. Some elements of this question go well beyond the purview of the portfolio of housing and aged care because the honourable senator has asked for information that clearly is not information to which I have access. I will inquire of the Minister or the relevant Ministers and, to the extent that I am able to, will obtain an answer. The first question referred to home loan affordability. A report recently put out by the Real Estate Institute of Australia refers to the June quarter 1989 data. It should be said that the Government recognises that data and that there has been some deterioration in home ownership affordability for recent and potential first home buyers due to higher interest rates and higher housing prices. While interest rates do impact on access to home ownership and its affordability, the best action that the Government can take is to ensure that the overall health of the economy is right.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As we are all well aware, house prices appear to have stabilised in the past six months with median prices plateauing in most major centres. Our preliminary data for the September quarter 1989 show that house prices in outer suburban areas of Sydney have stabilised over the last 12 months at about $110,000 for all home buyers and around $100,000 for first home buyers. The Real Estate Institute of Australia's data refers to established house prices paid by all home buyers. The fact is that housing costs faced by first home buyers are lower because first home buyers purchase less expensive properties. I cannot give a breakdown on the affordability of home purchase in capital cities other than Sydney, but I will take that on board with the other elements of the question and answer it in due course.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yesterday Senator Knowles asked me a question about French pilots in Western Australia-six French pilots flying British Aerospace 146 aircraft. I provide her with the following information: French pilots are licensed by the French Aviation Regulatory Authority. The Australian Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) has validated their licences for use in Australia pending issue of Australian equivalent licences. This process has involved a close examination of their qualifications and experience in consultation with the French authorities. Such validations are a common practice by aviation authorities around the world in recognition of the international nature of the industry. The validation process includes an examination in Australian air legislation. Some of the pilots failed this test on their first attempt and were permitted to resit that examination after 48 hours.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> For administrative convenience the CAA usually allows the pilots 14 days between examination and the resitting of it to refresh their knowledge at leisure. In the present circumstances where the pilots were able to study immediately full time they were permitted to resit after a shorter interval. This in no way compromised safety. The CAA normally requires airline pilots flying in particular jet aircraft for the first time outside controlled air space to fly 50 hours in command under supervision on the particular routes. However, this can be varied where it is considered that other factors which contribute to safety are present. These can include extensive experience in operations and/or extensive experience on the aircraft type in use. The French pilots are very experienced on the BAe146 and they have all demonstrated their competence on the routes in Western Australia.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 3 October Senator MacGibbon asked me a question about an alleged incident relating to air traffic control in Sydney and a French registered Air Maritime Boeing 737. On Thursday, 28 September, at about 11 p.m., a Boeing 737 aircraft operated by Air Maritime departed Sydney for Melbourne. The aircraft had been cleared by air traffic control to fly a standard instrument departure via Wollongong, thence to Melbourne by its planned flight route. The aircraft had planned to fly from Wollongong via Shelley, to Corryong and thence to Melbourne. The aircraft was under radar surveillance by Sydney air traffic control throughout its departure. When the aircraft passed over Wollongong and turned to track to Shelley the air traffic controller, noticing this turn, suggested to the captain that, as the more usual procedure did not involve passage via Shelley, he might wish to follow the normal direct route from Wollongong to Corryong.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This suggested change, together with some communications difficulties, caused some uncertainty and misunderstanding between the aircraft and air traffic control for a period. This, however, was resolved quickly and the aircraft proceeded on its planned route via Shelleys to Melbourne. The aircraft was under radar surveillance at all times. There was no other air traffic in the vicinity. There was no breakdown in separation and Sydney air traffic control judged that the circumstances did not warrant the raising of a formal incident report. The Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) regards this occurrence as being of a relatively minor nature and that the resolution was routine and well within the capacity of the air traffic control facilities available. The operator has been reminded of the normal practices associated with a standard instrument departure out of Sydney via Wollongong. Apart from routine operational surveillance activity, the CAA does not propose any further action with regard to this occurrence. There was no error on the part of the Air Maritime crew, as has been suggested by Senator MacGibbon.</PARA>
<PARA> A further disturbing element is Senator MacGibbon's deliberate attempt to create a picture of an imminent mid-air collision between two commercial airliners, with great loss of life. This is yet another clear example of the despicable scaremongering that is being driven by the Opposition at the behest of the Australian Federation of Air Pilots.</PARA>

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the answer given by the Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce (Senator Button) in response to a Question without Notice asked by Senator MacGibbon on 3 October 1989, relating to an alleged breach of aviation standards involving on Air Maritime Boeing 737 with French pilots operating a scheduled Sydney to Melbourne air service. </PARA>
<PARA>I wish to speak briefly to reject the pathetic but all too typical response we have had from Senator Button who indulges in personal abuse of anyone who challenges him in any way. Mr President, yesterday, following his incapacity to answer any questions in the Senate, Estimates Committee B was given a table which tells us of the state of Australian air traffic. We were told by the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) that we have 50 per cent capacity. Senator Button corrected that last Friday and admitted that that was incorrect. What we have, of course, is what we have described as a cobbled together set of air services. The Royal Australian Air Force and the Navy are carrying 14 per cent of traffic; 32 per cent is being carried in leased aircraft; 29 per cent, or less than a third, is being carried in aircraft which normally service this sector; and 6 per cent is being carried by commuter operators, 8 per cent by Qantas Airways Ltd and 11 per cent by foreign carriers. </PARA>
<PARA> The simple fact of the matter is that the whole airline system is operating under considerable stress. There is no question about that; no question at all. And in the course of what has been an extraordinarily drawn-out dispute, there have been significant allegations of variations of procedures as well as allegations about incidents. One of our own senators was taken on a charter flight under circumstances which certainly, I would suggest, show that systems are being stretched beyond their capacity. I think, in those circumstances, it is pathetic and absurd to suggest that the matter of safety is not of vital concern. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister, who is making accusations of scaremongering, actually has to face up to the fact that there is not much point in worrying about deficiencies after there is an accident. The simple truth of the matter is that we have a system under stress. There have been reports of accidents-and some of those reports may be seeded by airline pilots who are not employed and who have a vested interest in putting pressure on the Government. I am not sure about that, Mr President; it would not be surprising if that happened. But the fact of the matter is there are also unchallenged, verified cases of normal procedures not being followed. When a fully laden passenger aircraft does not follow the normal procedures, turns in the wrong direction and has to be corrected by the airport control, then clearly there is a risk. When foreign-speaking pilots are involved, clearly there is some additional element of risk. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr President, all that I wish to say is that I think the Opposition has put forward a very sensible way of ensuring that the Parliament can check the substance of this matter. Tomorrow I will be discussing with the Minister what form of parliamentary inquiry might be undertaken, if any parliamentary inquiry is undertaken. I simply want to say that the Minister's pique in having these matters raised with him and being challenged is pathetic. The Opposition will not be cowed or blackmailed out of raising matters of public interest by the bad temper of this Minister. I seek leave to continue my remarks later. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr President, the current airline pilots dispute is one of the most serious disputes to affect this country in a long time. Not only is it serious in terms of the national economy, but also it has its most serious impact in the devastating effect which it brings to the lives and to the economic welfare of thousands of small Australian businesses and to individual Australians throughout the country. It has a devastating impact upon the operators of small businesses in the tourist industry, people who happen to be bus drivers, people who are taxi drivers, people who are restaurateurs, people who are shop owners, and they are demanding to know why the Prime Minister of this country will not take the steps available to him to solve this dispute.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I say to the Senate chamber this afternoon that that is because the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) is simply no longer interested in governing on behalf of all Australians and paying attention to the welfare of all Australians-he has, in fact, an entirely different agenda; an agenda which is based upon looking after his mates of a variety of descriptions-and his complete failure to govern, as I said, on behalf of all Australians. The capacity of the Prime Minister to bring an end to this dispute is without doubt. The Opposition has put forward on a number of occasions a series of suggestions about how this should be achieved. On 18 September the Leader of the Opposition, Mr Peacock, released a statement outlining a nine-point plan in which he clearly outlined the steps that could be taken in this regard. In part, that statement read:</PARA>
<PARA> We have never supported their stand-and-deliver demand-</PARA>
<PARA>that is, the airline pilots-</PARA>
<PARA>for a 30 per cent rise not based on productivity improvement. </PARA>
<PARA>That quite clearly gives the lie to the accusations made today by Senator Button and others in that regard. On 29 September Mr Peacock wrote to the Prime Minister and indicated to him the capacity that he, the Prime Minister, had to bring about a resolution of this dispute. In his letter Mr Peacock said:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . enormous damage has been done to the tourist industry and to the thousands of individuals and firms involved in that industry. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition has never advocated surrender to the AFAP's wage demands as a means of resolving the dispute. </PARA>
<PARA>He put it to the Prime Minister quite clearly that the Prime Minister's capacity as, in effect, the owner of Australian Airlines to direct that airline to enter into negotiations with the Australian Federation of Air Pilots to test its bona fides was a device available to the Prime Minister to bring a resolution to this dispute which the Prime Minister manifestly refuses to take up. What the Government has done throughout this dispute is to introduce nothing more than a series of abusive comments about the Air Pilots Federation, about individuals, about the Opposition, to tie them up in a whole series of untruths. Let me give the Senate one simple example of that: the claim made by the Prime Minister that airline pilots work only an eight-hour week or 30 hours a month and that because new contracts are being offered which provide for 55 hours a month to be worked, they represent some enormous productivity gain in terms of an extra 25 hours work per month. The truth is, of course, that the pilots, by and large, fly up to 75 hours a month and that the figure which has been derived-eight hours a week, 30 hours a month-is arrived at by the disingenuous method of taking all pilots who are flying, plus all of the management pilots, plus all of the administrative people, plus all of the people in training, plus all of the people on leave, and all of the people on standby who qualify as pilots, dividing that figure into the total hours flown and making some comparative judgment as far as that is concerned. </PARA>
<PARA> I say to you, Mr Acting Deputy President, that there has been a failure to settle this pilots dispute because the Prime Minister is interested only in making a series of sectional deals and sectional arrangements. He is far more interested in making sure that he protects the precious accord with the Australian Council of Trade Unions (ACTU), the arrangement upon which the personal future and the power base of his mates in the union movement depend, and on doing deals with his mates in the airline industry who want help from this Government at public expense to restructure their operations prior to the deregulation of the airline industry. As Mr John Halfpenny said in the Canberra Times, the current debate over air travel, for example, was less about deregulation and more about `Abelising' the Australian airline industry. The first claims are already in from Ansett Airlines of Australia for compensation of $701,035. That is the first claim on the public purse which has already been put in by Ansett. The Federal Airports Corporation is being told to waive charges. It reads about those details in the newspapers because it has not been properly directed and properly told by the Government what it is supposed to do. </PARA>
<PARA> We have seen the behaviour of Sir Peter Abeles in this dispute. When Australian Airlines was prepared to accept a chartering rate for Royal Australian Air Force Boeing 707 jets of $4,000 per hour, Ansett objected and, under pressure, the Air Force ended up accepting a rate of only $1,500 an hour-another one of the deals done with mates along the way. It is the protection of its union mates and the accord and the protection of Sir Peter Abeles and the other mates, which we will come to, which is driving the policy initiative of this Government. </PARA>
<PARA> What is that accord all about-this sort of Magna Carta of industrial mediocrity? That accord is akin to the Munich Pact of economic policy. It was negotiated between the ACTU, which at that stage undoubtedly was telling the Prime Minister that it had no further territorial demands to make on the Australian economy, and the Prime Minister, playing the role of Neville Chamberlain-weak, vacillating, compromising, `peace in our time'. It was a piece of paper with a signature on it. Like the Czechs back at the time of the Munich Pact, the only people not invited around the table were the taxpayers, the wage earners, the people of Australia whose interests were being sacrificed in this sleazy deal. We have now seen the claims by and the consequential payout to Sir Peter Abeles. </PARA>
<PARA> But where are the payments to the people who are really hurting? Where are the payments to the tourist operators, to the people being stood down, to the people being sent to the wall? Where are the payments to the restaurateurs who are 25 per cent down in their business? The reason they are not being paid is that they are not powerful enough. After all, we have Mr Keating telling everybody that the tourism industry is overstating its case about how difficult things are. How did Mr Keating know all of this, particularly things about accommodation in hotels. An article in the Daily Telegraph on 22 September states:</PARA>
<PARA> He-</PARA>
<PARA>that is, Mr Keating-</PARA>
<PARA>also said a Sydney hotel he stayed in last week had an 83 per cent occupancy rate. </PARA>
<PARA>Well, unless he is back into his travelling allowance rackets, there must be a pretty good explanation of why a person whose electorate is in Sydney and whose home is supposed to be in Elizabeth Bay has to stay in Sydney hotels in order to make these observations. What this country is getting progressively more fed up with is the selective deals that this Government does with its mates around the place. Max Walsh reminded us in the Sydney Morning Herald of a couple of days ago about the deal that has now been done with the banks. He said in part:</PARA>
<PARA> There are echoes of the meeting Mr Keating had with media barons Mr Rupert Murdoch and Mr Kerry Packer in 1986 before the announcement of the Government's changed media laws. </PARA>
<PARA> These changes were to prove very valuable to Mr Murdoch and Mr Packer, providing them with windfall profits of $1 billion for their television interests. </PARA>
<PARA>We have people around the place who cannot get funding for welfare, who cannot get funding for needed social security payments. But when Mr Alan Bond was a mate the Prime Minister could find $30m for the defence of the America's Cup so that he and his mates could get out there, slosh themselves around in champagne and denounce as bums anybody who would not take a public holiday in support of that particular mate. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn to the Kodak deal which is under way at the moment. We see from the article of Paul Lyneham the other day that Senator Button has misgivings about this Kodak deal. In the context of this pilots dispute, Senator Button has been in here every day, like that other famous Pilate, Pontius, washing his hands of all of the Government's economic decisions-of the Kodak decision, of all the payments that are being made in that regard. </PARA>
<PARA> Next there is the deal that is being done with the banks, not on behalf of the people who are more disadvantaged; they are more likely to get their housing loans from the building societies whose interests rates have already gone up as part of this particular deal. At the end of the article by Max Walsh which I referred to earlier, he says:</PARA>
<PARA> In economic terms, the deal stinks. </PARA>
<PARA>In political terms it is also on the nose. After all, the Government is giving an additional $200m to banks at the very same time that we read that the Commonwealth Bank's profits have risen from $273m to $475m a year. That shows how much the banks are in need of another $200m. We have seen the whole of the deals being done with the ACTU-the jobs for the boys; the fact that Mr Kelty supplements his income by between 30 and 50 per cent because of all of the boards and statutory authorities that this Government puts him on and pays him to be on. We have seen the capacity of the ACTU to dictate tax policy in this country; to take the Prime Minister into a hotel room and beat him up to make sure that option C does not get up as part of the tax package. The reason that we do not have the sanctions capacity in industrial relations legislation to deal with the pilots dispute is that the ACTU vetoed it a couple of years ago when Mr Willis was bold enough to suggest that there was some particular reason for it. </PARA>
<PARA> The whole business of sectionalism which runs through the Government is seen even in something that Senator Collins is immediately interested in-Coronation Hill. It finds a small group in the community-on this occasion the Aboriginal people-and makes it the catspaw, the tool, in order to try to set at nought the greater national interest which is involved in making a proper and rational decision. In typical fashion, this Government is prepared to play the sectional issues and it will play the Aboriginal people as the last card in the pack. It is prepared to fight to the last drop of Aboriginal blood over the question of Coronation Hill. All of the Government's mates are looked after. Senator Evans is off in New York at the moment campaigning to be President of the General Assembly. He ought to remember that that was the job given to a previous Labor Foreign Minister, Dr Evatt, before he went completely insane. Nevertheless the Australian Labor Party is prepared to look after its mates. It sent Burke to Ireland, Whitlam to the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation, Morrison to Indonesia, Jenkins to Spain, Grimes to the Netherlands, Johnson to New Zealand, McClelland to Great Britain, Chris Hurford to New York-and there is even hope for Senator Collins if he plays his cards right. </PARA>
<PARA> We see the continuing manifest failure of this Government to act on the issues that are really important. Simply by redefining, by a statistical exercise, the Government says that there is no child poverty left in this country. If any of the Ministers like to get out of their dinner suits and cigar smoking, brandy swilling clubs and come round the streets of Sydney they can be shown what child poverty is really all about. We were told about the number of planes that would be flying. There is nowhere near the number of planes, nowhere near the seat capacity that was promised. The Prime Minister told us in August of this year:</PARA>
<PARA>I assert that before the end of the financial year interest rates will move down. </PARA>
<PARA>What are they doing? They are moving up. The large bulk of people in this country are having to pay. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the enduring features of the Hawke Labor Government will be that it will in fact rewrite the Australian political lexicon. It will turn the term `mate' from a term of honour to one redolent with sleaze. As Paul Kelly said in his article in March of last year:</PARA>
<PARA> The rorts perpetrated by the Labor Party's ``mates system are now an open joke matched only by the utter contempt displayed by the Hawke Government and its instrumentalities as it merrily despatches life rafts from the sinking ship. </PARA>
<PARA>What do we see in today's paper? We see in today's paper the record of achievement of the Hawke socialist Government under the heading: `Australia in the 80s: unequal, uncaring'. It states:</PARA>
<PARA> The richest 20 per cent of the population is coming closer to earning half of Australia's wealth, and most of its increased income is at the expense of the middle 20 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA>. . . . </PARA>
<PARA> An inequitable distribution of wealth compared with West Germany and the US . . . Canada, New Zealand and even Great Britain</PARA>
<PARA>That is the legacy of the Hawke socialist Government; the government of the mates, by the mates, for the mates; a government which is in the business of redistribution from the poor and needy to the fat and greedy, and that in fact is the hallmark of this Government. </PARA>
<PARA> It would not surprise me that, if Sir Peter Abeles and Mr Hawke were blown up in the same aeroplane, when they got up to the pearly gates and were asked to fill in the form as to their occupation prior to entry, Mr Hawke would simply write on his form `Prime Minister' and Sir Peter Abeles would write on his form `ventriloquist'. It is about time that this Government clearly understood what it is doing and what it is failing to do. It is, above all, failing to take into account the broad national interest in the decisions which it is capable of making. It is clearly there in the business of simply governing for its sectional mates, whether they happen to be in the ACTU and its power structures or in particular lobby groups-the conservation movement, the land rights movement or whatever, whether it happens to be in the board rooms and the clubs which this Prime Minister and his cronies frequent around the place; whether it happens to be in looking after Sir Peter Abeles or Mr Harris or appointing their friends to statutory corporations; or whether it happens to be in getting a handle on the Reserve Bank by making sure that the independence of the Reserve Bank, something which has been cherished as part of the financial arrangements of this country, is progressively compromised. </PARA>
<PARA> This Government is simply not in the business of governing Australia on behalf of all Australians. It has had the capacity in the course of this pilots dispute to do just that, to say, `Very well; we will take the broad national interest into account. We will direct Australian Airlines to enter into negotiations and to test the bona fides of the pilots in their claims that they would go back to work, improve productivity and get the aeroplanes flying again'. It has had the capacity not simply to provide assistance to Sir Peter Abeles and its mates in the airline business but to provide support and assistance for small businesses, for the people who do not have resort to the sums of money, the capacity to borrow and the sorts of credit arrangements which the large operators have. But no, it is simply not interested in those people. It is not interested in the general welfare of the people of Australia because it has become so used to governing simply in the interests of its mates, its friends, its supporters, its sectional interests, that it has entirely forgotten its primary obligation, which is to govern in the interests of all Australians. I say in conclusion that the real hallmark of all of this is that Robert Hawke is simply too small a man to occupy the office of Prime Minister. </PARA>

The problem for the Opposition and the Air Pilots Federation is that this Government is governing for all Australians. That is precisely why it is handling this dispute the way it is. It is not coming in here day after day and protecting the selfish interests of a tiny group of 1,600 Australians, which is precisely what the Opposition is doing. Of course, one of the chief champions of the Air Pilots Federation is Senator MacGibbon. Yesterday Senator MacGibbon engaged in a piece of disgraceful scaremongering.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Acting Deputy President, before I was so rudely interrupted I was saying that I have in fact personally been involved in many incidents such as the one that Senator MacGibbon described yesterday. It is totally legitimate to raise questions of air safety in this Parliament. It is totally legitimate in the course of this current airline pilots dispute to raise the pressures that are being placed on airlines and air traffic control and the potential for loss of life. It is tragic to see what is being inflicted on this country at the moment by the airline pilots. If one wants to talk about blood on one's hands, if one wants to talk about accidents, one could probably ascribe at least some of the deaths on our roads-in fact, one in particular, I regret to say-to the airline pilots dispute. One could chase that particular rabbit a long way by talking about individual car accidents involving people who normally would have travelled by air. But it is not excusable, it is not reasonable, for any honourable senator to come in here, ignore the facts of an incident and say that there was a chance of an imminent mid-air collision between two jet aircraft over schools in the main city of Sydney when the facts demonstrate that that incident did not even come close to the description that was given to it by Senator MacGibbon. But we should not be surprised at that kind of behaviour by Senator MacGibbon.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator MacGibbon came into this House last week and waved a contract around. He said, `Here is proof positive that what the Federation has been saying has been absolutely right all along. The airlines are offering a 40 per cent boost to the conditions that are being offered to airline pilots'. In other words, this is disgraceful. He said that they would be getting a `15 per cent better deal than they are getting now'. The trouble is that the Australian Federation of Air Pilots has not only led every one of its members up a blind alley with nowhere to go; it has successfully led the Opposition up the same blind alley because every time the Opposition sticks its neck out on behalf of the Federation, the Federation pulls the rug out from under it. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator MacGibbon tabled this contract-which he could not have read-in the Senate, when I invited him to do so, as proof that it offered a 40 per cent boost in current conditions. The reality is that it does nothing of the sort. I do not know which member of the Federation gave Senator MacGibbon this contract. I was interested to see the handwritten margin note--</PARA>

You can go into the Senate and tell them that this offers us a 40 per cent better deal'. Both the Opposition and the Federation of Air Pilots ran that argument all last week. The truth is that this contract requires an increase from an average number of flying hours of 31 1/2--</PARA></TALK.START>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="OF4">Senator COLLINS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This is an average. This would increase to 55 hours a month for a 3 per cent increase in salary, with a further increase of 3 per cent. So it is a 6 per cent pay rise on 1 April 1990. If honourable senators wanted some further demonstration of the fact that this contract does not accord with the lies that the Federation of Air Pilots has been telling about it, picked up without question and run by the Opposition, I refer them to the national news on Monday morning. The Federation has been running for a fortnight, with its mates in the Opposition quite happy to come in here mindlessly believing whatever they are told by the Federation, saying, `40 per cent increase'. On Monday morning Brian `the Sphinx' McCarthy said on the national news that these contracts were a disgrace and pilots should not sign them because they `took pilots back to the conditions that existed 30 years ago'. That is simply symptomatic of the schizophrenic, amateurish, juvenile way in which the Pilots Federation leadership has been handling this dispute. As I said before, every time the Opposition sticks its neck out on behalf of the Federation, the Federation pulls the rug out from under it. I do not know whether honourable senators heard the Federation's comments on this same contract on Monday morning, but they should refer to them.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Of course, the Federation was correct in one respect. What I suspect it was referring to was the changed conditions of service that are provided for in this contract. I will canvass some of the history of the industrial negotiations of this Federation over the last 30 years. What it is clearly referring to is the removal of the seniority and bidding system for routes, which is not in this contract. In fact, I note further-and I did make a general reference last week to the interesting changes in conditions after Senator MacGibbon so helpfully tabled this document in support of his argument; in fact, it destroyed his argument-the stand down time provisions allowed in this contract. The reason they are interesting is that the Federation, in the circular that was issued by it in October last year to its members, extolling the fact, in a three-page detailed breakdown of their award, that they were the best paid and best looked after group of pilots in the world, mentioned specifically the stand-down provisions provided in the United States of America. It said to its members, quite accurately, `We have a bidding system similar to that in North America. That is where it came from, but we have a better bidding system than they have because they have stand-down provisions so that when the planes are not flying for any reason, they do not get paid. We don't have that provision here; we are the best looked after and best paid pilots in the world'. </PARA>
<PARA> The reason that I mention that is to nail down the huge hole in the Opposition's arguments. It has an unbelievably simple-minded, fantasyland approach to industrial relations which it has been running in the House of Representatives today as well as in here. I listened to the debate in the House of Representatives. Some Opposition nonentity there-I do not know who it was-was debating the resolution of the pilots dispute-</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="OF4">Senator COLLINS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It was probably Andrew Peacock. He extracted bits and pieces from the nine-point plan of the Opposition. This is what an Opposition member said in the House of Representatives today: `If the Parliament supports this resolution the Parliament can resolve the airline pilots dispute, and this is how it is going to be done'. The honourable member said, in effect, `Let's negotiate now and we'll have the planes back in the air in a few days'. He went on to say, `If the pilots and the airlines simply sit down and sign a contract, this dispute will be over'.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Let us look at the facts. The current dispute was not caused by this Government and it was not caused by the central wage fixing system. It was caused by the Air Pilots Federation, under the same kind of collective bargaining arrangements that the Opposition would like to see introduced, going to its employers in the same way that it has done for 30 years, pointing a gun at the head of Ansett Airlines of Australia and Australian Airlines and saying, `Stand and deliver 30 per cent on top of the best wages and working conditions and lowest productivity in the world'. For one of the few times in the 30 years since 1959, the airlines stood up to the Federation. Why did they stand up to it? I think Senator Puplick mentioned one particularly crucial aspect of this debate that is correct: this has a lot to do with deregulation. There is no question about it. The reason that the Air Pilots Federation has tried this on to the extent that it has is that this is the last big pay grab by the Federation before deregulation. It was this Government that had the courage to terminate the two airlines agreement, despite the fact that the Opposition talked about doing it for years and did nothing about it, and there will be a whole new ball game in Australian aviation when in 12 months time that deregulation regime starts. </PARA>
<PARA> The Air Pilots Federation has a modus operandi, which has done very well for it since 1959, of using the two-airline agreement to its great advantage. It points a gun at Ansett and it immediately caves in. TAA, or Australian Airlines as it is now, then has to pick it up. What it did in the past was quite simple: it paid the extortionate demands of the airline pilots and immediately passed those costs on to ordinary Australians by increasing air fares. That is exactly how it operated. That is still the crux of this dispute. </PARA>
<PARA> In terms of the Federation's hypocrisy and how we can deal with the Federation and test its bona fides, it has been running full-page advertisements saying, `We will negotiate on anything-wages and conditions of service'. Within 24 hours of those advertisements appearing McCarthy has been back on the airwaves saying, `twenty-nine per cent and not a cent less'. He has not varied that in eight weeks. In the past such techniques have worked. The only difference between this dispute and all those that have occurred since 1959 is that for the first time the Federation has had the airlines stand up to it and say no. The cause of the dispute is collective bargaining. How do we fix a dispute simply by sitting down with an employer and signing a contract? That is what the Opposition has said will fix this dispute. There is the contract. The employers are offering it to the pilots, but the pilots refuse to sign it. </PARA>
<PARA> Where do the Opposition and the Federation go from here? That is the real crux of this dispute. The fact is that the wages policy implemented by the Government has brought enormous productivity gains to this country. It has in fact created-it is not rhetoric; it is cold, hard fact-1 1/2 million jobs in the life of this Government. That is not something that can be simply dismissed and put aside as of no account. There have been great benefits to this community. But again I stress that the central wage fixing system, in terms of the beginnings of this dispute and the perpetuation of it, has nothing to do with what is going on currently. What is going on currently is that a bunch of blackmailers are putting the same gun to the head of their employers as they have done since 1959 and for the first time the employers are refusing to give in because, as one of them said only recently, `The trouble with continually giving in to blackmail is that the blackmailers keep coming back and doing it again'. That is a fact. </PARA>
<PARA> Nothing that the Opposition has put forward in this debate today, or on the previous five occasions that it has brought such a matter in here, with its simple-minded nonsense, will go anywhere to solving this dispute. I regret to say that the only way the dispute will be solved is if the Federation pilots-after the Commission brings down its findings this week on whether this contract fits in the wage fixing system, and on my examination of it I believe it will, and perhaps it will use it as the basis for the award-sit down with their employers, as the Opposition wants them to do, and sign the contracts. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;To begin with I take up the words with which Senator Collins has just closed his extraordinary speech. Senator Collins concluded by holding out yet another illusion in the same vein as that which the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) has been tapping so vigorously ever since this dispute began. According to Senator Collins, the solution to this dispute is to be found in the determination to be brought down, he suggests or hopes, by Mr Justice Maddern of the Industrial Relations Commission (IRC), the body that used to be called the Australian Conciliation and Arbitration Commission. Recently it was renamed the IRC. That is a very appropriate set of initials because it also stands for the industrial relations club to which Mr Justice Maddern belongs. I almost choke on the word `justice' because the gentleman in question is not a judge, although he may have been given that status. Clearly he is not a judge because, in fact, this Government sacked another man in a similar jurisdiction-Mr Justice Staples-even though he enjoyed the same title. Nevertheless, according to Senator Collins, Mr Justice Maddern is about to bring down a determination which will probably turn these contracts into an award and, on that basis, hey presto, this whole terrible, tragic dispute will be solved!-if only in the light of that the pilots can be brought to see the error of their ways and can be brought to bend the knee to the Prime Minister who, as our matter of public importance says, quite rightly, has ceased to govern on behalf of all Australians. If time permits I will come back to that fantasy with which Senator Collins concluded his remarks.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Before turning to my own prepared comments I refer to a series of misleading suggestions put forward by Senator Collins during his remarks. For example, Senator Collins said that it was getting a bit wearing that the Opposition had raised matters of public importance in this place, I think on six separate occasions. I suggest to Senator Collins, through you, Mr Acting Deputy President, and to his colleagues on the Government side of the chamber, that he tell the tourism industry, all the other industries and the people dependent upon those industries in this country that it is getting a bit wearing for Government members to have to be told on no fewer than six occasions what a shambles this Government and this Prime Minister are reducing this country to through the Prime Minister's stubborn insistence upon the non-negotiability of his condition that on no account are the airlines to sit down and negotiate in any way with the Australian Federation of Air Pilots. As I said, it may be getting a bit wearing for Government senators to have this matter debated but I can assure them that out there, where the pain is being felt, where the bankruptcies are occurring and the bank managers are making their telephone calls to the poor little motel owners, the taxicab drivers, the hire car owners and so on, it is certainly getting a bit wearing too. But the thing that is wearing is the financial pain involved. It is not wearing that at least somebody in this place is taking up their cause for them in the face of the total calculated callousness with which our Prime Minister, by contrast, is approaching the matter. </PARA>
<PARA> For the rest, what else did Senator Collins say, apart from a couple of lacings of personal abuse of the general kind which we are accustomed to from Government members when they are hard pressed? They always stop playing the ball and start playing the man and Senator Collins did that in the cases of both Senator Puplick and Senator Tambling. I do not propose to dignify those elements of his remarks by any response to them. I merely note the characteristic performance on the part of Government spokesmen in that regard. The one matter which I want to take up and deal with at some length is Senator Collins's atrocious suggestion that `day after day'-I think I am quoting him accurately-`we have the Opposition coming in here and offering aid and comfort to the Air Pilots Federation'. That McCarthyist smear, if I may use a bad pun, given the name of the chief executive of the Air Pilots Federation, from Senator Collins is totally unworthy of any senator in this place, not even an Australian Labor Party senator. The Opposition has never supported the Air Pilots Federation. The Opposition has always said, on the contrary, that we do not support the pilots' claim per se. (Quorum formed) I digress for one moment to comment on the total hypocrisy of the Australian Democrats who this morning wasted two hours of the Senate's time having a debate about the total inappropriateness of calling quorums, thereby incidentally wasting speakers' time, yet this afternoon they have done just that. But I will not spend any more time talking about this rabble on my left. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition has always said that we deplored the effect of the dispute on the travelling public, and we have always said that we deplored even more the effect on the Australian tourism industry and all those dependent upon it. It is an industry which appears to be the last of the Government's concerns. In addition we have always continued to express our total frustration at the fact that everything this Prime Minister has done from the outset of this dispute has had the effect of inflaming the dispute on the one hand and prolonging the dispute on the other. In the process, the Prime Minister has been totally ignoring the interests of the travelling public and totally ignoring, it would seem, the terrible effects of the dispute on the tourism industry. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Hawke has again and again refused to permit the airlines to negotiate in any way with the Pilots Federation. The Opposition has said, and of course it is obvious, that there must be negotiations between the airlines and the pilots. On that we are at one with the Prime Minister and the airlines. But when did we arrive at a situation in this country whereby individual workers-in this case the pilots-were not allowed, by prime ministerial fiat, to be represented by a union of their choice? Whatever else might be said about the Pilots Federation-and many things could be said about it-there does not seem to be the slightest doubt that the Federation is strongly supported by its members. I must say that is unusual among trade unions in this country.</PARA>
<PARA> Because of the Prime Minister's absolutely manic determination-and I am unable for one moment to imagine what can be the basis for this, except for one suggestion which has been made, which I may return to-to exclude the Air Pilots Federation from any such negotiations, there are no negotiations. We cannot get any details, but there seem to have been no more than 10, and possibly fewer than half a dozen of the 1,647 pilots who resigned on 23 August-fewer than 10 and possibly fewer than half a dozen-who have gone back. There does not seem to be the slightest indication that the others are going to do so. So what are we going to do? What is the Government's response when we say, `What are you going to do about the present situation'?</PARA>
<PARA> Senator Collins, towards the end of his remarks, asked: Where does the Opposition go from here? I would ask: Where does the Government go from here? After all, as was revealed during the Senate Estimates Committee hearings last night, with the dispute now moving into its eighth week, we have no sign of any early end to it. Every few days we get fed a little more misleading pap. Three weeks ago the Prime Minister told us that by the end of September the airlines expected to be carrying 50 per cent of their normal passenger load. What do we find? We find, on the basis of information tabled during the Estimates Committee hearings last night, and referred to in Question Time today, that 34,800 passengers per day were carried during the June quarter by the commercial airlines; that is, by Ansett Airlines of Australia, Australian Airlines, East-West Airlines Ltd and Ansett regional airlines. </PARA>
<PARA> On 2 October, which is the best day for these figures from the Government's point of view, there were 18,545 seats available-not passengers carried, but seats available. I will come back to that point. Of those 18,545 seats, only 5,674 were being offered by the commercial airlines. There were 5,217 seats available on leased aircraft brought in from overseas. There were 2,154 being carried by the Royal Australian Air Force and the Royal Australian Navy, 1,300 by foreign carriers such as Thai Airways, British Airways, United Airlines and so on; 3,000 by Qantas; and 1,200 by various commuter airlines. So on 2 October, Monday of this week, we had the commercial airlines making available seats amounting to just over 16 per cent of the number of passengers carried during the June quarter on an average basis. I repeat that the airlines were making those seats available. It is a notorious fact that because of the shambles that the airlines booking system has been reduced to by the pressure of people upon them-I am not blaming the airlines for that; it is simply a fact of the situation-every plane leaving has vacant seats. In fact, the commercial airlines are carrying probably less than 15 per cent of what was previously their normal capacity. </PARA>
<PARA> We are now 7 1/2 weeks into the dispute. Fifteen per cent of the normal carrying capacity is being provided. Unless some magic wand is to be produced from some Prime Ministerial cupboard-and there is not the slightest sign of it-that seems to be about where we will be until Christmas. There might be a few more pilots starved into submission, but there does not seem to be the slightest sign of it. I believe from the general feeling that one gets from talking around the place that the pilots are absolutely fed up with the way this Government, and the Prime Minister in person, have treated them. I regret to say it, but I suspect that this country will finish up with airlines which are not being flown by these pilots at all. I suspect that they will never go back. </PARA>
<PARA> Is that what the Government wants? Is that statesmanship? Is that the action of a Prime Minister or is it the action of a vindictive little man? Do we have as the Prime Minister of this country a vindictive little man? That is the clear impression that any objective observer of the situation must get. At the beginning of this week, after seven weeks of the dispute, we had the commercial airlines, the four main carriers, carrying 15 per cent of their normal daily passenger load. The tourism industry meanwhile is going down in flames. We had a balance of payments deficit of $2.6 billion last month, and the Prime Minister has had nothing to say on the matter. </PARA>

Democracy is a fragile fabric, but it is a serious situation when we have adopted a system such as the conciliation and arbitration system which operates under the Industrial Relations Act-one may or may not dislike it but that is what the community has opted for-and, when some strain occurs, the Opposition says, `Well, let's just ignore it'. Are we next going to ignore the rulings of the Federal Court and the High Court? Why obey anything? Why should we as members of this community obey the laws at all? That is what is being advocated here.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It has been said, `Look, we understand that there is a process whereby people have their wages fixed, but because we have a bit of difficulty here let's ignore that'. The same sort of argument was used about the Pharmaceutical Benefits Remuneration Tribunal when that situation became a bit uncomfortable. What do we do in such situations? We just toss the umpire aside. We just throw out the system and, because there is a group of people who have a little industrial muscle, we say, `Let's give way; that's the answer. Let those people sit down and bludgeon whoever they will into submission and that will be that'. </PARA>
<PARA> Madam Acting Deputy President, I am a great admirer and supporter of the union movement. I am a person who does not believe that sections 45d and 45e of the Trade Practices Act ought to operate and I am a believer that negotiations should take place, but they should take place within a system. And in taking that approach I am being a traditionalist. I make no apology for that. The powers of the Parliament, as the founding fathers set them out, read in section 51 in the following way:</PARA>
<PARA>The Parliament shall, subject to this Constitution, have power to make laws for the peace, order, and good government of the Commonwealth with respect to-</PARA>
<PARA>. . . </PARA>
<PARA>(xxxv.) Conciliation and arbitration for the prevention and settlement of industrial disputes extending beyond the limits of any one State:</PARA>
<PARA>That is the way that this Australian community has opted to go since 1904 when the first Conciliation and Arbitration Commission was established. </PARA>
<PARA> Indeed, not only has the Commonwealth gone down that line; the States have as well. It is interesting to note that the Opposition says, `Let us forget about all this because the pilots do not want to use the system any more; we as an Opposition will support them in that. We say yes, they do not have to use the system any more. They can go and negotiate directly. They can tear up what has gone before; they can do what they want'. The interesting thing is this: the Pilots Federation did not have to register itself under the Conciliation and Arbitration Act as it then was. The Australian Industrial Relations Act which operates now says:</PARA>
<PARA>Any of the following associations may apply-</PARA>
<PARA>they do not have to apply-</PARA>
<PARA>for registration as an organisation. </PARA>
<PARA>And then it goes through and defines them. The Pilots Federation applied for registration under the Conciliation and Arbitration Act, now replaced by the Industrial Relations Act, and stayed within that system until it did not suit the pilots. Now the Opposition says, `Because you happen to be a union with considerable muscle you can go outside the system. You can go outside the guidelines and since you cause a lot of trouble we should give way to you'. That is really what is being said by the other side. Senator Stone says that he does not say that, and if that is what he--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have got no difficulty-in spite of what others might say-with the proposition that the Federation should represent the pilots, if that is what the pilots want, before the Commission-if it does in fact represent them. The difficulty is that the Opposition says, `Look, let the Federation represent the pilots'. But the difficulty is that it does not, and this is the point I am making, put itself within the framework whereby it can do that. Leave aside the Prime Minister; leave aside the politics; leave aside the politicians. Let us look at what was stated by the properly constituted body, the Australian Industrial Relations Commission. The Full Bench consisted of Mr Justice Maddern, President, Deputy President Hancock and Commissioner Paine. These are the umpires; these are the people that the community has appointed as the proper tribunal to decide these issues. This is what they said in Melbourne on 29 September 1989. The reference is 736/89, the print number is H9770, for whoever wants to read it. The Full Bench of the Industrial Relations Commission says this:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Federation has been given the opportunity to justify its claim before this Commission but has refused to do so. It is clear to us that the Federation has not changed its attitude-</PARA>
<PARA>this is last week-</PARA>

<PARA>The Act of Parliament which this very Parliament has passed. It refuses. What are we to say? Are we to say, `Oh well, even though the Federal Parliament of Australia has decided something, because it involves the pilots, let's forget about the will of the people expressed through Parliament'. That is the argument on the other side. On the other hand, the Commission says:</PARA>
<PARA>It is clear to us that the Federation has not changed its attitude which involves a refusal to proceed in accordance with the Act, its own rules-</PARA>
<PARA>I will come back to that-</PARA>
<PARA>and the processes of this Commission; nor has it altered its attitude to the principles established in National Wage Case decisions. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Now, Senator Stone, they are not a bunch of clowns. These are men with vast experience in law, economics and industrial relations. We are fully aware, says the Commission, of the damage which the dispute is causing to the economy and significant sections of the country. But, apparently, the pilots do not see that. The Opposition says, `Let us give way to this; let us concede this and go outside the system'. It is interesting to look at the pilots' own rules. I will explain what they are. These are the rules that the Federation itself established before it was registered. It is an agreement that was registered. It sets out the contract by which members of the Federation came together to form a union. These are the rules written by the Federation and which it put forward to have registered and which it had to justify to have registered. Rule 19 is headed `Industrial Agreements' and states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (a) An industrial agreement shall not be entered into unless its contents have been agreed to by a majority of the Executive Committee. </PARA>
<PARA>That is a standard rule and a good one. The second one reads:</PARA>
<PARA> (b) Industrial agreements or other instruments made on behalf of the Federation shall only be entered into in accordance with the Conciliation and Arbitration Act and copies of the same shall be furnished according to law to the Industrial Registrar. </PARA>
<PARA>These are the rules of the Australian Federation of Air Pilots-written not by compulsion but by agreement-which everybody who is a pilot is asked to accede to and which bind the pilots as in a contract. Yet the Federation, with, as I understand it, the support of the Opposition, simply says, `Look, let's ignore our own agreement. Let us ignore the very basis upon which we ought to proceed'. It is just a very revolutionary approach that the Opposition takes. What the Opposition says is that members of an organisation who ignore the Commission, who ignore their own rules, will somehow or other become people of sweetness and light as soon as they sit down to negotiate with their employers directly. </PARA>
<PARA> What does all the evidence indicate? What is the reality? The reality is that, unless this matter is processed through the Commission, we will get nowhere. It is just pointless to say that the thing can be solved without some compulsion being put on a group which says it wants 30 per cent and sticks by that. What is to be done? The simple answer the Opposition gives is, `All sorts of crises are being caused by this'. Of course crises are being caused by it. Of course people are suffering. The Commission understands that and, of course, the Government understands that. The pilots understand it, but what they are saying is, `Well, look, in pursuit of our industrial objective, a rise of 30 per cent in wages outside the guidelines-we will not comply with the sorts of guidelines with which everybody else complies-we will ignore the union movement, the Government, the Industrial Relations Commission and the pleas from the rest of the community and we will press on until our will is done'. That is the sort of opponent with which we are faced. Nevertheless it is suggested by the Opposition that if the pilots would sit down with the employers a settlement might be reached. Of course a settlement might be reached-but at what cost?</PARA>
<PARA> It is said that the breaking of the accord-an outcome that the Government has uppermost in its mind-would be no loss. The accord, since 1983, has delivered 1.5 million new jobs in Australia, over half of them for women. It has cut inflation significantly, it has produced Medicare, it has produced increases in pensions, it has made a fairer redistribution of income within the community, it has produced--</PARA>

All those things are to be jeopardised-with the consent of the Opposition, as I understand it; certainly without any criticism by the Opposition-for the sake of giving people a 30 per cent increase in wages of $70,000, $80,000 or $90,000 a year. What sort of system will we have?

The former have insisted that the dispute be settled within the guidelines laid down by the Commission . . . the AFAP has refused to accept this position. </PARA>
<PARA>That makes it quite clear that one side is willing to go by the rules and the other is not. The Commission itself tried to do something. It was ignored.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to support the matter of public importance raised by Senator Puplick today, namely:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The need to recognise that the failure to resolve the pilots' dispute arises fundamentally from the unwillingness of the Prime Minister, Mr Hawke, to govern on behalf of all Australians. </PARA>
<PARA>I have listened to the contributions made in this debate today and I have heard a significant amount of rubbish. I will deal with the rubbishy comments that I have heard seriatim in a minute. But let me commence by saying that Australians, and especially Labor voters, are very forgiving people. They have hearts of gold. They can forgive the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) a lot. Those who have read Blanche d'Alpuget's biography of the Prime Minister obviously have very forgiving hearts. They can forgive a Prime Minister for discarding Labor policies. One only has to read what Clyde Cameron, the former South Australian member, said in a speech entitled `Policy is the problem Bob' to see what true blue Labor voters-or are they true pink Labor voters, I am not sure-think of a Prime Minister who has come from one position in 1974 to a completely different one in 1989 with respect to a very large number of his policies. He is a chameleon-that is his problem. He looks around for what is popular and changes to fit the tune. Labor members, Labor voters, possibly, can forgive him that. </PARA>
<PARA> Australians can forgive a Prime Minister who has a few tears, a few boohoos on the television. The British would not put up with it from Thatcher and the Americans would not put up with it from Bush. But we will put up with it from our Prime Minister. He has a few oddities and we can wear that. We will put up with public declarations of cheating on his wife-we can forgive that. We will even put up with his calling a senior citizen who wants to have a go at him in a shopping centre a `silly old bugger'. He seems to get away with that and other expletives which I will not bother the time of the Senate with. But what we cannot forgive is someone, a Prime Minister, who, when faced with such a serious dispute, lets his unbalanced and emotional state get the better of him and declares `It's war' in Rambo style. He inflamed the dispute from the very beginning. He made it clear that the purpose of his involvement in the dispute was to crush the airline pilots union. </PARA>
<PARA> There is a huge personal and social cost to the nation of all this. Incidentally, it is a lesser cost to some of the Government's rich mates. Some compensation is being paid to them, such as through waiving landing fees, but nothing is being done for people who have bought a newsagency or gift shop at an airport or who happen to have a tourist facility. Nothing is being done for those people despite the fact that they might be going broke. Australians will not forgive the Prime Minister's bungling in handling this dispute. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Collins's contribution was not very outstanding other than for its nonsensical quality. Senator Collins comes from the Northern Territory. I am surprised that he did not remind us what the Tourist Commission Chairman, Robert Doyle, had to say. With respect to the Territory, Senator Collins's area, he said `Nothing is coming here. It is absolutely infuriating. Nothing is happening and there is loss of jobs'. Senator Collins might have talked about the Northern Territory Minister for Tourism, Roger Vale, who said that hundreds of young men and women have lost or are about to lose their jobs. That is where we are at. </PARA>
<PARA> This is not just some ideological argument over whether the pilots union should be able to represent the pilots. This debate is about whether the Prime Minister has in his heart the interests of all Australians, not just those of the Australian Council of Trade Unions (ACTU), which wants to see recalcitrant unions quashed, and his own interests, because he wants to see those who are bound by the award now sticking to it. The debate is about ordinary Australians who are hurting badly. I come back to the point I made about Australians being forgiving. They are prepared to put up with the problems of an industrial dispute for a period, but this has gone on for too long. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Collins said that this dispute was not caused by the Government and the centralised wage fixing system. He said that it began because the pilots tried to go outside that system and into collective bargaining and because they put demands straight to the airlines. He said that the Rafferty's rules system is what the Opposition wants. Let me take the opportunity to paint that as being the lie that it is. What his dispute shows is the lack of flexibility and lack of discipline in the current system. Not every Australian is covered by the accord and paid wage increases in accordance with the wage guidelines. Let us not kid ourselves about that for starters. Surgeons, doctors, lawyers and sales people who are on commissions are not paid in that way. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="7E4">Senator VANSTONE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am reminded by Senator Puplick that the President of the ACTU is not paid in that way. Hundreds of thousands of Australians are not bound by the accord. So what happens when a group of Australians decide that they want out of the centralised wage fixing system? At the moment Rafferty's rules apply. They apply because the Government, recognising that the Industrial Relations Commission needed enforcement powers, intended to give the Commission those enforcement powers but after a little tap on the shoulder from the union movement saying, `No you don't, Bob, not with our agreement', what do we know? The enforcement clauses were withdrawn from the Government's Industrial Relations Bill.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Government recognised the problem with the centralised wage fixing system and that the Commission does not have the capacity to enforce what it wants. It recognised that weakness and was going to do something about it, but the unions said, `Oh no, you don't, that doesn't suit. Leave a system where, if people want to create trouble, they can'. That is effectively what happened. The Government bowed to the unions. That is why we have a problem now. The Commission cannot enforce its decisions. That is why there is not sufficient discipline and flexibility in the system at the moment. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me outline the coalition's industrial relations policy. It is not one of Rafferty's rules, as Senator Collins and other Labor senators have presented. It is not one under which if people want out they can just opt out and that is it: they can demand whatever they like and they will get it. Ours is a system under which the centralised wage fixing system would be retained. Some people-both employees and employers-would prefer to stay in that system. They find that a better system-one that protects their interests better. </PARA>
<PARA> But that is not true of everyone. Some firms, because they have perhaps achieved an advantage in the market due to their own capacity and hard work, will be willing, prepared and want to pay their workers more. Some firms would be happy to negotiate directly with their workers-not with some union that deals with workers in that area or that particular craft all around the nation but directly with the people who work for that firm, who can take some pride in the achievement of that firm. We say that where a firm wants to do that, where an enterprise wants to make an agreement with its workers and its workers want to do the same back, we will let them do that and that agreement will be specific to that particular enterprise. </PARA>
<PARA> There is no question of some mad flow-on of wage increases. Those agreements will be for that enterprise. But, of course, the union movement does not want that. The union movement does not want to be muscled out by the workers, the very workers it is purporting to represent. We say that will be a better thing. We will have a centralised wage fixing system which those who want to can remain in and we will have the opportunity for people together, worker and employer, to decide whether they want to opt out and to negotiate agreements that suit themselves. We say that is a very sensible thing. So, in that sense, our system will be more flexible but we will also have the capacity to enforce those decisions. Once you make your choice, you will stick by it. There will be no Rafferty's rules as you can have under this system. Enforceability provisions will be installed into the Act so that there will not be the system that we have at the moment where people can just opt out and say, `See you later, Jack'. There will be a much better system. </PARA>
<PARA> Incidentally, the Minister at the table, Senator Reynolds, the Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for the Status of women, may care to realise, may even one day acknowledge, how much better this will be for women, because we have even seen the union movement acknowledging that it is not adequately representing women. Women are not flocking to join unions, and they are certainly not being given the opportunity to be represented at the higher echelons of unions as we have seen in the last couple of weeks: a couple of women have lost their jobs, lost the opportunity to represent women at the higher levels in the union movement. It is a boys own movement. </PARA>
<PARA> Under our system women in a particular enterprise would be able to have their voice properly heard because they would be negotiating directly with the employer. Under our system we say that, if the employees want to nominate a union to act on their behalf, they can. That is fair enough. People should be able to nominate who can represent them. So I fail to see how that can be presented as an anti-union policy. What the Prime Minister wants to do is defend the accord at all costs. My leader in the Senate, Senator Chaney, had this to say with respect to the accord and, in addition, with respect to the allegation constantly being made by the Labor Party that we support the pilots:</PARA>
<PARA>The pilots' action is inexcusable but the irony is that the Prime Minister is using the dispute to defend an accord which has cost Australia a fortune in terms of inflation, productivity forgone and massive increases in interest rates and foreign debt and, of most importance to workers, falling real wages. There is widespread disenchantment with the so-called accord. The reality is that it is making Australian workers worse off and they know it. It is a third world approach which offers only the prospect of ever decreasing real wages. </PARA>
<PARA>Senator Collins was quick to list, as Senator Cooney did, what he thought the achievements of the accord were. Let us look at the Agriculture and Resources Quarterly released a couple of days ago, quoted ad infinitum in Question Time today by Senator Cook in one of his set up dorothy dix questions. We see that in Australia economic growth is expected to be, for 1989-90, about 3 per cent, conferred with the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) average of 2.6 per cent, 2 per cent in the United States and 4 per cent in Japan. So in that sense you could say, in terms of economic growth, we are not too far off the mark. So where are we going wrong because, when you look at the average for inflation for OECD countries, you see that that is 4 per cent? We are still struggling along on 7 per cent, which is nearly double. Japan, which was expected to have a growth of 4 per cent, can manage with an inflation rate of 2 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for the Status of Women might like to turn her mind to what the accord has done in terms of inflation to the weekly shopping bill of every woman who buys groceries and food for her family. We should not forget that the Prime Minister has handled this dispute in such a way that he is not trying to salvage what he can out of it for all Australians; he is salvaging what he can out of it for himself, his mates and the union movement. He is doing this for himself, because he wants to get on with his mates and the union movement; he is doing it for the union movement because it wants to get rid of the Australian Federation of Air Pilots; and he is doing it for his mates because Peter Abeles is acknowledged to be a very good friend of his. It is extraordinary that the Government is paying compensation to the airlines-admittedly a good friend of the Prime Minister-and nothing is being done for the other people who have been so devastatingly affected by this dispute. So the Government wants to abuse the Opposition. It says that we have nothing to offer, obviously ignoring our nine-point plan. It is clear that that plan is not in support of the pilots. It is an absolute lie that we have supported the pilots. </PARA>
<PARA> We have written to the Prime Minister and encouraged him to use his capacity to solve this dispute, to exercise some influence on Australian Airlines, but still mistruths are being quoted by the Government. The Government is determined to look after its mates. This is not only the case in terms of the airline dispute. As Senator Puplick pointed out, this can be seen in changes in the media laws in this country, in the funding we put into the defence of the America's Cup, in the inexplicable decision to pour millions of dollars into Kodak, which just happens to be in the Prime Minister's electorate, and in another attempt to buy off the banks to try to keep interest rates down. It is bad luck if a person is not in that category. If one happens to have one's mortgage with a building society, it is just bad luck. Senator Puplick pointed out examples of jobs for the boys. The notion that this Prime Minister has got rid of child poverty is an absolute embarrassment. </PARA>
<PARA> So what it amounts to is that the Government has not handled this dispute on behalf of all Australians. The dispute has been used to achieve the ideological aims of the Prime Minister and the union movement and the cost of that to all Australians has simply been ignored. As I said at the outset, Australians can be very forgiving of a Prime Minister. They will forgive him the tears, they will forgive him cheating on his wife, they will forgive him calling an old pensioner a `silly old bugger'. But the Prime Minister's hopeless handling of this dispute will not be forgiven by the normal voters, and that is the reason this Government will be disposed of at the next election. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The matter of public importance before us today is that the airline pilots strike is the fault of the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) and, further, that the Prime Minister does not govern on behalf of all Australians. This nonsense would be laughable if it were not taken so seriously by the Opposition. The joke is that the Opposition fundamentally believes that the Australian Federation of Air Pilots (AFAP) can hold a gun at the head of the Australian people but that this is the Prime Minister's fault. The airline pilots can wreck the tourist industry, damage the economy, create havoc in the hospitality industry but, as we find out today, this is the Prime Minister's fault. We are constantly told in this place by the Opposition that this strike is currently costing billions of dollars. I have listened to some of Senator Chaney's estimates of what this dispute has cost to date and, moreover, what it is likely to cost in a full year. We have even had breakdowns of figures for the tourist industry. Never once, though, have the pilots been condemned for the ruthless and reckless way in which they are seeking to achieve their ends.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Opposition says that the Prime Minister does not govern on behalf of all Australians. If he gave in to the outrageous industrial blackmail of the pilots, does that mean that he would be governing for all Australians? If the airline pilots can opt out of the wages guidelines and negotiate using the tactics they are currently employing, that seems okay to the Opposition. The pilots enjoy the support of the Opposition. Like the Canberra and Sydney visiting medical specialists, the Opposition makes out a special case. Again, if people hold the community to ransom by whatever means, the Opposition will defend them. The pilots seem to have the support of no-one in Australia except some honourable senators opposite. </PARA>
<PARA> Yesterday, Mr Howard, the previous Leader of the Liberal Party, asked a question of the Prime Minister in the other place. His question in part was: would not this dispute be ended by individual pilots being signed up as quickly as possible on new contracts? Certainly, if Opposition senators did not support the Pilots Federation in the way that they have, we may well have made more progress to date. </PARA>
<PARA> Last week the Opposition said that this dispute had been mishandled. It seems to believe that to stand back and let anarchy prevail as industrial relations is the only sensible course of action. The Opposition argues that anything else is a mishandling. When the Opposition says that this dispute is mishandled, it is guilty of some of the worst humbug and hypocrisy. The Government must stand firm behind a wages policy that has established guidelines and has seen a reversal of the disastrous Fraser-Howard years, such as when inflation and unemployment went out of control in 1981 and 1982. In those years Australia experienced a wages explosion and a recession followed that saw unemployment rise to around 11 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> The policy of the coalition Government of that time allowed collective bargaining and ended centralised wage fixing, which gave wage outcomes that threatened to wreck the whole country. Indeed, the industrially strong did very well out of those years whilst other groups of wage and salary earners copped the inflation and the broken promises. They remembered those failed policies in March 1983. Coalition policy now seems to be the same. It does not feel the need to rethink and reassess its position since 1981-1982, even though the price of its policies has been the political wilderness ever since.</PARA>
<PARA> This is an important matter today because the central issue in the pilots dispute is whether a centralised system of wage fixation, with balances, checks and benefits for all wage and salary earners, can survive. The alternative which the pilots want is a wage fixing system which allows them, with the ability they have to wreck the tourist industry, dislocate business, and cost Australia valuable overseas exchange, wage rises whenever they wish. The pilots can hold a gun at the Government's head or the airlines' head and say, `Pay up now or we will cause all of the dislocation and disruption that we can'. The pilots know that they can rely on the support of the Opposition. When the Government and the airlines refuse to pay up they are accused by the Opposition of mishandling the dispute. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course, if things were different and the Government did not stand firm, the wage fixing principles would be thrown out the window. The industrially strong would immediately use the muscle that they have and completely break the wages system that has seen an unparallelled growth in employment in Australia. No doubt if that were to happen the Opposition would be arguing here for quids for their mates and nothing for the rest. In fact, it is interesting to see the Opposition's real industrial relations policy at work. When Canberra doctors are after every dollar they can get, the whole world must come to a stop. The Opposition screams `foul' and says that the doctors must get exorbitant rises immediately. I seem to remember listening to how terrible it was that visiting specialists could get only $67 an hour in Canberra but could get $97 in Sydney and how the world would come to an end because of this. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition also seems to be concerned that the pharmacists are not getting enough money. It has argued repeatedly here for more money for the pharmacists. The fact that an independent tribunal has come down with some findings does not seem to worry them. No, those in the Opposition will not let anything like that get in the way of pay rises for their mates. It was a different story when it came to the Mudginberri and Dollar Sweets workers. Then every sanction possible was advocated. The policy was different but quite clear-cut: wipe out the meat workers and the confectioners, and the Government would no doubt have mishandled that dispute as well. In that case the Opposition wanted every possible weapon used to break the strike. This time it is the Opposition's mates who are involved; so it wants negotiations, pay deals and the whole bit. </PARA>
<PARA> The hypocrisy of the whole industrial relations policy of the Opposition stands out starkly: `When it is ordinary workers, use every weapon to break them; when it is our mates let us all get together and work out a deal'. The Norm Gallaghers of the airline industry can feel safe with coalition industrial relations policy. From the very outset the Pilots Federation has aimed to destroy the orderly, centralised wage fixing system that has served Australia well. From the beginning it was clear that nothing was going to get in its way. It planned for months before the dispute, started the whole campaign and advised its members on how to survive a long period without pay. Of course, the Pilots Federation represents other workers outside of the commercial airline industry. It also represents pilots in other areas of employment, and for these workers the Federation is seeking rises inside the system: `When and where the bargaining power is greatest, use muscle'. All other areas use the system that so far has seen an orderly movement of wages. </PARA>
<PARA> On 11 August the Pilots Federation did not attend the Industrial Relations Commission but instead organised a 12-hour stoppage in Melbourne. From 12 August to 14 August it was the turn of Brisbane, Perth and Sydney. On 11 August, the AFAP stated quite clearly that the pilots saw no point in pursuing wage increases within the wage fixing guidelines. Since that time the Pilots Federation has stated that if the pilots get the rise and somebody says it is consistent with the guidelines, it will not worry the pilots. </PARA>
<PARA> Now, after many more weeks have gone by, the Pilots Federation has again refused arbitration. It walked out of the hearings last week having restated its claim that it does not care about the wages system and wishes to negotiate directly with the airlines to obtain its claim of 29.47 per cent. At no stage have its demands or its tactics changed. The pilots will claim the 29.47 per cent outside of the wages guidelines, and they will disturb, disrupt or ruthlessly do as much damage as they can until they get their own way. And what do we get from the Opposition? We are told that the Government is mishandling the dispute, we are told that it is the Prime Minister's fault, and we are told that the Government is not governing on behalf of the whole country because it will not give in to the demands of the Opposition's mates-the Pilots Federation. </PARA>
<PARA> We have had some other lovely little chestnuts from the Opposition on this matter. Senator Stone has revealed to the world during this dispute that he has always been a supporter of trade unionism. He even revealed that the trade unions have been secretly admired for years by all members of the Opposition. The key words are `secretly admiring the unions'. Those opposite have certainly never done anything to suggest that they have anything but contempt for trade unions. When their mates are in a sticky situation and they are called out to defend them, all of a sudden we find out that they are all born again trade unionists. So what does the Opposition advocate? Nothing. Mr Peacock, as the current Leader of the Opposition, stated on 31 August:</PARA>
<PARA>We are not in Government today, and the duty is on this Government to fix the dispute. </PARA>
<PARA>The only thing the Opposition can suggest is that it is not the fault of the Pilots Federation; that the whole world should condemn the Government and the Prime Minister. We never hear anything from the Opposition about the tactics of the Pilots Federation and I doubt whether we ever will. It is just like the doctors dispute: we are told that they are all reasonable people pursuing reasonable goals. As to the Dollar Sweets workers, the Mudginberri workers and others, the Opposition has a more hysterical view about them. The Opposition does not know where to go on this dispute. The topic it has put up for debate here today shows how bankrupt it is. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There are a number of points on which Senator Collins misrepresented my argument when he was speaking in the debate. The first one was where he claimed that I supported the Australian Federation of Airline Pilots. In the speeches that I have made here previously on this topic, I have made it abundantly clear that I do not support the Pilots Federation. I do not support any group in the Australian community which holds the rest of the community to ransom, and nor does my party. I have no brief either for the airline management, while I am on that subject.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The second point on which he misrepresented me related to the starting point of my argument, because I have always argued that regular line pilots flying for the Australian airlines are averaging somewhere around 75 hours a month actual flying time. I have rejected the fiction of the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) that they fly for eight hours a week, an aggregate of around 30 hours a month. The Prime Minister did this in the other place yesterday in Question Time. I have pointed out that that is a fiction that has been arrived at by dividing the total number of pilots into the number of hours flown. </PARA>
<PARA> The third point that I have been misrepresented on is where Senator Collins claimed that I was a Boeing 727 captain, because there was some handwriting on the documents I tabled in relation to the Australian Airlines contract. I point out to the Senate, as I pointed out to Senator Collins by interjection, that that is my handwriting on the papers that were tabled last week. </PARA>
<PARA> The final point, and the most serious one, is the misrepresentation by Senator Collins of how I have interpreted the contract. To do that I must take one or two sentences and explain what the contract provides, because it does not provide the 3 per cent that Senator Collins claims. He ridicules me for claiming that it provides somewhere around 40 per cent. The salaries under the Australian Airlines contract provide that a base salary of $98,295 be paid to a Boeing 727 captain for a 55-hour month. Now remember they are flying 75 hours. For each hour beyond that 55 hours clause (d) of the contract provides that pilots who exceed 55 flying hours per roster period shall be paid--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thank you, Madam Acting Deputy President. The explanation is that the pilots, if they follow this contract, actually do achieve something like a 40 per cent increment because they fly 75 hours a month, not the 30 hours that Senator Collins maintains I maintain they are flying. Thereby, with the loading that comes from the extra 20 hours, they do in fact achieve a 40 per cent increment. So I have been grossly misrepresented on that point and I believe that it is a dishonest argument that has been put forward by a bunch of losers.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I seek leave to make a statement relating to major reforms to government purchasing and to incorporate the statement in Hansard.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The statement read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA> The Government is about to take significant steps forward in improving both the cost-effectiveness of government purchasing and the ways in which it can enhance opportunities for local suppliers to get Commonwealth business. </PARA>
<PARA> This is a major element of micro-economic reform. </PARA>
<PARA> From 1 November there will be major changes to improve the efficiency of government purchasing. At the same time we will introduce new measures to give greater effect to our strong and continuing commitment to encouraging the development of local industry. </PARA>
<PARA> Federal public sector purchasing is very big business. An estimated 7 to 8 billion dollars, or 4 per cent of gross domestic product, is spent each year by Budget sector agencies alone. This estimate excludes very substantial expenditure by government business enterprises. Purchasing is also very important to the efficient administration of government. Government programs would founder if their supplies of goods and services were to fail through breakdowns in their purchasing systems or if capital acquisition projects were unable to deliver on time and within budget. </PARA>
<PARA> But in the past purchasing has been a backwater. In government, as in the private sector, it has not received the attention that it merits from management and its potential to contribute to better management has not been exploited. This was borne out by the service-wide review which was conducted last year under the financial management improvement program. </PARA>
<PARA> The review involved extensive consultation within government and with industry. It took account of the views of the people who work in purchasing and managers who are served by purchasing. It took account of developments in other governments. It also took account of the views of those who do business with government. </PARA>
<PARA> It found:</PARA>
<PARA> A restrictive regulatory environment;</PARA>
<PARA> An emphasis on process rather than outcomes;</PARA>
<PARA> A culture of caution and risk avoidance;</PARA>
<PARA> Slow and laborious processes;</PARA>
<PARA> A failure to provide staff with the training and career development opportunities they needed;</PARA>
<PARA> A preoccupation with technical rather than functional specifications;</PARA>
<PARA> A commitment to single stage tendering processes whether or not they were effective in the market. </PARA>
<PARA> The system was costing us money through excessive processing costs, time delays and failure to obtain the best price or the most appropriate goods and services from suppliers. </PARA>
<PARA> It was against this background that the Government decided to embark on the current program of reforms. The aim, as with other reforms to public administration, was not only to give managers greater freedom and authority to manage but also to require them to manage and to be accountable. </PARA>
<PARA> These reforms are part of a general program to improve efficiency in government administration. In the Administrative Services portfolio this has also been reflected in major reforms to the provision of common services which have already produced better performance and very large savings to government.</PARA>
<PARA> Following months of planning and preparation, the progressive implementation of the changes will begin with effect from 1 November. The following requirements have been undertaken:</PARA>
<PARA> The Audit Act 1901 has been amended to enable the issue of ministerial guidelines;</PARA>
<PARA> The finance regulations dealing with purchasing have been substantially amended to eliminate prescription of detailed processes and tabled in Parliament;</PARA>
<PARA> The Minister for Administrative Services has tabled and issued several guidelines on principles and practices for purchasing under the new regime; and</PARA>
<PARA> Departments are preparing purchasing reform plans for endorsement by their Ministers before they begin to operate under the new regime. </PARA>
<PARA> Departments are required to advise on progress in their annual reports from 1988-89 to 1990-91. </PARA>
<PARA> To complete the system, the Minister for Administrative Services will shortly issue a policy framework which sets out in summary form the major policies applying to Commonwealth purchasing and their integration with industry policy. </PARA>
<PARA> The main elements of the new approach will be:</PARA>
<PARA> A new emphasis on value for money in government purchasing, rather than price or acquisition costs. Departments' officers will need to look broadly at the performance of the goods and services they buy and their suppliers and take all relevant costs into account in assessment of offers;</PARA>
<PARA> Greater scope for departments to settle purchasing methods within a general principle of open and effective competition. Departments will have to gazette public invitations of offers and contracts arranged. But methods of approach to the market will not be rigidly prescribed. Use of conventional public tendering will continue, but other approaches, such as staged purchasing and prequalification of suppliers, will be encouraged, together with early notification of purchasing plans. </PARA>
<PARA> Under this new approach there will be greater opportunity for departments to tailor their methods to the markets in which they are buying. Generally, we expect to see:</PARA>
<PARA> Reduced costs in bidding and administration for both suppliers and government;</PARA>
<PARA> A more competitive approach from suppliers;</PARA>
<PARA> A continuing emphasis on ethics and fair dealing, supplemented by a formal code of ethics which the Minister for Administrative Services has already issued with one of the Commonwealth procurement guidelines;</PARA>
<PARA> Training and development to raise professionalism in Commonwealth purchasing and supply; and</PARA>
<PARA> Use of practices and procedures that will make it easier for industry to provide commercial solutions to government, and for government to get value for money, for example:</PARA>
<PARA> Functional specifications rather than detailed technical specifications;</PARA>
<PARA> Purchasing planning including forward purchasing planning;</PARA>
<PARA> Negotiation, including post offer negotiation in appropriate circumstances; and</PARA>
<PARA> Standardised and simple documentation. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to turn now to the Government's preference policy. </PARA>
<PARA> For a long time the Commonwealth Government has given some form of preference in its purchasing with the object of assisting Australian firms to obtain government business and thereby encourage the development of Australian industry. Since 1983 New Zealand industry has been treated in the same way as Australian industry for the purposes of the policy, consistent with the closer economic relations trade agreement between the two countries. </PARA>
<PARA> The preference policy has been in operation in some form for many years and has four main elements:</PARA>
<PARA> A monetary margin of preference;</PARA>
<PARA> Avoidance of biased or discriminatory practice in purchasing;</PARA>
<PARA> Debriefing of unsuccessful local tenderers; and</PARA>
<PARA> Mandatory use of the local products in some construction works purchases. </PARA>
<PARA> The preference margin is generally equivalent to a notional discount of 20 per cent on the Australian and New Zealand content of tendered goods and related services. There is discretion to give a higher margin in defined circumstances and for high value contracts. </PARA>
<PARA> A review of the effectiveness of the preference policy was initiated in 1988. The review was part of our response to the 1987 report of the Inglis Committee of Review on Government High Technology Purchasing Arrangements. </PARA>
<PARA> There has been extensive consultation with industry, the unions and the States about the preference policy. As part of the review, the Bureau of Industry Economics evaluated the effectiveness of the margin as an industry development mechanism. What has emerged is that:</PARA>
<PARA> The margin is cumbersome and costly to administer;</PARA>
<PARA> It has very little effect, for example it has influenced the outcome of only 107 contracts out of tens of thousands;</PARA>
<PARA> It is inconsistent with the thrust of our industry policy which is directed to making local industry more competitive. This is because it is like another protective tariff overlaid on the existing customs duty. It does not serve our concern to make industry more competitive;</PARA>
<PARA> The margin is inconsistent with the new purchasing policy with its emphasis on value for money. In this regime it does not make sense to use a mechanism which is narrowly focused on price. Remember that the new purchasing policy does not rely solely on final price. </PARA>
<PARA> For us the outcome of the review of preference was disappointing. We find ourselves responsible for a scheme which is not cost effective, not contributing to industry development and which is contrary to the thrust of purchasing reforms. But we believe very strongly that we must do something to demonstrate and make effective our commitment to Australian industry. </PARA>
<PARA> We considered various alternatives to the margin, including a second offer scheme to give suppliers with high local content a chance to make a second bid in some circumstances. However, the scheme did not generate wide acceptance. So we did not proceed with it. </PARA>
<PARA> What we have decided to do is to abolish, from 1 November, the notional 20 per cent discount component of the National Preference Agreement as applied by the Commonwealth. But we will retain and strengthen the anti-discriminatory elements of the current policy. For example, we are looking at making purchasing managers ensure that the specifications they issue are not biased. </PARA>
<PARA> The elimination of discrimination against local industry is fundamental Government policy and the basis of the National Preference Agreement to which the Commonwealth is strongly committed. </PARA>
<PARA> The Commonwealth's decision was agreed to in principle by the signatories to the National Preference Agreement at a meeting of the Australian Industry and Technology Council on 22 September. Some of them wanted to delay removal of the margin for twelve months, but this was not a practical alternative if we were to press on with our general purchasing reforms. So the changes will go ahead and we have been asked to report back to the Australian Industry and Technology Council next year on their effectiveness. </PARA>
<PARA> In any case, not all signatories to the Agreement apply the 20 per cent margin. Some apply 10 per cent and New Zealand does not apply a margin at all.</PARA>
<PARA> The specifics of the new arrangements are as follows:</PARA>
<PARA> the 20 per cent preference margin and discretionary preference elements of the Commonwealth's policy will be abolished from 1 November 1989-the same date as for the commencement of the purchasing reforms. Requests for tender for goods over $20,000 issued before that date will be assessed under the old system;</PARA>
<PARA> the important elements of the policy dealing with non-discrimination and debriefing of unsuccessful local tenderers will be retained and strengthened;</PARA>
<PARA> emphasis will be placed on the use of functional specifications rather than detailed technical specifications. This will give local suppliers the opportunity to offer cost-effective and innovative solutions to user requirements;</PARA>
<PARA> a purchase Australian office will be established;</PARA>
<PARA> there will be a public sector education campaign about buying local products;</PARA>
<PARA> we will fund the establishment of a full time National Industrial Supplies Office Co-ordinator;</PARA>
<PARA> a working party of officials investigating whether departments should pay Customs duty will report by 1 November;</PARA>
<PARA> priority will be given to dealing with the remaining recommendations of the Inglis Committee of Review on Government High Technology Purchasing Arrangements;</PARA>
<PARA> consideration will be given to measures to co-ordinate the use of Commonwealth and State Government purchasing to assist industry; and</PARA>
<PARA> there will be additional Commonwealth funding for the very successful national procurement development program. State Ministers at the recent Australian Industry and Technology Council meeting agreed in principle to additional joint funding for the program after June 1990. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn now to some details of these measures. </PARA>
<PARA>Existing Measures</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> The measures which will be retained and strengthened were last endorsed in 1984 and are designed to give Australia and New Zealand suppliers every opportunity to win orders from the Commonwealth. They require that:</PARA>
<PARA> Government specifications not exclude suitable, or reasonably adaptable, Australian and New Zealand products;</PARA>
<PARA> alternative Australian and New Zealand solutions be considered;</PARA>
<PARA> department's ordering patterns where possible be scaled to the minimum economic order requirements of Australian and New Zealand industry; and</PARA>
<PARA> unsuccessful suppliers be debriefed on request about the reasons why they failed to win orders. </PARA>
<PARA>A Purchase Australian Office</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> This new and entrepreneurial organisation will be established in the Department of Administrative Services to develop a role in promoting Australian and New Zealand industry in government and government businesses to industry. It will help to educate business about government buying, without cutting across what is already being done in government departments and agencies. A 008 number has been installed in the new office to handle queries from local suppliers. </PARA>
<PARA> The office will take on the role of designated body under the national preference agreement to investigate any complaints of discrimination. </PARA>
<PARA> It will manage a public sector education program. </PARA>
<PARA> It will work closely with those agencies in government with specific industry development functions, such as the Department of Industry, Technology and Commerce and Austrade, and with the purchasing community generally. </PARA>
<PARA> It will also join in investigating other suggested initiatives, such as strategic purchasing by Commonwealth and State governments to develop local industries. And it will develop links with the industrial supplies offices. </PARA>
<PARA>National Industrial Supplies Office Co-ordinator</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> The Government has also committed funds for the establishment of a full time national industrial supplies office co-ordinator in Canberra. The industrial supplies offices assist suppliers to be fully aware of the commercial and technical requirements of major purchasers and ensure that these purchasers are equally aware of the supply capabilities of local producers. The national office will coordinate the efforts of the various State offices to stimulate Australian industry. </PARA>
<PARA> The office is presently staffed on a part-time basis with funds from the States. The co-ordinator will work closely with the purchase Australian office. </PARA>
<PARA>A Public Sector Education Campaign</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> The aim of this campaign will be to promote in government the real advantages of dealing with Australian and New Zealand industry and the opportunities to get better value for money through doing so. These can include:</PARA>
<PARA> whole-of-life support;</PARA>
<PARA> shorter supply lines; and</PARA>
<PARA> avoiding the vagaries of currency fluctuations. </PARA>
<PARA>Payment of Customs Duty by Departments</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> One step we are disposed to take is to make departments, not just statutory authorities, pay customs duty. Under present arrangements, departments are required to include the duty notionally for tender evaluation purposes. However, actual payment of the duty would remove a possible financial incentive which departments might have to buy cheaper imports. It may also simplify the government purchasing proceeds for both suppliers and buyers. We have directed a group of officials considering the issue to report by 1 November. </PARA>
<PARA>General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade-Government Procurement Code</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> Removal of the preference margin would allow fresh consideration of Australia's accession to the code should the Government decide that this will offer advantages to Australian industry. At present we are unable to sign as a result of the protective nature of the preference margin. </PARA>
<PARA> To reiterate, purchasing reform is an important part of the Government's programs for economic improvements. Greater public sector efficiency and improved access for local suppliers has a beneficial effect right down the line. And it is consistent with and complementary to the Government's programs for the development and restructuring of Australian industry. </PARA>
<PARA> The issues have been thoroughly canvassed by all the interested parties. We all want better government purchasing systems that save time and money, improve service and performance and encourage local suppliers. We don't want symbolic reforms or to continue with processes that are outmoded or unworkable. </PARA>
<PARA> We aim to make purchasing by government conform to the best practices of the private sector. </PARA>
<PARA> Certainly, we will demonstrate for all to see our clear commitment to the development and strengthening of Australian industry and we will show our equally strong commitment to the anti-discriminatory principles underlying the national preference agreement. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That the Senate take note of the statement. </PARA>
<PARA>The Liberal and National parties welcome the thrust of the statement and the stated intention of placing a new emphasis on value for money in government purchasing. We also welcome the proposed reduction in regulation and the simplification of contracts which are detailed in this joint statement. Indeed, the statement picks up a number of Liberal and National parties policies, and I welcome that. </PARA>
<PARA> The problems for Australian manufacturers is that this Government is still not addressing the basic problems of macro-economic and micro-economic reform and until it does so Australian manufacturers will face great difficulties in competing with their international counterparts. Further, the statement is short on detail, especially costing, and proposes the establishment of yet another bureaucratic office which does not augur well for reforms aimed at addressing excessive regulation which has for so long been a feature of the purchasing environment of this Government. The absence of detail and costing and the failure to include these proposals in the 1989-90 Budget is indicative of the haste with which these proposals have been brought forward and I believe that they have been brought forward for a political purpose. They have been brought forward at this late hour in this Government's life so that the Government will be able to say at the election, `Oh yes, we were addressing these matters when we went to the people; have a look at the statement'. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course, this Government is long on statements and short on action. I doubt whether it will have much time to implement these proposals, although I welcome them, and I hope that it arranges to implement them. It would indeed be most welcome if the key objectives as outlined in the statement were achieved and if they ultimately led to more purchases from Australian manufacturers. But I have to say that the Hawke Government's record on regulation review does not inspire confidence in its ability to simplify purchasing procedures. The Government's failure to deliver on its rhetoric does not inspire confidence in its ability to deliver this package. As I said, this Government is long on talk and short on action. I hope that this will not be so with this statement of intention in relation to government purchasing. Australian industry would welcome relief from the heavy burden of on-costs. Australian industry would welcome a reduction in the heavy burden of regulations and welcome micro-economic and macro-economic reforms that would enable it to compete domestically and internationally with overseas industry. </PARA>
<PARA> The most important point about this proposal is the removal of the 20 per cent preference margin for Australian tenders on Commonwealth Government purchases. The Hawke-Keating Government now expects, or will from November of this year, Australian manufacturers to compete with overseas manufacturers, without preference, while continuing to allow them to be subject to crippling burdens such as interest rates currently running at up to 25 per cent on their overdrafts; a rigid industrial relations system which grants across the board wage rises regardless of productivity increases; as I mentioned before, ruinous on-costs and penalties; and the Hawke-Keating Government's failure to address properly the need to reform coastal shipping, the need to reform the waterfront, the need to address itself to the problems of the transport industry and the need to free up the communications industry. I also refer to this Government's failure to take any steps which would enable employers to attack current restrictive work practices. </PARA>
<PARA> The Hawke Government is also imposing on Australian manufacturers the burden of refusing to reduce the enormous volume of paperwork and overregulation which is imposed upon them. Indeed, while the Hawke Government refuses to address these fundamental issues Senator Button wonders why his policies are not working. Indeed, he has publicly acknowledged that his policies for industry are wrong. I say to Senator Button that they continue to be wrong and not to work because the Australian Labor Party refuses to address the fundamental defects of our economy. </PARA>
<PARA> The statement glosses over the real problems of the economy of this nation and attempts to con the people of Australia into believing that delivery of a statement of intention is the same as delivery of the goods. We wait to see, because that is not so, as has been amply demonstrated by this Government's repeated statements about micro-economic reform and its repeated failure to address micro-economic reform. I do hope that this statement will be not just another statement that goes into the drawer of things this Government has talked about but not acted upon. I hope we do see some action in the delivery of this package to the benefit of Australian manufacturers. </PARA>
<PARA> There is one particular matter on which I have made many speeches publicly outside the Senate and within the Senate. I am delighted to see that Senator Button has picked up my point and that in future contracts emphasis will be placed on the use of functional specifications rather than detailed technical specifications. This will give local suppliers the opportunity to offer cost-effective and innovative solutions to user requirements. What does all that technical language mean? In simple language, it means that, instead of government officers being technical experts and saying, for example, in relation to computers, `What we want is an IBM XYZ computer operating in this area doing this job, a Wang computer in this area doing this job and a Digital computer in this area doing this job' with detailed software all worked out by government employees, many of whom will have been duchessed by the international companies whose programs and equipment they have specified, the Government will simply say, `We want a computer to provide this result'-in other words, a functional specification rather than a detailed technical specification. </PARA>
<PARA> Then Australian manufacturers will be able to put forward propositions which incorporate their equipment, maybe in conjunction with imported equipment, which will result in Australian manufacturers being given the opportunity to tender successfully whereas at present, because of the way in which the tender documents are written, frequently Australian manufacturers are excluded by the tender document from being able to enter into the field. It is a matter upon which, as I have said, I have spoken frequently. I am delighted to see that Senator Button and his colleague have picked up my recommendations in this regard and implemented them in this document. I do hope that it is not just a statement of intention but becomes a fact. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to speak only briefly on this ministerial statement and to make several points. Firstly, it is extremely poorly written. I find it rather offensive to have to read gobbledegook, to have difficulty in working out exactly what is meant and also to have to wade through an enormous number of completely unnecessary words. The document could have been shortened enormously and said exactly the same thing. I want to give a few examples of poor English. It states, `The following requirements have been undertaken'. One does not undertake requirements. On page 7 one finds the statement:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>. . . to develop a role in promoting Australian and New Zealand industry . . .</PARA>
<PARA>What is wrong with `promoting Australian and New Zealand industry'? There is no point in the extra words. It states that it will `manage a public sector education program'. How about using the words `educating the public'? On page 8 of the typescript of the statement there is a double tautology when the argument twists back on itself. It reads:</PARA>
<PARA> Removal of the preference margin would allow fresh consideration of Australia's accession to the code-</PARA>
<PARA>referring to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade code-</PARA>
<PARA>should the Government decide that this will offer advantages to Australian industry. At present we are unable to sign as a result of the protective nature of the preference margin. </PARA>
<PARA>One does not know what the advantages are or to whom it is referring. One could refer to inefficiency in regard to some government purchasing by mentioning the recent purchase of photocopiers for senatorial offices. I was sent specifications for two photocopiers and asked to decide between the two photocopiers in order to replace the one that was in my office. Having an interest in using the least possible amount of paper, I selected a photocopier which, according to the specifications, would double side and collate. The photocopier was duly delivered to my office. I understand that this experience has been shared by other senators. When I proceeded to try to make it double side and collate, I found that I could not work the knobs on it to get it to do that. </PARA>
<PARA> The service lady came out and looked at the machine. She said, `Yes, you press this button to do that and this button to do something else'. When she had finished I said, `Yes, but I want to be able to double side and collate'. She stooped down and opened a drawer in the base of the photocopier and said, `To get it to do that you have to have this extra little piece which goes in down here'. I said, `I bought this machine believing that it had that little piece so that it would double side and collate'. She said, `That wasn't in the contract'. Clearly, there had been a slip-up between the information which was provided to my office and on which I had made a choice, and the contract which had gone to the supplier. To compound matters, I then said, `Well what happens if I buy the piece out of my electorate allowance and put it in because I am keen not to use so much paper?'. I was then told that if I bought anything and attached it to the photocopier it would abrogate the service contract for the photocopier and that furthermore the Department would not buy the extra piece of equipment to attach to the photocopier. </PARA>
<PARA> Another point to be made about this example is that in many instances when staff are very heavily loaded with photocopying duties, the photocopying is done only on one side of the paper when in many instances it would be quite appropriate to use both sides of the paper. So more paper is being used unnecessarily. I pose the question: Did anybody do the sums, not just on purchasing the photocopier, but on the actual lifetime cost of the photocopier plus the paper that goes through it? I suggest that nobody bothered to do the sums because if he had done so, he may well have found that the purchase of that extra bit of capital equipment would have not only saved money in terms of purchasing of paper but also conserved paper, and that is an important point. </PARA>
<PARA> One could also look at the purchasing of computing equipment for Parliament House and the way in which we have been provided with software which does not easily interface with software outside Parliament House. The software requires special instruction and quite a considerable number of staff to be available to provide assistance. A so-called `help desk' had to be created. The purchase of more usual software may well have avoided a great deal of that cost. It may be that the initial capital cost of the software was low, but what is the lifetime cost of running that software if we have to maintain a large staff of people to help us when we have problems? The software is not a particularly well designed piece of software, in particular with respect to word processing, but it is even less user friendly with respect to a number of other features. </PARA>
<PARA> The document before us, as I have indicated, is long on rhetoric and is not particularly specific with the exception that it seeks to remove the 20 per cent margin which has been a nominal margin provided to the purchase of Australian equipment up to the time, I think it is 1 November, when it will be removed. I stress to the Government that in making this sort of decision it is important that the total overall costs are considered. If, for argument's sake, one has a choice between buying an Australian piece of equipment and buying an overseas piece of equipment and the purchase of the overseas piece of equipment necessarily involves a downturn in Australian industry, a change in our foreign exchange and, perhaps, the unemployment of Australians-Australians going on to the dole-what is the total cost of making that sort of decision? We should be looking not just at the cost of the equipment in isolation but at the total effect of the purchase of that equipment, either within Australia or outside Australia, on the total Australian economy. It may well be that a substantial margin in favour of Australian purchases is, overall, beneficial. </PARA>
<PARA> The only other point I wish to comment on is the desirability that Australian Government purchases also be associated with any import duties that are payable on those purchases. This would seem to me to be a reasonable way of making those comparative assessments provided, and I stress again, that the associated costs such as the lifetime costs of the use of the equipment, that may well be borne if purchases outside Australia are made, are taken into account. A fairer way of considering those costs would be if the import costs included the import duty, if any is payable. </PARA>
<PARA> The area is clearly an important one. The Minister for Local Government (Senator Reynolds) draws our attention to the fact that public sector purchasing runs to the extent of $7 billion to $8 billion per year or 4 per cent of gross domestic product. It is important that we do better in this area, that we make better choices. I suspect that many of those choices will be better only if we get more competent people doing the assessments and those more directly involved in the use of the equipment having some say in how those choices are determined. Certainly, the point that has already been stressed in relation to emphasis on performance rather than narrow technical descriptions is a valid one. I am aware from the past, working in a former government department, of the way in which the call for tenders was often written with a particular piece of equipment in mind. In fact, the specifications for that equipment were virtually copied into the tender documents and made it extremely difficult for other tenderers to meet those precise specifications. A more generous and function-oriented description of the equipment would help in that area. </PARA>
<PARA> In conclusion, I do not find this document all that satisfactory. It does not really give us a great deal of indication as to where the Government is going with the exception of the tariff and the removal of the 20 per cent safety margin. It remains to be seen in practice whether this package results in more efficient ways and a more effective government purchasing regimen. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-The annual report of the Commonwealth Bank Group was tabled by the President in the Senate yesterday. I congratulate the Commonwealth Bank Group on the quite clear improvement in its finances and, more importantly, on what those financial results reveal about its improved efficiency of performance in 1988-89. But in doing so-and I will come back to that point-I also draw the attention of the Senate to the fact that the report from the Board of the Commonwealth Banking Corporation contains one or two comments which I think are of more general interest in so far as they touch upon the state of the banking industry and, more particularly, the state of financial markets under the great pressure which the Government, through its tight monetary policy-high interest rates-is placing upon those financial markets. I quote from page 2 of the report where the Chairman of the Board, Mr Besley, who signed this report on behalf of the Board, states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>Towards the end of the year, the operating environment was marked by sharp increases in interest rates associated with a progressive tightening of monetary policy aimed at excessively strong demand, inflationary pressures and Australia's external imbalance. While the monetary stance adopted by the authorities has contributed to some moderation in the pace of economic activity-</PARA>
<PARA>I interpolate to say that the degree of moderation is not overly apparent-</PARA>
<PARA>its effort on credit markets has been particularly significant, resulting in a weakening of the underlying position of many companies. </PARA>
<PARA>Given the kind of language which the Commonwealth Bank Board uses in reports of this kind, I regard that as rather sombre stuff. It is reminiscent in that respect of the Reserve Bank's annual report for 1989, which was presented and debated in this chamber about six weeks ago, just after the Budget. A little more on the same aspect appears on page 10 of the report, where, in discussing the question of its provision for bad and doubtful debts-a vastly increased provision, I might note in passing-the bank says:</PARA>
<PARA> Earnings had to bear a considerably increased charge for bad and doubtful debts, as higher interest costs on financing found out weaknesses in business cash flows . . . Careful analysis of accounts resulted in a charge against profit of $200.4 million to write off bad debts and provide for specific doubtful debts. This was about double the comparable charge of $104.5 million in 1987-88. </PARA>
<PARA>I will skip a couple of sentences in order not to make the quotes too long. The bank goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA>In striking this provision, the Bank took a more than usually conservative approach, to allow for the likelihood of testing times ahead for the economy. </PARA>
<PARA>In discussing the Reserve Bank annual report I pointed out that Reserve Bank boards, and in this case boards of the Commonwealth Banking Corporation, are not given to flamboyant or overly alarmist language. Language of the kind I have just been quoting is, I think, rather strong by the standards of these reports. This commercial bank-a government-owned bank, of course, but a bank operating within the commercial banking sector-is saying to the public and, indeed, to the Treasurer (Mr Keating) and to this Parliament, to which this report has been presented, `Notwithstanding that the economy at present appears to be bobbing along rather buoyantly, don't make any mistake about it; the very high interest rates that have been imposed upon us by the Reserve Bank at the Treasurer's behest are slowly but surely weakening the underlying financial standing of many of our customers. Therefore, we as a prudent commercial bank have felt it wise and appropriate to virtually double our provision for bad and doubtful debts in our accounts for the year just ended'.</PARA>
<PARA> I note in passing that those remarks by the Commonwealth Bank Board are fully in line with the views stated-again, in rather unusually blunt terms-in the latest Commonwealth Bank Economic Newsletter, which was released last weekend, and in an accompanying press release in which Mr Paul McCarthy, the Chief Economist of the Commonwealth Bank, who would of course have had a hand in writing the very passages I have just been quoting from this annual report, has said:</PARA>
<PARA>With no signs yet of an across-the-board moderation in domestic demand, and imports continuing to trend higher, there are no prospects of any decline in interest rates until some way into 1990. </PARA>
<PARA>At a later point of his remarks-again, I will be sparing in my quotation of this very interesting Economic Newsletter because I am using it only to back up the point that was made in the Commonwealth Bank report-Mr McCarthy said:</PARA>
<PARA>Even when an economic downturn is clearly underway-</PARA>
<PARA>which he foresees presumably early next year-</PARA>
<PARA>the vulnerability of the exchange rate to a rapid decline in interest rates is likely to see monetary policy eased cautiously rather than aggressively. </PARA>
<PARA>So much for those aspects of the Commonwealth Bank's annual report which deal with what I might call the macro-economic or, if you like, the monetary environment within which the bank is operating or seeking to operate. </PARA>
<PARA> Another aspect of the report on which I want to touch very briefly is the quite clear, I would say, quantum leap, almost, in efficiency of operation of the bank during the past 12 months. There are at least three indicators of that given in the report. There is first of all the reference on page 10 of the report to the return on average equity which in 1988-89 rose sharply to 14.63 per cent from a figure of just over 10 per cent-10.01 per cent-in the previous year. I think one only has to look at those two figures to see that something very significant happened to the bank's performance in 1988-89. Interestingly enough, the bank makes the point that this has nothing to do with a greater return from the pure interest rate effects. It is not due to higher interest rates. In fact, the bank actually says that the margin of the average interest earned over the average interest paid to its depositors fell slightly during the year from 3.97 per cent in 1987-88 to 3.84 per cent in 1988-89. So what we are really looking at is simply a more efficient operation and not an operation which is simply having its profits increased because interest rates have risen. On the contrary. </PARA>
<PARA> One obvious area where that increased efficiency is being found is indicated by the comment on page 11 of the report relating to staff costs where the report notes:</PARA>
<PARA>Staff costs as a percentage of total net income were reduced to 37.9% . . . </PARA>
<PARA>And it goes on to describe this as:</PARA>
<PARA>a dramatic improvement on the ratios of 40.3% in 1987/88 and 52.7% five years ago. </PARA>
<PARA>I think one would have to say that those figures speak for themselves. Finally, the report notes on page 5 a significant improvement in the bank's risk-weighted capital ratio. I apologise for that piece of jargon, Mr Acting Deputy President, but the Reserve Bank of Australia has made that kind of jargon necessary nowadays because of its new capital ratio requirements. The report simply says on that:</PARA>
<PARA>As at 30 June 1989, the Group's risk-weighted capital ratio was 9.56% compared with 7.33% a year earlier. This is comfortably above the 8% ratio required by the Reserve Bank of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA>So I think one must say that all of that is very encouraging in terms of the present management and direction of the bank. But, in conclusion, just let me say that I am sure I do not utter any blinding flash of revelation for the bank's management in pointing out that all banks these days are more and more dependent on the growth of their capital base and the Commonwealth Bank, most of all of our four major banks in this country, is most handicapped in that regard. And while it is encouraging to see that the Commonwealth Bank Group's risk-weighted capital ratio at the end of June this year was comfortably above the requirement laid down by the Reserve Bank, nevertheless the bank would itself, I am sure, be the first to agree that that situation will not necessarily remain if the bank is to grow without at the same time being able to raise new capital in one way or another. Of course, the Opposition's policy in that regard for the privatisation of the bank provides the clear avenue for it to move out into the capital markets in its own right, in a way which it presently finds great difficulty in doing, and thereby to maintain its position-its proud position-within the Australian banking scene and to provide a future for all its many and highly professional employees. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise ever so briefly to record some comments in respect of this inquiry, and I do so as a not detached senator, but rather one who have the dubious distinction of being on the Senate Standing Committee on Environment, Recreation and the Arts which was inquiring into drugs in sport. It was as a result of evidence provided to the Committee that this reference was made to the Committee of Privileges. Mr Acting Deputy President, it relates essentially to evidence given to the Committee by one Miss Sue Howland, and action purported subsequently taken by Mr Greg Blood, following Miss Howland's evidence.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I wish to put two matters on the record. The first is that Miss Sue Howland-Suzanne Howland-appeared before the Committee on subpoena and not on a voluntary basis, and secondly, the evidence she gave to the Committee was on the basis of that subpoena and as a result of questions asked of her due to her attendance. Miss Howland produced at that hearing a laboratory result and the request for the test, and the findings of the laboratory result. The test was to find the testosterone/epitestosterone ratio of Miss Howland. It is a standard test that athletes take when they want to find whether they can cheat the system. It is a test they take to determine whether the ratio is within the acceptable limit so as not to have them test positive following a meet, and therefore to be disqualified. </PARA>
<PARA> Miss Howland had that done by a doctor at the Australian Institute of Sport, and paid for by taxpayers. Miss Howland provided evidence in respect of that document during the hearing of 1 December. Miss Howland was living at a home owned by Mr Greg Blood, an employee-in fact a librarian-of the Australian Institute of Sport. Following Miss Howland's evidence to the Committee and upon her returning home, she found herself with a note which read:</PARA>
<PARA>I'm afraid you will have to look for alternative accommodation as soon as possible. I'm sick and tired of the drugs in sport. You can say what you like, I can choose who lives in my house. It was a very hard decision to make. </PARA>
<PARA>It was on that basis that Miss Howland first contacted the Committee. One of the terms of the Privileges Committee was to inquire into interference with witnesses and it reads:</PARA>
<PARA>A person shall not, by fraud, intimidation, force or threat of any kind, by the offer or promise of any inducement or benefit of any kind, or by other improper means, influence another person in respect of any evidence given or to be given before the Senate or a committee, or induce another person to refrain from giving such evidence. </PARA>
<PARA>Mr Blood had made it clear to Miss Howland previously that if she gave evidence she would be required to leave his home. That reference was handed to the Committee. I do not propose, nor would it in my mind be proper, to reflect upon the findings of the Committee, but it did find that Mr Blood had not committed a contempt of the Committee. Notwithstanding that, Mr Blood's actions were ones which I would have thought were likely, by any measure, to influence the evidence of Miss Howland and weigh, to some extent, upon her mind in the level of evidence that she gave, particularly given that the evidence was by and large within her knowledge and nobody else's. </PARA>
<PARA> It is not unreasonable to say that Miss Sue Howland is not one easily intimidated. She is robust both in physique and character and unlikely, I would have thought, to be subject to any emotional duress from Mr Blood who, on the other hand, was found by the Committee to be a person timid in nature. He found himself under considerable stress. The Committee notes that he perceived a number of conflicts between loyalty to his friend and to his employer; his desire that there should be a free flow of information and that issues relating to drugs in sport should be resolved, on the one hand, and his fear that he might be implicated in the dissemination of the information in an atmosphere of tension; and his somewhat sensitive personality and a battle, not of his making, between a forceful personality and the organisation where he worked. It appears to the Committee that Mr Blood took the action he did in a state of stress and was motivated by a desire to obtain relief from the stressful situation in which he found himself. I think that that is absolutely right. But what was not examined, and the Committee would not have had the capacity to examine it, was what duress or influence was cast upon Mr Blood by the Australian Institute of Sport. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the difficulties I have in reading this report is when the Committee perceives the conflicts between loyalty to his friend and to his employer. Quite frankly, that should not have been a conflict to Mr Blood. The acceptance of one is not the rejection of the other. I would have thought that the Australian Institute of Sport-his employer-would have been, and to my knowledge it was, a willing participant in the inquiry. It ought not to have caused any stress or affliction upon Mr Blood to have somebody living in his home give evidence that did not necessarily reflect generously upon employees at the Institute. My understanding from evidence given by the Institute was that it was fastidious and diligent in its endeavours to ensure that if there were any wrongs at the Institute they would be put right, if there were any improprieties they would be rectified and if there were any faults they would be corrected. I raise this because there was a great deal of difficulty for the Committee in finding witnesses who felt unencumbered, uninhibited and free to give unqualified evidence before the Committee. So very often it was brought to our attention that athletes were subject to communication from their peers, from coaches and, on more than one occasion, from employees at the Institute of Sport when it became public knowledge that they were giving evidence to the Committee. Once it became public knowledge, those people, by way of those communications, invariably found themselves subject to one form of duress or another. Miss Howland found herself in that category. </PARA>
<PARA> While the Committee has completed much of its collection of evidence, there is some way yet to go. I hope the fact that this matter was taken with the seriousness with which it has been by the Committee will mean that future witnesses will feel free and discharged from duress in giving their evidence before the Committee, particularly that which is given by way of subpoena. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the report. </PARA>
<PARA> The statement read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA> `Sheep Husbandry' is the fifth report of the Senate Select Committee on Animal Welfare. It follows reports on live sheep exports, dolphins and whales in captivity, kangaroos, and animal experimentation. The Committee is currently inquiring into intensive livestock production and the animal welfare aspects of the racing industry. </PARA>
<PARA> In the initial spate of general submissions received by the Committee in 1984, a number of groups and individuals expressed their concern about certain practices associated with sheep production in Australia. In particular, the surgical procedures of castration and mulesing were highlighted as being inimical to sheep welfare. The adequacy of shelter for newly-shorn sheep and new-born lambs was questioned, as was the general level of supervision of sheep in the extensive environment. Other concerns were for the welfare of sheep following natural disasters. The desirability of raising sheep at all in the semi-arid zones was questioned on both welfare and ecological grounds. </PARA>
<PARA> From the many competing animal welfare issues brought to the attention of the Committee, the welfare of sheep was selected for investigation not only because of the concerns expressed above but also because of the fear that, in an industry as economically significant as that of sheep and wool, the best interests of the sheep might always come a poor second to economic considerations. </PARA>
<PARA> By inquiring into sheep husbandry issues, the Committee provided a forum for sheep producers and others involved in `using' sheep to meet and exchange views with animal welfare groups. As the Committee's inquiry progressed, each group came to accept that the other had some legitimate concerns. Producers acknowledged that some of their practices could be improved, while welfare groups acknowledged that some of their proposals were unreasonable. The Committee is heartened, however, to see that both sides are now prepared to engage in more constructive debate on the issues which still separate them. </PARA>
<PARA> In considering the basic needs of the sheep, particularly access to adequate nutrition, the Committee concludes that at least some of the sheep welfare problems in this regard stem from a lack of knowledge on the part of some producers of the nutritive value of their pastures. The Committee encourages State departments of agriculture to the more forthright in publicising their guidelines concerning the amount, quality and continuity of feed necessary to maintain sheep health and to meet the specific physiological requirements for growth, pregnancy, lacta- tion, cold stress and survival following natural disasters. </PARA>
<PARA> Protection from climatic extremes is another basic sheep welfare need, but one which is clearly not being satisfactorily met by at least some sheep producers. The Committee believes that all sheep producers must provide whatever form of shelter is suitable for their location-stands of trees, sheds, windbreaks, grass shelter belts or sheep coats. If sheep continue to suffer and die from the lack of adequate shelter, the producers who permit this to occur ought to be prosecuted under the relevant State prevention of cruelty to animals legislation. </PARA>
<PARA>The Committee is particularly concerned at the level of lamb losses in Australia. It recommends that the industry, together with the State departments of agriculture, develop lamb loss parameters for the common breeds of sheep in each district, as a minimum target at which producers should aim. It further recommends that research be continued into the most effective forms of shelter, on a regional basis, and that the results of that research be widely and promptly disseminated. Other research recommended by the Committee to enhance the survival chances of new-borne lambs includes work into the cost-benefits of using ultrasound imaging on ewes in early pregnancy, and into improving the mothering ability of Merino Ewes. Research into vaccines to promote fecundity should, the Committee believes, be linked to work on improving lamb survival rates. </PARA>
<PARA> After considering the practice of tail-docking lambs, the Committee concludes that it is probably a helpful management procedure, though one which should take place at an early age. The Committee, however, believes that no tails should be docked completely for aesthetic reasons. </PARA>
<PARA> Other surgical interventions appear to cause lambs a great deal of temporary distress. The Committee questions the need for the castration of ram lambs destined for early slaughter. It recommends continued research into alternatives, such as immunocastration. </PARA>
<PARA> The distress caused to sheep by flystrike is of major concern to the Committee, as are many of the prevention and control measures. The Committee particularly finds the practice of mulesing abhorrent, but accepts that it is, for the present, necessary. Clearly mulesing cannot be eliminated overnight without causing further suffering to sheep from flystrike. However, the Committee recommends continued research into all means of preventing blowfly strike, so that the need for mulesing is ultimately removed. </PARA>
<PARA> Faulty dentition usually results in the culling of the sheep concerned. The Committee was therefore interested to receive evidence on the practice of teeth grinding to rectify that fault. Research into the practice to date, however, has not produced demonstrable benefits for the treated sheep. The Committee considers that until such benefits are demonstrated, teeth grinding as a preventative measure for whole flocks should be discouraged. </PARA>
<PARA> Electro-immobilisation as a means of sheep restraint is viewed by the Committee with some disquiet. The Committee would prefer to see the development of innovative, less stressful restraint alternatives. In the meantime, the Committee urges that the technique be applied with caution until further research clarifies the stress parameters associated with its use, and whether or not it has an analgesic effect. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee is supportive of recent innovations in sheep handling and marketing, which lessen the stresses associated with these practices. It particularly welcomes the advent of computer-aided livestock marketing which lessens the amount of movement sheep have to undergo, and eliminates the discomfort of saleyards and the additional travelling time. </PARA>
<PARA> The degree of supervision of Australian sheep raised extensively was the subject of considerable criticism before the Committee. The Committee is perhaps more concerned at the husbandry skills of the persons working in the sheep and wool industry, rather than their number, and supports calls for more training in behaviour-based skills in animal handling. </PARA>
<PARA> Changes to the traditional method of removing wool from sheep were viewed and considered by the Committee, given the costs and stresses of manual shearing. The Committee recommends that research be continued into both biological wool harvesting and robotic shearing, and in the short term, it recommends continued research into improving manual shearing practices. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee considered the objectives of sheep breeders striving for improved performance from their flocks. Substantial progress can be made by rigorous conventional selection for desired characteristics, including welfare objectives such as resistance to fleece rot. The increasing tendency particularly of studs to favour artificial reproductive techniques, either artificial insemination or embryo transfer, leads the Committee to urge that the techniques are only performed by persons with appropriate qualifications. </PARA>
<PARA> Genetic engineering of sheep is still in the experimental phase. The Committee considers that genetic manipulation may hold great promise for sheep welfare, and as such, continued research into its applications should be supported. An imported proviso, however, is that the relevant ethics committees are satisfied with the research protocols. </PARA>
<PARA> The welfare of sheep during and after natural disasters is of considerable concern to the Committee. The 1982-83 drought brought about high levels of sheep losses, not all of which could have been avoided. The Committee is not of the opinion that drought relief subsidies are the answer to the problem. Such subsidies appear to have been operating inequitably and are potentially open to abuse. The Committee is particularly concerned at the ecological and welfare problems presented by overstocking, and recommends that guidelines be devised on conservation farming techniques. </PARA>
<PARA> In addition to considering the specific welfare issues raised, the Committee also addressed the question of what to do when breaches of acceptable welfare standards occur. Cases of gross cruelty or neglect are covered by State legislation dealing with prevention of cruelty to animals, but few prosecutions involving sheep ever reach the courts, partly because of the difficulty in defining what constitutes acceptable sheep husbandry. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee remains unconvinced that industry self-regulation is working effectively. The few bad sheep producers are not being removed quickly enough for the good of the sheep. Appending codes of accepted sheep husbandry practice to legislation, as has been done in Victoria, results in more successful prosecutions. The Committee recommends that State governments increase the number of RSPCA inspectors authorised under the relevant State prevention of cruelty to animals legislation, to ensure that all complaints can be acted upon promptly. </PARA>
<PARA> In the view of the Committee, the only viable approach to achieve the well-being of sheep in the longer term is producer education. The sheep and wool industry must be more active in ensuring that its members act responsibly at all times. The Committee supports the continued development and regular review of codes of sheep husbandry practice at State and federal level, both as a means of bringing together all groups concerned with sheep welfare and as statements of considerable moral weight, whether or not they are appended to legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> I commend the report to the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This is the second report in a very short time from the Senate Select Committee on Animal Welfare. I am very pleased to see that we are at last starting to get some reports tabled in the House. As with the previous report on animal experimentation, there is no dissenting report. The report has been agreed to by all members of the Committee. That in itself reflects the attitude not only of the Committee members but also of those people that gave evidence. Most of us know that Australians benefit very much from sheep raising in Australia, whether it be from the $6 billion per annum export earnings that we receive, from the wool, from the woollen suits and dresses that we wear or from the meat we eat. A well-known and well-worn saying for many years has been, `Australia rides on the sheep's back'.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Over the years there have been, no doubt, many reports, papers and books written about sheep, but there are very few, if any, reports written about the actual welfare of the animal, questioning the husbandry practices that have evolved over the years in the industry. In chapter 1 there is a very concise history and outline of the industry which began, as far as Australia is concerned, in 1807 when Captain John Macarthur introduced 26 merino sheep from the Cape of Good Hope and thereby started the Australian wool industry. From that day on sheep and wool have become very big export earners for Australia, culminating in 1987-88 when the sheep and wool industry was Australia's largest single export earner. </PARA>
<PARA> When talking about the sheep and meat industry, though, we must remember that it survives in a very highly competitive market, with wool always under threat from synthetics and sheep meat always in very strong competition with beef, poultry and pork. Any changes in viability, therefore, could have a very profound effect on the sheep. With competition and rising costs always a threat to the industry, coupled with the vagaries of our climate, it is sometimes easy to forget the welfare of the animal itself. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee pointed out in its previous report on the live sheep export trade that society has a duty to see that undue suffering is not caused to animals and that we cannot accept that the duty should be set aside in order that food may be produced more cheaply. Where unacceptable suffering can be eliminated only at extra cost, that cost should be borne or the product forgone. On the other hand, all methods of domestic livestock rearing entail some loss of freedom and where an imperfect, but not unacceptable, system can be improved only at a disproportionate cost, it may be unreasonable to insist that this be done. </PARA>
<PARA> Today, with more people living in suburbia questioning the practices that have never been questioned in the past, it was pleasing to see during the course of our inquiry that there was an airing of many different views. It was certainly pleasing to see the positive attitude that was adopted by all those who gave evidence. The bringing together of the views of the producers, the researchers, and those who have become violently opposed to some aspects of sheep husbandry was one of the major achievements of our Committee. Just as in the animal experimentation inquiry, the benefit of all sides putting their arguments publicly will be of immense benefit to the community as a whole. Producers were keen to hear the concerns from responsible animal welfare groups. Conversely, the same groups concerned with welfare issues acknowledged that some of their proposals were unreasonable and they were prepared to modify some of their approaches. </PARA>
<PARA> Without going into too much detail, I would like to comment on some of the major areas of concern. As a lot of sheep are bred to die at a young age, the main issue as far as the Committee was concerned was the quality of life and the care during the life span. The main requirements for sheep, as we all know, are good food, ample water and good husbandry techniques. Some of the main issues raised about husbandry were with regard to sheep losses, mulesing, transport and neglect of sheep. Whilst not denying that there are significant losses of newly shorn sheep and newborn lambs, during the evidence that was given to the Committee I must say that I was concerned at some of the quite obvious extravagant claims of losses that were made. I believe that some of them were based on quite false figures. But regardless of some of these doubtful claims, the evidence given certainly raised a great deal of concern about stock losses. Many of these losses are due to unpredictable weather. Nevertheless, there is no doubt in my mind that an adequate supply of shelter was a No. 1 priority. I certainly agree with our recommendation regarding an increased provision of shelter, combined with more investigation into breeding and lambing techniques, particularly with merino sheep. </PARA>
<PARA> A great deal of the report deals with lamb losses and lamb practices. The most vigorous debate occurred when we entered the areas of lamb marking and mulesing. A great deal of evidence was given on these matters. The Committee took the time to make on-farm inspections and investigate some of these practices. It is interesting to note the recommendations that were brought forward as a result. I quote from recommendation 10.11:</PARA>
<PARA>No sheep have its tail completely removed. </PARA>
<PARA>There was a reason for that. Some operators had been taking the tail completely off the animal, thus depriving it of something with which to keep the flies away, and also allowing that particular area to become sunburnt and therefore in some cases develop skin cancer. As far as the castrating of lambs was concerned, we recommended that there be continued research into immunocastration whereby the animals are actually castrated by the use of an injection. </PARA>
<PARA> When we looked at the area of mulesing, feelings started to run high. As a sheep producer, I find mulesing cruel and visually offensive, but when I compare it to the alternative of flystrike, reluctantly, I must say that mulesing, in the short term anyway, has to be accepted. I was pleased that one of our biggest critics of mulesing, Christine Townend, also reluctantly accepted that, in the short term anyway, mulesing was a practice that should be accepted. I think the Committee was heartened by the vast amount of research that seems to be going into the control of flystrike in particular, because flystrike is one of the biggest curses of the sheep industry. It costs the industry something like $1m a year. A great deal of time and effort is being put into trying to find alternative methods to mulesing. I am quite convinced, having spoken to the researchers, that in the next three or four years there will be a chemical means of mulesing sheep. Hopefully, practices such as mulesing will fade into the past. </PARA>
<PARA> We were also very impressed with the research into shearing. Of course, shearing is one of the major tasks of the sheep industry. Evidence was given on robotic shearing. We were also given quite a deal of evidence on the use of epidermal growth factor, a natural chemical produced by sheep that is used for defleecing the sheep. I believe that that particular method has a great future. However, like everything else, it still has a long way to go. In the meantime, we recommended that research be continued into alternatives to conventional shearing. We also recommended that research be continued into improvements to manual shearing. </PARA>
<PARA> Two other concerns were raised about sheep farming. One was the practice of raising sheep on marginal country. This is opening up another debate; it is not one that I will dwell on today because I believe it will be discussed in the soil degradation and environment debate. Certainly, evidence was given that sheep raised in some marginal country was likely to make such country more drought stricken than normal. There was also the effect of overgrazing of the land, which was a matter of personal concern to all of us. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, I would like to touch on a matter which was not dealt with in the report, although it may have been touched on briefly, but which is of concern to me. I am concerned about the increasing number of hobby farmers in and around metropolitan areas. I believe that, in looking at the question of sheep husbandry and cruelty to sheep, that is one area in which the Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (RSPCA) and other like organisations should be taking much more notice because there is a lot of evidence to show that many sheep are attacked and wounded or killed by dogs in these areas. There is a lot of evidence to suggest poor husbandry, because of little knowledge by the owners of flystrike, pizzle rot, lice and all those sorts of things that sheep become infested with; that the suburban sheep owners do not really know enough about the breeding or husbandry of sheep, nor do they have the facilities to look after them correctly. We end up with interbreeding of sheep and the straying of sheep and lambs all over the place. Quite honestly, I believe that this is an area that the RSPCA in particular should be looking at. I think our final recommendation was that State and Territory governments increase the number of RSPCA inspectors authorised under the relevant State prevention of cruelty to animals legislation and provide additional funding to support them. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that this document, like the animal experimentation document, is a very professional report. It is put together very well, in a manner that is easy to understand. I believe that this report will become a very important reference document for those people interested in the welfare of sheep. I commend the attitude of all those concerned, including those who gave evidence, and particularly our staff for the amount of work put in by them, especially Paul Barsdell. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to say a few words about the report of the Select Committee on Animal Welfare. It is a good report. As Senator Calvert has said, it is a mine of information. The people who have put it together have done it in a very professional and competent manner.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I would like to talk about mulesing, which caused me a lot of concern. I think we have to talk about what mulesing is. `Mulesing' is a nice word for a very brutal practice, which involves the taking of a flap of skin some five inches long and two or three inches wide from under the tail of a sheep with shears. The sheep is grabbed with the hand, a kind of a fold is created and the skin and attendant hair are cut away from the area. It is a brutal and bloody operation. We observed it in the field. Many of the animal welfare people have reacted violently against the technique because, as Senator Calvert has said, it is brutal. It should be replaced. </PARA>
<PARA> The unfortunate fact is, however, that the consequences of not mulesing-in other words, leaving the sheep with a matt of hair underneath the tail-is fly strike. The area is wet from urine and faeces, the flies lay their eggs in the area and then the eggs hatch. That causes far more distress to the sheep than mulesing. Can one imagine how it must feel to a sheep to have fly larvae actually growing within its flesh? That is what happens. The recommendation was -I believe this to be a very strong recommendation-that mulesing cease as soon as research has developed a way of stopping flystrike. </PARA>
<PARA> I think we all agree-Senator Calvert nods in agreement-that mulesing should cease. It was a very difficult decision for me because mulesing is a brutal operation, but flystrike is even harder on the animal in terms of animal welfare and animal suffering; therefore I did support the continued use of mulesing. But I urge everyone in the industry to heed our recommendations 10.13, 10.14 and 10.15. I am not going to bother to read them out here, but basically they concern the reduction of flystrike by breeding more resistant sheep, by research into biological control methods over flies and by chemical control methods. Mulesing should be eliminated forthwith and--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Temporary Chairman, we have had some difficulty getting a prolonged debate on this legislation because of other business before the Senate. But I remind the Committee and Senator Bolkus, who is sitting in for Senator Tate, that when this Bill was last brought on I was explaining the three legs to our concern over clause 226, which is the subject of our amendment No. 59. The first leg of our concern is the general question of the proper relationship between a Minister and his department and the officers of a statutory authority. I have explained that and will not repeat it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The second and third legs of our concern relate to the particularities of the amendment proposed to clause 226 of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission Bill. Very briefly, before lunch I set out some concerns we had about the first part of the amendment in the Bill-that is, the part that relates to the secrecy provision in which the Government seeks to amend section 23e of the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act by providing that certain officers of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission (ATSIC) be among those who are listed as having exemptions from certain secrecy provisions. I draw to the attention of the Minister and the Committee the curious anomaly which this seems to present which seems to highlight once again the very unusual relationship which will exist-I know that Senator Tate is coming back, so I may not have to repeat the whole argument-between the commissioners, who will not have the exemption and who will not be able to receive certain information, and some of their officers, who will have the exemption and will be able to receive the information. A very strange situation may arise where we may end up with officers of ATSIC having certain information which they can pass on to the Minister, if they are advising the Minister, but which they are not able to pass on to the commissioners who are in charge of the Commission because if they do they may render themselves liable to a fine or a term of imprisonment. </PARA>
<PARA> If I understood Senator Tate correctly in the 30 seconds he had before lunch, he indicated that there was another mechanism by which the commissioners could be so authorised. I put it to him that that mechanism would allow anyone to be authorised-it could allow the officers of ATSIC-but the Government has seen fit in this Bill actually to nominate certain officers of ATSIC. It has actually nominated the chief executive officer or a member of the staff of the Commission approved by the chief executive officer which we all understand is the standard way of delegating that authority to the officers of the Commission. I suggested that the Government might wish to include the commissioners themselves in those who are included here in order to avoid the anomaly which I have drawn to the attention of the Committee. </PARA>
<PARA> The rest of the Government's amendment contained in clause 226, however, seeks to put in a new section 64b relating to land council's trust funds. This is contained in subclause 226 (3) of the Bill before the Committee. There are two issues here. The proposal refers to a Minister administering the section. The question is: who is the Minister administering the section? The question then is, also, what law or arrangement is the new section 64b, which is sought to be added by the Government, to replace?</PARA>
<PARA> I will turn initially to the first question. Who is the Minister about whom we are talking? It seems that two Ministers are being talked about under this new section. One of them is apparently the Minister for Finance because the Minister for Finance must approve the form of the accounts; and the other is the Minister administering this section. I am aware that my colleague, Senator Tambling, who is in the chamber, was intrigued by this very distinction and he asked the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) a question on notice. It is Question on Notice No. 1112. It has been placed on the Notice Paper and a response has been received. In order to expedite the work of the Committee I seek leave to have the question and the Prime Minister's reply incorporated in the Hansard. </PARA>

<PARA> (a) and (b) The expression `Minister administering this section' has been used in subsections 64b (2), (3) and (4) to distinguish that Minister from the Minister for Finance who is mentioned in subsection 64b (1). The intention is that `the Minister administering this section' will be `the Minister' referred to throughout the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act 1976.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It appears from the answer that the Minister administering this section and `the Minister', as we have used that phrase throughout the Bill, are to be one and the same person. The question is: why is it written in different language and why is there a difference in terminology? I turn to a more substantial matter about the proposed new section 64b. What is this section proposed to replace? It would require ATSIC to keep accounts and to prepare financial statements and annual reports in respect of the trust fund set up by section 62 of the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act. As we all know, that is the Aboriginal Benefits Trust Account (ABTA). Why is this section necessary at all?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I interpolate here that the Opposition amendment is simply to leave out the proposed amendments and the question we are asking is: why are they there? The secrecy provisions seem to us either to be unnecessary or to be clumsy, and we are now asking in relation to the trust fund amendments why the section is necessary. Presumably the trust fund accounts, in all the ways set out in this section, are handled by someone at the present time. Are they handled satisfactorily? If they are not handled satisfactorily, would you please tell us? Is there something wrong with the present arrangements? I feel obliged to remind the Committee that some recent newspaper articles have suggested that something might be wrong with the way in which the Aboriginal Benefits Trust Account is being administered. </PARA>
<PARA> I remind honourable senators that the fund is used in three ways. It is used to fund the administrative costs of the land councils, to make grants to Aboriginals in the region, and the remainder is used for the benefit of Aboriginals generally and proportions of the royalties are supposed to be used for each of them. I also remind honourable senators that there is one exception: the Minister may use some of the money that would otherwise go to Aboriginals generally, through the ABTA, and if necessary provide that to the land councils if they have extra administrative costs. I seem to recall that when I was Minister I had to activate that process. I think that I put a very substantial amount of money from the ABTA into supporting land councils. I believe that the amount was $1.3m that year. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ME4">Senator PETER BAUME</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is the very point, Senator. It is a lot different now. I understand that in the last two years amounts of $4m and $5m have been transferred from the royalties, which might have been expected to benefit Aboriginals generally, and have been given via this mechanism to the land councils for their administrative costs. Further, I understand a report has been prepared by a Mr Greg Crough suggesting that something will have to be done if the land councils and the trust fund are to avoid bankruptcy. This is a very serious matter because the amounts of mining royalties have been quite substantial. Senator Tambling sought from the Minister some information about this report and asked whether, because of the interest we have in it, it could be made public. The Minister declined to make it public. What possible secrecy can there be about the fact that the trust fund is in trouble, is almost bereft of funds and, as we know from other sources, that is because large amounts of money have been channelled through this mechanism to the land councils?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We are aware that the Prime Minister has already conceded that a small departmental unit dealing with Aboriginal affairs will need to be retained. If that is the case, proposed section 226 is simply not necessary. The small administrative unit can continue to do the jobs for which this section provides. I do not understand the essentiality of anything contained in it and it is for that reason that the Opposition has proposed that we leave out the clause; in other words, vote against what is proposed by the Government. </PARA>

In relation to the first matter-that is, whether there is some anomaly, as Senator Baume suggested, in the omission of the members of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission from the proposed paragraph (ba), obviously it was the desire of those drafting this legislation that those persons who might have permission, if you like, to receive this sort of information should be confined as stringently as possible.

I turn to the question of the way in which the Minister administering this section, the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs under present administrative arrangements, shall be in a position to lay before the Houses of Parliament the report and financial statements required in relation to the trust account. The proposal that the Commission undertake the role of preparing the accounts and financial statements in the form that the Minister for Finance determines in relation to the ABTA is part of the general process which we have noted in section after section and which, indeed, lies at the base of the whole proposal encompassed in this legislation that responsibility for many matters in relation to Aboriginal affairs is to be taken over by the Commission from the Department of Aboriginal Affairs.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> At present the Department, in accordance with the provisions of the Audit Act 1901-I think it is section 41d, according to the note given to me-accounts for the payments made into and out of this trust account. It is intended that ATSIC will be required to prepare these accounts and financial statements and submit a report to the Minister relating to the trust account-and, of course, they have to be audited by the Auditor-General-before the Minister then lays a copy before the Houses of this Parliament. So it is simply part of the pro- cess which has been well rehearsed during the committee stage of this debate whereby the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission will take on the roles and functions in many instances at present undertaken by the Department.</PARA>

As he alluded to in his comments with regard to this point, the issues and concerns that have been raised have come about largely because of the questions on notice that I have submitted to both the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) and the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs (Mr Hand). There has been considerable media concentration in the past several weeks on the administration of the land councils in the Northern Territory and the operation of the Aboriginal Benefits Trust Account. I do not want to take up much of the time of the Committee to canvass those issues in detail because I will have the opportunity in the Senate Estimates committee hearings in the next week or so to pursue and explore the past sins and the history of those particular areas in much more detail. In fact, that would be the far more appropriate place to do so.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As Senator Peter Baume has pointed out, the concentration of attention on the activities of the land councils and their funding is of very serious importance to the function of the whole Parliament. I believe in the last 10 years $140m has passed through the Aboriginal Benefits Trust Account. The action taken in the last couple of years by Minister Hand in using his discretion for top-up funds for additional administrative purposes of the land councils has been very marked. Of course, this has taken place at the same time as the entire build-up and the selling of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission proposal. This has created a great deal of controversy in the Aboriginal community in the Northern Territory. Anyone who has been closely following the media in the past few days will be very well aware that the former Chairman of the Northern Land Council, Mr Gerry Blitner, has taken very serious issue with the way in which the Land Council is currently being administered and the way in which Aboriginal Benefits Trust Account funds are being utilised under these discretionary powers. </PARA>
<PARA> I am concerned that the ATSIC legislation incorporates this administrative type function for the administration or the accounting of the Aboriginal Benefits Trust Account through ATSIC's books. Land councils operate under the auspices of the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act of 1976 and they are specifically designated for the benefit of the Aborigines in the Northern Territory, whereas ATSIC is an umbrella organisation that has Commonwealth and Federal connotations. I have been fearful for some time about the influence of Aborigines outside the Northern Territory, particularly urban Aboriginals, who do not identify as easily with the traditional Aboriginal people who still live very largely a ceremonial and different lifestyle in the Northern Territory. Anyone who has been following the debates on ATSIC, or the precursors to those-the statements by the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs since he brought down Foundations for the Future in 1987-will be well aware that I have continually expressed concern that the centralised functions of ATSIC will override many of the Government's intentions with regard to administration of funds for Aboriginals in the Northern Territory. The two are specifically distinct and I am very fearful that these provisions within the ATSIC legislation, which will, in effect, gobble up and tightly control-or could have the potential to very tightly control-the trust funds for Aboriginal people in the Northern Territory, will create a great deal of controversy and tension that is totally unnecessary and has many other political overtones. </PARA>
<PARA> As Senator Peter Baume said, I am concerned also that the Crough report has not been made public. It has been obvious, just from a careful reading of the Northern Territory News, that it has been available in some form to members of the media. It is obvious that they have access either to the document or to leaked parts of it. It has been commented on for some weeks. It has been made available to the land councils for their own administrative reasons. I fail to understand why members of parliament who have been so closely identified with the very radical change in administrative forms in the ATSIC proposals cannot be given the courtesy of access to this most important document. I am sure that Senator Coulter from the Australian Democrats needs to look at it and to study it comprehensively, just as Senator Peter Baume, Senator Ron Boswell and I need to be very intimately aware of the terms and the recommendations of it.</PARA>
<PARA> It has also been reported in the Northern Territory media that the Minister did not fully accept all of the recommendations of the Crough report and has in fact engaged a further consultant-I believe it is Dr or Professor Altman from the Australian National University-to prepare additional and further recommendations arising from the Crough report. This seems to imply either that there is continuing political pressure in this most important area or that things are being kept secret and quiet and swept under the carpet, which is totally unnecessary. Therefore, I believe that we have to be very careful with these issues. I certainly will be pursuing all of the financial implications of them in the forthcoming Estimates Committee hearings. For that reason, I have indicated to the Minister for Justice, Senator Tate, that I am hopeful that we will have present at the Senate Estimates committee hearings the officers responsible for the Aboriginal Benefits Trust Account and officers from the land councils who will be so vitally affected by this legislation, to give us an account of how things are being done under the present arrangements. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will not pursue further what Senator Tambling has put before the Committee. He will pursue that in the Estimates committee, and so he should. There are a number of matters which require further attention. I observe to the Committee that the explanatory memorandum is quite misleading on this clause. For example, it states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>Clause 226 (3), would require the Commission to keep accounts, and to prepare financial statements and annual reports in respect of the Trust Account established . . . </PARA>
<PARA>It is not actually doing that. The accounts are already kept and financial statements are already prepared. It would have been rather more clear had the explanatory memorandum pointed out that the purpose of this subclause is to transfer that function from the Department which does it presently-I take it it is the Department-to the new Commission. That would have been a much clearer and more accurate explanation of what this clause is seeking to do with the addition of the proposed new subsection to section 64 of the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act. </PARA>
<PARA> Having said that, I make a couple of other observations. We have had divisions on the previous three clauses which dealt with legislation administered within the portfolio and we have lost those divisions. It is not my intention, therefore, to take this matter to a division.

We believe that ATSIC clients, just like clients of the Aboriginal Development Commission, are entitled to privacy relating to their personal affairs. Their privacy is not otherwise provided for in any adequate way in this legislation and it is for this reason that we have proposed to add new clause 88a after clause 88. One could argue about where it should be added but this seemed to us to be an appropriate place for it to go. In its contents it merely seeks to provide what are fairly standard protections for the privacy of those who will be dealing with ATSIC. I commend the amendment. </PARA>

<PARA> (a) for its administrative purposes; or</PARA>
<PARA> (b) for the purpose of the performance of functions expressly conferred on the Regional Council by this Act.''. </PARA>
<PARA>Amendment No. 61 seeks to leave out the definition of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Island Corporation and to insert a new definition. The new definition would read, `an Aboriginal association incorporated under Part IV of the Aboriginal Councils and Associations Act 1976; but does not include a regional council'. Those are the words that matter. One of our concerns has been that, without this qualification, the Commission could declare each regional council to be an Aboriginal corporation. If this amendment is accepted, as the Minister for Justice has indicated it will be, that would not be possible. Had the Commission declared each or any of the regional councils to be an Aboriginal corporation such a council would thus have been eligible to receive property and grants of money for Aboriginal advancement purposes. </PARA>
<PARA> I think Senator Coulter set out for us last time we met his view of what the function of the regional councils was going to be. It certainly was not to be the recipient of grants from itself. Without this amendment to make that clear we have no such protection. Had this amendment not been passed and had the Commission declared the regional councils to be Aboriginal corporations, there would be a strong temptation for dominant factions to use the regional council itself as the vehicle for receiving grants rather than using genuine community organisations, especially if they were community organisations not at that time in favour with the dominant faction. </PARA>
<PARA> I remind the Committee that this is exactly the situation that arose in relation to the land councils in New South Wales. Similarly, the capacity of regional councils to receive and hold property, real and personal, would offer a temptation for them to develop into de facto Aboriginal land councils. Of course, that does not mean that it would occur, but it could occur. Amendment No. 63 merely seeks to identify the purposes for which a regional council might have power to acquire land. It states:</PARA>
<PARA> ``(2) Nothing in this section or in any other provision of this Act shall be read as conferring on a Regional Council a function of acquiring land except-</PARA>
<PARA>and there are two exceptions-</PARA>
<PARA> (a) for its administrative purposes; or</PARA>
<PARA> (b) for the purposes of the performance of functions expressly conferred on the Regional Councils by this Act''. </PARA>
<PARA>Clearly, its own administrative purposes would involve buying an office or building from which it could operate, if that was what it wanted to do. The Aboriginal Development Commission, for example, purchased Bonner House. We would not want to stop that happening. So we want to make sure that it is written in that that is an appropriate purpose and that the other purposes for which land might be acquired should be for the performance of functions which are conferred by this Act. In other words, we have taken time already in considering this Bill to look very carefully at the functions which ATSIC should have. We are merely saying that the conferring of power on a regional council to acquire land should be consistent with those purposes. That is why we have moved amendments Nos 61, 62 and 63. I am grateful to the Government for the indication that these three amendments are acceptable and I commend them to the Committee. </PARA>

<PARA> (a) as far as practicable, try to ensure that the number of persons who will be entitled to vote at the next Regional Council elections for each region will be equal; and</PARA>

<PARA> ``(9) For the purposes of this section Tasmania and the Torres Strait Islands are each to be regarded as a single Regional Council.''. </PARA>
<PARA>This amendment to clause 89, which appears at page 39 of the Bill, seeks to insert a new subclause (8) after subclause (7). Clause 89 deals with regions under the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission proposal. The Committee will recall that we have already discussed at some length what shall be the regions and what functions they shall have, and we will have a bit more to say later about the voting practices within those regions. I have to remind the Committee that this chamber-it might not have been this particular chamber; it might have been the chamber which we occupied previously-when acting as the Senate considered a referendum proposal from the Government party which sought to make malapportionment of electorates illegal in the States of Australia, that is, the general electorates. In the argument on that referendum proposal both within the Parliament and in the community the question of malapportionment of constituencies was canvassed very widely. I notice that Senator Sheil is in the chamber. He will remember that the State which he represents and which Senator Jones represents was mentioned at some length in relation to that argument. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition puts to the Committee a very simple proposition. If it is sufficiently important to condemn malapportionment of electorates and if the Government itself is now proposing an electoral structure, why should that structure represent malapportionment of the gross degree that we have seen in the proposal?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My colleague asks, `What are we going to do about the Torres Strait?'. I remind him that because of concerns which Senator Tate and Senator Boswell put in relation to Tasmania, which is Senator Tate's State, and the Torres Strait, which is part of Queensland, Senator Boswell's State, we altered the original amendment which we had circulated. Proposed subsection (9) reads:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>For the purposes of this section Tasmania and the Torres Strait Islands are each to be regarded as a single Regional Council. </PARA>
<PARA>I have gone ahead to respond to Senator Boswell's interjection in saying that that was a criticism of substance. If I am objecting to malapportionment and if we carried the proposal through it would not be possible for the Torres Strait to have a separate region or for Tasmania to have a separate region. For other considerations it is desirable that each of them should have a region. </PARA>
<PARA> We have rehearsed in this place already, and I will not do it tonight, some of the figures which show just how gross are the disparities between regions. I put a very simple proposition, the same as that which was put in the Senate when we were discussing the referendum Bill. Why should the vote of one person be worth a quarter of the vote of another person? This becomes important because we will repeat this argument in relation to zones. Under this Federal system, as it were-which ATSIC will be-the zones will each elect a commissioner and those commissioners will have equal votes on the Commission. I would like to think that they represented roughly equal numbers of electors. So what we are trying to do here is to ensure that, as far as practicable, the number of persons who will be entitled to vote at the next regional council in each region will be equal. </PARA>
<PARA> At the same time we have included a second leg which seeks to ask that, as far as possible, persons with common interests or backgrounds, having regard to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander tribal and customary links, be included within the same region. We have included that because of the many complaints that those of us on the Senate Select Committee on the Administration of Aboriginal Affairs have received. Senator Collins gave us the striking example of a couple of communities in Arnhem Land where out-stations were separated from their home base-the out-stations being in one region, the home base in another. We want to avoid that happening if we can. </PARA>
<PARA> This amendment we are proposing, that is No. 64a-with the word `Island' having an `s' added to it-seeks to provide that, as far as practicable, there should be an equality of electors. After all, we are asking this of the Australian Labor Party, which has been the champion of the fight against malapportionment in non-Aboriginal constituencies. We are asking the Labor Party why the same principle cannot be applied within the ATSIC proposal, accepting the validity of the argument which Senator Tate put to me that Tasmania and the Torres Strait do present special cases which need to be provided for, as we have tried to do within the terms of the amendment. We have proposed the following words in our amendment:</PARA>
<PARA>For the purpose of this section Tasmania and the Torres Strait Islands are each to be regarded as a single Regional Council. </PARA>
<PARA>That is irrespective of the numbers of electors. </PARA>
<PARA> There are a number of other matters which need to be raised but I will raise just one of them here. The regions set out in the map we had in September 1988 have been shown to be deficient of any understanding of tribal or community boundaries and they have been shown to be grossly malapportioned. If honourable senators go to the report of the Senate Select Committee on the Administration of Aboriginal Affairs, at pages 11, 16 and the following pages, they will see that argument set out. The Select Committee itself recommended some improvements-for example, the sliding scale as to how many regional councils would be elected. That was an improvement and the Government picked that up. </PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Senator Tate" NAMEID="NJ4">

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;A big improvement. As a member of the Select Committee, I thank Senator Tate. It was a big improvement. It is to the Government's credit that it picked that matter up, and I thank it for that. It has removed some of the greater excesses but it has not resolved the problem. It has helped things to this extent: the sliding scale means that the collegiate that meets for the zone elections might have a different weighting as between regions of different size. But we have proposed a new clause 89 (8) so the Minister would be required to follow principles of equal representation. I do not know of any convincing argument that says that a Labor government, which was prepared to ask the Australian people by way of constitutional change to entrench opposition to malapportionment for white Australians, should not put the same principle into a Bill in which it is seeking to provide representation for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Australians. If there is a significant difference, we should be told what it is.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I may need to raise other matters in relation to this amendment. But I indicate, in summing up, that we did listen to the points by the Minister a few days ago in discussion off stage. I think the main objection he raised was sufficiently important to try to overcome it by way of an amended amendment. I urge him to pick up equal representation as a principle and to accept this amendment which is offered in an attempt to overcome what was one of the grosser failings of the ATSIC legislation, as identified earlier this year by the Senate Select Committee. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Could I just briefly indicate that the fundamental difference between ATSIC-and, therefore, the electoral methods that might underpin its composition-and the Federal Parliament is, of course, that the Federal Parliament is a law-making power within society and has the capacity and exercises the ability to appropriate moneys. ATSIC is not vested with any power to make laws, nor is it a body which finally appropriates funds. That is done by this Parliament. I think there is a very significant difference between the two.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I want to make this point: as far as the criteria which Senator Baume puts forward for determining the boundaries of the regions are concerned, the two exceptions or exemptions which he has made are, I think, in themselves eloquent rebuttal of what he says he is trying to achieve. He admits by those exceptions and exemptions from his general principle that there can be situations where homogeneity and likeness of communities are more important than the question of mere numerical equality between regions. It just simply happens that because Tasmania and the Torres Strait Islands are so clearly distinct, being islands or island groups, we fastened on to them in the discussion I held with Senator Peter Baume. But it may be that there are many other communities throughout Australia which would find themselves joined together quite artificially by the first criterion in Senator Baume's proposal in a way which would be as disastrous for them as it would be for the Torres Strait Islanders to be put into some huge region including Aboriginal persons.</PARA>
<PARA> Senator Baume's proposed clause 89 (9) says:</PARA>
<PARA>For the purposes of this section Tasmania and the Torres Strait Islands are each to be regarded as a single Regional Council. </PARA>
<PARA>I ask Senator Boswell: What will happen to Seisia, which he mentioned earlier, and to Bamaga which are on the mainland, as I understand it? They do not fit into this proposal at all. I think they would be most upset to find that they were to become part of a region and amalgamated with some Aboriginal communities rather than retaining their links with Torres Strait Islanders living on the Torres Strait Islands. So I do not think the amendment circulated by Senator Peter Baume really does justice even to the interests of the Torres Strait Islanders. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It does not. It relates only to those people living on Torres Strait Islands, not Torres Strait Islanders living on the mainland in the Seisia and Bamaga communities, for example. I think that that is a major problem. I remind honourable senators of a statement made by a critic of the proposed ATSIC arrangements. I would like the Committee to hear this comment. It was to this effect:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>The work of many people, many years of slogging, will be wiped out, all to satisfy Gerry Hand's socialist left philosophy that all power must be centralised in Canberra. His attitude is that the `bush murrays' have not got the ability to make a decision for themselves in their own communities. That is what ATSIC is all about. ATSIC denies Aboriginals their right to live in a secure community because it pushes various communities together in the same regional council which gets one voice at zonal level. This may lead to the dominance of the more articulate urban Aboriginals whose priorities may be quite different from those of community Aboriginals. For example, urban Aboriginals may be more interested in legal and health services while Aboriginals in the communities may see water, sewerage, housing and roads as their priorities. The basic issue here is how to get adequate representation for all without denying Aboriginal people their ethos of relating to the people and needs of their own communities. </PARA>
<PARA>That very profound insight was by Senator Ron Boswell in the debate on 17 August 1989. I put it to Senator Peter Baume that the amendments which he has circulated would have precisely the effect of creating a very unreal relationship between urban and some more traditional Aboriginal peoples by forcing them into one region in the name of seeking equality amongst the numbers of those entitled to vote in that regional council election. I admit that the list to which I now refer was made up before the new amendment was circulated during the last 24 hours, apparently. Let us say that the Aboriginal population of Australia is approximately 230,000. Therefore, each region would comprise about 3,800 if all were of equal size. On this basis we would see the following arrangements for regions: Sydney metropolitan would get four regions; Melbourne would get two regions; Brisbane, four regions; Perth, three regions; Darwin, two regions; Adelaide, two regions; Townsville, three regions; and Rockhampton, two regions. That would give a total number of urban based regions of 22, whereas at present the metropolitan centres would account for eight regions. </PARA>
<PARA> I indicate to Senator Baume that the effect of his proposal would be to fulfil the fears that Senator Tambling and Senator Boswell have raised-that one might have an undue overall dominance of the urban Aboriginal communities in relation to the voice of the traditional Aboriginal communities. Within regions, one could have a swamping of the traditional communities by urban Aboriginals who were brought within their region in the name of this equality. So the Government does not accept the newly circulated amendment. I cannot believe that, in their heart of hearts, either Senator Boswell or Senator Tambling could support this proposal. Even if they were minded to, in relation to the Torres Strait Islanders-who must be of great concern to Senator Boswell, who I know has a very real affection for and understanding of these people-I do not believe that the amendment as circulated deals with their communities which live on the mainland of the Australian continent. </PARA>

<PARA>For the purpose of this section, Tasmania and the Torres Strait Islands are each to be regarded as a single Regional Council. </PARA>
<PARA>Tasmania and the Torres Strait Islands are geographic descriptions of places. It would need to be reworded that they are to be regarded as single regions, each electing one regional council, to put it in the appropriate form. What he said does not really make sense. </PARA>
<PARA> Having said that, the Australian Democrats cannot support this series of amendments for slightly different reasons from those outlined by Senator Tate. We do accept that as far as possible the principle of one vote one value should obtain. As Senator Baume will recall, in the Senate Select Committee I argued for that. Indeed, I think I helped to propose the recommendation of the Committee that the size of the regional councils be determined on a sliding scale to take account of the differing population of the regions. </PARA>
<PARA> Recognising that it is impossible to achieve more than that relatively modest improvement in equality of representation, I also sought to include the provision that the regional councils, as part of their duty during their first term in office, would have the responsibility of reviewing their electoral boundaries and processes and that each regional council would make a recommendation to the Minister in relation to both of those matters. The Minister would also-this is now written into the legislation-consult with the Australian Electoral Commission and have two sources of advice on all those matters which, amalgamated, would synthesise the concerns that Senator Tate has correctly enunciated about the cultural similarities that bind together certain groups and which may determine that one group is small and another group is larger, and over the boundaries in that relationship, also taking into account the appropriate forms of representation-the size of the regional councils and the electoral processes. </PARA>
<PARA> I firmly believe, as I have indicated in this Committee debate before, that it is impossible at this stage going into a new structure to adequately foretell exactly how this thing will work out. In this area more than any other, the appropriate mechanism is to get it as good as possible in terms of commonality of spiritual and cultural background and equality of representation, and then, having created that mechanism, hand it over to the Aboriginal people themselves through their regional councils, so that they can then take this matter forward and make modifications as they go along. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not believe that at this stage we can go any further than the Government has already been prepared to go in modifying the size of the regional councils. It does seem to me that in Senator Baume's proposal, even with the changed wording in relation to Tasmania and the Torres Strait Islands, he has already recognised that there are in those instances smaller groups that will need special consideration. I have discussed with a lot of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people the way in which Torres Strait Islander people on the mainland-that means the bulk of Torres Strait Islanders-fit in. Should they vote back with their Torres Strait Islander regional council? The answer universally by the indigenous Torres Strait Islanders is, `No. We do not want them to vote with us. We would be swamped by those people, some of whom have been away for one or two generations'. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;They could have been away for a couple of generations; precisely. On the other hand, the provision of a special grouping on the mainland for those people is not very satisfactory. I was quite taken by Senator Tate's analogy with islands on the mainland. It is an analogy that I have previously made in a different context when we were attempting to get certain desert areas in Australia set aside as world conservation zones. I pointed out that the Galapagos Islands are important from the point of view of the conservation of species that have evolved surrounded by water. In many of the inner areas of Australia there are islands of population, islands of unique life surrounded by large areas of desert. In the same sense, they are islands. I think that the anomaly which is created by juxtaposing those provisions which Senator Baume is attempting to put into subclauses (8) and (9) simply indicates that we should be leaving this with the newly created regional councils. Let them determine how they want their boundaries organised in future, the size of the regional councils and the electoral processes. I think that that is as far as we can go at this stage.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This Bill will leave this place extensively amended and it will be up to the Minister in the other place to determine what he wants to do with it. I say to Senator Coulter that one more amendment or one less amendment is not the issue. The legislation will pass or fail on the will of the Government to see it through in another place and to bring it back if necessary. It is all very well for Senator Coulter to say that he accepts the principle of one vote one value, but we are going to give him an opportunity to vote for it. If he votes against it, I will not believe him. He says that he believes in one vote one value. It is a classic situation because when people are put to the test, they always find reasons not to vote for a matter.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> What Senator Tate has offered us are the classic arguments given by those who have proposed malapportionment down through the ages, that is, that the electoral interests or electoral rights of certain people, usually urban people, have to be subordinated for some reason because there are some other purposes, some special social purposes so that, in fact, one group of Aboriginals, whom Senator Tate and I think Senator Coulter identified as traditional Aboriginals, should have an influence out of proportion to their voting numbers. </PARA>
<PARA> I will explain why it is necessary to look at this amendment. We are talking about a federal structure at the top of which will be elected commissioners-whatever the figure may be; 15 or whatever. One will be elected from each zone. Those commissioners sitting in the Commission will have one vote each. They will be equal votes, if I may say so without outraging my friend. It reminds me of a State parliament I know where there is one vote for each parliamentarian. That applies in many parliaments; not just in one. The fact is that those commissioners will be making decisions. Of course, they will not be passing laws and appropriating money. Who ever suggested that they would? What they will be doing is making decisions about budgets and the sharing of resources. They will be making day-to-day decisions which will affect people in the communities in a hundred ways. Does anyone deny that? Of course the commissioners will be doing that. </PARA>
<PARA> For them to have legitimacy it is desirable and necessary that their election be fair. I cannot believe that we are hearing a Labor government say that it wants malapportionment of the degree that exists between the regions as proposed in this Bill. I am not at all surprised at the Australian Democrats saying, `We believe in one vote one value but we will not vote for it'. But for the Australian Labor Party to say, `We will have one region with fewer than 1,000 electors and one region with 17,000 or 18,000 electors'-if we are prepared to put up with that and the regional councillors are so elected, whether on a sliding scale and there are 10 or 20 regional councillors-does not get rid of the effects of malapportionment. They will then meet as a college to elect one zone commissioner. That is unfair and it is the very reason the honourable senator proposed a referendum a couple of years ago. He thinks it is unfair too. It is unfair for whites but good enough for blacks. I do not understand how a Labor Party, which asked us to vote at a referendum to end malapportionment, can then put malapportionment of this extent into the ATSIC proposal and argue that it does not want to do anything about it. </PARA>
<PARA> I take full responsibility for the amendment; it is defective. The Minister has pointed that out. Clearly, it would have to take account of the mainland communities that belong to the Torres Strait, and they include Bamaga and Seisia. I notice Parliamentary Counsel is sitting there advising the Minister. There is no reason why, if the amendment is defective, we could not seek to have that defect corrected if an acceptance of this proposal about malapportionment was what was standing between us. This is a proposal to put something of an end to the malapportionment. The argument that urban people are in some way entitled to less voting power than others is something that I, as an urban dweller, have always found highly offensive. The problem arises for people on this side of the chamber because ATSIC itself is such a hopeless, flawed proposal. That is really where the trouble arises. What we are seeing now is one of the consequences of that proposal. </PARA>
<PARA> Labor's fault, Labor's error, is in going down this road and seeking to put together an administrative structure and an elected structure to try, as it were, to provide an heir to the National Aboriginal Conference, at the same time as it provides an administrative structure to take over the functions of the other portfolio agencies. It will not work and we are seeing just one area in which it is unfair and improper. Senator Tate has actually been defending, with the thinnest arguments, inequalities between voting regions which are greater than those we see for any State parliament, any constituency. When we understand that those councils will meet together to elect a zone commissioner and that those commissioners will meet as the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission to make decisions about resources, the consequences of malapportionment become severe indeed. </PARA>
<PARA> I say to the Minister that if in fact the defect in my amendment-that is, that Bamaga and Seisia are not included-needs to be overcome I am perfectly content to seek, through him, help to overcome it. I have no more wish than he has to see that defect persisted with. What I am inviting the Committee to do is to make a declaration on malapportionment. The Opposition will press the amendment. We will watch how senators vote. We believe this is a chance for the Committee to make a statement about where it stands on malapportionment. I know where I have always stood and, before the Minister says anything, he might check the Journals of the Senate as to where I have always stood. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not doubt for one moment the sincerity of Senator Peter Baume's general political philosophy in relation to the question of one vote one value. But I do remind the Committee that he has already accepted that in relation to this ATSIC legislation there ought to be two quite significant exceptions in relation to the island of Tasmania and now the communities of Torres Strait Islanders. I understand Senator Coulter is not going to support the amendment; so I have not asked Parliamentary Counsel to deal with the question of the mainland communities of Torres Strait Islanders. But I wonder whether I had mentioned in my conversation the question of Bathurst and Melville Islands where there is a community of about 1,600 people. Under Senator Baume's proposal they would be required to be amalgamated and forcibly integrated into a region within the mainland Northern Territory. I wonder whether he might not have thought that that also, for purposes of cultural homogeneity, required an exemption to be made.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> What I am trying to say-and I take Senator Coulter's point-is that the proposed boundaries may require revision. Experience will teach us that, no doubt. But they have been put together in good faith in order to achieve the sort of cultural homogeneity which the Committee set up by this Senate apparently thought was important. I remind Senator Baume that the Senate Select Committee on the Administration of Aboriginal Affairs, of which the members were Senator McMullan, Senator Peter Baume, Senator Boswell, Senator Collins, Senator Coulter and Senator Devlin, obviously spent some time on the question of voting strength within regions. It concluded on page 40, paragraph 2.118:</PARA>
<PARA> Where regions are created in the interests of achieving cultural unity and the resulting regions have small populations the disparity in representation (voters per councillor) could be addressed by linking the number of councillors to the population of the region. </PARA>
<PARA>The following paragraph states:</PARA>
<PARA> The Committee recommends that regions with populations of less than 1000 elect ten Councillors, those between 1000 and 2000 elect eleven Councillors with one additional Councillor for each thousand of population until those with more than 10,000 voters have Councils of twenty councillors. </PARA>

Three of the persons sitting on that Committee are in this chamber, and they thought that at this stage of the development of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission proposal that was the best that could be achieved having regard to the interests of achieving cultural unity in the various regions. For that reason, I believe that we should take Senator Coulter's advice and await the experience that we have over the next several years of the operation of these councils. No doubt that will enable us to pick up some of the anomalies which will inevitably develop. But I believe that they will not be anywhere near as disruptive and in many cases as truly divisive as would be the case if we attempted to amalgamate various communities in the way in which Senator Baume's proposal would require.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to make one brief point in answer to Senator Peter Baume's assertion that the Australian Democrats are not committed to equality of representation. In this matter we have two important principles. Those two principles are partly in conflict. There is a very fundamental mathematical principle that one cannot optimise two independent variables simultaneously. One cannot optimise the representational aspects which we are dealing with and at the same time optimise the cultural aspects. One therefore must make a judgment and come down with a compromise. The point that Senator Baume is making also relates to the representation of the councils when it comes to the election of the zonal representative. That is the point at which the malapportionment occurs.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;At which it becomes significant. The population size of the individual zones is therefore perhaps of more relevance when one moves up to the next stage, which is the commission stage. The variation in terms of the size of the regional councils will not really matter at the level of the operation of a regional council; it will matter only when representatives of those councils come together to select the zonal representative.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As I say, I am not demurring at all from the importance of equality of representation. I believe that what we have in the Bill will take that into account by way of the opinions and advice which will be expressed by the Australian Electoral Commission when it advises the Minister in relation to boundaries and electoral processes. But here we do have two principles. One of those principles with respect to Aboriginal people is somewhat different from what operates in the non-Aboriginal community. There are very significant cultural differences between Aboriginal people-between people of one tribe and another, between urban and non-urban Aboriginal people, between people who are still observing more closely their traditional cultural heritage and those who have, for various reasons, moved away from that cultural background. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Peter Baume will remember that in the Northern Territory the original division of regional councils was strongly objected to by a number of Aboriginal people precisely because the boundaries had not been drawn in ways which reflected the traditional boundaries, the recognised boundaries. If any proposal is to work at all and impose, even in a quasi fashion, a non-European electoral process and decision-making process on Aboriginal people, again I say that I think we have the best initial compromise and it is up to the Aboriginal people, through this mechanism, to determine how they want this to evolve over time. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We are debating the regional councils of ATSIC. I want to make it very clear that the Islander communities of Bamaga and Seisia were established on the mainland of Cape York Peninsula when Saibai Island went under water in a tidal wave in 1949. These communities see themselves as Islanders rather than Aboriginals. They are part of the Island Coordinating Council, a body funded by the Queensland Government, and I believe also funded to some extent by the Federal Government. I made representations in the Senate earlier when these communities were not on the map. I believe the new map has picked them up and I have been issued with a list of communities that are in the Torres Strait Regional Council area.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I want to make it very clear that the Islander people initially were so annoyed about ATSIC that they even took the massive step of trying to remove the islands from Australia. They had various meetings seeking secession from Australia. The fact that they now have this regional council and a zone has appeased them to some degree, although I would say that some of them still are not happy about the whole prospect of ATSIC. Initially they wanted their own separate commission. They did not want to be a minority of a minority. I put it on record that most of them are not happy about the ATSIC proposal. But we have gone some way towards lessening their unhappiness by allowing the Torres Strait communities, both on the mainland and in the islands, to become a regional council and have their own zone. I am concerned about the list I have been given. I believe that a community is missing from this Torres Strait regional council area-that is, Port Kennedy. Maybe the Minister can--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I just wish to inform the Senate of a very exciting new trophy for cricket. Honourable senators in this place will know of my interest in things to do with sport and, in particular, my interest in women's sport. I was very pleased to be informed that last week an announcement was made about the Chief Minister's City of Canberra trophy, a new cricket trophy for under 19 men and under 21 women in the Australian Capital Territory. This is a very exciting and significant award. The inspiration for the trophy was the cricket ball that was used in the historic fifth test played in England this year and flown to Australia on the record-breaking flight of the Qantas 747-400 Longreach aircraft called the City of Canberra. That trophy was presented to the Chief Minister by the area manager of Qantas Airways Ltd. The Chief Minister has decided that this would make a splendid perpetual trophy for both men's and women's cricket. A copy of the trophy will be presented to the best all-round player in the under 19 men's competition and the best all-round player in under 21 women's cricket. In addition to receiving a trophy, the young cricketers will be given a return trip by Qantas to England where it is hoped that they will be given the opportunity to have some cricket practice, if not participate in games.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> One of the reasons I have raised this matter in the Senate is that I am very pleased to see this further acknowledgment of sport and, in particular, cricket and, of course, women's cricket which has actually been alive and well in this country for over a hundred years. Indeed, the game played between the Australian and English teams in Bendigo commemorated 100 years of women's cricket in Bendigo itself. And, of course, over this last five or seven years, we have seen quite a different media coverage and recognition of the importance of women's sport. The early cricket matches between English women and Australian women in 1985 received mocking press reports. But by the time they got to the final match in Bendigo, on which the series hinged, the reportage was very different and was no longer mocking of women's cricket. </PARA>
<PARA> We have had to recover and rediscover the significance and importance of women's sport in this country. This award, this prize, is very important because it gives equal recognition to women involved in cricket and it also associates them in some way with the recent significant victory by Australia in the Ashes series in England. This is not a bad thing to be associated with if one is a young male or female cricketer in this country. </PARA>
<PARA> I think it would have to be said that the Australian Capital Territory (ACT) award would be one of the richest sporting awards for cricket in the country. It is a very significant prize and I believe that the sponsors associated with the trophy-in particular Qantas and WIN television in the ACT-need to be congratulated. It is also hoped that this prize or trophy for under 21 women cricketers will lead to the development of cricket for girls of school age. The majority of women do not get much opportunity at school to participate in cricket and develop their skills from an early age. But with an award like this for under 21 women and men, hopefully young girls and men, if not all around Australia at least in the ACT, will be encouraged to take up cricket along with all the other sports they seem to be enjoying more and more. </PARA>
<PARA> I wanted to draw this very commendable prize to the attention of the Senate. The Australian Capital Territory Cricket Association Inc. and the Australian Capital Territory Women's Cricket Association, in collaboration with the sponsors and the Chief Minister, Rosemary Follett, are to be commended for this contribution to both men's and women's sport, and cricket in particular. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="3K4">Senator DUNN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The protests that occurred at Nurrungar and the protests that occur when nuclear-armed ships enter our ports would not be necessary if our governments did not persist in maintaining our historically ill-motivated and militarily useless alliance with the United States (US). Since the Second World War a mainstay of our official defence policy has been the relationship with the United States that is usually referred to by the title of the most substantial agreement between our two countries-the ANZUS Treaty-although its terms do not prescribe the whole of our current relationship with the United States. The other elements of the relationship are usually described as deriving from our membership of the larger and rather nebulous Western alliance. I believe that we can do without ANZUS and the other obligations that are generally associated with this treaty. I believe that we never needed it and that it is essential for Australia to disentangle itself from ANZUS as expeditiously as possible. The costs of this involvement have been and continue to be high and the benefits are few.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I refer briefly to the genesis of the ANZUS Treaty because its origin illustrates some of the problems that the treaty still presents. At this point I recommend a paper that I have found very helpful in clarifying my views on the treaty. It is titled Breaking the American Alliance and it is by one of our own parliamentary researchers, Gary Brown. I suggest that senators who are currently supporters of ANZUS should not be put off by the title because it is a thorough and scholarly work. ANZUS is our fault. Australia-which then meant Menzies-practically begged the United States for some sort of security guarantee when it failed to persuade Britain and the United States to impose a hard Versailles type of peace treaty on Japan. </PARA>
<PARA> When the treaty was announced in 1951, it was of considerable help to the Menzies Government in a general election. This was no accident. John Foster Dulles in Washington had been informed by Australian Foreign Minister Percy Spender that there was a strong risk that Labor leader Evatt would topple the Menzies Government by playing on public fears of a resurgent Japan. This argument overcame the reluctance of the United States authorities to offer any kind of treaty and it issued a statement of intent 10 days before the 1951 election. The recorded statements of Dulles clearly show a deep suspicion of any government-or possible government-with Labor or socialist or even peace associations. This attitude has persisted right up to the present. At a defence conference last year our distinguished former Ambassador for Disarmament, Richard Butler, described his initial reception in Washington by senior United States officials. They regarded him as if he were a reptile that had just crawled out of a bog in the Russian steppes. The convenient release of the embryonic ANZUS Treaty just days before a close Federal election was only the first instance of our military treaty relationship with the United States interfering directly with Australia's domestic politics and sovereignty. </PARA>
<PARA> There have been many costs, as I have said, incurred by this treaty. The most notable has to be Australia's involvement in the Vietnam war. Like many other Australians I opposed our involvement in this war; it cost Australia directly hundreds of millions of dollars and nearly 500 lives. It also cost us a part of our international reputation and associated us with not only the carnage of the war itself, but also the bloody aftermath-especially in Cambodia-and the long term social, economic and environmental damage to the region. It was a tragic but also very silly war. Australia was not needed militarily but because our pseudo-independence gave a superficial international gloss of `free world against the evil empire of communism' to the conflict. The silliness of the war in military terms is demonstrated by the fact that the United States-despite its material power-lost the war. So much lost, so much ruined, for nothing. The vacuous predictions of the domino theory came to nothing too. </PARA>
<PARA> From the beginning the ANZUS Treaty was used to justify a run-down in the Australian defence forces and the forces we did maintain were tailored to fit into United States priorities. Major expense is still being incurred in exercises directed towards United States rather than Australian needs. This has left Australia at the mercy of a treaty which places no obligations on the United States except to consult. It has also deprived Australia of the opportunity to choose military options in its own region. The annexation of Irian Jaya, then known as Dutch New Guinea, and East Timor are cases in point.</PARA>
<PARA> When Sukarno started to agitate for the `return' of Dutch New Guinea, Australia was opposed to it, but it could get neither British nor US support. Without that guaranteed support-even in munitions supplies-Australia could not even use the military option as a bargaining counter. I do not assert that Australia ought to have gone to war over this issue, but the division of the island of New Guinea and the assimilation of the people in the western portion into an empire defined by an accident of colonial history has caused trouble and will continue to do so. </PARA>
<PARA> The situation was similar in East Timor. Although the Indonesia of today is in some respects different from Sukarno's Indonesia, change for the worse is certainly possible. If a militaristic, expansionist group were to seize power there the evidence of recent history would show two successful annexations in the face of international and Australian disapproval. This might well be an encouragement to fresh military adventures. </PARA>
<PARA> Australia's future role in the South Pacific may well present some difficult problems. Foresight and delicacy are needed in our dealings with our neighbours. We need to make our own decisions about our region. The evidence shows that the US regards Australia and the nations of the South Pacific as little more than a sideshow. Three examples illustrate this point rather well. The first is the failure of Australia and South Pacific nations to persuade the US Government to control the rapacity of the American fishing fleets in the Pacific. Gary Brown observes in his book that the US Tuna Boat Association seemed to have more influence with its government than Australia and the South Pacific nations combined. Only when tiny Kiribati signed a fishing agreement with the Soviet Union did the US take action. </PARA>
<PARA> The second example is the two reactions to the South Pacific Nuclear Free Zone Treaty. When the news of the treaty was received in Washington, State Department spokesman Bernard Kalb regarded the treaty as a big joke at a widely reported and televised media conference. When it came time to make an official response the US appeared to have changed its mind about this funny, ineffectual treaty. Despite Australia's efforts to make the treaty acceptable to the US, it has not signed it. The third example is the total lack of response to our efforts to gain US support in persuading France to stop its nuclear testing in the Pacific. France is not an ally of the US, only a friend; but maintaining a good relationship with France is obviously more important to the US. </PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Government has made much of Australia's benign influence on the United States in disarmament matters. There are no visible signs of this influence in the above examples and I have not yet mentioned one of the most galling aspects of the recent United States-Australia relationship, and that is trade. </PARA>
<PARA> Japan is the notable winner in the economic competition between nations that sometimes takes on the appearance of a war. Although there are justified complaints that Japan is not always playing on a level playing field, the intrusion of the United States into Australian wheat markets is something else altogether. The use of subsidies of up to 50 per cent to take over traditional Australian markets is the economic equivalent of using chemical weapons. Australia's protests about this intrusion-and blatant betrayal of free-trade principles-have been dismissed with specious arguments. The annual loss to Australia is estimated at about $1.3 billion. Coincidentally, our defence purchase outlays for 1986-87 were also $1.3 billion. Most of it went to-guess where?-the United States. </PARA>
<PARA> Predictable protests about the wheat trade and other United States offences against fair trading have come from the farming community. But the linkage of the trade issue with the bases reveals something about the perceived value of the alliance in a relatively conservative section of our community. Mr Ian McLachlan, who has been associated with the far Right and was being groomed for a high position in the coalition's parliamentary party, said:</PARA>
<PARA> When friends like the United States are prepared to crucify you economically, what confidence can we have that they will defend us in time of military threat?</PARA>
<PARA>The answer to Mr McLachlan's question is implicit; we can have no confidence. There were calls to threaten the United States on the trade issue by withdrawing one or more of the leases on the so-called joint facilities. Government Ministers and spokesmen uttered a few vague squeaky threats but shut up when the United States responded with some irritation. </PARA>
<PARA> The option to threaten the United States by closing the bases has been made more difficult by the extension last year of the leases on Pine Gap and North West Cape-effectively for 10 years. I was dismayed and perplexed by this move. I still do not know what inducement or threat was offered by the United States to persuade our Government to extend the lease and sacrifice a negotiating advantage. When I examined the text of the new lease agreement I realised that it had the same barely-altered, composed-in-Washington character as the Australian statement dictated by George Shultz to Bill Hayden in 1983 after the fuss about the refusal to dry-dock HMS Invincible. </PARA>
<PARA> Despite cosmetic changes to the title of the US facilities, they perform the same basic function that they always have-that is, to give the US the capability to fight and win a nuclear war. This capability is constantly being updated. One of the latest additions is the defence support program satellite system for which Nurrungar is the principal overseas ground station. US generals are on record describing how crucial this system is to their state-of-the-art nuclear war-fighting system. There is no doubt that these facilities are primary Soviet nuclear targets and we actually have safety plans for a nuclear attack on Pine Gap, Nurrungar and North West Cape. This information was conveyed to me by Major-General Howard of the Natural Disasters Organisation late last year. </PARA>
<PARA> The much vaunted arms control verification function of the bases is only a by-product of their more sinister nuclear war-fighting and war-winning function. Mr Hawke in particular has made much of the verification function of the bases, including claiming that the intermediate-range nuclear force treaty could not have been signed, nor the strategic arms reduction talks begun, without the bases being on Australian soil. Professor Desmond Ball-who is likely to know-describes these claims as hyperbole. Most of the really important advances in verification are taking place overseas-like the agreements to allow inspection teams access to missile dismantling and to certain factories. </PARA>
<PARA> In 1984 both the Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Hayden made strong statements on Australia's policy on nuclear war and strategy. They specifically rejected the concept of `limited' or `theatre' nuclear war but affirmed Australia's reluctant support for deterrence along the lines of `mutual assured destruction'-usually correctly described as MAD. Some well-informed authorities claim that MAD was never really even an official US policy; the emphasis of both sides in the nuclear stand-off has been on surviving and winning a nuclear war. Attempts at making an independent Australian policy statement on nuclear war are folly when we are in thrall to a self-willed superpower that pursues its nuclear war strategy through the bases we have allowed on our territory. </PARA>
<PARA> Although the bases are an affront to many Australians and although they do make Australia a nuclear target, the installations themselves are remote from most of the population. Nuclear weapons will only turn up there-briefly-if there is a major nuclear conflict. The nuclear-powered and nuclear-armed warships that enter our harbours are another matter entirely. Although the United States and the United Kingdom refuse to declare whether any individual warship is carrying nuclear weapons we have a pretty fair idea of both the presence and the number of weapons on visiting warships. Before carrying these weapons, warships and their crews have to go through a process of certification. This process is not particularly secret and similar vessels tend to carry the same weapon loads. We also have evidence that certified ships nearly always carry all their nuclear weapons. </PARA>
<PARA> One important fact about the nuclear weapons that come into our harbours is that they are all tactical weapons-designed for fighting the limited or theatre wars that Mr Hayden rejected so emphatically--</PARA>

<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The notes read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA> One important fact about the nuclear weapons that come into our harbours is that they are all tactical weapons-designed for fighting the limited or theatre wars that Mr Hayden rejected so emphatically in his 1984 statement. If we were to take this policy statement seriously, the only nuclear-armed ships we should allow in our ports would be the large submarines that carry the intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMS). Fortunately there is no reason for these vessels to come anywhere near Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> This rather begs the question of what the other ships are doing here. They are certainly not defending Australia. Vice-President Quayle made it quite clear during his recent visit that the US would not be defending us from the more likely local threats. I imagine that if Australia were to be suddenly attacked by a regional but non-Communist power any US warships in Australian harbours would leave immediately and head for the horizon. </PARA>
<PARA> I don't want to comment in detail tonight on the recently tabled report of the standing committee on foreign affairs, defence and trade and its 39 recommendations-which could justly be described as 39 steps to nowhere in particular. For instance, recommendation 29 wonders whether spraying a nuclear-powered vessel that has suffered a melt-down in its reactor with water might not reduce the contamination. I suggest that the consenting members of the committee should be allocated a port and a long hose so that this experiment can be tried at the first opportunity. </PARA>
<PARA> Most recommendations rubber-stamp the existing regulations and safety plans. The recommendation on dry-docking (recommendation 37) is almost a verbatim rendering of the text of a letter from Mr Beazley to the committee describing his current policy. </PARA>
<PARA> Rubber stamp is a phrase that applies particularly well to the whole report. The committee was well aware that any conclusion that would exclude the warships would be unacceptable to both the Government and the Opposition. The evidence available to the committee was meagre on essential details and the conclusion-that there are only a few minor adjustments to be made-is dictated by the insistence of our ally, the US, that we accept their nuclear-powered and nuclear-armed ships or risk losing the alliance. </PARA>
<PARA> We run the risks of a nuclear-powered or nuclear-armed ship accident. We suffer the distress of hosting nuclear weapons that we have decided, for ourselves, not to develop or use. We make parts of our territory nuclear weapons targets. In return we enjoy the benefits of the nuclear umbrella, just like everyone else on earth. I believe that it is time for us to withdraw from the alliance. New Zealand did this somewhat indirectly and despite threats of `punishment', New Zealand has not suffered any dire consequences. New Zealand is not a `friend' of the United States. Australia, too, should upgrade its relationship with the United States from Ally to friend. </PARA>
<PARA> The ANZUS relationship began in fear and it had continued on this basis. The relationship is based on power, not friendship and not on the shared values that are often alluded to when the subject of ANZUS is raised. </PARA>
<PARA> When we discard this alliance we will be able to make practical arrangements for our defence with whomever we like; quite probably we will still have close contacts with the United States. We will feel better about ourselves, we will feel better about the Americans, they will probably regard us in a better light. Many developments that I have not had time to mention tonight point to an `independent' Australia in the future. One of these developments is the slogan of `self-reliance' that our Minister for Defence is promoting, let us hope that it soon becomes a reality. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I give the Minister for Justice (Senator Tate) no thanks for that because I have not written what I have to say and I am not in a position to incorporate it in Hansard. Mr Acting Deputy President, I rise tonight to make a contribution, modest and indelicate as it might be, on considerations in respect of Kakadu National Park. Might I say, with the greatest respect, that this debate in Cabinet epitomises the very standing of this Government. It demonstrates the confusion, the chaos, the vacillation and, frankly, this Government crudely in pursuit of votes, not in pursuit of the national interest. The history of Kakadu National Park stages 1, 2 and 3 is a litany of broken promises and lost opportunities which in many respects is the hallmark of this Government. Senator Richardson's attempts to have stage 3, including the conservation zone, locked up is the third occasion on which this Government has made a political decision totally removed and totally divorced from considerations of merit. The decisions in respect of stages 1, 2 and 3 have all been made without the competing national interests in any way being judged on their merits.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Broken Hill Proprietary Co. Ltd (BHP) is not the first mining company to feel the sharp end of this Government's vacillation, distortion, confusion and, ultimately, changing of facts. Let us look at the sorry saga, for instance, of Geopeko. Geopeko has had mining tenements granted to it since 1974 in what we now find to be stage 2 of Kakadu National Park. So since 1974, 15 years ago, it has had those tenements granted under title of the Crown, yet it has not been able to mine. On 20 February 1985, 11 years after those tenements were first applied for, the declaration of stage 2 was revoked so as to have it incorporated into the one plan and the one park-Kakadu National Park. In other words, stage 2 dissolved into stage 1 of the Kakadu National Park. When that created some anxiety, quite necessarily and naturally, on the part of the mining companies, Mr Cohen gave a comforting reassurance that the conditions in respect of mining, provision 56 of the plan of management, would not be in any way corrupted or altered and that it was simply an administrative advantage in terms of the management of the park. </PARA>
<PARA> As I say, the first plan of management provided quite explicitly for the exploitation and mining of minerals and metals within the park. As long ago as 1974, Dr Rex Patterson, the then Minister for the Northern Territory in the Labor Government, wrote in the following terms to Geopeko on 21 December 1975:</PARA>
<PARA> I refer to your applications for renewal of exploration licences Nos 219 and 220. These applications relate to areas that extend into the area proposed as a national park in the Alligator Rivers region. </PARA>
<PARA> It is the intention of the Government, at the February 1974 sittings of the Northern Territory Legislative Council, to introduce new legislation providing for the creation of national parks in the Northern Territory, and for the issue of rights under that legislation to allow prospecting to be carried out within those national parks under suitable conditions. </PARA>
<PARA>He concluded by saying:</PARA>
<PARA> I am authorised by the Government to assure you that, if your applications for renewal of licences are approved only in respect of areas outside the boundary of the proposed park, you will, upon commencement of the new legislation, be issued with fresh licences under that legislation in respect of the areas within the park boundary to which your current renewal applications relate. </PARA>
<PARA> Please be assured that my officers will be available to discuss any matter of concern to you. </PARA>
<PARA>In 1974 Geopeko was given an undertaking and assurance by a Labor government that the integrity of its mining tenements, which were impinged upon by the proposed stage 2 of Kakadu National Park, would retain their integrity. That was the first time that the Government had an opportunity to break its promise, and it did so. What happened to Geopeko during the years? Notwithstanding the assurances of Mr Cohen that the rules of the game would not change with the incorporation of stage 2 into stage 1, there was some anxiety by Geopeko. The company wrote to Mr Cohen asking him for an assurance that that was not to be the case. He wrote back to and assured the company that nothing had in any way changed. That anxiety by Geopeko was matched by the Northern Territory Minister for Mines, then Mr Coulter; and it was Mr Cohen who, on 16 September 1986, wrote to the Northern Territory Minister for Mines and said:</PARA>
<PARA> amalgamation of the two areas simply provided administrative advantages, allowing the whole park to be operated under the name `Kakadu National Park' and under one plan of management. . . . Conditions applying to any operations for the recovery of minerals were unchanged by the amalgamation of the two areas. </PARA>
<PARA>Not being satisfied with that, Geopeko discovered that a proposed plan of management that was circulating did not include provision for mining, so it wrote to the Government. It wrote to Senator Gareth Evans, then Minister for Minerals and Resources. He wrote back on 8 September 1986, saying:</PARA>
<PARA>my department has provided comments on the proposed Plan to the Director, National Parks and Wildlife which seek inclusion in the Plan of provisions for operations for the recovery of minerals similar to those in the first plan. </PARA>
<PARA>That was the assurance that had been received thus far by Mr Cohen. The letter went on:</PARA>
<PARA>Such an approach is necessary to give effect to the Plan's key management objective of developing an inventory of all renewable and non-renewable resources in the Park. You can be assured-</PARA>
<PARA>the words of Rex Patterson ringing again-</PARA>
<PARA>that I am following this issue carefully with the long term objective of establishing a multiple land use policy for the region which balances the interests of the mining industry with those of other land users. </PARA>
<PARA>In other words, Kakadu was to embrace, through the Government, the principle of multiple land use. That letter was dated 8 September. On 16 September-the very same day that Mr Cohen had written to give warm reassurance to Mr Coulter that the rules had not changed-the Government issued a press statement. A joint press statement by Mr Cohen and Senator Evans said:</PARA>
<PARA> The revised terms of the Plan of Management for Stages I and II to be submitted to Parliament will be along the lines of the draft Plan publicly circulated by the Director of Australian National Parks and Wildlife Service. The provisions in question differ from the previous Plan . . . </PARA>
<PARA>In eight days they differed, notwithstanding a letter that same day signed by Mr Cohen saying they had not. The statement went on:</PARA>
<PARA>The provisions in question differ from the previous Plan, now expired, which enabled exploration and mining to take place outside the pre-existing leases with the approval of the Governor-General. </PARA>
<PARA>So we found that Geopeko had been grossly misled and that, in fact, the rules had changed and Geopeko was unable to explore within leases which had not yet been granted. To that extent, Geopeko was now losing its non-renewed tenements. But at least it still had its pre-existing tenements, because the statement talked only about no exploration or mining taking place outside the pre-existing leases. But the truth was to be found some weeks later. On 12 November the same year Geopeko, for the third time looking for reassurance that the Government had not only not moved the goalposts but had not dismantled them, wrote to the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke). He wrote back saying:</PARA>
<PARA>While I recognise that Geopeko has a number of pre-existing mineral leases within Stage 2 that are protected under the National Parks and Wildlife Conservation Act, I reaffirm that no mineral exploration will be permitted outside those areas-</PARA>
<PARA>he was repeating what had been said by the press statement on 16 September-</PARA>
<PARA>and that the Government will not countenance any mining in Stages 1 and 2 . . . </PARA>
<PARA>The nonsense of that letter is that one could mine inside the pre-existing leases under the plan of management which required the approval of the Governor-General; it was simply that the Governor-General was not about to grant approval. So Geopeko discovered after this period between 1974 and 1986 that not only had it been misled but in fact it had lost title to the leases it had previously held. It is a matter of history now. We know that Geopeko went to the court and the Government's decision was overturned and that on appeal the Government was successful in its endeavours. </PARA>
<PARA> That is the second case where a decision was made for political reasons, whether it be right or wrong. For that reason it is probably worth my reminding Senator Tate of the events of 1986 on about 14 September when the Prime Minister was presumptuous enough and, I might add, in those days responsible enough to write to Mr Cohen. Because he had got a whiff that the plan of management did not include provision for mining, he wrote to Mr Cohen. He said that he was concerned about the absence in the draft management plan for Kakadu of any provision for the possible future recovery of minerals within the park. The Prime Minister was reported in the National Times of 14 September as pressing for mining to be allowed in the uranium rich Kakadu National Park in defiance of Australian Labor Party policy. According to the article, Mr Hawke's letter said that:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . a Cabinet review of the Government's policy restrictions on trade has identified access to mineral exploration and mining in Kakadu, and the proposed Stage three as one area in need of review. </PARA>
<PARA>The article continued:</PARA>
<PARA> The letter says: `With this in mind and given Australia's present current account deficit-</PARA>
<PARA>this was in 1986 when the current account deficit was about half of what it is now-</PARA>
<PARA>I would have serious reservations with any proposal that would result in the imposition of a more restrictive framework on potential mineral exploration development within Kakadu . . . </PARA>
<PARA> I ask therefore that you examine the full implications of not including a provision for the recovery of minerals in the draft plan prior to its finalisation.'</PARA>
<PARA>He was saying that the management plan prior to the amalgamation was restrictive and that he wanted something less restrictive. He wrote to Mr Cohen. If my memory serves me correctly, a Cabinet meeting was to be held on one of the Royal Australian Navy ships to consider this issue. Mr Cohen could see that there was an inevitable march against his position given the Prime Minister's imprimatur of Senator Evans's position, so Mr Cohen, to quote the National Times:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . was staggered by Mr Hawke's intervention and may raise the matter with Caucus if Cabinet forces the issue. </PARA>
<PARA>No wonder Mr Cohen slipped out the door backwards. Mr Cohen was reported as saying:</PARA>
<PARA>He believes the Government would be committing political suicide if it opens the park to mining because of the backlash from environmental, peace, and Aboriginal land rights groups. </PARA>
<PARA>This is the very argument being put now by the Prime Minister and by Senator Richardson, who at that time supported mining and are now saying that there should be no mining in stage 3 in the conservation zone because of opposition from the environmental groups, the peace groups and the Aboriginal land rights groups. Of course, Mr Cohen or his Department leaked the letter from the Prime Minister. It was thrown on the bonfire, so there was much uproar, rage and indignation via these groups. This followed the turmoil of the Government announcing in the Budget of 1986 that Australia was to sell uranium to France, breaking an inviolable platform of the Australian Labor Party. The Government, understanding the necessity of doing something about the balance of payments, had made that decision. It was in that environment that the Prime Minister and Senator Gareth Evans both got rolled. It had nothing to do with merit, virtue or economic responsibility; it was simply a decision made in the interests of political survival. That is what we are seeing again at present. </PARA>
<PARA> There are just one or two other matters that I wish to touch upon in the short time I have left. We have now had the spectacle of Senator Collins-unfortunately, I have not had an opportunity to read it all, and I am sorry I did not have an opportunity to tell him I was going to raise this; I did not think I was-writing to the members of Cabinet seeking to persuade them to a point of view. Without reading in detail what he has been saying, I understand that point of view is that the Jawoyn do not have a proper land claim, that there is merit in mining stage 3 and that there is some question about Coronation Hill being a sacred site. In fact, in his submission he quotes me from Hansard, asking questions of the Aboriginal community. </PARA>
<PARA> I wish to touch on one matter with respect to Senator Collins that I find disappointing. If my memory serves me correctly, Senator Collins brought some of his constituents to Canberra in 1987, prior to the Australian Labor Party's conference in Hobart. They came to Canberra to see the Prime Minister and to go to the conference. They were traditional owners of Koongarra and they were seeking to allow mining in the Koongarra area. They were to receive a benefit of $265m if the mining project went ahead. Mr George Hunt, a traditional owner and the oldest member of the delegation, urged that the mine go ahead, saying that he had seen many friends die waiting for a decision. Mr Hunt is regarded as the most senior traditional owner. They came down with the proper approval, and quite rightly so, of Senator Collins. </PARA>
<PARA> Yet when the Senate Standing Committee on the Environment, Recreation and the Arts prepared its report on the potential of the Kakadu National Park, the majority report refused to endorse mining of Koongarra. One of the signatories to the majority report was Senator Bob Collins. The minority report, written by me and signed by Senator McGauran and Senator Panizza, recommended mining in Koongarra. Senator Collins would not sign or support that minority report. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Collins now, quite rightly in my view, makes the point that the Jawoyn people do not have a legitimate land claim in respect of what is described as the sickness country-a reasonably new phenomenon in Aboriginal anthropology, discovered some time in the last two or three decades. As I have pointed out in this chamber previously, the Jawoyn people have already made a land claim in the vicinity of UDP Falls, Coronation Hill and in the conservation zone. That land claim has been unsuccessful. The Commissioner found no intrinsic spiritual relationship between the Jawoyn people and that area. The only area he granted was area one, some 60 or 65 kilometres south of Coronation Hill. </PARA>
<PARA> In many respects that matter has been resolved. Yet the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs, Gerry Hand, in 1986 made his position quite clear in respect of mining in Kakadu. At that point he was not taking a position as Minister for Aboriginal Affairs because he was not then the Minister but representing the Left of the Labor Party. He held that mining should not take place. Now he is telling us that under the heritage legislation he is obliged to take certain steps which will prevent mining. </PARA>
<PARA> I refer to page 310 of the minority report in respect of sacred sites on Coronation Hill:</PARA>
<PARA> Senator Crichton-Browne: Nipper Brown, do you remember ever asking the Aboriginal Sacred Sites Protection Authority to register Coronation Hill as a sacred site?</PARA>
<PARA> Nipper Brown: No, never. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Crichton-Browne: Did you ever want Coronation Hill for a sacred site?</PARA>
<PARA> Nipper Brown: No, never. There is nothing there. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Crichton-Browne: There is nothing at Coronation Hill?</PARA>
<PARA> Nipper Brown: Nothing. It is free. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Crichton-Browne: You never signed any piece of paper saying: ``Make Coronation Hill a sacred site''?</PARA>
<PARA> Nipper Brown: No. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Crichton-Browne: Mr Barraway,-</PARA>
<PARA>one of the other Jawoyn elders-</PARA>
<PARA>have you ever signed anything asking for Coronation Hill to be made a sacred site?</PARA>
<PARA> Mr Barraway: No, I have never. </PARA>
<PARA>The reason I asked both those gentlemen was that it is alleged that they sought an application to make Coronation Hill a sacred site, and they are shown on the application as the applicants. I asked:</PARA>
<PARA> Have you ever thought of Coronation Hill as a sacred site?</PARA>
<PARA> Mr Barraway: No. </PARA>
<PARA>It was after some further inquiry that we discovered that it was alleged that they had in fact signed the application form which they now disowned. </PARA>
<PARA> Then we addressed the question of the Bula and the sickness country and significance of the area generally. Nipper Brown was recognised as the senior elder amongst those present. The report continues:</PARA>
<PARA> Senator Crichton-Browne: There is no bula on Coronation Hill?</PARA>
<PARA> Nipper Brown: Nothing. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Crichton-Browne: So the Coronation Hill area is not a sacred site area?</PARA>
<PARA> Nipper Brown: Nothing. It is free. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Crichton-Browne: Did some people make a mistake and think Coronation Hill was a sacred site?</PARA>
<PARA> Nipper Brown: It is free. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Crichton-Browne: Are you happy for BHP to explore on Coronation Hill?</PARA>
<PARA> Nipper Brown: We are all happy if they go ahead and explore for gold or anything like that. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Crichton-Browne: Is there a senior elder amongst the men here today? Who is the senior man?</PARA>
<PARA> Nipper Brown: I am. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Crichton-Browne: You are the chief?</PARA>
<PARA> Nipper Brown: Yes. </PARA>
<PARA>We had previously received evidence from Ms Wynjorroc and Ms Flora that there was no Bula at Coronation Hill and it had no intrinsic spiritual value. They said that it was of no significance. It is not without consequence to note that in respect of the Jawoyn Katherine area land claim before Justice Kearney-it was Ms Wynjorroc and Ms Flora who gave evidence. Therefore they are presumably judged by the Jawoyn people to be an authority. </PARA>
<PARA> There is some considerable debate in respect to BHP's activities in the area. I am certainly no apologist for the mining companies, least of all BHP. In further evidence to the Committee at Barunga by the Jawoyn people on 9 March, the transcript reads:</PARA>
<PARA> Chairman-Are the Jawoyn people happy with the situation at present where BHP has a permit for exploration?</PARA>
<PARA> Mr Fordiman-Yes. </PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="XF4">Senator Crichton-Browne</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Have the Jawoyn people always been happy with their negotiations with BHP?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Mr Byer: Yes. </PARA>
<PARA>He was also one of the elders. The evidence on page 315 continues in that light. It is clear from the evidence received from the Aboriginal community that Coronation Hill is not sacred site, is not a Bula, is not part of the sickness country, and it is not an area of intrinsic spiritual value, which Aborigines judge ought not be mined. In fact, at a meeting of the Jawoyn people they gave approval to BHP. Perhaps it ought to be remembered that half of the total employees on the BHP site are Jawoyn and there are something like 60 Jawoyn people presently on the waiting list requesting work on the site. </PARA>
<PARA> It is a great tragedy that these people are being used and manipulated, harassed and bullied and encouraged under duress to change their minds as to the real position. I am ever so sorry that we now find Senator Collins flying into the fray, casting doubt upon Coronation Hill in terms of the Aboriginal relationship with it. Those points were made. Those conclusions were to be found in the minority report, contrary to the majority report, and yet every member of the Labor Party on the Committee signed the majority report and refused to sign the minority report. </PARA>
<PARA> Question resolved in the affirmative. </PARA>
