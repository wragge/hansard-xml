<PARA>To the Honourable the President of the Senate and members of the Senate in Parliament assembled:</PARA>
<PARA> The petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth, that:</PARA>
<PARA> We are concerned about the increase in violent television programmes for children and particularly those programmes promoting violent toys that are available for sale in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA> Your petitioners therefore humbly pray; that you support the Broadcasting (Prohibition of Violent Programmes for Children) Act 1988 which has been presented by WA Independent Senator for Nuclear Disarmament, Jo Vallentine. This act aims to prohibit the broadcasting of children's TV programmes that are violent and that promote toys modelled on characters, weapons or other war accessories which are also available for sale in Australia.</PARA>

<PARA>To the Honourable the President and members of the Senate in Parliament assembled.</PARA>
<PARA> The humble petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth that:</PARA>
<PARA> The Parliamentary Joint Select Committee on Video Material has concluded that ``Adverse effects upon people, and especially upon children, of exposure to material containing various degrees of violence, pornography or obscenity have been demonstrated''.</PARA>
<PARA> The majority of the Select Committee strongly opposed the proposition for a new NVE (non-violent erotica) category, which would have entrenched X-rated video pornography.</PARA>
<PARA> All six State Governments have, through their Attorneys'-General, expressed unanimous opposition to the circulation of X-rated videos.</PARA>
<PARA> We consider the continuing distribution of X-rated videos from the A.C.T. to be reprehensible and to be contrary to the wellbeing of the Australian community in general.</PARA>
<PARA> We strongly request urgent Government action to prohibit the distribution of X-rated and excessively violent video material.</PARA>

This subject was examined exhaustively by the 1985-86 Senate Select Committee on Senator Harradine's Human Embryo Experimentation Bill which received 270 submissions and more than 2,000 pages of evidence.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="BH4">Senator HILL</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I direct my question to the Minister for Justice. Is it a fact that Australian Federal Police (AFP) investigating the murder of Assistant Commissioner Winchester sought certain details of membership or attendance at a meeting of the Belconnen branch of the Australian Labor Party (ALP)? If so, was this because the police wanted to check the alibi of a person or persons on the night of the crime? Is it a fact that, initially, the branch declined to cooperate with the Australian Federal Police? Is it further a fact that after the publicity of recent days there was a change of mind and access was granted? Finally, is the Minister, as a leading member of the ALP, concerned at this apparent attempt by members of his Party to impede Australian Federal Police investigations of this horrendous crime?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="NJ4">Senator TATE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Hill will be aware, as would any other interested senator, of the facts relating to this matter because a media release was put out yesterday on behalf of the Commissioner of the Australian Federal Police to this effect, and I will read it in full. It states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Commissioner of the Australian Federal Police, Mr Peter McAulay, said today (10 April) that there are no police inquiries into the Belconnen Branch of the ALP.</PARA>
<PARA> However, it is a fact that the AFP did approach the Belconnen Branch of the ALP shortly after Assistant Commissioner Winchester's murder to determine if certain persons had attended a certain meeting on a particular night.</PARA>
<PARA>That is a way of saying on the night of the murder. The media release goes on:</PARA>
<PARA> The Federal Police have continued to conduct a number of lines of investigation in relation to Assistant Commissioner Winchester's murder but to comment further could prejudice the investigation.</PARA>
<PARA>I think that puts the whole matter in proper perspective. The Federal Police have been following every possible line of inquiry in relation to this particular assassination of a senior police officer-in fact the most senior police officer to be assassinated in the Western world this century-and for that reason no stone has been left unturned in its investigative effort. That involved making an approach to the branch for assistance in looking at its attendance register. I have no reason to believe that that cooperation was not made available to the Australian Federal Police. I know for a fact that an officer of the branch, Miss Rosemary Follett, offered to make the full meeting records available for perusal by investigative officers only yesterday, but I do not believe that that was the first occasion. The fact is that the ALP branch officers have been, as I understand it-and I am going now only on media reports-very willing to assist the AFP in its inquiries in this matter. There should be no assumption that there is any wider inquiry being undertaken into the Belconnen branch of the ALP by the AFP.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4F4">Senator BUTTON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am very pleased to be perceived by Senator Crowley in relation to my newly found responsibilities, in the absence of Senator Reynolds. The Government's record in improving women's chances of a fair go in employment is a very positive one. Almost 60 per cent of the 1.3 million jobs that have been created since this Government came to office have gone to women. In March 1989 women's full time employment increased by a further 1,600. The unemployment rate for women is now 6.7 per cent, the lowest figure since the December quarter 1976, and 4 per cent lower than when we came to office. Women's participation in the work force regularly comes in at over 50 per cent. Over 40 per cent of the labour force is female and this is regarded, I believe, by most observers as a sign of a maturing economy and not as an indictment, as Senator Walters opposite has stated on one or two occasions. Nonetheless, the Government acknowledges that work remains to be done in improving women's access to employment. Australia still has a higher gender segregated work force, with associated lower average weekly earnings for women, than some other countries.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Government has put in place a legislative program to try to tackle these problems. The Government also sees the achievement of equal employment opportunity for women as part of a micro-economic reform question, in particular our labour market reform package which is all about making the best possible use of human resources in the interests of Australia. The gains in efficiency that we expect to come from award restructuring and related reforms mean that women will gain access to a wider range of occupations, better advancement within occupations and improved, and a re-evaluation of, skills. To the extent that this is successful, the gains will accrue not only to women but to the economy as a whole.</PARA>
<PARA> Those who want women out of the work force or even refer to them as `economic conscripts', as Senator Newman and Senator Hill in one of his more aberrant moments have done, do the economy as much of a disservice as they do women. I should point out that the days are gone when the average household comprised a working husband and a wife working full time in the home caring for children. This characterises only 16.2 per cent of all income units paying tax. The Business Council of Australia stated in its recent bulletin:</PARA>
<PARA>The fact is . . . the majority of women want to be in the workforce, but they also do most of the child rearing, caring for the aged and domestic management. If women do have children, the combination of seeking a return on their personal investment in education and commencing a career, economic and financial circumstances and personal preferences leads most to seek re-entry to the paid work-force.</PARA>
<PARA>The Business Council goes on to note that enterprises which seek solutions to the difficulties faced by women seeking to re-enter the work force will have a competitive edge in the labour market. Labour market reform aims to give Australia that competitive edge, and this Government will continue to do its best to make sure that women's contribution to competitiveness is fully realised.</PARA>
<PARA> While that is a longer answer than I usually give, I think it is important to get this issue in perspective, which is something that the Opposition has not done. For example, Senator Newman said in March this year, `So many of these women are economic conscripts'. Senator Walters said, `For the first time under Labor this year we have 50 per cent of women in the work force. What an indictment!'. Senator Hill said something similar on 8 March, but in a notice of motion on 4 April he urged the Government vigorously to pursue programs designed to give women greater financial security and financial independence involving a number of issues, including training and worthwhile employment opportunities.</PARA>
<PARA> The coalition, of course, opposed the Equal Employment Opportunity (Commonwealth Authorities) Bill when it went through the Parliament in 1987. Senator Hill crossed the floor and voted against his own Party on that occasion. As usual, there is a total degree of confusion in the Opposition about these issues, and it is important that I answer the question at that length for those reasons.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have seen a press release, dated 2 April, put out under the letterhead of Senator Irina Dunn and headed `Wildlife conservation not possible in south-east New South Wales without creation of new national parks immediately'. It does refer to Dr Harry Recher, who is styled as a former principal research scientist with the Australian Museum and now senior lecturer with the Department of Ecosystem Management at the University of New England. I am not in a position to query Dr Recher's credentials. He is in his own right an academic of considerable standing and status. Senator Brownhill asked me whether he is the same Dr Recher who gave evidence under oath in a court proceeding, and whose evidence was found faulty, in the Terania Creek case. I cannot actually confirm that detail directly. I assume he is the same fellow but I cannot confirm it from my own memory.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The whole debate about the south-east forests is moving into the realm of fantasy. I had a press conference yesterday at which I issued a press release. I think at best 1 1/2 newspapers referred to the press release in their coverage of stories that emanated from that conference. I think there is a need for a higher level of reporting on this issue so that the facts are clear. I think that is a desirable matter.</PARA>
<PARA> Senator Dunn's role in this debate has been quite unequivocally-in terms of her own quite strong commitment to and support of those beliefs-to argue the side of the conservation movement. I do not for one minute deny that it has a case that the community of Australia is required to listen to. I congratulate it on the way it has put its argument. However, one needs to distinguish between that case and the case that is put with equal force on the other side and the implications of simply accepting some of the wider assertions about the environment and the sawlog and woodchip industry. The livelihood of many Australians who are on low wages, poorly educated and locked into regional areas of Australia from which they have little opportunity to transfer is affected by that argument. I sympathise with those blue collar workers, given the anxiety the situation creates for their future.</PARA>
<PARA> This Government has been wanting to find a balanced solution to the issue, one in which the environment concerns of the area are best protected-my colleague Senator Richardson has advised me about that-one in which we protect the industry base. In that way, rather than exporting out of Australia the rawest forest product, woodchips, and buying back the most expensive forest product, paper, we could use our comparative advantage in this area and develop an indus- try approach which encourages value adding all the way down the path. That means in pulp and paper production in this country. The key to doing that is to encourage and provide sufficient incentive for Australian native hardwoods-the hardwoods in shortest supply for pulp manufacture in the world at the moment-to be put in plantations in this country so that the industry base is secured on the basis of a plantation resource.</PARA>

Is the Government considering such an increase in expenditure on roads?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="TJ4">Senator WALSH</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There have been several questions about road funding in the last few days. One of the things I note with some satisfaction is that the automobile associations around the country have finally acknowledged that there is not and should not be a one to one ratio between taxes or excise levied on fuel and Commonwealth Government expenditure on roads. I regard that as some progress.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Royal Automobile Association of South Australia put out a press release last Friday defending its campaign and saying that it had never advocated spending all of the fuel excise on roads and was seeking a `modest' 2c per litre increase. That might seem to be modest, but what the Automobile Association is advocating at 2c is a very large $470m increase in Commonwealth outlays. It is also inconsistent with the Association's own official magazine, the South Australian Motor, for March and April of this year, in which the President of the RAA, Mr Bill Steele, is quoted as saying:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . the Government returns only five cents to roads; what we want is 7.5 cents.</PARA>
<PARA> That is an extra 2.5c, which amounts to a modest, or immodest, addition to outlays of $590m. The South Australian RAA also suggested that an amount equal to this could easily be found from cutting out wasteful programs. A sum of $590m is vastly in excess of the amount that Senator Michael Baume, even at the height of his antics, was able to identify as Chairman of the Waste Watch Committee by abolishing a number of little government agencies, the total amount of which added up to about $32m. Even if one agrees with Senator Baume that all those little government funded agencies should be abolished, that will give us $32m, which still leaves a long way to go to $590m.</PARA>
<PARA> What the South Australian RAA is in fact asking for is an increase in spending which could only be accommodated by cuts such as eliminating the $418m paid as Austudy for tertiary students plus the $200m or thereabouts paid in Austudy for secondary students. In view of all that, I am not surprised that a number of RAA members are getting pretty annoyed that their membership fees are being siphoned off into producing Liberal Party propaganda and that the chief of the RAA, Mr Fotheringham, is acting as a political mouthpiece. The last point I want to make is that the official of the South Australian RAA with whom I appeared on an Australian Broadcasting Corporation program in Adelaide yesterday pointed to the alleged very bad condition of roads in places like Cleve, Lock and Kimba on the Eyre Peninsula. Ironically, that is an agricultural area that is represented by the only National Party of Australia member for South Australia, a member of the Legislative Assembly. He represents that area. Both the National Party and the National Farmers Federation less than two years ago, as Senator Stone well knows, were advocating that less Commonwealth money should be spent on roads and not more.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There are something like 10 questions there. At least Senator Coulter did give me some advance notice of them, so I am able to give him a response. As to the first question, yes, I am advised that the CAA has purchased a property on Marble Hill for a secondary surveillance radar to service aircraft in the Adelaide area. This site is to the east of the airport and provides extensive coverage for aircraft approaching Adelaide from the eastern States. A site in the Mount Lofty Ranges is required in order to give sufficient coverage to the east. This radar will supplement the existing radar at the Adelaide airport which is currently affected by the Mount Lofty Ranges.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As to the second question, which was whether the property was bought at auction by a man with children rather than openly by the CAA, I am advised that the CAA used an agent to purchase the land and bid at the auction. However, the administrative officer of the Adelaide office of the CAA who was arranging the purchase was in attendance and did have his two children with him as his wife was in hospital. In keeping with normal practice, the agent did not reveal his connection with the CAA until after the auction. To do so would place the CAA at risk in bidding for the property. As the auction price did not reach the reserve, the agent entered into negotiations with the vendor and at that stage revealed his connection with the CAA.</PARA>
<PARA> The answer to the third and fourth questions is no. As regards the fifth question, as indicated in response to the first, the property is to be used for the siting of a secondary surveillance radar. I am advised that the CAA has undertaken extensive analysis of suitable sites in the Mount Lofty Ranges. This site has been identified as the most suitable available. However, following a community consultation meeting last Friday, 7 April, with CAA officers, a committee of local residents has been formed, and they will be examining a number of alternative sites with the CAA.</PARA>
<PARA> As to the seventh question, which was whether this development is part of $100m expenditure on radar facilities here and in other parts of Australia, the radar sensor procurement program involving an expenditure of over $100m will see the replacement and extension of the Australian radar network with 19 new radar installations extending from Cairns to Perth. Two new radars will be located in the Adelaide area.</PARA>
<PARA> As regards the eighth question, like all Commonwealth statutory authorities, the CAA is not directly bound by State and local government planning regulations. However, the CAA is required to abide by the Environment Protection (Impact of Proposals) Act 1974. This Act is administered by the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories, and his Department maintains close liaison with the State and local authorities.</PARA>
<PARA> Ninthly, in accordance with the Act to which I have just referred, a notice of intent is being prepared. It is a matter for the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories to decide whether an EIS is required. The answer to the tenth question is yes.</PARA>

Has the Minister's attention been drawn to a letter which appeared in yesterday's Australian Financial Review written by Mr John Simmonds, Federal Secretary of the Post Office Agents Association? Does the Minister agree with Mr Simmonds that there ought to be a tax incentive for workers not covered by occupational superannuation schemes to make private provision for their retirement income needs?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="TJ4">Senator WALSH</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have seen the letter and I agree with the basic points that Mr Simmonds makes. Mr Simmonds, however, appears to be unaware of the fact that there is already such an incentive. It was substantially increased with effect from 1 July last year. At that time the ceiling on tax deductable contributions by the self-employed and also employees not covered by employer sponsored funds under section 82aa of the Income Tax Assessment Act was increased from the previous $1,500 to $3,000. That means that a self-employed person with an income of around $27,000, which is just above average weekly earnings, can put $3,000 of that income into one of the various superannuation schemes, claiming the whole $3,000 as a deduction from that taxable income, and then be taxed on the remaining $24,000. That essentially puts him or her in an equivalent position as that of a wage or salary earner on a taxable income of $24,000 whose employer is making a contribution to a funded superannuation scheme at a rate of 12 1/2 per cent of wages or salaries.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I think I am safe in saying that there are not very many funded schemes to which employers contribute at a rate higher than 12 1/2 per cent. If the hypothetical self-employed person chooses to put more than $3,000 into a super scheme, the money over and above that $3,000 is not deductable from the taxable income at the time but it is exempt from the 15 per cent tax levied on employer contributions to super schemes. In other words, it is treated in exactly the same way as are employee contributions to occupational superannuation schemes.</PARA>
<PARA> What I have said in regard to self-employed persons applies in the same way to employees whose employers do not provide them with any employer sponsored occupational super other than the 3 per cent productivity money. As I said at the beginning, I agree with the conclusions to which Mr Simmonds has come but clearly he is not fully aware of the facts. I will see that he does become aware of the facts and suggest that he alert the members of his Association to these substantial superannuation savings incentives which are already part of the income tax system.</PARA>

Of course, a lot of concern has been expressed about the equity implications of the proposal that was announced following last year's Premiers Conference. Senator Reynolds initiated a number of consultations with local government. Her investigations confirmed that unresolvable inequities would occur should the proposal proceed to claw back 90 per cent of the rates by reducing financial assistance to local government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Most local government authorities may have been disadvantaged while only a very few, with a large concentration of Telecom and Australia Post facilities, would have benefited. Subsequently the Treasurer and Senator Reynolds recommended to the Government that it not proceed with the arrangements to recoup the additional rate revenue. The Government has accepted their advice. The decision means that local government will be able to rate Telecom and Australia Post facilities from 1 July. The Federal Government will now not recoup any of the additional rate revenue generated. Telecom and Australia Post have estimated that the additional rate revenue generated by this decision will total $28m per annum. I think the decision reflects the Government's willingness to listen to the concerns of local government and our desire to treat that level of government fairly.

It should be noted that at the peak of the increase in bankruptcies, bankruptcies caused by consumer debt totalled less than 10,000 per annum. In fact, bankruptcy has been declining and it is pleasing for me to able to announce today that figures I have just seen indicate a 22.8 per cent decrease in the number of bankrupts for the quarter ending March this year as opposed to those for the same quarter last year. There has been a 14.7 per cent decrease in the number of bankruptcies for the nine months to March this year compared with the same period last year.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It should also be noted that in commenting in this way the media have managed to ignore essential parts of the report which indicate that consumer debt did peak in 1986, after a steady increase in the early 1980s, but has fallen over the past two years. It should also be recognised that a substantial cause for this decrease has been the employment policies of this Government. Unemployment was 50 per cent higher in 1983-84 than it is now, according to the March figures for this year. Employment has increased by 1.3 million people over that period under this Government.</PARA>
<PARA> Despite the amelioration in the situation, the Government's job has not ended. EPAC has raised a number of issues which are already being acted upon by the Government. In the area of financial counselling, training and education I have already mentioned in this place the proposal to organise industry funding to assist financial counsellors in those essential functions of training and education. We have already passed legislation in this Parliament to amend the Bankruptcy Act to ensure that a one week moratorium is introduced so that those who intend to go bankrupt get advice from financial counsellors before they do so. Another part of the report deals with the whole question of consumer awareness campaigns. This Government is embarking upon a process to target those disadvantaged sections of our community, particularly youth, in terms of gearing education to them.</PARA>
<PARA> Another major issue which EPAC mentions is the adequacy of State credit legislation. In fact, this issue has been one of my highest priorities in the last 12 months. Last year State and Federal Ministers for Consumer Affairs discussed-and this year they will continue to discuss-a concept of uniform legislation to cover the consumer credit area. To date, we have legislation which covers only the regulation of finance companies, but does not cover the banking sector, credit unions and building societies. It is the intention of all Ministers to ensure that by July this year we come up with an approach which not only gives us uniformity in legislation but also gives a significant extension to consumer rights in those areas which I have mentioned.</PARA>
<PARA> So, in summary, it is fair to say that the indication in the report that 100,000 Australian families are going bankrupt is not right. But it is also fair to say that the Government's policies are very much geared towards addressing this problem in a constructive way.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator GARETH EVANS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will have to ask my colleague, the Minister for Science, Customs and Small Business, whether it is in fact the longest period without major direct conflict since the days of the Roman Empire. Certainly, it is the case that there has been no direct conflict between the major nations of the developed world since 1945. It is also the case that these nations, in common with Australia, would today certainly perceive this kind of war, like any war, as both repulsive and futile. This is not to say, of course, that we now live in a peaceful world. Indeed, many of these nations have been directly and indirectly engaged in other conflicts over that period.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> On the question of major threats to the status quo, to which Senator Maguire referred, it is important to recognise the difference between the irrationality and the possibility of war. There still exist large, professional infrastructures devoted to defence, and while these exist political disputes between nations, including those of the developed world, always risk leading to war. This consideration accounts for the Australian Government's very active role in encouraging the major powers to agree on substantial arms reductions which still retain stability in both their nuclear and conventional forces.</PARA>
<PARA> The best hope of significantly extending the period in which there have been no major wars between developed nations is to encourage nations to recognise the substantial risks inherent in the use of force-that is something I wish the Liberal Opposition would have regard to, with its cavalier approach to many of these issues and its gung-ho encouragement of activity-and to concentrate on advancing national interests and strengthening stability based on international cooperation on security and arms control issues.</PARA>
<PARA> So far as our own position is concerned, we currently enjoy, as has been said in various places, not least in the White Paper by my colleague Mr Beazley, a favourable security outlook with no identifiable military threat. We certainly cannot give ourselves over to the rosy view taken by some people in this chamber that unilateral disarmament could increase our security. Our defence planning continues to give priority to defending Australia against the kind of military pressure that could arise in the shorter term.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4F4">Senator BUTTON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am certainly aware of all those media reports that Senator Giles refers to in her question. Furthermore, I am well aware of some of the underlying issues. In answer to the first part of the question, the shedding of staff does not follow from the budget shortfall in CSIRO. It does, however, arise from fundamental changes resulting from strategic decisions taken by the CSIRO board and management. The structure and charter of CSIRO has been comprehensively reviewed over the past few years. In 1986, the Government amended the Organisation's enabling Act to reflect contemporary requirements for a primarily government funded research body. The Organisation itself engaged McKinsey and Co. Inc. to examine its role and structure. The resulting changes have a focus of a much more responsive and business-oriented organisation. An examination of the Organisation's administrative structure and systems has also been undertaken and implement- ation is almost complete.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The strategic decision which has been taken by CSIRO management will allow CSIRO to deploy its internal resources in a similar manner to the best overseas laboratories, and is a long overdue reform of critical importance to CSIRO's operational flexibility. A $14.2m budget shortfall for 1988-89 has come to light as a result of the implementation of improved costing and accounting procedures within CSIRO. The present problems within CSIRO are as a result of its adaptation to long term trends, not political issues of the day. They are well understood by all Ministers who have the CSIRO, as well as wider science and technology issues, under scrutiny at the present time.</PARA>
<PARA> While I am on my feet, I point out that this issue and the public debate about this issue are not helped by the sorts of statements emanating from the Opposition. For example, on 9 March, two shadow Ministers put out statements relating to CSIRO. One was from Mr Julian Beale, who is described on his letterhead as the `Shadow Minister for Education'. Mr Beale said:</PARA>
<PARA>The federal Government must release the Report to Cabinet by Science Minister, Barry Jones, calling for greatly increased science funding . . .</PARA>
<PARA>There is no report to Cabinet. Mr Beale's statement continued:</PARA>
<PARA>The Cabinet . . . rejected the Jones request.</PARA>
<PARA>whatever it is said to have been. That is not correct. He continued:</PARA>
<PARA>Jones and the Science Department-</PARA>
<PARA>There is no Science Department and there has not been one for two years. One would have thought that a shadow Minister might have been aware of that. He continued:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . had asked especially for increased funding of biotechnology, water and soil conservation, and superconductivity.</PARA>
<PARA>That is not correct. That statement is totally incorrect. He said:</PARA>
<PARA>This panic move follows disagreements on policy between Mr Jones, Mr Dawkins and Senator Button.</PARA>
<PARA>There is no disagreement on policy of a fundamental kind. On the same day, Mr McGauran, who does describe himself as Opposition spokesman on science and energy, had a fair bit to say, which is pretty distinct from what Mr Beale was saying that day. Mr McGauran is advocating a parliamentary committee which `would have the vital task of rewriting the charter so that it ensures a supportive political working environment for the organisation'-that is, CSIRO-`and its responsibilities'. He goes on to say that the committee would `make some critical decisions about the future of scientific research work in Australia'.</PARA>
<PARA> It is the Government's view, and it was also the view of the Fraser Government, that it is not government business to make detailed critical decisions about science and the directions of science. That is why governments of each political persuasion have provided a one-line appropriation for CSIRO and invested in it and its management the responsibility for making decisions about the scientific directions of the Organisation. As usual the Opposition's statements on this issue represent a degree of confusion and, sadly, ignorance, which is alarming for anybody who might at some stage in a year or so--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Is the Minister for Finance aware of the latest Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) figures, which show that there has been a dramatic increase in investor activity since the re-introduction of negative gearing-from 9.4 per cent of all finance provided for housing in the September quarter of 1987 to 20.7 per cent in the December quarter of 1988? Is the Minister further aware that in raw figures this is a total increase in investor finance from $121.2m to $443.6m, which breaks down to an increase in purchase finance for existing dwellings from $68.6m to $302.6m-an increase of almost five times-and an increase in construction finance from $52.6m to only $141m-an increase of only three times? Does the Minister agree that this shows clearly that investors are largely using negative gearing to displace home buyers, not to build new housing? Is the Minister concerned with the effects of this negative gearing exercise which the Government set in place with the concurrence of the Opposition-effects which are demonstrated by the December quarter figures from the Victorian Department of Housing and Construction `Rental Report', which show that in the 12 months from December 1987 rentals increased by almost twice the inflation rate in Victoria? Will the Minister concede that negative gearing has clearly failed as a means of resolving the housing crisis by resulting in a displacement of intending home buyers with speculating investors?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will try to keep the answer shorter than the question but I will probably not succeed because there are a number of points which need to be made. Senator Powell, or someone from her staff, dropped this question into my office at about 12.30 today. The figures that she cited on finance provided for housing during the September quarter show an increase from 9.4 per cent to 20.7 per cent. Nobody in my office has been able to find any figures in any official publication that are equal to those, or any category or classification that is clearly identifiable or can be matched with that description. I cannot really comment on the figures per se, but assuming the figures mean something--</PARA></TALK.START>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Senator Richardson" NAMEID="4E4">

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="TJ4">Senator WALSH</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Perhaps it is a pretty heroic assumption, but it appears that the figures did not come from the ABS; perhaps they came from the fairy at the bottom of the garden. Whatever the correct figures are-if the categories are accurately described-they appear to relate to finance for housing, allegedly for negative gearing or for investment but not for construction. In other words, there is a turnover component in this which does not affect the total stock of housing.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The other point which ought to be made is that, without wishing to be too disrespectful, the Australian Democrats are always attracted to conspiracy theories of various types. A minor variant of the conspiracy theory here is that people who want to be home buyers are being displaced by people who are buying properties for rental. If that is true-I do not know whether it is true-it means by definition that more housing is available for rental, and not only available for rental but it is being rented. By definition, to take advantage of negative gearing the owner of a property must have a tenant. If there are losers on the buyer side of the market there will be gainers on the rental side. Frankly, I do not know how that all balances out, but I suggest that Senator Powell, before she asks questions like this again, should source the figures which are stated in her questions and try to describe what she is talking about somewhat more accurately than the subjects that are described in this question.</PARA>

<PARA>If Senator Powell really wants figures to be checked quickly, it would help if she gave the catalogue number which is attached to every ABS publication that I am aware of. It is not clear, I should also say, whether the figures to which she has referred-essentially unsourced-include new personal loans taken out by owner-occupiers using their own homes as security. This is a `service' which some financial institutions have provided to people. If you have substantial equity in your house then why not borrow some of it and take an overseas holiday? It is that sort of thing. Personally, I make the observation that such activities do nothing to help the nation's macro-economic problems. However, that sort of activity has clearly been available and I presume is being availed of. For all I know, given the vagueness of descriptions of the alleged statistics, that could be included as well. That, of course, would have absolutely nothing to do with turnover in housing stock, additions to the housing stock or the ownership of the housing stock.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Last week Senator Knowles asked me a question about the costs of mailing information to medical practitioners about drugs under the pharmaceutical benefits scheme. I am now in a position to answer that question. Medical practitioners were provided with advance notice of the de-listing of the 12 brands from the pharmaceutical benefits scheme list in the December 1988 schedule of the pharmaceutical benefits. However, they would not have been fully informed of the circumstances surrounding the de-listing, including the fact that alternative brands remaining on the subsidised list have been subject to the same stringent standards of government testing as the de-listed products.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Government was reluctantly forced into undertaking an advertising campaign on this issue in an endeavour to counteract a campaign of misinformation being waged by the pharmaceutical industry and the Pharmacy Guild of Australia. Because of the fear and uncertainty generated by these vested financial interests, the Government had a clear responsibility to inform the elderly and chronically ill through their health care professionals of all the facts on the delisting of the 12 brands and to allay concerns about the availability and efficacy of the alternative brands still listed on the pharmaceutical benefits scheme. The information capsule, which was distributed to 26,000 medical practitioners throughout Australia, cost $45,000, including packaging, collating, labelling and postage. The unit cost was $1.73. The capsule method of distribution was selected ahead of conventional envelope distribution on the advice of the advertising agency consulting to the Government on this campaign, which considered the capsule more likely to attract the attention of busy medical practitioners and therefore ensure that the Government's message on this issue was effectively communicated. It is pointed out that the drug industry in Australia spends an estimated $3m per week on drug promotion and product information, directed mostly at general practitioners. A conventional envelope would have been unlikely to penetrate the plethora of written material received by doctors.</PARA>

<PARA> (a) the terms of those proposals and the clauses of any legislation proposed for the establishment of ATSIC;</PARA>
<PARA> (b) the effectiveness of the process of consultation undertaken by the Government with respect to the ATSIC proposal;</PARA>
<PARA> (c) the proposal of the Aboriginal Development Commission for `an alternative strategy for Aboriginal self-management';</PARA>
<PARA> (d) the Government's treatment of the Aboriginal Development Commissioners, including the dismissal of 8 of the Commissioners. </PARA>
<PARA>Subsequent to the establishment of the Committee, the Government introduced the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Bill 1988, which is still on the Senate Notice Paper. The Committee's report comprises a majority report of Senators McMullan, Collins, Devlin and Coulter, with a total of 40 recommendations, a dissenting report by Senators Peter Baume and Boswell, and a further report by Senator Coulter on two particular matters. The Government's response deals with the recommendations in each of these reports.</PARA>
<PARA> The Senate will be aware that a number of inquiries have been established by the Government into aspects of the administration of Aboriginal affairs, and today in another place the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) and the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs (Mr Hand) will be responding to the reports received from those inquiries and outlining the Government's intentions in relation to the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission (ATSIC). I am informed that the statement of the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs will encompass the main features of the Government's response to the report of the Senate Select Committee. These statements will, of course, also be made to the Senate. I shall therefore not delay the Senate at this point by referring to matters which will be dealt with in those statements, save to note that the Government has accepted, in whole or in substance, a large proportion of the majority recommendations. </PARA>
<PARA> I seek leave to incorporate in Hansard the Government's response to recommendations contained in the report of the Senate Select Committee on the Administration of Aboriginal Affairs. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The document read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA>SENATE SELECT COMMITTEE ON THE ADMINISTRATION OF ABORIGINAL AFFAIRS</PARA>
<PARA>Majority Recommendations</PARA>
<PARA>Recommendation 1</PARA>
<PARA> A separate office of Aboriginal Affairs be retained within the Employment, Education and Training portfolio. The precise structure of the office is a matter to be determined by the Government of the day. The office would be responsible for advising the Minister on all matters relevant to the portfolio including the administration of legislation and the exercise of delegations for which he or she was responsible. (para 2.22)</PARA>
<PARA>Comment</PARA>
<PARA> The ATSIC Bill does not restrict the advice available to the Minister to that provided by ATSIC. Indeed, it was always envisaged, under the ATSIC proposal, that there could be circumstances where the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs (and also the portfolio Minister) might occasionally require separate departmental advice on issues concerning ATSIC, and that this advice would come from the policy co-ordination area of the Department of Employment, Education and Training. </PARA>
<PARA>Response</PARA>
<PARA> The Minister will have access, as required, to departmental advice. </PARA>
<PARA>Recommendation 2</PARA>
<PARA> A greater proportion of the current activities of the ADC should be the responsibility of the proposed AEDC than is envisaged in the Bill. (para 2.35)</PARA>
<PARA>Comment</PARA>
<PARA> The effect of this recommendation would be make a major change to the character of the AEDC by putting all the ADC's present enterprise, land acquisition and investment functions with it. These functions include non-commercial elements such as subsidised interest rates and grants, and land acquisition for primarily social, rather than economic, purposes. The AEDC, however, has an essentially commercial orientation; this could be seriously impaired if non-commercial elements, on a significant scale, were to be added.</PARA>
<PARA> It is also envisaged that the AEDC would have a small, highly qualified staff operating from a centralised location, and making use of ATSIC field services for certain functions such as initial contact. A broader role raises the prospect that AEDC would operate through a more decentralised structure; to the extent that this were to happen, the efficiencies and economies to be obtained from amalgamation of existing DAA and ADC operations, and the benefits to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people flowing from the amalgamation, would be foregone. </PARA>
<PARA> Subsequent to the Report of the Senate Select Committee being presented to the Parliament, the Auditor-General has reported, inter alia, on a number of aspects of the ADC's enterprise program. The Auditor-General's findings have emphasised the non-commercial nature of many projects funded by the ADC under this program, and point strongly to the need for substantially firmer accountability requirements. </PARA>
<PARA> The reverse result, however, would be achieved by transferring the program to the AEDC, which is intended, as a purely commercial operation, to have a greater measure of autonomy than the ADC has enjoyed. </PARA>
<PARA>Response</PARA>
<PARA> Not agreed. In view, however, of the range of responsibilities that ATSIC Commissioners will have, the Commission will be empowered to set up a number of Boards to examine and make recommendations on specific subject areas. It is considered that this should help to improve the management of Commission business and to ease the pressures on the full Commission. </PARA>
<PARA>Recommendation 3</PARA>
<PARA> The AIAS should retain its own legislation and continue to deal with other Aboriginal Affairs portfolio agencies as it has in the past. The proposed reforms to the Institute contained in the ATSIC Bill should be implemented by amendment of the Australian Institute of Aboriginal Studies Act 1964. (para 2.46)</PARA>
<PARA>Comment</PARA>
<PARA> The main effect of this recommendation is that the reforms to AIAS which are currently included in the ATSIC Bill will now be enacted separately. There would still be 3 ATSIC Commissioners on the Council of the Institute. </PARA>
<PARA>Response</PARA>
<PARA> Agreed. </PARA>
<PARA>Recommendation 4</PARA>
<PARA> The ATSIC Bill be amended to require the Commission to report to the Minister and to Parliament within eighteen months of ATSIC's establishment on:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) the potential conflicts of purpose and responsibility identified at paragraphs 2.18 and 2.52-2.55; and</PARA>
<PARA> (b) suggested legislative amendment to resolve these conflicts. (para 2.60)</PARA>
<PARA>Comment</PARA>
<PARA> This recommendation would enable any difficulties that Commissioners may experience in reconciling their representative and executive responsibilities to be brought to notice and addressed. </PARA>
<PARA>Response</PARA>
<PARA> Agreed, but on basis of review after 2 years. </PARA>
<PARA>Recommendation 5</PARA>
<PARA> The ATSIC Bill be amended to require the responsible Minister to consult the Board of ATSIC prior to the appointment of a Chief Executive Officer. The Committee has also recommended at paragraph 3.47 that the Chief Executive Officer be appointed for a specified minimum period. (para. 2.63)</PARA>
<PARA>Comment</PARA>
<PARA> This recommendation would help the development of a sound working relationship between Commissioners and the Chief Executive Officer. Its immediate implementation, however, would raise a practical difficulty in relation to the first Chief Executive Officer who will have a vital role in the successful establishment of ATSIC. </PARA>
<PARA>Response</PARA>
<PARA> Agreed, except for the initial appointment for a period of 2 years, as recruitment action will need to be completed by the time ATSIC commences. </PARA>
<PARA>Recommendation 6</PARA>
<PARA> They [the Commissioners] should not be able to approve substantial expenditures, (grants, loans or guarantees) without a full written assessment of proposals including reports on viability, costings and alternatives. Clause 20 of the Bill which requires the ATSIC Board to prepare guidelines for its operations should include such a requirement. Similarly clause 144 of the Bill which governs meetings of the AEDC Board should be amended appropriately. (para 2.70)</PARA>
<PARA>Comment</PARA>
<PARA> This accords with sound management practice, and there is no objection to making it a formal requirement. </PARA>
<PARA>Response</PARA>
<PARA> Agreed. </PARA>
<PARA>Recommendation 7</PARA>
<PARA> A review of zonal and regional boundaries and representation be conducted prior to every second ATSIC election to ensure that an appropriate balance between fair representation and protection of traditional Aboriginal communities is maintained. Such reviews should be conducted by a panel appointed by the Minister including representatives of ATSIC and the Australian Electoral Commission. (para. 2.75)</PARA>
<PARA>Comment</PARA>
<PARA> This is consistent with the Government's intention that boundaries be kept under regular review, to ensure that they meet the preferences of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. </PARA>
<PARA>Response</PARA>
<PARA> Agreed. </PARA>
<PARA>Recommendation 8</PARA>
<PARA> The Regional Councils, as one of their first tasks review the Regional and Zonal Boundaries taking into account the principles of fair representation and protection of traditional kinship and association. (para. 2.76)</PARA>
<PARA>Comment</PARA>
<PARA> There is no objection to this proposal. </PARA>
<PARA>Response</PARA>
<PARA> Agreed. </PARA>
<PARA>Recommendation 9</PARA>
<PARA> A review of a regional boundary should be conducted if called for by at least 25% of voters in a Region and a review of a zonal boundary on request of 25% of the voters in a Zone. (para. 2.76)</PARA>
<PARA>Comment</PARA>
<PARA> This recommendation is seen as consistent with the general principle that Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people should be able to determine how the Regional Council structure can best meet their needs. </PARA>
<PARA>Response</PARA>
<PARA> Agreed, subject to recommendation 12. </PARA>
<PARA>Recommendation 10</PARA>
<PARA> The Department of Aboriginal Affairs initiate immediately a program of consultation on the regional boundaries with communities, organisations or individuals who have expressed concern to this Committee, to the Department or to the ATSIC Task Force and that the process of revision be a continuing responsibility as outlined in paragraph 2.64. (para. 2.111)</PARA>
<PARA>Comment</PARA>
<PARA> Consistent with the intent of this recommendation, the ATSIC Task Force has recently sent out more detailed boundary maps to DAA and ADC Regional Offices, seeking comments on whether these would reflect Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander preferences. Particular attention will be given to identified areas of concern, including those brought to the notice of the Select Committee. </PARA>
<PARA>Response</PARA>
<PARA> Agreed. </PARA>
<PARA>Recommendation 11</PARA>
<PARA> Regions with populations of less than 1000 elect ten Councillors, those between 1000 and 2000 elect eleven Councillors with one additional Councillor for each thousand of population until those with more than 10,000 voters have Councils of twenty Councillors. (para. 2.119)</PARA>
<PARA>Comment</PARA>
<PARA> This recommendation reflects a concern that, in elections within Zones for Commissioners, there be an appropriate balance in voting strength as between Regions in a Zone. It does not address, however, the question of disparities in population sizes as between Zones, which in many respects may be regarded as more significant. By itself, it could also bring into sharper focus the concern of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people in rural and traditional areas that their interests may be overshadowed by large urban populations in their Zones. </PARA>
<PARA>Response</PARA>
<PARA> Agreed. In addition, the Government recognises that the splitting of larger Zones, with a concomitant increase in the number of Commissioners, would help to resolve problems of population disparities. It will therefore propose to the Parliament that 5 additional Zones be created. </PARA>
<PARA> In 3 of the Zones with large populations-New South Wales (East), Queensland (South) and Western Australia (South)-the relevant metropolitan Regions each have populations over 10,000 and are therefore large enough to form their own Zones. Splitting the Queensland (North) and Northern Australian Zones will reduce these to population sizes nearer to the general Zone average. These changes will also eliminate the more significant disparities as between populations of Regions within particular Zones. </PARA>
<PARA>Recommendation 12</PARA>
<PARA> This population should be, in each instance, the population on an electoral roll. While placing one's name on the electoral roll should be voluntary, voting should be compulsory thereafter for those whose names are on the roll. The recall provisions should be exercisable only by those on the electoral roll. (para 2.130)</PARA>
<PARA>Comment</PARA>
<PARA> The proposal for a separate roll raises some significant issues, including the anomaly of voluntary enrolment but compulsory voting, and the resources required to establish and maintain the roll. More fundamental, however, are the persuasive arguments that can be mounted against the establishment of a public roll based on race. Nonetheless, the Government accepts that there are advantages in using some form of roll, provided this can be done in a way which is compatible with individual rights and the public interest. </PARA>
<PARA>Response</PARA>
<PARA> The possibility is being explored within the Australian Electoral Commission of a confidential system which would allow for the use of existing Federal electoral rolls combined with an acceptable mechanism for checking the bona fides of voters. </PARA>
<PARA>Recommendation 13</PARA>
<PARA> The Ministerial Review Panel (see para. 2.64) review the questions of rolls and compulsory voting after the first two successive elections and make recommendations for any change. The Committee further recommends that Regional Councils carry out a review and make recommendations on the same matters at the same time. (para. 2.133)</PARA>
<PARA>Comment</PARA>
<PARA> Subject to the need to take into account the response to recommendation 12, no difficulty is foreseen with this recommendation. </PARA>
<PARA>Response</PARA>
<PARA> Agree. </PARA>
<PARA>Recommendation 14</PARA>
<PARA> The ATSIC Bill be amended to permit Regions to choose their preferred method of selecting Councillors, subject to Ministerial confirmation. Where no agreed and acceptable proposal is received from a region the electoral process proposed by the Bill should be applied. Nothing in this recommendation should permit regional councils to increase their representation for the purpose of electing zonal Commissioners. (para. 2.145)</PARA>
<PARA>Comment</PARA>
<PARA> This recommendation would allow for recognition of cultural differences. The Government understands this-and has made special arrangements for the Torres Strait region to accommodate its unique cultural and geographic circumstances. However, it could also put the Minister in an impossible position in deciding whether a proposed variation reflected the wishes of voters in a Region and was consistent with the general purposes of the ATSIC legislation. </PARA>
<PARA>Response</PARA>
<PARA> Further consideration is desirable. It is therefore proposed that the Commission be required to report to the Minister and the Parliament on this matter, in the same context as the other matters for report covered by recommendation 4. </PARA>
<PARA>Recommendation 15</PARA>
<PARA> A requirement for regional managers to be available as requested at regional council meetings be included in the legislation. If regional councils meet less frequently than four times per year then the regional manager should provide a quarterly report on his or her work to the Chairman of the Regional Council. (para 2.154)</PARA>
<PARA>Comment</PARA>
<PARA> There is no difficulty with the intent of this proposal. </PARA>
<PARA>Response</PARA>
<PARA> Agree. The Bill will be amended to require the Chief Executive Officer to designate an officer or officers required to attend Regional Council meetings at the request of Councils. </PARA>
<PARA>Recommendation 16</PARA>
<PARA> The ATSIC Task Force, as part of its responsibility for the implementation of ATSIC prepare a detailed statement of the role and operation of Regional Councils for wide distribution. This should include the status, authority and funding of existing community groups and councils once ATSIC is in place. (para. 2.155)</PARA>
<PARA>Comment</PARA>
<PARA> This is being taken in hand in the context of the overall staff and community training and education program now being developed by the ATSIC Task Force. </PARA>
<PARA>Response</PARA>
<PARA> Agree. </PARA>
<PARA>Recommendation 17</PARA>
<PARA> Clause 52 (8) be amended to remove the requirement that the Minister must transfer any increase in the Torres Strait Regional allocation from the other regional allocations. (para. 2.163)</PARA>
<PARA>Comment</PARA>
<PARA> This recommendation, if adopted, would require that any additional funds that may be allocated to the Torres Strait Region be found from sources other than the allocations for other Regional Councils. </PARA>
<PARA>Response</PARA>
<PARA> Agree. </PARA>
<PARA>Recommendation 18</PARA>
<PARA> The Bill be amended to provide for review by ATSIC of various provisions. (para 2.171)</PARA>
<PARA>Comment</PARA>
<PARA> This would allow ATSIC to monitor and report on the operation and effectiveness of relevant aspects of the legislation. </PARA>
<PARA>Response</PARA>
<PARA> Agree. </PARA>
<PARA>Recommendation 19</PARA>
<PARA> The passage of the Bill through the Senate should proceed. (para. 3.16)</PARA>
<PARA>Comment</PARA>
<PARA> Self-explanatory. </PARA>
<PARA>Response</PARA>
<PARA> Agree. </PARA>
<PARA>Recommendation 20</PARA>
<PARA> The preamble in its present form be put to the Parliament as a separate and simultaneous resolution with the ATSIC Bill. (para. 3.16)</PARA>
<PARA>Comment</PARA>
<PARA> While this recommendation would help meet the concerns of those who maintain there could be wider legal implications of the Preamble (though the majority report notes there appears to be little substance to such concerns), the alternative of a resolution would be widely considered as more transitory and less substantial in form. </PARA>
<PARA>Response</PARA>
<PARA> Not agree. </PARA>
<PARA>Recommendation 21</PARA>
<PARA> Clause 3 of the ATSIC Bill be amended to include specific reference to self-management for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people as an object of the Bill and that the wording of section 3 of the ADC Act be included in clause 3 of the ATSIC Bill. (para. 3.18)</PARA>
<PARA>Comment</PARA>
<PARA> This would replicate, within the body of the Act, the recognition in the ADC Act of the past dispossession and dispersal of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples. It is not possible to replicate the exact words of section 3, due to the references to the ADC Capital Fund. However, the substance of section 3 will be taken up. </PARA>
<PARA>Response</PARA>
<PARA> Agree, subject to comments. </PARA>
<PARA>Recommendation 22</PARA>
<PARA> The Minister consult the AIAS on this question and examine either the transfer of the responsibility contained in clause 7 (h) to the AIAS or the amendment of clause 7 (h) to require that the Commission be empowered to exercise that power only after consultation with the AIAS. (para. 3.29)</PARA>
<PARA>Comment</PARA>
<PARA> This recommendation is intended to ensure that clause 7 (h) does not operate in a way that might adversely affect the role and interests of the Institute. </PARA>
<PARA>Response</PARA>
<PARA> Agree. </PARA>
<PARA>Recommendation 23</PARA>
<PARA> ATSIC's power to collect and publish statistics be limited to details of its own activities. (para. 3.32)</PARA>
<PARA>Comment</PARA>
<PARA> It has always been envisaged that ATSIC, like the Department of Aboriginal Affairs, would make full use of ABS services. There are some needs, however, which are not met by ABS collections-for example, aspects of the compilation of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander community profiles which form the basis of program planning and which will be important to the planning activities of Regional Councils. </PARA>
<PARA> It is understood that the concern expressed to the Select Committee may have arisen from an apprehension that the Bill, as worded, would enable the collection of information on individuals. This has never been intended. </PARA>
<PARA>Response</PARA>
<PARA> The Bill will be amended to include appropriate safeguards against intrusive and unnecessary statistical collections. </PARA>
<PARA>Recommendation 24</PARA>
<PARA> Any guidelines governing the making of loans or the giving of guarantees be published in the Commission's Annual Report and circulated to all Regional Councils. (para. 3.34)</PARA>
<PARA>Comment</PARA>
<PARA> Self-explanatory. A requirement to repeat such guidelines in each annual report, however, may not be the most effective and economic method of promulgation. </PARA>
<PARA>Response</PARA>
<PARA> Agree, subject to the comments noted. </PARA>
<PARA>Recommendation 25</PARA>
<PARA> Clauses 23 and 86 be amended to extend the period of ineligibility to one full term of a Regional Council after completion of the term of imprisonment. (para. 3.40)</PARA>
<PARA>Comment</PARA>
<PARA> This proposal would differ from the approaches taken on the issue of ineligibility in other Commonwealth legislation. It is considered that a preferable approach would be to adopt the scheme provided in the recent legislation for ACT self-government. </PARA>
<PARA>Response</PARA>
<PARA> It will be proposed to the Parliament that the Bill be amended to provide that a person will be ineligible if convicted and under sentence for an offence punishable by imprisonment for five years or longer. </PARA>
<PARA>Recommendation 26</PARA>
<PARA> Clauses 23 (2) and 86 (c) be strengthened by including specific offences and removing the limit of `one year or longer' on sentences. In addition the inclusion of undischarged bankruptcy as a ground for ineligibility is supported. (para. 3.41)</PARA>
<PARA>Comment</PARA>
<PARA> The comments above to recommendation 25 apply here also. </PARA>
<PARA>Response</PARA>
<PARA> As for recommendation 25. </PARA>
<PARA>Recommendation 27</PARA>
<PARA> Clause 31, `Termination of Appointment', should be amended to make it mandatory that a Commissioner cease to hold office where he or she is convicted of an offence mentioned in clause 23 or becomes a bankrupt during his or her term of service. Clause 104 already provides for the dismissal of a Regional Councillor in such circumstances. (para. 3.42)</PARA>
<PARA>Comment</PARA>
<PARA> Clause 104 does not provide for the dismissal of a Regional Councillor on the basis of bankruptcy. However it is accepted that appointments should be terminated if a person is convicted and under sentence for an offence punishable by imprisonment for 5 years or longer. </PARA>
<PARA> This approach would put Commissioners on the same basis as Regional Councillors. </PARA>
<PARA>Response</PARA>
<PARA> Agree, subject to comments above. </PARA>
<PARA>Recommendation 28</PARA>
<PARA> The Committee supports the proposals that the Deputy Chairperson be an elected Commissioner; that the position be rotated annually; that an elected Commissioner as Deputy Chairperson would be in the spirit of community participation; and that the position of Deputy Chairperson should be rotated among Commissioners. It recommends that clause 24 be amended accordingly. (para. 3.45)</PARA>
<PARA>Comment</PARA>
<PARA> Self-explanatory. </PARA>
<PARA>Response</PARA>
<PARA> Agree. </PARA>
<PARA>Recommendation 29</PARA>
<PARA> Clause 25 be amended to establish a minimum period of appointment for Commissioners of two years or until the next zone election, whichever falls earlier. The Committee also recommends that clauses 38 and 136 be amended to require that the instruments appointing the Chief Executive Officer and the Director of the AEDC state the minimum period of appointment being a period of not less than two years in the case of the Chief Executive Officer and one year in the case of the Directors of the AEDC. (para. 3.47)</PARA>
<PARA>Comment</PARA>
<PARA> This recommendation is intended to ensure a measure of stability for ATSIC and the AEDC. </PARA>
<PARA>Response</PARA>
<PARA> Agree. </PARA>
<PARA>Recommendation 30</PARA>
<PARA> Clause 28 be amended:</PARA>
<PARA> (i) to provide for the election of a replacement Commissioner where the office of Commissioner becomes vacant and where the next election for Commissioners will not be held for more than six months; and</PARA>
<PARA> (ii) to ensure that Ministerial appointments of acting Commissioners whether in the place of appointed or elected Commissioners be restricted to a period of six months and not be renewable. (para. 3.50)</PARA>
<PARA>Comment</PARA>
<PARA> Self-explanatory. </PARA>
<PARA>Response</PARA>
<PARA> Agree. </PARA>
<PARA>Recommendation 31</PARA>
<PARA> A limit of six months be placed on the term of leave to be allowed under clause 27. (para. 3.51)</PARA>
<PARA>Comment</PARA>
<PARA> Self-explanatory. </PARA>
<PARA>Response</PARA>
<PARA> Agree. </PARA>
<PARA>Recommendation 32</PARA>
<PARA> The Committee does not consider it appropriate that the most senior executive position in ATSIC should be filled on an acting basis for extended periods and therefore recommends that the Minister be required to fill the position on a permanent basis where the position will be vacant for more than six months. (para. 3.53)</PARA>
<PARA>Comment</PARA>
<PARA> Self-explanatory. </PARA>
<PARA>Response</PARA>
<PARA> Agree. </PARA>
<PARA>Recommendation 33</PARA>
<PARA> Where a member has a pecuniary interest in a matter before the Commission he or she shall not be present at, or participate in, any meeting of the Commission to consider that matter. (para. 3.60)</PARA>
<PARA>Comment</PARA>
<PARA> Self-explanatory. </PARA>
<PARA>Response</PARA>
<PARA> Agree. </PARA>
<PARA>Recommendation 34</PARA>
<PARA> The `sufficient' number of signatures for a valid recall petition under clause 32 be reduced to 66% of enrolled voters within a zone. (para. 3.60)</PARA>
<PARA>Comment</PARA>
<PARA> Self-explanatory. </PARA>
<PARA>Response</PARA>
<PARA> Agree, subject to recommendation 12. </PARA>
<PARA>Recommendation 35</PARA>
<PARA> Where the Minister makes terms and conditions under clause 34 or the other similar provisions cited below that they be published in the Commonwealth Gazette. (para. 3.61)</PARA>
<PARA>Comment</PARA>
<PARA> Self-explanatory. </PARA>
<PARA>Response</PARA>
<PARA> Agree. </PARA>
<PARA>Recommendation 36</PARA>
<PARA> ATSIC draw up and publish criteria governing the employment of consultants. Further, where terms and conditions of employment aside from commercial or other confidential matters are determined under section 47 they should be publicly available. (para. 3.66)</PARA>
<PARA>Comment</PARA>
<PARA> Self-explanatory</PARA>
<PARA>Response</PARA>
<PARA> Agree. </PARA>
<PARA>Recommendation 37</PARA>
<PARA> Aboriginal or Torres Islander Corporations, incorporated under the laws of a State or Territory be deemed to be incorporated bodies for the purposes of ATSIC. (para. 3.72)</PARA>
<PARA>Comment</PARA>
<PARA> ATSIC is already required by the legislation to recognise Aboriginal corporations (whether incorporated under Commonwealth of State/Territory laws) if all members are Aboriginals or Torres Strait Islanders or the Commission is satisfied that the corporation is controlled by them. </PARA>
<PARA>Response</PARA>
<PARA> Consistent with existing provisions of the Bill. </PARA>
<PARA>Recommendation 38</PARA>
<PARA> The Committee is concerned that the categories of incorporated bodies referred to in Recommendation 37 may exclude body corporates which are not controlled by Aboriginals or Islanders but have as their principal object the provision of services to Aboriginals or Torres Strait Islanders, for example organisations operated by the various churches. The relevant clauses of the Bill should be amended to enable the Commission to make grants to any body corporate which meets the criterion established above. (para. 3.73)</PARA>
<PARA>Comment</PARA>
<PARA> Some bodies which are not comprised of, or controlled by, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders receive assistance with the provision of services to them. </PARA>
<PARA>Response</PARA>
<PARA> Agree, subject to Ministerial approval to ensure that the basic intention of the ATSIC legislation to encourage Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander self-management will not be impaired. </PARA>
<PARA>Recommendation 39</PARA>
<PARA> The Bill be amended to remove the requirements that the AEDC be liable to pay dividends and taxation on profits or income generated by the Capital Fund. (para. 3.78)</PARA>
<PARA>Comment</PARA>
<PARA> The requirement to make such payments is seen as inter-related with the commercial orientation of the AEDC. Given that this orientation is to be maintained (see recommendation 2), it is considered that the proposed change cannot be justified at this time. </PARA>
<PARA>Response</PARA>
<PARA> Not agree. </PARA>
<PARA>Recommendation 40</PARA>
<PARA> The Bill with amendments should proceed and that in the spirit of self-determination ATSIC should be charged with the responsibility for modifying its own structure. (para. 4.77)</PARA>
<PARA>Comment</PARA>
<PARA> The intent of this recommendation is seen as recognising that ATSIC, within the confines of the powers conferred on it by the Parliament, should have a capacity to evolve to meet the challenge of changing needs. As appropriate, the Minister would be involved in this process, and ATSIC's annual reports would include descriptions of actions taken or proposed. </PARA>
<PARA>Response</PARA>
<PARA> Agree. </PARA>
<PARA>SENATE SELECT COMMITTEE ON THE ADMINISTRATION OF ABORIGINAL AFFAIRS</PARA>
<PARA>Minority Report Recommendations</PARA>
<PARA>Senators Baume and Boswell</PARA>
<PARA>Recommendation 1</PARA>
<PARA> We recommend that the Bill now before the Parliament be withdrawn and the whole concept it represents be reconsidered. </PARA>
<PARA>Comment</PARA>
<PARA> The Government is proceeding to make the vast majority of the amendments suggested by the majority report. The Government does not accept that the ATSIC concept is somehow flawed, and ought to be reconsidered. </PARA>
<PARA>Response</PARA>
<PARA> Not agreed. </PARA>
<PARA>Recommendation 2</PARA>
<PARA> We therefore recommend that the ATSIC Bill not be further proceeded with because of the demonstrated inadequacy of the consultation process. </PARA>
<PARA>Comment</PARA>
<PARA> The Government has accepted the majority report recommendation to proceed with the Bill, and does not accept that the consultations undertaken were inadequate. </PARA>
<PARA>Response</PARA>
<PARA> Not agreed. </PARA>
<PARA>Recommendation 3</PARA>
<PARA> We recommend that the ATSIC Bill not be further proceeded with, and that adequate consultation, as was promised, take place with those whose lives will be affected by the legislation before any new proposal is developed. </PARA>
<PARA>Comment</PARA>
<PARA> The Government has accepted the majority report recommendations to proceed with the Bill, and does not accept that the consultations undertaken were inadequate. </PARA>
<PARA>Response</PARA>
<PARA> Not agreed. </PARA>
<PARA>Recommendation 4</PARA>
<PARA> We recommend further that the Senate not proceed with further consideration of any ATSIC Bill until adequate consultation has occurred. </PARA>
<PARA>Comment</PARA>
<PARA> As this recommendation is directed to the Senate, it is not appropriate for the Government to respond. </PARA>
<PARA>Response</PARA>
<PARA> No comment. </PARA>
<PARA>Recommendation 5</PARA>
<PARA> We recommend that Aboriginal Hostels Limited remain independent of any unified portfolio structure. </PARA>
<PARA>Comment</PARA>
<PARA> This recommendation is consistent with the ATSIC proposals-accordingly it is accepted. </PARA>
<PARA>Response</PARA>
<PARA> Agreed. </PARA>
<PARA>Recommendation 6</PARA>
<PARA> We recommend that the further process of consultation, which we have already recommended, should be so arranged to separate funding discussions and decisions from the consultations so that there is no capacity for more allegations of this kind to be made. </PARA>
<PARA>Comment</PARA>
<PARA> This recommendation is consistent with the approach adopted by the Minister from the very beginning of his consultations, viz., not to discuss non-ATSIC matters until ATSIC matters were completely dealt with in each meeting. As explained to the Senate Select Committee, it is not feasible to deny remote communities an opportunity to raise matters of concern to them during any visit by the Minister to their community. The Government has not, however, accepted the further consultations recommended by the Minority Report. </PARA>
<PARA>Response</PARA>
<PARA> Not agreed. </PARA>
<PARA>Recommendation 7</PARA>
<PARA> We recommend that the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs acknowledge by letter to each dismissed Commissioner that the leaked story about financial misappropriation by the ADC under the dismissed Commissioners was untrue and damaging. </PARA>
<PARA>Comment</PARA>
<PARA> The Government has never asserted that the Acting Commissioners of the ADC whose appointments were terminated were responsible for misappropriation. </PARA>
<PARA>Response</PARA>
<PARA> Not agreed. </PARA>
<PARA>Recommendation 8</PARA>
<PARA> We recommend that the Government study, and provide to the Senate a written critique of the alternative proposal developed and presented by the ADC under its former commissioners, and that it do so before it attempts to determine the Bill currently before the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA>Comment</PARA>
<PARA> This matter was a specific term of reference of the Senate Select Committee. Given that neither the majority nor the minority reports undertook a critical examination of this matter, the Government does not believe it is appropriate to provide its own assessments of the ADC proposal to the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA>Response</PARA>
<PARA> Not agreed. </PARA>
<PARA>Recommendation 9</PARA>
<PARA> We recommend further that the ADC proposal for the restructuring of the portfolio, presented to the Minister during the latter months of 1987, be the basis for a new proposal to take the place of the ATSIC Bill. </PARA>
<PARA>Comment</PARA>
<PARA> Senators Baume and Boswell, referring to the ADC alternative, note that ``the signatories to this minority report are not equipped to analyse and comment on the elements of the ADC's recommendations.'' (p. 45). The Government has accepted the recommendation of the majority report to proceed with the ATSIC proposal. </PARA>
<PARA>Response</PARA>
<PARA> Not agreed. </PARA>
<PARA>Recommendation 10</PARA>
<PARA> We recommend that the Government give serious consideration to creating separate Aboriginal and Torres Strait representative bodies as one means of correcting the extreme malapportionments in the ATSIC Bill. </PARA>
<PARA>Comment</PARA>
<PARA> This recommendation would not, of itself, eliminate the unequal voting strengths of particular regions in the Bill. The Government has accepted recommendations of the majority report, and increased the number of zones, to significantly improve this situation. </PARA>
<PARA>Response</PARA>
<PARA> Not agreed. </PARA>
<PARA>Recommendation 11</PARA>
<PARA> Even at this stage, we consider all the circumstances ought to be investigated and, at the very least, a public denial and apology should be issued by the ADC Board and the Minister. Also legal aid should be made available to the sacked Commissioners to enable them to take action in the courts, if they so desire, to clear their names. (p. 40)</PARA>
<PARA>Comment</PARA>
<PARA> This matter refers to the SMH article of 25 May 1988. See response to recommendation 7. </PARA>
<PARA>Response</PARA>
<PARA> Not agreed. </PARA>
<PARA>Senator Coulter</PARA>
<PARA>Recommendation</PARA>
<PARA> I therefore recommend that the proposed definition of Aboriginal Person in Clause 4 of the Bill be amended to read:</PARA>
<PARA> Aboriginal Person means a descendant of an Aboriginal person of Australia or, if descent cannot be established, means a person who identifies himself or herself as an Aboriginal person and is accepted by the community as an Aboriginal person. </PARA>
<PARA>Comment</PARA>
<PARA> Senator Coulter has argued that the definition of Aboriginal person in the ATSIC Bill is a tautology. This ignores the fact that the formulation utilised has been used extensively in the past, is incorporated in a number of recent enactments, and has been judicially considered. By removing any reference to race, which is the Constitutional head of power for the ATSIC Bill, Senator Coulter's recommendation may risk a judicial finding that the Bill was unconstitutional. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the statement. </PARA>
<PARA>The Senate has before it the Government's response to the report of the Senate Select Committee on the Administration of Aboriginal Affairs. In this report we see that the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs (Mr Hand) has sought support from both the Aboriginal and Islander communities to give him some type of go ahead to bring in the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission (ATSIC) legislation. We are informed that the ATSIC legislation will be brought before this Parliament on 1 October. This so-called support that the Minister has solicited from both the Aboriginal and Islander communities is based on certain assurances given to those people by the Minister. </PARA>
<PARA> I have before me statements by the Aboriginal Coordinating Council, which is the peak body of Aboriginals in Queensland, saying that it will support ATSIC on the following basis. These assurances have been sought by the community councils. The Minister, after having consulted with them, then put out a press release saying that he has the support of the Aboriginal communities. The Aboriginal Coordinating Council said that it would accept ATSIC on these provisions:</PARA>
<PARA> 1. Regional Council Function should not be so wide as to allow the Regional Council to interfere with Community Council issues. </PARA>
<PARA> 2. Local Community Council should retain primary responsibility for planning the economic and social future of its community. </PARA>
<PARA> 3. The Community Council should be the main representatives of the Community in dealing with Federal and State Governments. </PARA>
<PARA>This is of course in complete contradiction to the ATSIC proposal. The communities have never given their support to ATSIC in any shape or form because those provisions that the communities have put on ATSIC cannot possibly be met. The Minister has once again misled the Aboriginal communities and, to a large degree, the public. </PARA>
<PARA> In front of me I also have a transcript from the Chairman of the Torres Strait Island Coordinating Council saying that he will support ATSIC if the Torres Strait Islanders get a separate commission. It states:</PARA>
<PARA>I would not say that we would like to break away. All I am saying is that we need to create two separate identities, that the Aboriginal people are a totally separate race of people from the Torres Strait Islanders. We have a unique lifestyle and a culture which is totally different to the Aboriginal people. </PARA>
<PARA>Again, that was sold as an acceptance by the Aboriginal and Islander communities of ATSIC. Let me make it very clear that neither the Queensland Aboriginals nor the Islanders of Queensland have in any way accepted ATSIC; yet the Minister has said in his reports that, basically, the Aboriginal communities accept the ATSIC proposal. That is as far from the truth as it is possible to be. We are particularly worried about the ATSIC proposal. We believe that it does not meet the requirements of the Aboriginal people; that it does not address certain requirements that they have set out. Also, in the report it is admitted that the Senate inquiry was absolutely necessary. The Minister, after abusing the inquiry, picked up most of the proposals that were put forward by it. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Stone makes a legitimate interjection, and I accept that. There is no assurance that the Minister will ensure accountability. Overall, the legislation will fail because it will take away from the Aboriginal communities the right to set their own priorities. It will take away the right of the communities to decide what actions they will take in their communities. The proposed legislation does not give the Aboriginal and Islander communities more self-determination; it actually reduces the self-determination that they already have. In the statement the Minister said that he is determined to explain how the ATSIC legislation works-after he brings it down. I would have thought that the right way to explain the legislation to the Aboriginals and Islanders was to explain it before it was put before the Parliament.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There has been subterfuge throughout the process. When the Senate Select Committee report was brought before the House on 28 February, representatives of the Aboriginal Coordinating Council from Queensland pleaded with the Minister not to go ahead with the ATSIC proposals and the legislation. The executive members of the ACC came here at great expense to their organisation. I believe they lobbied Senator Collins, certainly Senator Coulter, and a number of Government members. The Minister told them, `I will come up and sort all this out with you'. The Minister did go to Cairns and said, `Yes, let's look at your requirements'. They set down four conditions which had to be met before they would be prepared to accept ATSIC. The Minister has completely ignored those conditions. He has also ignored the conditions that the Islanders set down. I say again, in the most sincere manner that I can--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will not be put off by Senator Button. I say in the most sincere terms that I can muster that the overwhelming majority of Aboriginals and Islanders in Australia reject the ATSIC proposal. Despite the Minister going around and gladhanding them with $809,000-worth of inducements, they still do not accept the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission. I believe that the Minister in pushing this Bill forward, with the determination of the Government behind him, and of Senator Button who should know better, will put the Aboriginal community 40 years behind where it is at the moment. The determination of this Government to go ahead with an ATSIC proposal that has no support amongst the Aboriginal communities is tantamount to ignoring the wishes of 90 per cent of the Aboriginal communities in Australia. Last week when Senator Collins was visiting communities one of the more traditional community representatives tried to appeal to the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke), to talk to him about ATSIC and breakaway land councils. We saw what almost resulted in a blow by blow fight between Mr Snowdon and the Aboriginal representatives. Such is their passion against ATSIC. This is what is confronting Australia now, as evidenced by the headline, `ALP man faces poll backlash after ``frontier politics'' '--</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Collins well knows that ATSIC was behind it. There was the Central Land Council but there were a number of things behind the objections. He knows only too well that the Aboriginal people are not behind ATSIC, and they are certainly not behind ATSIC in the Northern Territory. That is what is behind the whole problem of the land councils up there and ATSIC. They are all mingled in together.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I believe that the Select Committee on the Administration of Aboriginal Affairs has served a useful purpose. The Government has picked up most of the recommendations. It improves the ATSIC Bill slightly but in my estimation it does not in any way condone what the ATSIC proposal will mean to Aboriginal communities. It means that they will lose control of their own communities, it means that the smaller communities will not get any representation on the regional councils and it means the less articulate members of the Aboriginal people will sit in a regional council meeting and will not be able to express their views. This is what ATSIC will mean. It is completely out of character with the Aboriginal way. The report does not give any apology to the eight Aboriginal Development Commissioners sacked. That is a travesty of justice. It is an absolute disgrace that those people had to go back into their communities under a cloud. I will address that further if the legislation comes down in this session of Parliament. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister indicates that it will be coming down in this session. Let it be on Senator Tate's head and on Senator Button's head that Aboriginal communities will be completely destroyed. The Government has some experts on Aboriginal affairs. I nominate Senator Collins; he is someone who really does understand the Aboriginal communities' needs and wants. The Government has no excuse for ignorance when it has people who have expertise. I believe such people have advised the Government that ATSIC will not be in the best interests of Aboriginal and Islander communities. Even the report says that the Minister will have certain powers that he did not have under the Aboriginal Development Commission Act. That is not giving self-determination to Aboriginals; it is providing more ministerial power. It is not the way to give Aboriginals self-determination because it is being given to them with one hand and taken back with the other.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I do not look forward to the time this legislation comes before the Senate. I sincerely hope that between now and that time some form of enlightenment will come down upon the Government and it will take notice of some of its people who do represent Aboriginals in the outback communities. The report definitely supports the Senate committee that has been set up. Senator Coulter, Senator Collins, Senator Peter Baume and I, as Committee members, have put in many hours. We have amended the Bill; we have made some sort of improvement. But overall the bringing forward of this legislation will not be in the best interests of Australian Aboriginals. As the report indicates, instead of moving Aboriginals forward it will set Aboriginal communities back a number of years. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-I make this statement on the administration of Aboriginal affairs on behalf of the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke). Honourable senators will recall that in November last year the Government announced a number of interrelated inquiries into the administration of Aboriginal affairs. The background to the establishment of these inquiries was material provided and statements made in Senate Estimates Committee processes, and elsewhere, alleging serious shortcomings in the administration, including financial management, in the Aboriginal Development Commission (ADC) and in the Department of Aboriginal Affairs.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Minister for Aboriginal Affairs (Mr Hand) announced on 7 November 1988 that he had asked the Auditor-General to undertake a comprehensive audit of the Aboriginal Development Commission and to extend this, as appropriate, to the Department of Aboriginal Affairs. He announced also that the Public Service Commissioner would be investigating questions concerning personnel management in the Department of Aboriginal Affairs and that the Department of Finance would investigate any staff classification issues. Furthermore, he announced that the Government recognised that certain matters might still require further examination in the light of these specialised investigations and that the Government had asked Mr Andrew Menzies, AM, OBE, a former deputy secretary of the Attorney-General's Department, to make any such inquiry. </PARA>
<PARA> The Auditor-General and the Public Service Commissioner are, of course, independent statutory officers, and the Government made it clear that Mr Menzies would also be exercising an independent role in following up any outstanding matters. The Government also made it clear that each of these inquiries should be as thorough as those conducting them judged necessary. It was the Government's intention from the outset that, in the light of the outcome of these inquiries, it would consider whatever steps might be necessary to address any problems brought to light. </PARA>
<PARA> I am now able to advise honourable senators that most of these various inquiries have been completed. The Public Service Commissioner and the Department of Finance have completed their inquiries. Moreover, as a result of a further request from the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs to the Minister for Finance (Senator Walsh), the Department of Finance has prepared a broader report on financial management in the Aboriginal Development Commission. As honourable senators already know, the Auditor-General has completed a substantial part of his remit, with only a report on some particular enterprise projects in the Aboriginal Development Commission area which were brought to notice in the Senate yet to come. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Menzies has completed an interim report which outlines the process he is following in his inquiries and the matters which he has excluded. In particular, he is not re-examining issues which have been dealt with definitively by the Public Service Commissioner, the Department of Finance or the Auditor-General in their reports. Mr Menzies has identified two issues in the Auditor-General's report which have not been or are not being dealt with to finality by the Auditor-General and which Mr Menzies sees as appropriate for his investigation. He indicates that these two matters are under active investigation, together with a comparatively small number of matters arising from submissions received from the public or otherwise brought to his attention. Mr Menzies outlines in part II of his interim report the matters under investigation but recommends that that part of the report not be published generally. The Government accepts his recommendations that, in view of the continuing investigations, part II should not be published. It has, however, been made available to the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate (Senator Chaney) and the Leader of the Australian Democrats (Senator Haines). </PARA>
<PARA> I make the important point that, pending Mr Menzies' final report, I shall not comment today upon the conduct of any individual, nor should others prejudge the findings. Attempts to ascribe guilt by allegation or smear are simply unacceptable. The Government also has, of course, the recommendations and views of the Senate Select Committee on the Administration of Aboriginal Affairs. The Government is confident, therefore, that the primary issues of administration in the area of Aboriginal affairs have been covered in all the reports we have now received. Against this background, I now table in the Senate all the reports referred to excepting the Auditor-General's report which has already been tabled and part II of Mr Menzies' report. </PARA>
<PARA> With the bulk of the inquiries now completed, the Government is in a position to inform the Parliament of its views and intentions concerning organisational arrangements for the Aboriginal affairs portfolio on the basis of thorough consideration of the material now available to us. The Minister for Justice (Senator Tate), who is the Minister representing the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs, will be following me with a detailed statement concerning these arrangements. The Government, of course, stands ready to refine its response and undertake any further action, should that be necessary, when the remaining reports are received. They will, of course, also be tabled in the Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> At the outset it needs to be acknowledged that administrative shortcomings, some of them serious, are evident in the area of Aboriginal administration. The Government does not sweep aside these shortcomings, nor will we shirk our responsibility to correct them. In the case of the Department of Aboriginal Affairs, the Auditor-General found that, overall, there was a lower than acceptable standard of administration. Clearly, administrative practices in a wide range of areas will have to be tightened. The Government recognises this, the Department knows it and some steps have been taken already. </PARA>
<PARA> The Department of Finance concluded, in relation to staff classification matters, that the action taken by the Department was not well founded in terms of classification principles and processes. Honourable senators should note in this regard that the Department of Aboriginal Affairs has accepted the Department of Finance's conclusions and the necessity of appropriate corrective action. On the other hand, I believe it is important to note that, as the Auditor-General's and Public Service Commissioner's inquiries found, some of the more vocal critics of the Department were unable to provide evidence to back their claims. The Public Service Commissioner has not substantiated allegations of patronage, favouritism, nepotism and cronyism in the Department of Aboriginal Affairs. No hard evidence was produced that would warrant investigation under the Public Service Act. </PARA>
<PARA> The Public Service Commissioner's delegate, Mr H. B. MacDonald, found no more than that there was an occasional lack of prudence or judgment and that there were some deficiencies in the Department's personnel practices, most particularly an inordinate delay in approving an equal employment opportunity program. Mr MacDonald also concluded that it was essential to clarify the policy guidelines on Aboriginalisation-that is, enhancing access by Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people to employment in the Department. The much more fundamental problems brought to light in these inquiries are in the programs administered by the Aboriginal Development Commission rather than the Department. </PARA>
<PARA> The special audit report's major criticisms are directed at the way the Aboriginal Development Commission administers its enterprise funds-pointing to a number of failed enterprises and less than rigorous oversight by the Commission. In nearly all cases mentioned in the report, Audit found that the ADC had failed to apply the criteria set out in its legislation and concluded that the most serious defects in administration were in the ADC's approval procedures. </PARA>
<PARA> It should also be noted that there are proposals in the broader Department of Finance report for a strengthening of administrative support in these areas and for the exercise of greater control, through clearer and more specific ministerially endorsed guidelines. The Government has taken these findings into account in the response which I shall outline and on which Senator Tate's statement will elaborate. </PARA>
<PARA> Before outlining the Government's response to the findings of these inquiries, it is essential that I reaffirm the two basic principles at stake in this crucial area of government administration. There is, first, the imperative for self-management, by Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, of government programs designed to assist their well-being. If there is one lesson that emerges from 200 years of contact between the original inhabitants of this country and the Europeans who have arrived since 1788, it is this: that after all the benign neglect, the paternalism and the failed attempts at assimilation, today we realise that the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders themselves are the best judges of their needs and priorities. In recent years, the imperative of self-management has received considerable bipartisan support and it is one to which this Government has shown its fundamental commitment. </PARA>
<PARA> Secondly, there is the thoroughly complementary imperative for proper ministerial responsibility and accountability for, and effective parliamentary scrutiny of, programs as a whole, especially in relation to their financial administration. The nub of the issue before us then is finding the right balance between the principles of self-management and of overall ministerial responsibility. Many critics, including in the Senate, fail to see the need for balance. They have drawn the facile conclusion that answers to the administrative shortcomings that have been identified, especially in the Aboriginal Development Commission, lie solely in winding back self-management.</PARA>
<PARA> The Government believes it is possible-indeed, it is vital-to strike a better balance; a balance that both widens and deepens the opportunity for self-management, and establishes a more appropriate means of financial accountability and ministerial oversight. That is precisely what the Government's proposed legislation for the establishment of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission (ATSIC) seeks to achieve. It seeks to widen the scope for Aboriginal self-management to encompass all of the programs undertaken within portfolio agencies, and to deepen its real effectiveness by giving Aboriginal people at a regional and local level a far more specific responsibility to determine priorities and outcomes. It seeks also to establish the right mechanism for ministerial involvement which will genuinely uphold the principle of accountability to the broader Australian community. </PARA>
<PARA> I take this opportunity to reaffirm the Government's determination to proceed with the ATSIC legislation. Nothing that has emerged from these inquiries has eroded the Government's fundamental support for the concept and nature of ATSIC. But we can and will draw on the work of the Senate Committee and on the inquiries to refine and improve the details. In his statement today Senator Tate will describe the Government's intentions on amendments to the ATSIC legislation, particularly in the light of the report of the Senate Select Committee. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe it is appropriate in this context to remind honourable senators of some of the legislative history of Aboriginal self-management, and in particular to point out that ADC itself was developed, under the previous Government, with a less than conventional level of ministerial oversight for a statutory authority. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4F4">Senator BUTTON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I begin by quoting the words of Senator Neville Bonner, the first Aboriginal member of parliament, in giving, on behalf of the previous Government, the second reading speech on the Aboriginal Development Commission Bill in the Senate on 21 November 1979. He said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>The Government, in introducing the Aboriginal Development Commission Bill, is taking steps to put into effect what I have been saying for a number of years-the placing into Aboriginal hands of the control of Aboriginal affairs. </PARA>
<PARA>He went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . Aboriginals will be responsible for the decision-making. Of course this is not to say that Aboriginals also will not make mistakes. </PARA>
<PARA>I interpolate here to say to Senator Stone that he is continually being acknowledged in this statement. Senator Bonner went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA>It is to be expected that we will, as we all do. But Aboriginals should have greater sensitivity to Aboriginal needs and they will learn from any mistakes they make while exercising this responsibility. </PARA>
<PARA>As honourable senators will know, the legislation to establish the ADC was not actually passed until 1980. The amended legislation, again in the words of Senator Bonner, was designed to `strengthen the commitment to self-management' and to achieve `further steps down the road to making equality a reality for Aboriginal Australians'. He was able to say that because the weight of the responses to the original Bill was to reduce the role of the Minister and expand the role of the Commission. I would also remind honourable senators of some important points made in that 1980 Senate debate by Senator Chaney, the then Minister for Aboriginal Affairs. He said:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . there is an element of risk in Aboriginal self-management. I think it is a risk which both the previous Government and this Government have seen as a worthwhile risk. </PARA>
<PARA>He also said:</PARA>
<PARA>I suggest to those members of the Opposition who are concerned, that they look at the limitations of ministerial power in this Bill as compared to the Bills that the Opposition when in government put through the Parliament in 1974 and 1975. </PARA>
<PARA> I think they will see that we are progressing in the way that one would expect towards withdrawing ministerial authority. I do not suggest that the Bills that were passed in 1974 were wrong for their time. I suggest that, as one would expect, we are moving in a direction of increasing Aboriginal control rather than ministerial control. </PARA>
<PARA>The significance of this recital of the background to the ADC is that it shows that both sides of the Parliament have made, and welcomed, moves to give Aboriginals a greater say in the design and delivery of programs to advance their status in Australian society. We all have been prepared to accept what Senator Chaney termed `an element of risk'. </PARA>
<PARA> In reaffirming my Government's support for ATSIC I make the point that, given this legislative history, the proposed new Commission is the logical and appropriate next step for the advancement of both the great principles of self-management and ministerial accountability. Not only do the reports of the inquiries not undermine the Government's belief that ATSIC represents the correct way forward-we are encouraged by some of the positive implications for ATSIC's basic structure in the inquiry reports. For example, the special audit report illustrates the problems which can arise when one agency, the Aboriginal Development Commission, confuses its activities in enterprise funding with its own wider socio-economic responsibilities, and those of other agencies. It also points up some difficulties the Department of Aboriginal Affairs has experienced in providing a balanced range of services to communities in response to their expressed needs. </PARA>
<PARA> While the report does not draw any conclusions, the Government notes that such problems as these would be reduced by bringing the full range of programs under a single administration, by eliminating the potential for overlap, and by planning systematically on the basis of communities' and regions' own priorities. At the same time, the Government accepts that it cannot proceed with these changes without addressing as effectively as possible the administrative shortcomings brought to light in the various inquiries, and the need for accountability and appropriate ministerial involvement and parliamentary scrutiny. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government had already, in the development of the ATSIC Bill, sought to provide for greater ministerial involvement-through the Minister being able to establish guidelines within which the new body would be required to operate in the administration of policies and programs, and being closely involved in the monitoring of priority setting through approval of estimates on a regional basis. These controls are designed to prevent the possibility of any radical departures from the approved estimates and policy goals. </PARA>
<PARA> Honourable senators will note that the Department of Finance report tabled today recommends that the Minister should be given a broad role to approve the estimates of the Aboriginal Development Commission; should consult on the Commission's corporate plan; and should issue broad policy guidelines, especially where financial administration is concerned. The ATSIC legislation which the Government is proposing will meet those requirements. </PARA>
<PARA> We have, moreover, considered to what extent the thrust of those recommendations should apply to the ADC while it continues to function in the lead up to ATSIC, as the Minister representing the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs will indicate in his statement. Also relevant is the recommendation made by the Auditor-General that the Government review the business enterprise provisions in the ATSIC Bill. The Government has done so and a more detailed statement covering its consideration of both the general financial accountability and business enterprise provisions of the Bill will be made by Senator Tate. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has also determined that it will respond to the problems raised in the various inquiry reports, and to the suggestions made by the Public Service Commissioner for strengthened support, in the following ways. We will amend the ATSIC legislation to establish an Office of Evaluation and Audit, details of which will be provided in Senator Tate's statement. We will ensure that there are adequate resources provided to the new Commission to enable these audit and reporting functions to be carried out effectively. We will make sure that there are sufficient resources, including for training and by way of a temporary infusion of specialist managerial skills, for the new Commission. The Public Service Commissioner's reports pointed to the need for better training and improved management practices, and the Department of Aboriginal Affairs is discussing with the Public Service Commissioner the best way to implement those recommendations in the Department as it is now. Dr McIver, in her report last year, as consultant on the new Commission's staffing and administrative structure, also concluded that a very active staff development program would be vital in the Commission's early days. </PARA>
<PARA> Because the reports have highlighted the need for training Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people who work in community organisations, if they are to function with proper financial management, the Government will look to how it can intensify its efforts under the Aboriginal organisations training program. More immediately, the Government recognises the need to spell out and clarify the policy of Aboriginalisation for specific staffing positions concerned with formulation of policy for, and direct delivery of services to, Aboriginals, especially within the Department of Aboriginal Affairs and the new Commission. We will require relevant Commonwealth agencies to establish-in consultation with the Public Service Commissioner and relevant unions-policy guidelines on enhancing access by Aboriginals and Torres Strait Islanders to employment, and that appropriate equal employment opportunity plans be in place on the establishment of ATSIC. </PARA>
<PARA> It would not be appropriate to conclude this statement without making mention of those many people whose diligence and commitment to the cause of the Aboriginal people cannot be questioned. The efforts of so many of these Australians, Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal alike-including those in the Department of Aboriginal Affairs and the Aboriginal Development Commission-are beyond the demands of duty. Indeed, some of the shortcomings that have been identified have arisen, not from base motives, but from a genuine determination to overcome the appalling disadvantage suffered by Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. It is as a result of those efforts, over very many years, that government-sponsored programs are gradually improving the health, housing, education and employment of Aboriginal Australians and are steadily strengthening Aboriginal communities through land rights, through enterprise development, and through the provision of services to improve basic living conditions. My Government is proud that, in recognition of this vitally important work, we have continued to make substantial real increases in allocations to Aboriginal programs in an era when it has been necessary to wind back the growth in overall Commonwealth expenditure. </PARA>
<PARA> The inquiries have submitted the administration of Aboriginal affairs to an extraordinarily detailed scrutiny and produced a wealth of material and analysis in a relatively short time frame. The Government appreciates the effort of all of the agencies and people involved, and I take this opportunity to thank them for it. Surely the time has now come, especially in this Parliament, to cease the constant stream of allegation which has dogged this vital area of government administration. The Government's approach is, as I have indicated, to draw upon lessons from the inquiries and to look to the future-to ensure that mechanisms are put in place and support provided so that future administration is on a sound footing. We are determined to address administrative problems in a way which ensures a higher quality of future administration in this very important area of government and, in the long run, a higher quality of life and sense of belonging for all Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the statement, and condemns the Government and the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs for their failures in the administration of Aboriginal affairs, and calls on the Government to delay further consideration of the ATSIC proposals until there has been full and effective consultation with the Aboriginal community and the rest of the Australian community and a remedying of existing administrative shortcomings. </PARA>
<PARA>We have before us today a vast array of both statements and reports. Those statements first started to arrive in my office at 1.20 p.m., and the last of the statements arrived at 1.40 p.m. I saw some of the reports at an even later time. I therefore have to acknowledge that a close reading of all of these documents has not been possible for me, but I have certainly had a chance to read the statements which have been put down and the statement that has just been read by the Leader of the Government in the Senate (Senator Button) in this place. I wish to express my very great disappointment and the disappointment of the Opposition at the announcement which is contained in the statement delivered on behalf of the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke), that the Government intends and is determined to proceed with the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commissioner (ATSIC) legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> Before going on to deal with that particular matter, may I record some satisfaction at the fact that the Government has, in the various statements which have been put down, acknowledged the value of the work of the Senate Select Committee on the Administration of Aboriginal Affairs. I do that because honourable senators will recall that this was a matter of very considerable contention. In fact, on 15 February this year the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs, Mr Hand, made a very substantial attack on the Senate committee system in general and on the Senate Committee looking at ATSIC in particular. He said things like this:</PARA>
<PARA>Civil liberties of those individuals are just swept aside, while some Senators strut around this country . . . floating on their own ego picking up these sorts of wild stories . . . </PARA>
<PARA>He went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA>And so I say to the Senate committee, you know, anything that they suggest, any proposition they put up-because it is a stunt, the whole thing's been a political stunt-doesn't automatically mean that I'm going to accept it. </PARA>
<PARA>I remind the Senate of those words because today the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs, through the mouth of the Minister for Justice, Senator Tate, has indicated that the Government has accepted the vast majority of the recommendations of the majority of the Committee. In other words, the majority report of the Committee-which is in the main a report of all of the senators, although there is a strong dissenting report on a number of particular matters from Senator Boswell and Senator Peter Baume-the main detail of the recommendations of this Committee, have in fact now been picked up and adopted by the Government. I make the point that the cheap and vicious political attack which was made on the Senate Committee has now been exposed for what it was, because the Minister and the Government have now affirmed the bulk of those recommendations. </PARA>
<PARA> This statement of the Prime Minister's is something of a confession of fault, yet at the same time an ignoring of the faults and problems which have been disclosed. What the Prime Minister has just said, through the mouth of Senator Button, is that it needs to be acknowledged that administrative shortcomings, some of them serious, are evident in the area of Aboriginal administration. The Prime Minister went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA>The Government does not sweep aside these shortcomings nor will we shirk our responsibility to correct them. </PARA>
<PARA>What has happened, in fact, is that all of these problems and shortcomings have been reduced to the neatness of these reports. We have managed to get down in black and white what they are, and they make extremely sorry reading. We are told that remedial action will be taken by the Government with respect to these matters, but the fact is that remedial action has not yet been taken.</PARA>
<PARA> I want to take the Senate behind these neat, green bound reports. I suggest, Madam Acting Deputy President, that you take your colleague the Prime Minister to Balgo and Wiluna, preferably on pension day, as I have been to Wiluna on pension day, and I suggest that you talk to your colleague the State Minister for Aboriginal Affairs about the concerns that are being expressed to her about the condition of the administration of Aboriginal affairs in your and my State of Western Australia, and the disgraceful confusion in so many of those areas which are so neatly now written about, typed and bound in these reports.</PARA>
<PARA> Madam Acting Deputy President, there is a fundamental internal inconsistency in what Senator Button, on behalf of his and your Prime Minister, has put down today. We are told that it is the determination of the Government to proceed with a proposal which, the Opposition believes, does not have the support of even the Australian Labor Party. It has the support of the Prime Minister and Minister Hand. The only reason ATSIC is proceeding is that there is not sufficient interest in the field of Aboriginal affairs for the Labor Party, which has the responsibility for the Government in this place, to intervene and to take this matter out of the hands of a Prime Minister who is self-indulgent and who simply parades himself on the Aboriginal affairs stage, a Prime Minister who, in my view, has shamefully sold out the Aboriginal people of Australia at the same time as he has pretended to champion their cause. On page 7 of the statement that we have before us the Prime Minister said:</PARA>
<PARA>At the same time, the Government accepts that it cannot proceed with these changes without addressing as effectively as possible the administrative shortcomings brought to light in the various inquiries, and the need for accountability and appropriate ministerial involvement and parliamentary scrutiny. </PARA>
<PARA>I accuse the Prime Minister of inconsistency because the simple truth is that it is not possible to put an orderly administration in place on top of the chaos which at present exists. The first and simple responsibility of the Government in Aboriginal affairs in 1989 is to get some order into the existing administration. I am appalled by the reports which I get from Aboriginal communities about the breakdown of administration. I am appalled by the statements made by people in the Aboriginal Development Commission. I was invited to take tea with them during the last parliamentary recess. They told me they were demoralised, that they were unable to do their task and that it would take years to restore orderly administration. I am appalled by the fact that when one meets a departmental officer in a casual way at an airport or wherever almost inevitably today the talk is of demoralisation and an incapacity to do the task. I laugh at some of these reports. Some of these reports simply reflect the fact that people are frightened and are not prepared to speak in an open way. There is plenty that is being said. There is nobody who is even vaguely close to the administration of the Department of Aboriginal Affairs who would not believe that the administration is in chaos. </PARA>
<PARA> We are not talking about some chaos in a government department which, of itself, would not matter, except it would be a matter of waste. We are talking about the sort of chaos which means that children are not nourished or educated and that the next generation of Aboriginal people are being condemned to a worse life in many communities than they had in the last generation. That is what we are debating. It is simply not true that the Government is putting in place a procedure which will be more accountable. </PARA>
<PARA> If one wanted to design an arrangement which was based on building on the mistakes of the past so as to repeat them one could not have done a better job than Minister Hand. I used to say that there was nothing right about Minister Hand except that his heart was in the right place. I withdraw that comment. I withdraw it because I have been assured by somebody who has worked closely with Minister Hand that that is the only serious mistake I have made in my comments in this area. The scurrilous way that Minister Hand has attacked anybody who has challenged what he is so thoughtlessly and recklessly doing without the benefit of steady advice-just as his Prime Minister has been reckless-and the pathetic and stupid and arrogant way that this Minister has behaved is a disgrace to the Labor Party and to this Government. The truth is that Minister Hand has now accepted-presumably because that is the price of getting legislation through the Senate, for which he requires the support of the Australian Democrats-that there will be a need to very substantially amend this legislation. I think that without doubt the Opposition will have very many more substantial amendments to offer which we will debate in this place. </PARA>
<PARA> I ask the Australian Democrats to look at the prospect of the timetable that the Minister has put in place for the establishment of ATSIC. I ask the Australian Democrats to look at the proposition that there should be a temporary five-man commission to run this show. I ask them whether they can in conscience support the timetable or the interim proposal that the Minister has put forward. The timetable is clearly not realistic. The suggestion that ATSIC should be in place by November is absurd. We could not possibly deal with the legislation in the program which the Government has put before us. The Government does not intend to have the legislation before us until June. I am not sure at what time in June or July it wishes us to adjourn. The fact is that we are expected to go into some sort of interim administration of ATSIC by November, as I understand from the statements before us. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am corrected by Senator Tambling. I thank him for his assistance. The fact is that this is again a political timetable. It has nothing to do with the orderly administration of Aboriginal affairs. We in the Opposition are in the unhappy position of having to rely upon the good sense and integrity of the Australian Democrats in examining this proposal. I say to them that they will carry a very heavy responsibility. I make the utterly confident assertion after 30 years of involvement in this area of policy and involvement with the Aboriginal community that this legislation is laying the framework for the next shambles. In five years' time the Senate will be debating why we have a shambles on our hands, if this legislation goes into place and is put into operation. I am confident that we will have an election in the next 12 months-I do not think we are going to depart from the constitutional processes-and that there will be a change of government. I suppose, therefore, it will fall to us to try to correct the neglect of the last six years.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In all of this detail that we now have before us to debate-and which will be read by the many honourable senators who have a close and very idealistic interest in the future of the Aboriginal community in Australia-one can read the story of six years of gross neglect. We have had the report of the Auditor-General before us for some time. I do not know why some of the other reports were not available earlier. Senator Tambling pointed out to me that some of these other reports are dated January and February this year. We should look at the report of the Auditor-General which was misrepresented by the Prime Minister in his statement when he suggested that the problems are mainly focused on the ADC. That is certainly not what I have found from this report. What we found in page after page was the cold bureaucratic description of the chaos which should not be described in cold and bureaucratic terms. We found the reason for that chaos. We found that on page 70 of the Auditor-General's report it says:</PARA>
<PARA>An examination of existing policy guidelines . . . established that the guidelines were out of date, unrealistic, not relevant, not measureable, ambiguous and too narrow. The Department was budget rather than policy driven.</PARA>
<PARA>Where were the Ministers when all this was happening? I will tell honourable senators where the Ministers were. Clyde Holding was out chasing national land rights, something that the bureaucracy could have advised him on the first day of the Labor Government was not achievable. The Attorney-General's Department, the Prime Minister's Department and the Department of Aboriginal Affairs could have repeated the advice that I received-that it was not a goer; it was not achievable. For 4 1/2 years the then Minister for Aboriginal Affairs, Mr Holding, focused on chasing a romantic rainbow and ignored the basic administration of Aboriginal Affairs. We then got the intervention of the Prime Minister in the Northern Territory who, at Burunga, raised the proposition that we were going to have a treaty. We asked the Department of Aboriginal Affairs in the Estimates Committee shortly after that statement by the Prime Minister what work had been done by the Department on that proposal. The answer was none. It was another bit of politicking. It had nothing to do with orderly administration or the real long term interests of the Aboriginal people. One can go through page after page of this in the report. There are items under the heading `Total Breakdown of Administration'. On page 77 under the heading `Compliance with Grants Conditions', it states:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . considered inadequate for almost all grants examined. </PARA>
<PARA>. . . . </PARA>
<PARA>In many instances financial statements received lacked lists of outstanding debtors and creditors, lists of capital items purchased, details of employment levels . . . </PARA>
<PARA>On page 78 it continues:</PARA>
<PARA> In attempting to assess program performance, audit observed that in many instances in 1987-88 there was a total absence of, or inadequate, statistics to evidence the achievement of planned measurable outcomes. </PARA>
<PARA>I agree that Senator Collins knows a lot about Aboriginal affairs; I wish he were the Minister. He should not come here and abuse me for the fact that when I was Minister there were higher administrative costs than there are under Labor. I am surprised there are any administrative costs under Labor. It did not administer anything. It just shovelled out the money and left the people to rot. That is this Government's record in Aboriginal affairs. </PARA>
<PARA> None of this has been fixed or can be fixed because morale has dropped out of the Department of Aboriginal Affairs, the good people are leaving or have left, and people are frightened. That is the truth about Aboriginal affairs. The silver bodgie-I cannot think of words that I am prepared to use in this place to describe the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) when I think of him prancing around the stage on this-that strutting little popinjay, will go around pretending that he is working for the good of the Aboriginal people of Australia. That is a sick joke. It is a lie. One can go through and through this document. Audit found many instances where breaches of grant conditions occurred. No remedial action was taken by the Department. There is another example on page 81:</PARA>
<PARA> The Project Evaluation and Funding Proposal Forms . . . did not provide adequate evidence to show the grants were made on the basis of need and that the level of funding was appropriate. Deficiencies noted included-</PARA>
<PARA>and so the lists go on. I do not have time to deal with them in full. </PARA>
<PARA> Then we get these more recently tabled reports, including those of the Public Service Commission. The Public Service Commission's report reminds me of the majority report of the Select Committee on the Administration of Aboriginal Affairs. It is worth remembering that the whole Committee pointed out that the conditions laid down by the Minister himself for consultation with the Aboriginal community had not been met, that virtually every Aboriginal community said it had not had time to fully study and understand the report and that they expected a second round of consultation. </PARA>
<PARA> Then, of course, the Committee came out with a quite different conclusion-that the Bill should proceed. That is why my colleague Senator Boswell and my colleague and ex-Minister Senator Peter Baume dissented. Look at the Public Service Commission report. What a joke. I would suggest that those who want to look at the Public Service Commission report should look at pages 16, 18 and 23. Let me quote just a couple of pieces out of that report. On page 23 it says:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . Mr Perkins . . . in his public comments was allowed much greater licence (ranging into very delicate political issues) than is normal for a senior officer of the apolitical Australian Public Service. His robust, hands-on style perhaps accentuated these tendencies. </PARA>
<PARA>Those tendencies were the tendencies to have a very heavy involvement in particular staffing matters. A little later on page 23 the report goes on:</PARA>
<PARA>Given his volatility and style as a manager and his extraordinary range of contacts in Aboriginal communities, it is hardly remarkable that Mr Perkins was seen by a number of people as being too involved informally in some staff selection processes at various levels of his Department. </PARA>
<PARA>In this report Mr Perkins's network is described; his motives are not impugned. I want to say something about Mr Perkins. I worked closely with him and I regard him as a friend. He is not very pleased about the fact that I have been part of having to draw attention to deficiencies in his Department. I think Charles Perkins is an extraordinary man. He went from being an orphan child with no prospects, put himself through university by playing professional football, helped to raise the consciousness of Australians about the plight of Aboriginals in the 1960s with his freedom rides, and has had a most distinguished career of service with the Australian Public Service which has been continually sullied, if you like, by the political role he has gone on playing. </PARA>
<PARA> I point to the period of my own Ministry, when the head of the Department was Mr Tony Ayers, now the head of the Department of Defence, as a period which showed that, given proper ministerial guidance and support-support is perhaps the better word-Mr Perkins was able to contribute in a consistently positive way to administration. I believe that whatever faults are shown up with respect to Mr Perkins's administration are not the fault of Mr Perkins; they are the fault of his having to work under two Ministers whom I regard as having been grossly neglectful of the detail of their duties. The current Minister for Aboriginal Affairs (Mr Hand) in particular did not give Mr Perkins the support or role which enabled him to perform in an appropriate way. If there is to be any brickbat thrown in this matter I believe it is clearly to be thrown at the political people involved and not at Mr Charles Perkins. I regret that for the last six years he has not had, in my view, appropriate political or other support from his Ministers-guidance, if you like. </PARA>
<PARA> This series of statements and reports will be much debated, I suspect, over the coming weeks and months. There will be many opportunities provided. I am sorry that my own contribution to the debate has had to be before I could go in full detail through all the material which has been put before us. I say again that I think this is one of the areas of Labor's greatest failure. The truth is that the next election will be won or lost on issues such as home interest rates and the Government's failure to run this splendid country in a way which enables it to produce and to maintain its place in the world. This Government will be damned because of the enormous overhang of foreign debt which puts us at enormous risk next time there is a change in the price that is paid for our products. </PARA>
<PARA> Those are the things that will be written large about this Government. I believe that a careful study of this Government will show that there is no area for which it should be more roundly condemned than its administration of Aboriginal affairs. So much was promised, so many votes were bought on the basis of those promises, and the performance has been third rate. The performance has been pathetic. All of this matters because there are hundreds, thousands, tens of thousands of Aboriginal people who have been led up the garden path and who are now suffering for having believed the nonsense that Labor politicians put to them. They are suffering because of the lack of orderly administration in this vital and difficult portfolio. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Acting Deputy President, you have put a lot of time into exposing some of that maladministration, as have many others of our Senate colleagues. I know that the common intent of all of us has been to try to get remedies which will see positive things being done. What we have been promised today is a continuation of the worst that has been happening. We have been promised that yes, all these things have been written down by all these learned people, there are these splendid statements of intention about accountability, but the structures that are being put in place will simply compound and make more difficult the problems of the past. </PARA>
<PARA> I speak with very great sadness at this time. I think it is a terrible shame that we are left in the position that this Government has put us. I hope that the Australian Democrats, who will have the power to make our votes useful or not useful on this issue, will consider very carefully the reality of the position of Aboriginal Australians. If they do not, if they join with the Government in allowing this extraordinary timetable, this extraordinary proposition, to go through, then I think we are going to have a very sorry future. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to seek leave to incorporate the statement in Hansard, but I know honourable senators opposite will not let me do that. It is now 16 months since the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs first made a statement in the other place outlining the Government's proposals to significantly restructure the Aboriginal Affairs portfolio. In that time much has happened. The Government has had the most extensive consultation ever on a piece of Commonwealth legislation affecting a particular group of people. We have had a significant response to the proposal from Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people right across the country. We have had a politically motivated smear campaign from the Opposition to try to thwart the plans of the Government and the Aboriginal community. But the Government is determined to proceed with its legislation establishing the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission (ATSIC).</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The proposal to establish ATSIC was announced by the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs on 10 December 1987. Since that time he has made many modifications, taking into account the views expressed to him and others during the extensive consultations he undertook with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. Today I will outline additional changes. </PARA>
<PARA> Many of these changes deal with the question of accountability. This is an area which, I remind the Senate, is just as important to Aboriginal and Islander people as it is to the Government. </PARA>
<PARA> During the consultations the Minister had with communities around the country on the ATSIC proposal, Aboriginal and Islander people stressed that they did not want to be set up to fail. They did not want to take part in the decision making process if it meant operating under flawed legislation. They were happy to accept the increased responsibilities but only if they received the necessary resources and training for the job. They did not want to be blamed for other people's mistakes, which has happened too often in the past. The Government has no intention of setting Aboriginal people up to fail. ATSIC will be provided with proper training and resources. But the legislation will also provide a series of checks and balances to ensure that all participants in the decision making process-from the regional councils through to Government-are accountable. </PARA>
<PARA> The basics of ATSIC will not be affected by any of the changes I will announce today. I remind the Senate of the main features, as contained in the Bill passed by the lower House last year:</PARA>
<PARA>a system of regional councils, elected by Aboriginals and Torres Strait Islanders resident in that region, which will determine priorities, develop regional plans, and generally represent the interests of the region;</PARA>
<PARA>commissioners, of whom the majority will be elected by regional councillors grouped into zones for this purpose;</PARA>
<PARA>the Commission replaces the Department of Aboriginal Affairs (DAA) and the Aboriginal Development Commission (ADC);</PARA>
<PARA>programs would be administered by Commission staff with funding direct to Aboriginal organisations and individuals;</PARA>
<PARA>other portfolio bodies-Aboriginal Hostels Ltd (AHL) and the Australian Institute of Aboriginal Studies (AIAS)-would retain their independent existence, but would have three ATSIC commissioners on their governing bodies;</PARA>
<PARA>staff would come under the Public Service Act;</PARA>
<PARA>the Minister's powers would balance the requirements of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander self-management with those of accountability to the Parliament;</PARA>
<PARA>a new body, the Aboriginal Economic Development Corporation (AEDC), would be formed to provide finance and services, on an independent commercial basis, for major enterprises involving, and of benefit to, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. </PARA>
<PARA>Thus ATSIC will combine, in the one organisation, the means for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people to have a real say in the management of their own affairs with an administrative structure that eliminates existing overlaps, is more responsive to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander wishes, and attains appropriate standards of accountability for public funds. </PARA>
<PARA>Accountability</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> The Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce, Senator Button, has already spoken of the Government's response to the findings of the Auditor-General in his special report on the ADC and on the Department. The Government affirms its resolve to address the problem areas identified in that report with vigour and determination. We have examined the Auditor-General's findings to see where they may bear upon the ATSIC legislation, and in particular on the provisions relating to accountability. At the same time we have taken into account the report of the Department of Finance into the ADC's financial administration. Both these reports lend support to the view that our proposals for ATSIC will result in a more effective administration of Aboriginal Affairs. It is already the case that the ATSIC Bill contains stronger provisions than the ADC Act-for example, through the authority of the Minister to approve the Estimates, which he lacks under the ADC Act. </PARA>
<PARA> Changes to the Bill must be considered in the context of the basic principle of ATSIC that Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people should have greater control over matters affecting them. The question is one of balancing this principle with the principle of ministerial accountability for the correct and efficient use of public funds. We therefore propose that the ATSIC Bill be amended to:</PARA>
<PARA>establish within ATSIC an Office of Evaluation and Audit, to undertake evaluations and internal audits on programs, projects and procedures. Project evaluations will be on a continuing basis, while for programs and regions there will be a three-year cycle of general audits. More intensive examination will of course flow from any shortcomings revealed in the general audits. The Office will report regularly to the Commission and the Minister, and annually to the Parliament through the ATSIC annual reports. The Head of the Office will have senior rank, and will be appointed by the Minister;</PARA>
<PARA>require ATSIC to observe financial directions to be made by the Minister;</PARA>
<PARA>require ATSIC to keep the Minister informed about specific projects that are encountering difficulties;</PARA>
<PARA>require ATSIC to prepare a corporate plan and to consult the Minister about it; and</PARA>
<PARA>clarify the distinction between commercial and non-commercial activities-a problem which has bedevilled the ADC. </PARA>
<PARA>It might be noted that one of the recurring criticisms by the Auditor-General was that projects were funded without there being community plans against which to assess priorities. The ATSIC Bill addresses this need. Coordination of community and regional planning is one of the functions of regional councils. </PARA>
<PARA>Senate Select Committee</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> The Senate Select Committee on the Administration of Aboriginal Affairs reported on 28 February on the ATSIC Bill. I have tabled the Government's responses to the recommendations of that Committee. We have accepted, in whole or in substance, the great bulk of the recommendations of the majority report. Those recommendations include, I point out, support for the Bill proceeding in the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA> I shall confine my comments here to the more substantial proposals for change to the Bill, commencing with those relating to the regional councils and the election of commissioners. The Select Committee expressed some concerns about the disparities in Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander populations as between regions in a zone, and as between zones. These differences exist because we have sought, as a result of the extensive consultations which have been held, to accommodate the wishes of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people as to where boundaries should be drawn, thus taking into account kinship ties and community of interest. This has undoubtedly been the right approach. Comparisons with legislatures and the principle of one vote one value miss the point; ATSIC is not a parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> Nonetheless the Government recognises that a system where one region in a zone with a small population has the same voting strength in elections for a commissioner as a much larger region has some inequitable features. Accordingly we accept the Select Committee majority's recommendation 11 to provide a sliding scale of regional councillors, starting with 10 for regions with populations of under 1,000, with an additional councillor for each additional 1,000 or part thereof up to a maximum of 20-the number presently in the Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> We have also addressed the issue, identified by the Select Committee but on which it made no formal recommendation, of substantial population imbalances as between zones. To this end we propose that the five most populous zones be split in two, thus raising the number of elected commissioners to 17. In New South Wales, the Sydney region will comprise a new zone, as will the Perth region in Western Australia. The Northern Territory zone, which comprises much of the Northern Territory, will be split into two separate zones. </PARA>
<PARA> In Queensland, which has the largest Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander population, two new zones will be created. One is for the Brisbane region, and the other to accommodate the wishes of people living in the so-called DOGIT communities-those who hold a form of title to their land under deeds of grant in trust-to be encompassed within the same zone. A new map is being drawn up to show the proposed changes. We believe these proposals will make for a better balanced system of regional councils and, through the revised zone structure, a more equitable system for the election of commissioners. </PARA>
<PARA> Recommendation 12 proposes, inter alia, voluntary enrolment for regional council elections, but compulsory voting for those who do enrol. The Government's intention has been that no special roll be established and that, as with the elections for the former National Aboriginal Conference, voters fill out a `voter card' on the day. There would be mechanisms for testing the eligibility of voters to take part in the election. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government appreciates that the Select Committee has been concerned to find a system which would provide both the opportunity for persons of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander descent to choose whether they wished to vote in regional council elections and a means for checking the eligibility of voters. The Government has given careful thought to voting systems. In its view the overriding consideration is that a public roll based on race, whatever its purpose, should not be established in this country. We will explore possible alternative systems with the Australian Electoral Commission. The details will be contained in the electoral rules which I am to prescribe in accordance with clause 95 of the Bill. That clause provides that the Parliament may disallow such rules. </PARA>
<PARA> A number of the recommendations are for tightening up existing provisions of the Bill. They deal with such matters as eligibility for elected or appointed office, pecuniary interests, full written assessments of proposals before substantial expenditures are approved, acting appointments, and employment of consultants. The Government accepts these recommendations, with some modifications to bring them in line with the requirements of other organisations established by statute. Although it modifies the Government's original intention to bring all bodies in my portfolio under one umbrella, we will also accept recommendation 3, which proposes that the Australian Institute of Aboriginal Studies should continue to be established under its own legislation. Other aspects of the proposed reforms to the Institute's structure will proceed. </PARA>
<PARA> The Select Committee looked closely at the preamble to the Bill. The majority, while recognising that concerns about possible wider ramifications of the preamble were not well based, has suggested that it could help to allay such concerns if the preamble were removed from the Bill and moved separately, without amendment, as a resolution of both Houses. The Government stands by its conviction that the preamble is of such significance that it should not be separated from the Bill. Australians should not back away from acknowledging, in a symbolically important way, the facts of history and our resolve to address the present effects of past injustice. We will not be diverted in our purpose by those who have chosen to represent the preamble as having a degree of legal force that it does not possess. </PARA>
<PARA> The Select Committee's recommendation 2 is important, and has received close attention. It proposes that enterprise and related functions of the ADC be transferred, not to ATSIC as the Bill proposes, but to the Aboriginal Economic Development Corporation-the AEDC. ADC's housing functions, however, would transfer as planned to ATSIC. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has decided not to transfer those functions to the AEDC. The reason for this is that the AEDC is intended to operate in quite a different way. It will not administer programs but will facilitate and participate in significant commercial enterprises involving, and of benefit to, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. It would be inappropriate, and would dilute the commercial nature of the AEDC, to have it take on programs, especially programs which include quasi-commercial aspects such as grants and concessional loans. ATSIC, through the regional council planning processes is designed to accommodate a whole range of community needs and in so doing will reduce the present wasteful duplication of administrative structures, including field services. I note here that the recent report of the Auditor-General has highlighted the problem that the ADC has often faced in separating its commercial and social functions. Maintaining the AEDC as a strictly commercial body will help address those concerns expressed by the Auditor-General. The ATSIC Bill will improve the capacity of the Minister to oversee enterprise activities in line with recommendations made by the Auditor-General. </PARA>
<PARA> With regard to the first recommendation of the Senate Select Committee that a separate Office of Aboriginal Affairs be retained within the Employment, Education and Training portfolio, I should point out that the ATSIC Bill does not restrict the advice available to the Minister to that provided by ATSIC. Indeed, it was always envisaged, under the ATSIC proposal, that there could be circumstances where the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs, and also the portfolio Minister, might occasionally require separate departmental advice on issues concerning ATSIC, and that this advice would come from the portfolio Department. </PARA>
<PARA> It will be clear from what I have said that the Government rejects the minority report of Opposition senators in seeking to have the Bill withdrawn. They have not established a case. Their report is long on assertion and colourful phrase, but woefully short on accuracy and fact. For reasons best known to themselves they wish to perpetuate a system-a system which they created-which is patently not working as it should. It is not a system for meeting the legitimate expectations of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people for a real say in their own affairs. </PARA>
<PARA>Other Changes</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> The opportunity will also be taken to make a number of other changes, essentially machinery and minor in nature, to the legislation-for example, in relation to dates of operation. A summary of the main changes to the ATSIC legislation is attached to the printed copies of this statement. </PARA>
<PARA>Implementation and Timing</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> ATSIC has already been delayed well beyond the original proposed starting date. That has created considerable problems for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, who naturally wish to know that promised and needed reforms will not be put off again. The delays have also left portfolio staff uncertain about their futures. In addition they have had to deal with a constant barrage of abuse from the Opposition as well as cope with the onerous task of responding to hundreds of questions on notice which have taken them away from their normal duties. We are very conscious of the additional difficulties this has caused for them, as it has for portfolio management. As the Minister representing the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs in this place I take this opportunity to express my gratitude for the way in which portfolio staff have continued to undertake their demanding and important tasks with commitment and efficiency, in often trying circumstances. </PARA>
<PARA> There are still some reports to be completed, including a further report by the Auditor-General and some investigations by Mr Andrew Menzies. It is unlikely that these reports will show a need for further legislative change, but should it prove to be otherwise the Minister shall, of course, bring forward proposals for such change. The timetable that we propose for implementing ATSIC takes this into account. I would also add that we will continue our consultations with the staff associations in the lead up to the implementation of our proposals. </PARA>
<PARA> The amendments I have outlined are important but do not affect the substance of ATSIC. We believe they will be widely welcomed and acceptable as desirable improvements. We therefore propose to press ahead with the legislation in the present sittings of the Parliament. Once the legislation is passed, there are a number of processes to be completed before the new Commission can become fully operational. These include the holding of regional council elections, the processes for which will take some months, and the election by regional councillors of the Commissioners. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government is very conscious of the need to minimise uncertainty and avoid further drift. It is also very conscious of the degree of confusion which has been generated in the community as a result of the political campaign waged by the Opposition. At the same time we recognise that Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people need time to understand the changes that are being made and, more broadly, to get to know more about ATSIC and how it will work. They need to have this information before being asked to make the important decisions of electing their regional councillors and then those regional councillors electing Commissioners. </PARA>
<PARA> Our preferred course is that the Commission be established on an interim basis from 1 October 1989. This will be done under transitional arrangements which will allow for the appointment by the Minister of five Commissioners, including the Chairperson. This arrangement will have a 12 months sunset clause. We would then allow an extensive period for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people to become familiar with the way ATSIC will work and for the administrative structure to shake down. A major educative and training effort will be made during this time. Regional councillor elections will then be held, and ATSIC would become fully operational, within this 12 month period. This phasing-in approach will help ensure that ATSIC comes into operation smoothly and effectively. </PARA>
<PARA> Already the ATSIC concept has been open for consultation and comment for over 15 months. We have made a series of refinements and modifications as a result of those processes. We will also ensure that ATSIC is properly resourced to undertake its important tasks. In its management and administration, ATSIC must have its priorities right from the start. It will have to put a lot of effort into such areas as corporate planning, program budgeting, policy and program guidelines, and evaluation and internal audit. </PARA>
<PARA> Another vital need to come out of the inquiries is for a much improved training effort, to enhance the skills of those working within Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander organisations and of portfolio staff and to ensure that ATSIC is properly understood by Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. </PARA>
<PARA> Some State and Territory governments have expressed concerns about ATSIC. The Minister has sought on a number of occasions to provide opportunities to meet with them and is continuing to do so. This is notwithstanding the fact that no State or Territory should have anything to fear from ATSIC. It appears, however, that some are happier to complain rather than put their views to the test. </PARA>
<PARA>Immediate Needs</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> ATSIC will not be operational for some months, but there is clearly a need, identified in the reports of the Department of Finance and the Auditor-General, to act now to remedy deficiencies within the present structures. We shall ensure that the ADC, during its remaining life, operates on a similar basis to ATSIC and in a manner that properly reflects Government priorities. The problem lies, at least in part, with defects in the ADC Act. By a combination of amendments to the Act, cognately with the ATSIC legislation, and of directions to the ADC under section 11 (1) of that Act, we will require Ministerial approval of estimates and consultation of its corporate plan; issue broad policy guidelines, especially relating to financial administration; and empower the Minister to request information and advice. A summary of the main proposals is also attached to this statement. </PARA>
<PARA> As far as the Department of Aboriginal Affairs is concerned, problems identified in the reports can only be addressed by administrative action. This action is currently being taken. In this regard I am able to report that considerable progress has been made in respect of a number of matters identified by the Auditor-General as requiring improvements. These include substantive work on the development of revised performance indicators; the acquittal of grants to Aboriginal organisations; revision of financial guidelines for grants; and the acquisition of additional field resources for some Regional Offices of the Department. </PARA>
<PARA>Conclusion</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> The changes we have made to ATSIC have not come about as a result of actions by the Opposition. It has had the opportunity but has failed to make any constructive contribution. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition has only sought to delay the proposal and generate confusion within Aboriginal and Islander communities. It has demonstrated that it is not interested in any kind of progressive reform. It is certainly not interested in Aboriginal people being part of the decision making process. </PARA>
<PARA> This is the only conclusion we can draw from the Opposition's stance. It cannot accept that Aboriginal people must be part of the processes of government. It cannot accept that Aboriginal people are the ones who can best determine their own needs and priorities. I am happy to say that its efforts have clearly failed. </PARA>
<PARA> Now, for the first time, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Australians will have a real say in matters affecting them. We are putting an end at last to paternalism, to the idea that others must decide what is best. We cannot amend history, but we can act to correct its adverse effects for today's and tomorrow's Australians. That is what ATSIC is all about. It is an achievement of which all Australians will be proud. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That the Senate take note of the statement. </PARA>
<PARA>The report that we are considering is entitled ATSIC: The Way Ahead. Let me repeat that-ATSIC: The Way Ahead. What an ironic title to give such a paper. This paper presented today in conjunction with another statement by the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) on issues related to the administration of Aboriginal Affairs and the paper presented by the Minister for Justice, Senator Tate, in response to recommendations of the Senate Select Committee on the Administration of Aboriginal Affairs are a fraud. They are a fraud not only to all Australians but to the 200,000 Aboriginal Australians. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that the importance of this issue cannot be stressed too strongly. In fact, I believe that the most disappointed senators today, in considering the various reports that have now been made, must be Senator McMullan, Senator Collins and Senator Coulter. They spent a great deal of time as members of the Senate Select Committee inquiring into Aboriginal Affairs. They hassled for months with the particular issues and with a very important and dramatic report to the Senate. We have seen them insulted by the tactics of the Labor Party today. I remind the Senate that Senator Boswell and Senator Peter Baume put in a minority report that highlighted many of the issues of many of the problems. </PARA>
<PARA> In looking at this issue today we must consider the way in which it has been presented. In fact, it is an information overload which has serious connotations. It must mean that every senator-in fact, anybody who is seriously considering this issue-must ask: what is the Government hiding? Today, as Senator Chaney said earlier, three very important ministerial statements have been made. At the same time, we have had put on our desks a report of the Public Service Commissioner, two reports of the Department of Finance, a report from Mr Menzies and, of course, in recent weeks and months we have also had the special report of the Auditor-General and the report to which I have referred, the Senate Select Committee report on the whole issue of Aboriginal affairs. Each and every one of those reports and ministerial statements demand a comprehensive consideration by the Parliament. It is very interesting to trace the dates of those various reports and see when they were handed down. I ask the very important question: why were the Department of Finance reports not tabled concurrently with the special report of the Auditor-General which was tabled here several weeks ago? Why was it held back? The dates invite comparison and make one very suspicious of the motives. </PARA>
<PARA> Today's statements by Ministers need very special consideration. Senator Tate gave a response to the report of the Senate Select Committee. It addressed all of the 40 recommendations of the majority report, all of the recommendations of the minority report and the various recommendations of Senator Coulter. In a very cavalier manner, the Government has decided to push ahead and press on with a very different agenda. In fact, it takes one back to the adjectival way of doing things that Mr Hand seems to have in the administration of his portfolio. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me remind honourable senators that in December 1987, as Senator Tate said in his statement, some 16 months ago, there was an attempt to bring forward the first serious consideration of the new administration of this area. That document was called Foundations for the Future. In March and April 1988, mark 2 and mark 3 were presented to the Parliament with various amendments, changes, modifications and ratifications. What did we get today? We had further statements such as this: `In light of whatever, we may have to amend this again further down the track'. What an insult to all of the people who gave submissions so generously to that Senate Select Committee. What about the people throughout Australia in the Department-the public servants, the members of the Aboriginal Development Commission and also the staff of the ADC-who have been seeking for much longer than 16 months to get it right?</PARA>
<PARA> The Prime Minister made a very pious statement in the Parliament today. It is almost a papal encyclical. If one looks at the commitments, background and history, one finds very little in what the Prime Minister put down. Let me highlight the major issues that he raised, and he raised only two. He said that there were two imperatives for government. He continued:</PARA>
<PARA>the first imperative for self-management, by Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, of Government programs designed to assist their well being. </PARA>
<PARA>. . . </PARA>
<PARA> Second, there is the thoroughly complementary imperative for proper ministerial responsibility and accountability for, and effective parliamentary scrutiny of, programs as a whole, especially in relation to their financial administration. </PARA>
<PARA>The Labor Government has failed on both of those counts. It has now made a mockery of self-management in the whole process that it has adopted in seeking to get into place a new form of Aboriginal administration. In regard to ministerial responsibility and accountability, what have we been asking for in the Senate, in Senate Estimates committees and in the Senate Select Committee for the last 16 months if it has not been the rotten, lousy ministerial responsibility and accountability of Minister Hand, who has walked away from those very essential tenets?</PARA>
<PARA> The Prime Minister in his statement acknowledges that there are major problems in this portfolio. He said that there are shortcomings; some serious ones are evident; that there are areas where there was a lower than acceptable standard of administration. He said that the staff classifications were not well founded in terms of classification principles and processes. He sought to take the mickey out of the Public Service Commissioner in his report and to play down the very important issues that arise. I will address that aspect a little later. The Prime Minister's statement certainly acknowledges the problems, but it does not go anywhere near giving a commitment to addressing them. If one looks carefully at the final paragraph of what the Prime Minister said, one will see that it is nothing but sheer hypocrisy. He said:</PARA>
<PARA>The Government's approach is, as I have indicated, to draw upon the lessons from the inquiries and look to the future to ensure that mechanisms are put in place and support provided so that future administration is on a sound footing. We are determined to address administrative problems in a way which ensures a higher quality of future administration in this very important area of government and, in the long run, a higher quality of life and sense of belonging for all Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. </PARA>
<PARA>That statement should be compared with the results and with the action of Minister Hand. Of course, the Prime Minister, Mr Hand and Mr Snowdon constantly scream that the Opposition is supposedly engaged in a campaign of smear and of attacking people's credibility. A stream of allegations dogs the area. I ask them to name the smears, to name the people. It is fine just to say it. We have addressed hundreds of areas of financial mismanagement. Sure, a couple of people were hurt along the way, but they were all associated with the problems. There is no smearing of Aboriginal people in the community. Mr Acting Deputy President, let me assure you that in the electorate that I represent 25 per cent of my constituents are traditional Aboriginals. There are 35,000 such people in my electorate. I think I know very well the way that they feel on this issue. </PARA>
<PARA> What the Government is seeking to do today is to lump all of the sins together. Let me remind the Senate that the problems did not occur on the scale that we have uncovered in the last year-looking back over the period of the Labor administration of five years-under the previous administration of the Liberal-National Party Government. The Prime Minister's statement is a mockery when it comes to self-management for Aboriginal people. It walks away from genuine ministerial responsibility and accountability. </PARA>
<PARA> I also remind the Senate very clearly that what we are talking about in the establishment of a new Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission is something that will represent, or purport to represent, 200,000 people around Australia. It will have a budget well in excess of $600m, probably closer to $1 billion per annum. We need to balance this against all the problems that are associated with the Aboriginal Development Commission, which is an existing statutory authority with an existing budget of $30m. That is $600m compared with $30m. The balance is currently administered by the Department of Aboriginal Affairs and other government agencies. Maybe it is time that taxpayers, Australians, ran for the bunkers on this issue. The concerns we are expressing are extreme and very genuine. As I have said, Minister Hand's document is entitled The Way Ahead. It is based on the Foundations for the Future document of some 16 months ago. But those documents are certainly not the way ahead and they are certainly creating a great deal of controversy in the broad community and in the Aboriginal community. </PARA>
<PARA> The legislation to put the ATSIC proposal in place has to come back before the Senate. We need to note that the Bill is underpinned by the idea that the Aboriginal people are entitled to special administrative and representative arrangements because they have a special claim. The argument has overtones of compensation and of Aborigines being a superior class of Australian citizen. I refer to a couple of the many lines beginning `And whereas' in the preamble to the Bill, especially written in with special significance:</PARA>
<PARA>AND WHEREAS they were dispossessed by subsequent European occupation and have no recognised rights over land yet recognised by the Courts other than those granted or recognised by the Crown;</PARA>
<PARA>AND WHEREAS that dispossession occurred without compensation and no serious attempt was made to reach a lasting and equitable agreement with them on the use of their land;</PARA>
<PARA>On it goes-`and whereas', `and whereas', `and whereas'. The Minister has the audacity to argue that this preamble will not be influential in the courts in future. What sheer and absolute rubbish. In contrast, the coalition asserts that while the Aboriginal community in Australia has a special status, as first Australians, their rights and responsibilities are no different from those of other Australians. As Australians they are entitled to government assistance to meet their basic needs, and as the most disadvantaged cultural group it is appropriate that special mechanisms be employed to improve living standards. The Government philosophy leads to giving Aborigines control of a statutory authority overseeing their interests within the nation. The coalition philosophy leads to a bureaucracy which remains accountable to the Parliament but which employs distinctive consultative mechanisms to ensure that Aboriginal advancement programs are appropriate and effective at all levels. The coalition clearly rejects Aboriginal self-determination as represented by ATSIC in favour of very real self-management and economic self-sufficiency. We need to be very careful in that. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn to the document The Way Ahead. We always have to look for the hidden agenda in anything Mr Hand writes. The hidden agenda for this one is tucked away, down towards the back. As I said, this makes a sheer mockery of self-management for Aboriginal people. On page 19 of the draft I have it is stated:</PARA>
<PARA> Our preferred course is that the Commission be established on an interim basis from 1 October 1989. This will be done under transitional arrangements which will allow for the appointment by the Minister of five Commissioners, including the Chairperson. This arrangement will have a 12 months sunset clause. </PARA>
<PARA> We would then allow for an extensive period for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people to become familiar with the way ATSIC will work, and for the administrative structure to shake down. </PARA>
<PARA>Come on! Again Mr Hand is going behind the intent of the Parliament. He is going behind legislation. How much do I have to remind people of what Mr Hand did last May when he chucked out a group of commissioners on the Aboriginal Development Commission who happened to be putting an alternative view? They were all eminent Aboriginal people in the area of administration. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;He has not apologised; he has not looked at their position in any way. What is he doing now? He is bringing back another hand-picked-pardon the pun-group of representatives to run a $600m budget. He is completely bypassing the Department of Aboriginal Affairs bureaucracy; he is gobbling up the Aboriginal Development Commission and any other area that he can possibly get his hands on. That is the sort of hidden agenda we find tucked into the back pages of a report like this, supposedly based on consultation with Aboriginal people throughout Australia. That provision will be horrific for Aboriginal people throughout Australia. The old ADC board had a significant number of people on it, from different groups. Even the proposals in the Act for regions, zones and everything else enabled some degree of participation in that process of administrative review. But, no, we will now have a hand-picked, five-member, special 12-month sunset clause condition interposed. I hope the Australian Democrats will not buy that. That would be against every principle that I accept that the Democrats stand for in trying to get benefits for Aboriginal people throughout Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> So much for this most extensive consultation ever that Mr Hand claims. He tries to hide behind criticism by saying that it is smear. Like heck! In no way is that the case. He goes back to his Foundations for the Future document of 1987, which was so fundamentally flawed, and says that the Government has made many modifications and of course will make many more all the way along the line. The legislation is flawed and the people who have to bear the blame for this mistake this time are surely the Labor Cabinet and the Labor Caucus. They must have rolled Senator McMullan and Senator Collins, who must be squirming as a result of this document and the weight of evidence that was presented to their very effective committee. Areas of change are reflected all the way through, whether it be zones and regions, the Institute of Aboriginal Studies or the different groups and how the Minister is going to achieve accountability and effectiveness between them all. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me come to a few more curly ones that the Minister wants to tuck into the legislation, without consultation with Aboriginal people. I remind the Senate of this intention in his statement:</PARA>
<PARA>establish within ATSIC an Office of Evaluation and Audit . . . The Office will report regularly to the Commission and the Minister, and annually to the Parliament through the ATSIC Annual Reports. </PARA>
<PARA>So the Minister has put a special audit bureau into ATSIC, underneath the top of the pyramid. It is little wonder when we read the special Auditor-General's report tabled a few weeks ago. When the Auditor-General reviewed this entire portfolio, as a result of the work of Senate estimates committees last year, he found:</PARA>
<PARA> Budgetary planning was not based on relevant quantified target objectives against which performance could be/was measured . . . general control of DAA expenditure was unsatisfactory; funding for community development was generally provided in the absence of plans for such development, without planned targets and without measuring the success of outcomes in terms of achieving planned community development; Department was unable to confirm that funds it provided for 1,752 projects had been expended on the purposes for which it had been provided. The total unacquitted grants could exceed $100m but was not known, though 783 of the projects did involve allocations of $67,749,576. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is certainly worth noting the comparison. Now an Office of Evaluation and Audit is to be put inside ATSIC to do this type of reporting. The Auditor-General's report has not been fully and comprehensively debated anywhere in this Parliament because the Australian Labor Party does not have the courage to put it on the agenda for the House of Representatives or bring it back where it properly should be discussed-in this place. We talk about the changing of the guard by way of a number of regions and zones and the population balances and the electoral colleges. Mr Hand has sought to break every Labor principle in the book. He is now splitting them up; let me remind the Senate that he talks about splitting the Northern Territory into two separate zones. I wonder how compatible that will be with the administration under the Aboriginal Land Rights Act of the Northern Land Council and the Central Land Council, which are so closely identified with Minister Hand in all of his radical attempts to get on with changing politics.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA> We have to keep coming back to so many areas. But let us look at the Public Service Commissioner's report. The words of that report sound like the constantly watered down words that are used in respect of other issues. As Senator Chaney said in his response to the statement by the Prime Minister, we have not had time yet to read this report, which was thrown on our desks half an hour, if we were lucky, before we walked into this chamber this afternoon. I am sure that some honourable senators have not had the opportunity to read through it. </PARA>
<PARA> Okay, the Public Service Commission has done a job for the Prime Minister's Department. It has watered down the words in the front of the report. But on pages 42 and 43 the Public Service Commissioner deals with some 10 detailed recommendations. He talks about a senior level task force to be set up to report quarterly with comprehensive reviews; the fact that DAA's longstanding equal opportunity program should be looked at; that the responsibilities and intentions in the areas of aboriginalisation and criteria weighting should be clarified as soon as possible; that all staffing policies in relation to Aboriginals should be consolidated; that staff training and career development programs of DAA should be reviewed; that a code of conduct and other appropriate publications give the alert concerning patronage et cetera, and the avoidance of conflict of interest in staffing and other administrative matters; the fact that the Merit Protection and Review Agency should be asked to organise special seminars on selection procedures, grievance rights, et cetera; and that unions should be encouraged to play their full part in involving personnel in practices and performance. For heaven's sake, that is the real part that should have been played by the Public Service Commissioner. Someone obviously monitored and watered down the front part of the report. But pages 42 and 43 of the report contain damning recommendations. </PARA>
<PARA> Whilst that report also castigates, to a certain extent, some of the union demands of last year, we need to be reminded that on 3 March this year-there has been plenty of time for participation in all of these reviews, inquiries and everything else-the lady who raised the issues last year was still not happy. In a letter of 3 March 1989 to the Minister, Mr Hand, Miss Ann Forward, the National President of the Administrative and Clerical Officers Association, said:</PARA>
<PARA>Morale is at an abysmal level, and members despair of ever being able to do their jobs properly. They have inadequate resources, especially of staff, to deliver services and programs to the clients of the portfolio. There are very real concerns about the cessation of training, inadequacy of travel funds, dubious employment practices, particularly in relation to the use of temporary staff, and alarming rates of resignations and sick leave (including stress related). </PARA>
<PARA>Further on she says:</PARA>
<PARA> There is a very real and extremely urgent need for some stability to be put back into the working lives of members in DAA and ADC. </PARA>
<PARA>Miss Forward is on the attack again. All of these reports have not picked up the issues raised by the Administrative and Clerical Officers Association. The Minister has the audacity in this statement to say, `We are going to change it; we are going to do it differently; we are going to frustrate them further'. Members of the Public Service have been under a lot of pressure for the last six months because there have been problems, and even the Prime Minister has acknowledged that in his statement. But what support have they received from the Minister, Mr Hand? They have received none. He has constantly undermined their system. He has gone behind them. He has dealt with the pseudo Public Service of the land councils, the radical organisations in the national coalition and all of the other organisations. Of course, he is now seeking to bypass the whole lot of them to put into place a special, new, hand-picked commission, not one that is accountable to the Aboriginal constituencies to carry out an administrative reform, not one that is accountable to this Parliament in the ways in which it should be. </PARA>
<PARA> What about Minister Hand's commitment to the State and Northern Territory governments for further consultation on this matter? There is no reflection whatsoever in today's statement that he is going to do anything in that regard. Yet, the public announcements and everything else have been, `Yes, we are going to take account of what industry, commerce, State governments and Aboriginal groups want around Australia'. Let me quote from a telex message from Gerry Hand to State and Territory Ministers responsible for Aboriginal affairs. This telex, dated 29 March 1989, stated:</PARA>
<PARA>My own commitments-</PARA>
<PARA>he is trying to get a date for a meeting with State Ministers on this matter-</PARA>
<PARA>Parliamentary and other, will prevent me from attending such a meeting until the last week of April. Meanwhile, as I have indicated, the Commonwealth must press on with addressing the important issues of this portfolio. This will not pre-empt our discussions, and I will examine objectively and report to Cabinet any soundly based proposals that are put forward at our meeting for improving the legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> May I therefore request that you arrange for my office to be advised as soon as possible which dates in the last week of April would be convenient to you or, should you not be available, your nominee, for a meeting in Canberra. </PARA>
<PARA>That is what Minister Hand said to the State Ministers. What has he done today? He has gone against the statement in his telex that he would not pre-empt their considerations, debate and discussion and the very good input that they should all be making. There is no mention whatsoever of this by either the Prime Minister or Minister Hand. As I said earlier, very obviously Minister Hand and Mr Hawke did not even bother to consult the Labor Caucus. Perhaps we would have seen a different view and attitude if commonsense had properly prevailed. </PARA>
<PARA> It is clear that the Aboriginal Development Commission is again to be fiddled with in the interim. It is good that we will have the opportunity on Thursday and Friday of this week to deal with these matters when the Senate Estimates committees are back on deck. I make no apology for having asked hundreds of questions last year. It was terribly important that these issues should be addressed. What flowed from those questions-all of these reports, inquiries and everything else that Minister Hand and Mr Hawke are now attempting to sweep under the carpet? But at least this week we will be able to ask questions on notice and take up these very important issues that have to be addressed. </PARA>
<PARA> The Aboriginal people are being affected. We need to remember that we have a Minister who is prepared to bypass totally every system and every principle that I thought the Australian Labor Party stood for in the Parliament. Not one member of Hand's left wing faction in the Senate has got up and debated this matter. On one occasion Senator Bolkus got up, stuffed up a question and then retreated into his tortoiseshell. Ever since then, not even one member of Hand's left wing faction has attempted to bail him out. This has been left to credible senators like Senator McMullan and Senator Collins. Of course, they are not participating in today's debate, because they have been thoroughly insulted, just like all other Australians, all other senators and, in particular, all Aboriginal people. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;When I was elected to the Senate I came into this place with a considerable respect for the processes of representative democracy and the procedures which I hoped I would observe in this place. I find that today, in dealing with this matter, those processes for which I had such a high regard have been quite seriously abused. I note that on Wednesday evening the Treasurer, Mr Keating, is to make a major statement. Thursday's newspapers will be full of that matter. This afternoon we are dealing with three-I emphasise `three'-ministerial statements which are ill-prepared and which are intertwined in such a way that it is difficult to work out exactly what is going on. In the short time available it is impossible to look at them closely, but I have discovered one major inconsistency between them. This very important matter, as previous speakers have pointed out, has been before the Senate in very detailed ways. It has been before a number of committees of inquiry and before other inquiries over a long period-since December 1987. For the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs (Mr Hand) to push this matter through on this day in this way can only be described in fairly crude terms as `a snow job'. It is an attempt to push through a very important piece of legislation which is before the Select Committee on the Administration of Aboriginal Affairs and before the public so that it does not get proper consideration.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I refer to the statement which was made by Senator Button on behalf of the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) on the administration of Aboriginal Affairs. In the statement the Prime Minister in quoting Senator Bonner stated:</PARA>
<PARA>He was able to say that because the weight of the responses to the original Bill-</PARA>
<PARA>he is speaking of the original Aboriginal Development Commission Bill-</PARA>
<PARA>was to reduce the role of the Minister and expand the role of the Commission. </PARA>
<PARA>Further on there is another quotation:</PARA>
<PARA>In reaffirming my Government's support for ATSIC, I make the point that, given this legislative history,-</PARA>
<PARA>and this is the important point-</PARA>
<PARA>the proposed new Commission is the logical and appropriate next step for the advancement of both the great principles of self-management and ministerial accountability. </PARA>
<PARA>Yet, as Senator Tambling and others have pointed out, one comes to the second point of the Summary of the Principal Changes Proposed to the ATSIC Legislation and finds:</PARA>
<PARA>For an initial period of up to 12 months, the Commission will operate on an interim basis with 5 Commissioners appointed by the Minister. </PARA>
<PARA>That is a serious conflict of meaning between the words in the Prime Minister's statement when, again, he is reflecting-and I think quite rightly-on the need to set up a structure which properly reflects the needs and aspirations of Aboriginal people in terms of self-determination and self-management. Here one finds that everything the Minister is saying and everything that the Senate Select Committee has been working towards is denied by that simple action proposed by the Minister to set up the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission (ATSIC) as a commission of five appointed commissioners. </PARA>
<PARA> The wealth of information which has been presented to us today is also worth stressing, as Senator Tambling has done. Not only do we have three ministerial statements, but also we have the four other statements, some of which clearly the Government has had for a considerable period and which would have been very useful to have as preparation for this debate this afternoon. The Prime Minister's statement says, amongst other things, that we should be learning from the past. As I have indicated on several previous occasions, I felt that my function in the Senate Select Committee was to look closely at the material which was coming out of the various other inquiries into the administration of Aboriginal affairs-both the Department of Aboriginal Affairs (DAA) and the Aboriginal Development Commission (ADC)-to learn from those things, and to attempt to set up as far as possible, an administrative structure for Aboriginal affairs which would function better in the future. We need to bear in mind, along with that general principle, that the two basic principles on which the Prime Minister reflects and which need to be balanced are first, the principle, of self-management, self-determination, and, second, the broad principle that one needs a structure which is accountable. These difficult to reconcile functions need to be built into this better structure. </PARA>
<PARA> I cannot help but reflect on the way in which the Aboriginal Development Commission was grossly distorted in May last year when the Minister, Mr Hand, saw fit to remove certain commissioners who had objected to the proposal for ATSIC as it was at that stage. An alternative proposal was put before both the Minister and subsequently the Committee which, interestingly, in one respect, the Committee was minded to take up and incorporate in its recommendation No. 2; that the economic development type functions should be properly put with the Aboriginal Economic Development Corporation-the new body-which will administer the capital fund and have responsibility for the investment of that capital fund. That should be separated from the social welfare type functions which would be properly administered by ATSIC. </PARA>
<PARA> Given that the Minister has shown himself incapable of making appropriate appointments to the ADC-and I point out that some 80 per cent of the problems of the ADC which required investigation were problems which became evident after that ministerial rearrangement-I cannot support, and the Democrats will not be supporting, this interim arrangement to set up a commission of five commissioners appointed by the Minister. If we are to learn from the past, let us look at the past, at the history of this Minister in relation to the sorts of appointments he has made and the sort of mess they have got the ADC into. If one looks at that and learns from the past-the Prime Minister's own words-one learns that that system will simply not work. It will be a worse situation. It certainly will not address the hollow, repeated claim by the Minister that he is working towards self-determination and self-management. </PARA>
<PARA> I cannot help reflecting also on the fact that the Minister is also calling in one of his other statements for a corporate plan for this new body. Interestingly, after a rather shaky beginning, in which the ADC had some difficulties which were investigated by a House of Representatives committee which reported in 1985 and 1986 and after the appointment of Mrs Shirley McPherson to head the ADC, it seems to me that during her brief administration, before Minister Hand intervened, the ADC was sorting itself out, and one of the things it was getting was a corporate plan. In fact, it was doing precisely what the Minister is now recommending ATSIC should do. It seems a cruel irony that the Minister is now turning around and attempting to claim that only in his integrated structure will the development of corporate plans and proper administration be achieved when in fact he has destroyed the one part of the administration of Aboriginal affairs which seems to me to be largely on the road to sorting itself out and developing a sound management practice. Again, I merely reflect on the Minister's and the Prime Minister's words that we should look at history. In looking at history we find that this Minister is certainly not a Minister to be trusted with the appointment of people to take up these new functions as he is proposing in point 2 of attachment A to the statement of the Minister for Justice (Senator Tate). </PARA>
<PARA> In responding to the particular recommendations of the Senate Select Committee, recommendation 12 is that a roll be established as a prerequirement for the conduct of elections. Recommendation 12 says:</PARA>
<PARA> This population should be, in each instance, the population of people on an electoral roll. While placing one's name on the electoral roll should be voluntary, voting should be compulsory thereafter for those whose names are on the roll. The recall provisions should be exercisable only by those on the electoral role. </PARA>
<PARA>This recommendation was seriously considered by the Committee as one which would expedite the functioning of ATSIC. It would make it quite clear who was eligible to vote and would also remove from the time of the election any challenges to eligibility to vote, so that when the elections were held the votes could be counted fairly quickly. Interestingly, in making a response to this the Minister says: the possibility is being explored within the Australian Electoral Commission of a confidential system which would allow for the use of existing Federal electoral rolls combined with an acceptable mechanism for checking the bona fides of voters. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="TF4">Senator COULTER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Leaving aside the mechanism by which this might be done, to which Senator Stone is referring, the Minister is saying there that he is investigating the establishment of an electoral roll. Yet at page 11 we find that recommendation 12 proposes, inter alia:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>voluntary enrolment for Regional Council elections, but compulsory voting for those who do enrol. The Government's intention has been that no special roll be established and that, as with the elections for the . . .</PARA>
<PARA>So even after this delay, and given the chicanery of the Government in attempting to push these three documents through at such short notice, together with the various accompanying government reports, we find that the Government has internal conflicts in the various statements it is making. On the one hand it it saying that the recommendation of the Senate Select Committee that a roll be established is being investigated by the Electoral Commission, and, on the other hand, it is saying in the other statement that it has already rejected that recommendation. </PARA>
<PARA> In relation to the preamble-I find the right document. This confusion just indicates the degree to which the Government has attempted to obfuscate this whole matter. As Senator Tambling has indicated, the preamble to the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission Bill 1988 contains the word `Whereas' a number of times. According to the Government, that preamble has no impact in law whatsoever. A number of people drew the Committee's attention to their concern that the word `Whereas' may have some relevance in law. The Committee for two reasons-and I stress `for two reasons'-recommended that the preamble be separated from the legislation and passed in a cognate debate, or at least be debated, as a separate motion of the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA> The two reasons were: firstly, if the Government is saying that the word has no force in law, then it is appropriate to make quite certain that it has no force in law, by separating the preamble from the rest of the Bill. That reason is addressed by the Minister. But the second reason which the Minister totally fails to address, is that a number of Aboriginal people have been led to believe that that preamble does have some force in law. In other words, I believe they have been dishonestly dealt with by this Government by the inclusion of that preamble, and it is simply a matter of honesty that that preamble be separated so that it is absolutely clear that, if it has no force in law, it becomes a motion of the Senate, it is put through as a motion of the Senate, and it has exactly the same force as far as Aboriginal people are concerned. Nobody, and most importantly no Aboriginal people, must be misled into thinking they have got more out of this Government than they have, because the Government, by its own admission, is clearly not offering anything by putting that preamble in the front of the Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> I am extremely disappointed-I cannot stress it more strongly-with the way in which this Government has chosen to deal with this whole package of material which it has brought in on this day on which we have to deal with other important matters. It is delaying the release of important documents which are relevant to our consideration, while appearing to satisfy a number of the recommendations of the Senate Select Committee. If we look through the list in one of these documents, it appears that all but about four of the recommendations have been accepted. In the response, that particular recommendation regarding the five commissioners to take over the functions of ATSIC is not mentioned. We have to find another document before it is revealed that its structure, for 18 months into the future, would not be according to the model anyway. The whole process has been one of deceit and has been misleading. </PARA>
<PARA> I came into this place with a certain amount of respect for Mr Hand. I have found it very difficult to maintain that respect as this process has gone down the path of various ministerial statements and attacks on Senate committees and the like over the time that we have had to deal with this Minister. I can only assume that he is less concerned about the real welfare of Aboriginal people than he is about winning, in a very crude political sense. He has invented something which he calls ATSIC, and now he is simply intent on getting something called ATSIC up, and being able to wave that fact before everybody and to say, `Look, I have won'. We are not about winning in this place, particularly when it comes to Aboriginal welfare; we are about a very serious matter, the improvement in the lot of Aboriginal people. </PARA>
<PARA> I am still committed to the ideal of self-determination and self-management. I am still committed to the ideal that the original ATSIC proposal purports to address, but I am not convinced that this Minister is at all serious about addressing that matter and at the same time ensuring that there is proper accountability in the structure which he is now putting before us. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This afternoon I intend to take just a few minutes of the Senate's time to outline that yesterday was a black day for education, if not in Australia, then at least in the State of New South Wales. It was a day when the clocks were turned back, when the repression of years past again raised its ugly head, a day when supposed community leaders decided it was correct to use violence against the young people in their charge. All of this was done in the name of education. Yesterday must mark one of the low points of educational leadership in New South Wales. To bring back the cane is a step which indicates the educational administration has lost control and forgotten what education is all about.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The word `education' is derived from the Latin `ducere' meaning `to lead', and is prefixed by `ex', which means `out of'. The word `education', therefore, is most apt. As a civilised nation it is appropriate that we be led out-led out from ignorance, from bigotry, from hatred and from oppression-towards knowledge and understanding. Instead of concentrating on education, instead of adopting measures to assist teachers to help students who have behaviour problems, instead of employing specialists who can provide that assistance, the education system in New South Wales has joined repressive societies in resorting to the use of violence. </PARA>
<PARA> We now have a situation in New South Wales where those who have been incarcerated for crimes against society have far more rights than a child at school. Prisoners are no longer flogged. Prisoners have been accused by one section of society, tried by another and compelled to serve their sentences under the control of a separate corrective system. But what happens with the defenceless child who is caned? Quite often the accuser, the judge and the person who metes out the punishment are one and the same person. Our society would not tolerate a similar system for those accused of criminal offences. By far the vast majority of teachers are hard-working, dedicated men and women who will not have a bar of the use of corporal punishment. The others who deliberately inflict pain on those whom they should be educating lose any right to regard themselves a professionals. </PARA>
<PARA> What would society say if people such as medical practitioners, nurses and psychologists used violence to counter their patients' behaviour problems? They would be disbarred, and rightly so. Yet we now face the bizarre situation where state-condoned violence is to be returned to a school system which had until yesterday projected a humane image. Many schools now have courses in peace studies and in many schools and in the wider community there is support for Australia to take a lead in the search for world peace. But is the next generation going to believe us when we hold that disputes should be resolved by other than violence and yet use violence against them at school? They are more likely to regard us as hypocrites. </PARA>
<PARA> My opposition to the use of corporal punishment is well documented. I therefore do not intend to make further remarks about this matter today. Before concluding, however, I would commend to honourable senators the editorial of today's Sydney Morning Herald. It has pained me to speak on this subject, but the almost unbelievable actions of what is supposed to be an educational administration in New South Wales should not go unnoticed. </PARA>
