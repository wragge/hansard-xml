<PARA> We the undersigned citizens and residents of Australia humbly pray that:</PARA>
<PARA> 1. The Parliament heeds our profound concern regarding the penal code reforms of the ARENA Government in El Salvador.</PARA>
<PARA> 2. We request that as these reforms breach the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, and in consideration of the escalation of human rights violations by El Salvadoran armed forces, the Australian Government convey to the United States that all forms of military aid to the Salvadoran Government should be suspended.</PARA>

<TITLE>Company Tax Collection System</TITLE>
<PARA>To the Honourable the President and members of the Senate in the Parliament assembled. The petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth that:</PARA>
<PARA> The Government's Budget decision to change the company tax collection system will be a crippling blow to many small businesses, already suffering as a direct result of the Hawke Labor Government's high interest rate policy.</PARA>
<PARA> The earlier remittance of company tax payments to the Government will substantially reduce the cash-flow position of thousands of small businesses.</PARA>
<PARA> Many small businesses will be driven under as a result of the Government's decision-unable to find funds for both tax commitments and new stock, only able to borrow at record high interest rates and unable to claim any tax relief on such borrowings to meet their tax commitment.</PARA>
<PARA> The Government's proposed changes to the company tax collection system has only been introduced as a greedy grab for more tax revenue.</PARA>
<PARA> The small business community would prefer the Government to completely abandon the proposal rather than make only minor alterations to the original Budget decision, which are not likely to alleviate the situation to any significant extent.</PARA>
<PARA> And your petitioners, as in duty bound, will ever pray.</PARA>

<TITLE>Vietnam: Buddhist Leaders</TITLE>
<PARA>To the Honourable the President and members of the Senate assembled in Parliament.</PARA>
<PARA> The petition of certain citizens of Australia draws to the attention of the House:</PARA>
<PARA> That the Australian Parliament expresses its repugnance that the Socialist Republic of Vietnam has kept imprisoned 47 Buddhist leaders since 1984.</PARA>
<PARA> And further, that the regime in Vietnam has recently tried and sentenced to death Thich Tri Sieu and Thich Tue Sy, two distinguished scholars from amongst the 47. Both of these religious academics are intellectuals of the highest order, being scholars in Buddhist scripture.</PARA>
<PARA> Your petitioners therefore request the House to denounce the intentions of the Socialist Republic of Vietnam and to call on the Vietnamese Government for clemency and a remission of the death sentence as being barbaric.</PARA>

<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The speech read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA> I commend the work of the Senate Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances. This is an important part of the work of the Senate, which is not often recognised. </PARA>
<PARA> However, there is a real concern that-very often-undertakings given to the Committee have not been honoured, in particular, promises to amend particular items of delegated legislation which are deficient or poorly drafted. </PARA>
<PARA> Ministers make promises which are based on the advice of public servants. These promises may be made in good faith. But in some cases the advisers have no intention of delivering on the undertakings which they persuade their Ministers to give. I believe that these advisers are simply relying on the terrifying workload of Ministers. Undertakings will be superseded by other pressing matters, and forgotten. </PARA>
<PARA> In such situations the Senate is powerless. Even the most conscientious of Ministers-considering their workload-is tempted to treat the matter as water under the bridge. </PARA>
<PARA> I have consulted a number of honourable senators, and I believe that the approach set out in the Bill represents a consensus of all Parties. </PARA>
<PARA> In essence, the Bill provides that where an undertaking is given but not subsequently honoured, the delegated legislation in question comes before the Senate again, as if for the first time. This means that the Senate again has the power of disallowance which it had the first time. </PARA>
<PARA> This renewed sanction should concentrate the minds of those who advise Ministers to give such undertakings. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe all senators will welcome this Bill, which gives the Senate the power to ensure that promises made are promises kept. </PARA>

<PARA>I seek leave to have the second reading speeches incorporated in Hansard. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The speeches read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA>MARINE NAVIGATION LEVY BILL 1989</PARA>
<PARA> The purpose of this Bill is to alter the basis of calculating the method of charging commercial shipowners for the navigational services provided to them by the Commonwealth. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill will also transfer the authority to raise the necessary revenue from the Lighthouses Act 1911 to a Levy Act and its associated Collection Act. This will remove any doubt that may exist as to the constitutional validity of light dues as a method of cost recovery. </PARA>
<PARA> Since 1915, the Commonwealth has operated an extensive network of marine navigational aids around the coast of Australia, to facilitate the safe and economic navigation of vessels engaged in trade and commerce. </PARA>
<PARA> This network, which presently numbers some 387 navigational aids costing about $39 million per year, is fully financed by light dues paid by commercial shipping engaged on both overseas and coastal trading. </PARA>
<PARA> The rate of light dues is 53 cents per net registered ton of the vessel per quarter. The rate is the same regardless of the flag of the vessel or the trade engaged upon. </PARA>
<PARA> Through the efficient rationalisation of the system and the effective use of modern technology, the rate of light dues has not been increased since October 1983. </PARA>
<PARA> This represents a considerable reduction in real costs to the shipping industry. It has been achieved despite some significant investment in recent years, including in Hydrographers Passage in the Great Barrier Reef and on the North West coast of Australia. These investments have been primarily for the benefit of the bulk export trade in those areas. </PARA>
<PARA> The commercial shipping industry is closely consulted on all matters relating to the operations of the navigational aids network through the Maritime Services Advisory Committee on Navigational Safety. There are representatives of both foreign and Australian flag shipowners on this committee. </PARA>
<PARA> In recent years, the increasing complexity and variety of navigational services and aids provided to ships, and the increasing disparity between the ships themselves and the trades on which they are engaged, have thrown considerable doubt on the validity of the traditional charging methods. </PARA>
<PARA> Two years ago, therefore, the government initiated an examination of the basis of charging light dues. </PARA>
<PARA> The new rates of levy contained in the Levy Bill now before the House result from that examination. </PARA>
<PARA> Although various alternative methods of charging were considered, no practicable method of charging in terms of cargo values or use of individual aids was discovered. A levy based on the net tonnage of a ship was found to be the fairest of the practicable methods. </PARA>
<PARA> It was considered that some variation in the formula for setting dues might be feasible and consultations were immediately started with the shipping industry. </PARA>
<PARA> It was also decided that the existing exemptions for naval vessels, fishing craft and private yachts should continue. </PARA>
<PARA> During the extensive consultations with industry groups, a wide variety of options was considered. As would be expected with such a diverse range of interests, it proved impossible to reach a full consensus on the most appropriate formula to apply. </PARA>
<PARA> Nevertheless, in June this year, as part of the overall reforms of maritime and waterfront activities, the Government was able to announce the new formula preferred by a clear majority of industry representatives. </PARA>
<PARA> Under the new formula, the rate per net ton is reduced as the ship's tonnage increases. Smaller vessels will pay slightly more but the large vessels will pay significantly reduced amounts each year. </PARA>
<PARA> This will be of particular benefit to the larger bulk ore carriers which carry, in terms of tonnage, the greater part of our exports. </PARA>
<PARA> The new levy is based on a sliding scale which ranges from 33 to 63 cents per net registered ton compared with the present 53 cents per ton and will continue to be paid each quarter. </PARA>
<PARA> To illustrate, a small coastal vessel of 200 tons will pay some $20 per quarter more; a vessel of 25,000 tons will pay the same as now; and a 72,000 ton vessel will pay some $6,900 per quarter less. These represent significant on-going savings to the large bulk carriers serving our export trades. </PARA>
<PARA> The Levy Bill imposes the levy in accordance with the formula I referred to earlier. </PARA>
<PARA> It also allows the rate of levy to be varied by regulation. However, to prevent the levy being increased by regulation to a level beyond that represented by reasonable cost increases, a ceiling of 15 per cent per annum has been imposed. </PARA>
<PARA> To summarise, Mr Speaker, this Bill and its associated Collection Bill bring up to date the method of charging for the provision by the Commonwealth of navigation aids and related navigational services. While I cannot say that every sector of the shipping community agrees wholeheartedly with the formula arrived at, I can say that it represents the best compromise that could be reached. </PARA>
<PARA> I commend the Bill to the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA>MARINE NAVIGATION LEVY COLLECTION BILL 1989</PARA>
<PARA> This Bill sets out the administrative detail related to the collection of the proposed navigation levy. It broadly restates the provisions currently contained in the Lighthouses Act and regulations made thereunder. </PARA>
<PARA> Briefly, it provides for the levy to be paid quarterly to a Collector of Customs. Levy is not payable on a ship that merely calls at an Australian port for:</PARA>
<PARA> shelter, repairs or refitting</PARA>
<PARA> to take on provisions etc. </PARA>
<PARA> to change crew or to land a crew member for medical treatment. </PARA>
<PARA> The regulations may exempt ships from the levy. Regulations under the Lighthouses Act 1911 already exempt certain kinds of ships from light dues. Honourable members will find a list in the Explanatory Memorandum accompanying the Bill. It is intended that regulations under the Levy Collection Act will, at least for the time being, provide similar exemptions. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill provides also for the repeal of superseded provisions of the Lighthouses Act 1911. It also does not perpetuate an archaic provision of the Lighthouses Act that permits a Collector to distrain goods and equipment aboard a ship and sell them to pay dues. </PARA>
<PARA> I commend the Bill to the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA> Debate (on motion by Senator Tambling) adjourned. </PARA>

<PARA> The speeches read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA>COMMUNITY SERVICES AND HEALTH</PARA>
<PARA>LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (No. 2) 1989</PARA>
<PARA> This Bill will amend the Aged or Disabled Persons Homes Act 1954, the Aged or Disabled Persons Homes Amendment Act 1989, the First Home Owners Act 1983, the Health Insurance Act 1973, the National Health Act 1953 and the Nursing Homes Assistance Act 1974. </PARA>
<PARA> The major purpose of this Bill is to enable the residents' rights initiatives to be implemented in nursing homes and hostels. The Bill also:</PARA>
<PARA> Removes the necessity for a medical certificate for nursing home admission;</PARA>
<PARA> Allows for back dating of domiciliary nursing care benefit in certain circumstances;</PARA>
<PARA> Provides for proprietors of nursing homes to be approved operators;</PARA>
<PARA> Provides for lodgement and processing fees for reviews of budgets or deficits of certain nursing homes; and</PARA>
<PARA> Includes certain minor amendments consequential to the implementation of new respite care arrangements in nursing homes. </PARA>
<PARA> These measures are based on the Government's social justice policy and continue the reform strategy in the aged care program with particular emphasis on ensuring access and equality, promoting equality and providing opportunities for full participation in Australian society. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill also includes amendments to:</PARA>
<PARA> The First Home Owners Act 1983</PARA>
<PARA> The definitions of ``proprietor of a laboratory'' and ``officer'' of the health insurance commission</PARA>
<PARA> Restrict entitlement to Medicare benefits of certain diplomatic representatives</PARA>
<PARA> The administration of the vocational register of general practitioners</PARA>
<PARA> Various arrangements of the pharmaceutical benefits scheme</PARA>
<PARA> The major purpose of the Bill is to introduce new provisions which give effect to the rights and responsibilities of residents of Commonwealth funded aged care facilities. The Bill provides for a `charter of residents rights and responsibilities' and an agreement between a resident and a proprietor of a facility, based on the charter. The Bill strengthens the legislative provisions for preserving those rights by improving access by authorised persons to facilities, residents and staff. The Bill also seeks to make available information about the standard and general nature of services provided by a particular nursing home or hostel to enable consumers, the elderly or their friends or relatives to make informed choices about suitable care and to encourage high quality care. </PARA>
<PARA> In 1986 the nursing homes and hostels review recommended a major program of aged care reforms aimed at providing better quality care and a greater range of choices for frail aged people. The first four reform stages were concerned with the rational use of resources, more effective planning, equitable distribution of funding, effective assessment and equity in care provision. </PARA>
<PARA> The fifth state of the reform process was heralded by the release of the report Residents' Rights in Nursing Homes and Hostels in July this year. </PARA>
<PARA> In the minds of many people, older members of our society are seen as a group, rather than as individuals. They are often considered to be without influence and dependent on the good will of others. Consequently, they are devalued and may become even more vulnerable to harassment, threats and even physical violence. Older people are also commonly victims of a patronising approach which sees all people over a particular age as unable to make decisions and needing assistance with every task. </PARA>
<PARA> Many older people have accepted this negative view of themselves and have become resigned to being isolated and lonely. We must not accept this situation as inevitable. Governments have a responsibility to both enforce rights and educate and inform in relation to those rights. </PARA>
<PARA> Residents' Rights in Nursing Homes and Hostels was the final report of the consultant commissioned to identify the issues that concern residents of nursing homes and hostels and to examine the attitudes and approach of nursing home and hostel proprietors and staff to residents of those facilities. </PARA>
<PARA> Four major problems were identified in the report-residents' feeling of isolation and boredom; the lack of control that residents feel they have over their own lives; the absence of information about available services; and the fear of retribution if any complaint is made. </PARA>
<PARA> These problems are ones which should be of concern both to service providers and to the community in general. </PARA>
<PARA> I will not go through the report's recommendations in detail. Instead I will refer to the major changes flowing from the report which the Government, in the 1989/90 budget context, has announced as priority initiatives for implementation over the next four years. </PARA>
<PARA> The priorities in 1989-90 will be to implement:</PARA>
<PARA> A charter of residents' rights and responsibilities and a resident/provider agreement by 1 July 1990. The standard agreement would be implemented in respect of new residents only from 1 July 1990 and a later date will be negotiated with the industry for completion of agreements with existing residents. </PARA>
<PARA> The establishment in each State and Territory office of the Department of Community Services and Health of an effective unit to receive and follow-up complaints from residents or their representatives. </PARA>
<PARA> Commonwealth funding for independent advocacy and mediation services in each State and Territory to take up grievance issues on behalf of residents. It is likely that most will be operational in the latter part of 1989-90. </PARA>
<PARA> A community visitors scheme to enable residents to have greater access to their local community and to provide residents with information, support and advice. It is anticipated that the scheme will be implemented first in Queensland and Victoria from April 1990. </PARA>
<PARA> A comprehensive information strategy to enhance the awareness by residents, potential residents and the community generally, of care options and the key issues to be considered in choosing the right type of care. </PARA>
<PARA> Before action is commenced to implement these initiatives there will be extensive consultation with the industry, consumers and staff groups. </PARA>
<PARA> I would now like to outline the provisions in the Bill to enable the residents' rights initiatives to be implemented. </PARA>
<PARA> While the residents' rights report makes a large number of recommendations for change, it recognised that it is also critical to change the attitudes of our society towards the aged as well as those of consumers, staff and management. The proposed amendments to the Aged or Disabled Homes Act 1954 and the National Health Act 1953 contained in this Bill will provide the framework within which residents' rights issues can be addressed, and thus continue the process of positive change. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill provides the Minister with the power to formulate a statement or charter of the rights and responsibilities of the residents of approved nursing homes and hostels. The charter is a broad statement of principle which will emphasise rights of choice, access to services, rights to independence, participation and involvement in all aspects of daily life, and access of the residents to their own records. It will also state the responsibilities that residents, as adult members of society, should meet in their daily lives, including respecting the rights of others. </PARA>
<PARA>The Residents' Rights report suggested that there are a number of advantages of a charter. </PARA>
<PARA> `A Charter provides residents with a sound basis for any negotiations with management around particular issues . . . also, it provides a sound basis for the quality of care which management are endeavouring to provide. It is a useful tool for informing residents about what they can expect in a facility and for educating new staff members on the nature and type of facilities they have jointed.'</PARA>
<PARA> The charter, along with the proposed agreements, will establish the concept of residents and proprietors being equal partners. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill also provides for the adoption of contractual arrangements or agreements between nursing home residents and proprietors, as a condition of funding. The entering into of agreements as a condition of funding has already existed in hostels since January this year and this Bill will simply extend the arrangements to nursing homes. </PARA>
<PARA> The implementation of a standard residents' agreement between nursing home and hostel residents and proprietors is considered essential. The Residents' Rights report stated that, currently, entering into formal legal arrangements between residents and management is not a common practice. This means that neither party has a clear definition of their full rights and responsibilities towards the other party and there are no clearly defined paths to protect those rights and responsibilities. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill also provides for situations where the resident either does not wish, or is not capable of entering into an agreement or is not able to be represented by either a guardian or person holding power of attorney. This is particularly relevant in nursing homes where a significant proportion of residents are unable to manage their own affairs as a result of dementia or similar conditions. These residents are entitled to the same consideration as others, and the Bill provides for them to be cared for in the same manner as those residents for whom there is an agreement in place between a resident and the proprietor. In situations where there is no agreement between a resident and the proprietor, the proprietor will be required to comply with conditions set down by the Minister in a notice in writing. The conditions would be consistent with matters covered in the agreement. </PARA>
<PARA> While the proposed amendments provide the Minister with the broad power to determine a common or standard form of agreement to be entered into between residents and proprietors, it is envisaged that the agreement will be consistent with the charter and will cover:</PARA>
<PARA> fees and financial information</PARA>
<PARA> service provision</PARA>
<PARA> security of tenure</PARA>
<PARA> participation in decision making, and</PARA>
<PARA> dispute resolution</PARA>
<PARA> The resident and proprietor may add to this if they so wish, so long as the intent of the standard agreement is preserved. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill also proposes amendments to provide Commonwealth Officers and other authorised persons with greater access to nursing homes in the performance of their duties. </PARA>
<PARA> Currently Commonwealth Officers who monitor standards are authorised under section 42 of the Act to enter the premises and access only the documentation related to the operation of the premises as a nursing home. The proposed amendment will extend authorised access by Commonwealth Officers to include residents and staff of the nursing home and to documents related to the provision of care. The proposed authorisation does not imply that residents or staff will be coerced into talking with officers but merely enable officers to have access to such people. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill also facilitates access to residents, staff and documents by those Commonwealth officers who review the degree of care, required by residents and verify the level of subsidy payable. At present access for the purposes of review of resident classifications is not guaranteed. Consequently if a nursing home denied access, no reviews could be undertaken. This means that potentially a nursing home could gain excess benefit by classifying its residents into unjustifiably high categories of relative service need but that the Department of Community Services and Health would not be able to challenge these classifications. </PARA>
<PARA> As a key initiative to provide the more isolated residents of nursing homes and hostels with support, advice and links to the external community, the residents' rights report recommended the establishment of a community visitors scheme. Under this scheme, people in the community with spare time and an interest in aged care will visit an allocated nursing home and hostel at least once a month. For this they are to be paid a special honorarium ($600 per annum based on $50 per monthly visit). The Bill makes provision for the Minister to designate people as community visitors and to describe their role and also provides them with access to a nursing home and its staff and residents to perform their function. Community visitors will be selected and trained on the basis of the sensitive and critical function they will be required to perform. </PARA>
<PARA> Under another initiative, advocacy services are to be established in each State and Territory. Advocates will be employed by appropriate organisations to speak on behalf of residents and uphold their rights and interests in grievance situations. The Bill therefore makes provision for advocates to have access to nursing homes and their residents to perform their function. </PARA>
<PARA> A further proposed amendment of the Bill is to give the Minister authority to publish information on specific aspects of a nursing home or hostel. The purpose of publication is to assist residents, potential residents and their representatives to select a nursing home or hostel suited to their needs or wishes. The information itself will relate to the quality of life for residents and to details about the facility's location, size, fees and method of operation. The information relating to residents' quality of life will be based on compliance with standards determined by the Minister. This information will assist intending residents to become aware of the quality and level of support available, will allow the many good nursing homes and hostels to promote their facilities and serve as an incentive for the few low standard facilities to provide a better service. The legislation provides a time period for proprietors of facilities to comment on the information prior to it being published and it requires the Minister to change the information before it is published where such comments are considered warranted. </PARA>
<PARA> The publication of information about residential aged care facilities is a major step forward in promoting the residents' right to know about the facility they live in, the public's knowledge of the care provided for the older people in their community and the high quality of care provided by most service providers. </PARA>
<PARA> As I have shown, the residents' rights amendments go a long way towards enabling the frail aged in nursing homes and hostels to be protected and addresses the major concerns identified by the residents themselves, namely those of isolation and boredom; lack of control over their own lives; absence of information about available services; and fear of retribution if a complaint is made. </PARA>
<PARA> I would now like to outline various amendments to other provisions relating to the residential aged care program. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill also makes the provision of a medical certificate optional rather than mandatory for the purposes of considering an application for nursing home admission. Currently medical practitioners on geriatric assessment services with the delegation to approve nursing home admissions are required to provide the medical certificate required on the application form, as well as actually approve the application. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill will allow these delegates to make decisions on nursing home admissions even though no medical certificate is provided, thereby simplifying procedures for nursing home admission. However where a certificate is provided, the Bill requires that it be taken into account. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill also allows backdating of approval of a domiciliary nursing care benefit (DNCB) application in certain circumstances. </PARA>
<PARA> Currently the date of effect of an approved DNCB application cannot be a date earlier than the date on which the application was received in the department.</PARA>
<PARA> A number of applications, for reasons beyond the direct control of otherwise eligible applicants, have been delayed before reaching the department. These delays have disadvantaged some applicants and have occurred for a variety of reasons. For example, completed applications have been mislayed or delayed by medical practitioners or registered nurses or completed applications have been lost in the mail. Previously, act of grace payments were made in some of these cases. The amendments in the Bill will allow for processing in these circumstances. </PARA>
<PARA> It is intended that prior to any decision to backdate an application, supporting statements from the doctor and the nurse will be required indicating that they had completed the requisite certifications and advising the date or dates on which this occurred. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill also provides for the Minister to approve a person as an approved operator of a nursing home for the purposes of receiving Commonwealth payments under the National Health Act 1953. The Bill also provides for the Minister to revoke approvals. </PARA>
<PARA> These powers are considered necessary by the Government because of the nature and vulnerability of aged persons. In addition under residents' rights proposals in the Bill, residents will be entering into contracts with proprietors, who must be acceptable for the purpose of operating a nursing home. </PARA>
<PARA> Further, the amending legislation will assist in removing underlying concerns about some care providers, particularly former proprietors who, having previously treated residents poorly and failed to meet the required care standards, or engaged in fraudulent practices, are now seeking to return to the industry, for example by purchasing an existing approved nursing home. Present Commonwealth approval controls do not provide adequate cover in circumstances involving sale and purchase of nursing homes. </PARA>
<PARA> The powers provided in this Bill will ensure that Commonwealth funding approvals are granted to persons who will properly meet the responsibility for the care and accommodation of an extremely vulnerable group of people. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill also provides for the Minister, when approving a person as an approved nursing home operator or revoking such approval, to have regard to principles. These principles, which will be subject to parliamentary scrutiny, will cover such matters as the character and reputation of the person, the ability, willingness and expertise of the person to provide adequate nursing home care and meet the special care needs of nursing home residents; the ability to effectively financially manage a nursing home and the capacity and willingness of the person to comply with conditions of approval of a nursing home for Commonwealth funding. </PARA>
<PARA> It is provided in the Bill that a person who is dissatisfied with a decision to refuse or revoke approval may seek a review of a decision through the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill provides for existing proprietors of approved nursing homes and persons who have been granted approval-in-principle to construct a new nursing home or transfer nursing home beds, to become approved operators automatically under the legislation. Such approvals are of course subject to the revocation of approvals provisions if a person was found to be unsuitable to be a proprietor. </PARA>
<PARA> The Nursing Homes Assistance Act and the common form of agreement authorised by that act, permit proprietors of former deficit financed nursing homes to request the Minister to review the approved budget and operating deficit of a home for a period ending before 30 June 1987. </PARA>
<PARA> The legislation requires the request in the first instance to be investigated by a nursing homes advisory committee. These committees are established in each state to assist the Minister's investigations by providing a detailed professional and independent review of departmental decisions, where proprietors are unable to reach agreement with the Minister's delegate on the levels of approved budgets and deficits. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has become concerned at the escalation in the number of requests for review received since 1 July 1987, the date from which the Government's aged care reforms were introduced. The industry has indicated that the increase in the number of requests is largely an orchestrated form of protest against aspects of the nursing home reforms. The National Health Act was amended last year to introduce lodgement and processing fees for requests by proprietors to review nursing home fee decisions. The provisions of this Bill remove the current inconsistency between the Nursing Homes Assistance Act and the National Health Act in this regard. </PARA>
<PARA> The process of review is a through one involving the gathering and analysis of complex information. The length of time for each review varies but on average consumes almost 100 hours of public service time. In the past, the cost of a review, estimated at about $4000, has been met entirely by taxpayers. </PARA>
<PARA> There is a statutory obligation on the Minister to consider these requests for review. However, it is difficult to distinguish between protest or vexatious appeals and those which are genuine. It is in the interests of the taxpayer and nursing home proprietors with genuine grievances, to free-up the nursing homes review mechanisms by ensuring that only those cases which are genuine become the subject of review and that those appeals are expeditiously handled. There is a further need to prevent the situation from worsening by avoiding future protest or vexatious appeals against fee determinations. The government considers the introduction of a lodgement fee of $500, and an additional processing fee of $500 for each half-day a committee meets to consider an appeal, will achieve those objectives. Administration of these arrangements will be facilitated by fees being deducted from payments due to a nursing home proprietor under the common form of agreement or under the National Health Act 1953 on authorisation by the proprietor. </PARA>
<PARA> To safeguard the position of genuine appellants both lodgement and processing fees will be refunded in full where a request for review is wholly or substantially successful. Provision is also made for the lodgement fee to be refunded in full to a proprietor who withdraws a request within 84 days following a decision. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill also provides some essentially administrative amendments to the National Health Act 1953 which are consequential to the National Health (Nursing Home Respite Care) Regulations. </PARA>
<PARA> Taken together, these amendments remove the distinction between approvals for short-term respite care admission and general nursing home admission. This distinction is no longer necessary since the gazettal of these regulations has removed the need for a separate type of approval for short-term respite care. The amendments will tidy up the Act and will remove the possibility of confusion. All approvals for admission to a nursing home including for short-term respite care, now will be made under the same section of the Act. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn now to the amendments to the First Home Owners Act 1983. The Government has been concerned that whilst Australian-born citizens are ineligible for the first homes owners scheme if they have previously owned a home in Australia, migrants and also Australian citizens who have owned a home overseas are treated more favourably as any previous overseas home ownership is disregarded. For obvious reasons, it is not practicable to attempt to test for previous ownership overseas. Further, there are difficulties in applying the scheme's income test equitably as between long term residents and those acquiring a home before they have been here for a full year. </PARA>
<PARA> Clearly those with sufficient means or prospects to be able to embark upon home ownership soon after arrival are in an already strong position and stand less in need of assistance from the taxpayer. </PARA>
<PARA> Accordingly the proposed amendment requires at least one person involved in each application for assistance under the Act to have had his or her principal place of residence in Australia during the period of 12 months immediately preceding the date of home acquisition. </PARA>
<PARA> Another amendment to that Act provides for a child under the age of 18 at the date of home acquisition, or a child born during the period commencing on that date and ending at the expiration of the first anniversary of that date to be treated as a dependent child of an applicant for the purposes of the Act. Additionally the child must be in the custody, care and control of, and ordinarily residing with, an applicant for assistance under the Act at any time during the outlined period. The amendment will simplify administration of the Act as the existing references to the Social Security Act are to be deleted in favour of a test administered by the Department. </PARA>
<PARA> The last proposed amendment will overcome anomalies in the existing legislation which result in disadvantage to certain persons who purchase their homes under a terms purchase contract. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill also includes amendments to the definitions of ``Proprietor of a Laboratory'' in section 3 (1) and ``Officer'' of the Health Insurance Commission in sections 3 (1) 23dk (3) and 129aac of the Health Insurance Act 1973. </PARA>
<PARA> In 1987, new pathology arrangements were introduced to bring into effect a greater degree of accountability of persons providing pathology services, by requiring that approved pathology authorities (APAs), undertake to maintain certain standards. A failure to maintain those standards results in the possible revocation of the undertaking and the loss of eligibility for Medicare benefits for the services rendered in the APA's laboratory. </PARA>
<PARA> It has become apparent that the corporate structure of some providers of pathology services makes it difficult to identify the actual operator of the services. </PARA>
<PARA> The new definition of ``Proprietor'' of a laboratory in section 3 (1) of the Health Insurance Act will mean that medicare benefits will not be payable in respect of services rendered in an accredited pathology laboratory unless there is at least one proprietor who has effective control over the staffing, equipment and the premises of the laboratory. </PARA>
<PARA> The Health Insurance Act confers upon officers of the Health Insurance Commission a number of powers and duties in relation to the medicare program. Legal opinion is that the definitions as they stand, could be interpreted to mean the persons actually holding office under the Health Insurance Commission Act 1973-that is the members (or Commissioners) and the General Manager. This is plainly not the intention of the original provisions. </PARA>
<PARA> The proposed amendment to section 3 (1) of the Health Insurance Act more clearly defines ``Officer'' to specifically represent members of the staff of the Commission. </PARA>
<PARA> Section 23dk (3) of the Health Insurance Act requires an approved pathology practitioner to produce to an officer of the Commissioner a written confirmation concerning a pathology service. It is not intended all officers of the Commission should have this power [as would be conferred by the proposed amendment to section 3 (1)] but to confine it to the General Manager.</PARA>
<PARA> The proposed amendment to section 129aac is intended to give added confidence to medical providers at formal counselling sessions by limiting the applicability of the section to officers of the Commission who are either medical practitioners, dental practitioners or optometrists. </PARA>
<PARA> This Bill will also insert a new clause which will restrict entitlement to Medicare benefits to those diplomatic representatives, their staff and families of countries whose Governments have with Australia an agreement under section 7 of the Health Insurance Act which specifically entitles Diplomatic/Consular staff and their families access to the Health Care System of the host country. </PARA>
<PARA> This amendment removes the anomaly whereby in the current Act the inclusion of `eligible overseas representatives' in the definition of `eligible person' ensures foreign diplomatic representatives and their staff are entitled to Medicare benefits while in Australia whereas Australia's diplomatic representatives in the other country concerned may not be entitled to reciprocal health care privileges. </PARA>
<PARA> The proposed amendments to section 3H of the Health Insurance Act relate to administration of the vocational register of general practitioners. The amendments will require the exercise of ministerial power under that section by regulation not determination. The changes are in accordance with the commitment made to the Senate on 30 August, and again in the subsequent debate on 7 September, to make this change to the legislation ``at the earliest possible opportunity''. The proposal is consistent with the recommendations of the Senate Select Committee on Health Legislation and Health Insurance and will provide for greater parliamentary scrutiny. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill also extends the benefits of a health care card (and thus pharmaceutical benefits at the concessional rate of $2.50) to those persons in receipt of a ``formal training allowance''. This amendment simplifies the administration of the formal training allowance scheme and gives those persons the same entitlement as those receiving either unemployment benefits or a job search allowance. </PARA>
<PARA> This provision is to apply retrospectively so as not to disadvantage persons receiving this allowance since its commencement in July last year. </PARA>
<PARA> Two clauses in this Bill provide for the linking of the relevant secrecy provisions of the Health Insurance Act and National Health Act. These amendments will improve the administration and effectiveness of both the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme and Medicare, particularly in the area of overuse and abuse. </PARA>
<PARA> Officers of the Health Insurance Commission will of course continue to be subject to the secrecy provisions of these Acts. </PARA>
<PARA> This Bill also makes a technical amendment to the provisions of the National Health Act that relates to the `Special Patient Contribution' arrangements under the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme. </PARA>
<PARA> There are at present only two drugs subject to this provision which allows for the payment of an additional charge by the patient when the drug's manufacturer disputes the price determined by the Pharmaceutical Benefits Pricing Authority. </PARA>
<PARA> Under the present arrangements, if a prescription for any quantity other than the maximum quantity, or a multiple of this quantity, is written the patient has to pay a full special patient contribution. </PARA>
<PARA> This amendment provides a simple formula for the calculation of a pro-rata special patient contribution for any quantity of the drug prescribed by the doctor and thus provides a more equitable method for calculating the special patient contribution in all cases. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill will correct an anomaly in the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme. Under the National Health Act at present, a prescription written for a patient who is entitled to free or concessional pharmaceutical benefits, must establish, to the satisfaction of the pharmacist supplying the drug, that he or she is entitled to that benefit by recording the card number on the prescription. This information may of course be recorded by the patient or any other person (including the pharmacist) acting as an agent for the patient. </PARA>
<PARA> Situations arise where persons fail to establish their eligibility status at the time of supply for a variety of reasons. Sometimes this failure arises not through oversight or carelessness on the part of the person or the agent. It could be caused by an error in the pharmacy or private hospital or because the person involved was admitted in an unconscious state, or was suffering from an illness which impaired his/her abilities. </PARA>
<PARA> It is thought that in these circumstances, it would be unjust not to allow for such persons to be retrospectively accorded their correct status and consequently, expenses incurred would be correspondingly reduced, as a consequence. </PARA>
<PARA> There is currently no provision in the National Health Act for such an adjustment to be made. This proposed amendment to the Act provides for such an adjustment on the following conditions-</PARA>
<PARA> that whether such an adjustment would be allowed would be at the discretion of the secretary of the department; and</PARA>
<PARA> that this discretion will only be exercised in relation to cases where the claimant can provide satisfactory evidence that he/she had paid for a pharmaceutical benefit at a level above that appropriate to his/her eligibility status and that this event occurred in circumstances beyond his/her control (or that of the agent's) and was not due to their oversight or other avoidable circumstance. </PARA>
<PARA>The arrangements for residents' rights, consequential upon amendments to the Aged or Disabled Persons Homes Act 1954 and the National Health Act 1953, are expected to cost an estimated $0.89m in 1989-90, $1.58m in 1990-91 and $1.75m in 1991-92. Expenditures would be incurred in relation to honoraria payable to community visitors costs relating to the preparation of statements on standards and funding for advocacy services. </PARA>
<PARA> Consequent upon the amendment to subsection 58e (6) of the National Health Act 1953 there may be a small additional cost (estimated $10,000 in 1989-90 and $20,000 annually thereafter) arising from domiciliary nursing care benefits being payable from a date earlier than the date of receipt of the application to eligible applicants whose applications have been lost or delayed through no fault of the applicants. These payments are no more than those to which the applicants are entitled under the eligibility criteria in the existing legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> Consequent upon the amendment to the Nursing Homes Assistance Act 1974, the proposed lodgment fee of $500 and an additional processing fee of $500 per half day will yield revenue estimated at $45,000 in 1989-90, with anticipated revenue of $20,000 and $5,000 in 1990-91 and 1991-92 respectively. The fees are consistent with existing provisions in the National Health Act 1953 for requests for review of nursing home fees under that legislation and will have a deterrent effect on nursing home proprietors lodging non-genuine appeals. Proprietors who have their appeal wholly or substantially upheld will have their lodgment fee refunded and no processing fee will be applied. The main Commonwealth savings will be in avoiding non-quantifiable additional costs in processing non-genuine review applications. </PARA>
<PARA> The amendments to the First Home Owners Act 1983 to impose a 12 months residency requirement for recent arrivals before they can qualify for assistance is expected to result in savings of $2m in 1989-90 and $3m in each of the three subsequent financial years. The remaining amendments to the First Home Owners Act 1983 have no financial impact. </PARA>
<PARA> There is no financial impact consequent upon other amendments to the National Health Act 1953, the Health Insurance Act 1973 or the Aged or Disabled Persons Homes Amendment Act 1989. </PARA>
<PARA> The amendments relating to pharmaceutical benefits will not result in any financial outlays. </PARA>
<PARA> I commend the Bill to the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA>BOUNTY PHOTOGRAPHIC FILM BILL 1989</PARA>
<PARA> This Bill proposes new legislation, the Bounty (Photographic Film) Act 1989, to provide bounty assistance to Australian manufacturers of sensitized photographic colour film from 1 January 1990 to 31 December 1992. </PARA>
<PARA> This legislation will remain in force for a further period of two years to 31 December 1994 for the purpose of securing the performance of undertakings under this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> The bounty arrangements contained in this legislation provide in Clause 10 for a bounty to be paid at a rate of $3.75 per square metre of silver halide colour sensitized photographic film which has been sensitized and finished in Australia pursuant to conditions noted in Clause 7, which I will discuss shortly. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government's decision to bring forward this legislation results from the Government's consideration of recent events relating to Kodak Australasia. </PARA>
<PARA> On 24 August 1989 Eastman Kodak of the United States (the parent company of Kodak Australasia) announced that it would be restructuring its worldwide operations following disappointing financial results. The restructuring taking place over the next twelve months involves the sale, closing down or re-organisation of several operating units with combined revenues of $1.25 billion and the cutting of 4500 jobs worldwide. </PARA>
<PARA> One operating unit selected for closure by Eastman Kodak was Kodak Australasia's manufacturing operations at Coburg, Victoria. </PARA>
<PARA> Kodak Australasia's Coburg operation is Australia's second largest exporter of elaborately transformed manufactures. The operation contains a major research and development, manufacturing and distribution capability employing some 1500 people. For 1989, Kodak Australasia forecast that of its total sales of $472 million, exports of $164 million will be generated. </PARA>
<PARA> The Australian operation is recognised, even by Eastman Kodak, as an efficient and world competitive operation. However, for strategic reasons, Eastman Kodak is unwilling to close down its less efficient operations in other parts of the world. For example, Eastman Kodak's plants in Europe are positioned to take advantage of the changes in 1992; Eastman Kodak is unwilling to close down its South American operations because of the existence of high tariff walls and very favourable taxation regimes; and its plants in the United States represent Eastman Kodak's corporate home base. </PARA>
<PARA> Following an initiative by the management of Kodak Australasia, an undertaking from Eastman Kodak was obtained that if Kodak Australasia could substantially improve its economic performance, Eastman Kodak would undertake to maintain and develop its Australian operations. </PARA>
<PARA> To achieve this target, Kodak Australasia undertook to deliver $20 million per annum in productivity improvements and to approach Federal and State Governments for additional temporary assistance. </PARA>
<PARA> The Victorian Government recently announced that it would assist Kodak Australasia through various measures at a level of approximately $6 million over three years. This was granted on condition that the Federal Government would provide further assistance. </PARA>
<PARA> In considering the question of whether to provide assistance to Kodak Australasia, this Government has taken into account the significant contribution Kodak Australasia has made over a number of years in the areas of wealth and job creation, skills, technology and, most significantly, exports independent of any form of Government assistance programme. </PARA>
<PARA> The signals from Eastman Kodak also suggested that a window of opportunity existed not only to overturn the closure decision but to press for a commitment to enhance Kodak's Australian operations in the Asian region, in return for temporary assistance from this government. </PARA>
<PARA> In reaching a decision to provide assistance, the government took account of the following major commitments from Eastman Kodak and Kodak Australasia. </PARA>
<PARA> First, Kodak Australasia will be retained as a manufacturing plant for colour film employing sensitizing operations for a minimum of three years and finishing operations for a minimum period of five years. </PARA>
<PARA> Second, Kodak Australasia will retain its corporate mandate as the sole producer of Kodacolour 100 colour film for Australia and at least those Asian and other markets currently supplied by the company. </PARA>
<PARA> Third, Kodak Australasia will retain its export mandate into those Asian and other markets currently supplied by the company, and be entitled to seek further export markets in these regions. </PARA>
<PARA> Fourth, Kodak Australasia will implement significant productivity improvements through award restructuring, inventory, overheads and production line improvements. </PARA>
<PARA> Fifth, in the event that Kodak Australasia does not maintain its mandate for the Asia Pacific region over the next five years, Kodak Australasia has agreed to pay back any Federal Government assistance provided. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, Kodak Australasia will be broadening its research and development activities within Australia over the next five years. </PARA>
<PARA> Any changes in Government policy that would provide a comparative financial advantage to Kodak Australasia (e.g. reduction of corporate tax rates or of tariffs on input costs) will be taken into account and any assistance provided reduced accordingly. </PARA>
<PARA> In the light of Kodak's decision, the Government favours the provision of support to Kodak and believes that a production bounty effectively incorporating the conditions referred to is the most appropriate form of assistance. This will, in the Government's view, enable the company to carry out and complete its restructuring satisfactorily, expand its export base substantially and enhance its research and development capabilities. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill contains the following substantive elements:</PARA>
<PARA> To be eligible to receive bounty under this legislation, Clause 7 requires the producer of bountiable film:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) to carry out in Australia all the sensitizing and finishing operations in respect of the film;</PARA>
<PARA> (b) to complete the finishing of the film in the first 3 years of the 5 year period to which the Act applies; and</PARA>
<PARA> (c) to be registered for the five year period to which the Act applies. </PARA>
<PARA> Clause 16 dealing with the registration of persons under the legislation, will enable regulations to be made prescribing conditions to be met by bounty claimants, including:</PARA>
<PARA> a requirement that a registered person perform finishing operations for the whole of the period to which the Act applies;</PARA>
<PARA> a requirement that a registered person maintain prescribed production levels, employment levels, and in a plant of a prescribed production capacity; and</PARA>
<PARA> a requirement that a registered person enter into a photographic industry development agreement for the period to which the Act applies, with progress under that agreement subject to an annual review. </PARA>
<PARA> Bounty will be paid on the production of bountiable film where the producer satisfies all the preconditions I have described, and where the producer lodges a claim for payment within the first 3 years of the scheme. The proposal to limit this bounty to a three year period brings this legislation into line with other pieces of bounty legislation which are scheduled to phase out by 1992-93. </PARA>
<PARA> Retaining the legislation for five years however enables the Government to recover bounty payments in the event that the requirements of the legislation, including the registration conditions to be prescribed under Clause 16, are not complied with by the intending claimant for the entire 5 year period. </PARA>
<PARA> The Comptroller-General of the Australian Customs Service is empowered to periodically monitor and audit the application of the bounty under Clauses 20 to 24 to ensure that the country is paid in accordance with the legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> In framing this bounty legislation the Government considers that its implementation will encourage the long term growth and development of sensitized film production in Australia, assist in the modernisation of plant and equipment and lead to Australia enhancing its position as a major exporter of photographic film and related products. Exports are expected to total $1 billion in earnings over the next five years. The Government is satisfied that the commitments entered into between Eastman Kodak, Kodak Australasia and the Government, and this legislation will provide a policy environment which will encourage health and efficiency in a sector vital to Australia's future growth as a manufacturing nation. </PARA>
<PARA>Financial Impact Statement</PARA>
<PARA>The amount of money available for the payment of bounty, or advances on account of bounty under this scheme, is limited to that amount which is appropriated by the parliament for that purpose (subclause 12 (2) and clause 31). </PARA>
<PARA> In announcing the bounty scheme on 31 October 1989, the Government indicated that only the first 3 years of the bounty scheme would receive an appropriation totalling up to $36 million (at an annual limit of up to $12 million). </PARA>
<PARA> The financial impact of this Bill by financial years is therefore:</PARA>
<PARA> $6 million for 1989-90;</PARA>
<PARA> $12 million for 1990-91;</PARA>
<PARA> $12 million for 1991-92; and</PARA>
<PARA> $6 million for 1992-93. </PARA>
<PARA> I commend the Bill to the Senate</PARA>
<PARA>GRAIN LEGUMES LEVY LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 1989</PARA>
<PARA> The principal purpose of the Bill is to amend the Grain Legumes Levy Act 1985 and associated regulations to allow different rates of levy to be determined for the various grain legumes covered by the grain legume research scheme. In recognition of the higher per unit value of crops recently added to the scheme, the maximum rate of levy prescribed in the Act is proposed to be increased from $2.60 to $5.00 per tonne. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill also provides for an increase in the levy rate for peanuts from $1.25 to $2.00 per tonne and changes of an administrative nature in respect of peanuts and mung beans. All changes have been recommended by the Grains Council of Australia, which is the growers' organisation defined in the Levy Act. </PARA>
<PARA> The Grain Legumes Levy Act, in conjunction with the Rural Industries Research Act 1985, gives effect to a grain legumes research scheme which is funded by a levy payable by growers on the production of certain grain legumes. The levy rate is presently $1.24 per tonne for all leviable grain legumes, which can be varied by regulation up to a maximum rate of $2.60 per tonne. Grower contributions to research by way of the levy, are matched by the Commonwealth on a dollar for dollar basis up to 0.5% of the industry's gross value of production. </PARA>
<PARA> Australian grain legume production has increased very markedly over the past decade and today makes a significant contribution to the Australian cropping industry. Moreover, the industry has developed into a major rural commodity export earner. National production in 1988/89 is estimated at over 1.8 million tonnes valued in excess of $400m. Exports for the same year were in excess of 782,000 tonnes valued at $207m. </PARA>
<PARA> Improved prices relative to cereals has been a significant factor in the strong growth in grain legume production. There is, however, increasing recognition among the farming community of the value of grain legumes as a rotational crop, both to provide nitrogen for subsequent cereal crops and to assist in the control of cereal disease. Grain legumes are thus expected to continue to play an important part in farm management, as well as broadening the market base for rural producers. </PARA>
<PARA> Reflecting the increased grower interest in grain legumes in recent years, the Government has approved a number of additions to the grain legumes research scheme. Initially only lupins and field peas were leviable under the Act. Faba beans, chick peas, mung beans, pigeon peas and peanuts have since been included. The value per unit of production of the crops added to the scheme, however, varies considerably from that of lupins and field peas. </PARA>
<PARA> The objective of the proposed amendments to the Grain Legumes Levy Act 1985 contained in this Bill is to provide for a levy determination mechanism for grain legumes leviable under the Act to more closely reflect the price received by the grower for the particular crop grown. </PARA>
<PARA> It will assist growers of all grain legumes covered by the scheme, to reach the target level of 0.5% of gross value of production which the Government considers to be the appropriate minimum level of industry contributions to research. Contributions to that level receive the benefit of full matching contributions by the Commonwealth. </PARA>
<PARA> The amendment will provide for different rates of levy to be payable on individual leviable grain legumes or groups of leviable grain legumes, by way of regulation. The maximum rate for any levy under the scheme will continue to be prescribed in the Act, but is to be increased to $5.00 per tonne as requested by the growers' organisation. </PARA>
<PARA> The first grain legume proposed to attract a separate level rate is peanuts, which for administrative efficiency, is prescribed in the legislation in this instance. The rate of $2.00 per tonne has been the subject of a specific recommendation of the growers' organisation as required by the Levy Act. Also in regard to peanuts, a change to the legislation is necessary to ensure that the levy is applied on an ``in shell'' basis, reflecting the fact that a proportion of production is sold in that form. </PARA>
<PARA> In relation to the financial implications of the Bill, the higher levy rate for peanuts will generate an estimated additional $29,700 in industry contributions to the grain legumes research trust fund in the first full levy income year. Provision has been made for the increased Commonwealth matching contribution to commence in the 1990/91 financial year, at the level appropriate to a commencement date for the Act of 1 January 1990. None of the remaining provisions of the Bill have direct financial implications. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill also provides for the addition to the scheme, by regulation, of the mung bean species Vigna mungo. The addition is necessary to ensure that all commercially grown species of mung bean are listed and thus leviable. </PARA>
<PARA> The existing Grain Legume Research Levy Regulations will be made redundant by the legislative amendments proposed and are to be repealed. The amendments provide express authority for further levy rates to be prescribed by regulation subject to the maximum rate prescribed in the Act. </PARA>
<PARA> Subject to the Primary Industries and Energy Research and Development Bill entering into force, the grain legumes research scheme will continue to be administered by the Grain Legumes Research Council. It is envisaged that the scheme would be administered in due course, as part of the proposed Grains Research and Development Corporation, reflecting the close links between cereal and grain legume crop production. </PARA>
<PARA> The commencement date of this legislation will be a date to be proclaimed. A commencement date of 1 January 1990 would accord with existing provisions of the Act and ensure that all peanuts harvested in the 1989/90 season attract the higher rate of levy. </PARA>
<PARA> I commend the Bill to Honourable Senators. </PARA>
<PARA>INCOME TAX (INTERNATIONAL AGREEMENTS) AMENDMENT BILL (No. 2) 1989</PARA>
<PARA> I am pleased to introduce this Bill, which will provide legislative authority for the entry into force of comprehensive double taxation agreements between Australia and Papua New Guinea, and Australia and Thailand. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill will also provide legislative authority for the entry into force of protocols to amend Australia's existing comprehensive double taxation agreements with France and Singapore. </PARA>
<PARA> The Papua New Guinea and Thailand agreements, which were signed on 24 May 1989 and 31 August 1989 respectively, deal with all substantial forms of income flowing between Australia and the other two countries. </PARA>
<PARA> The agreements substantially accord with other comprehensive taxation agreements concluded by Australia in recent years. The Government believes the agreements will contribute positively to the strengthening of trade, investment, and wider relationships between Australia and these two countries.</PARA>
<PARA> A feature of the agreements is that they each provide for ``tax sparing'' credit relief to be extended by Australia for tax forgone by Papua New Guinea and Thailand under specified development incentives investment. </PARA>
<PARA> Where income derived by an Australian resident taxpayer has benefited from one of the nominated development incentives, each agreement calls for the tax credit to be allowed by Australia to include the foreign tax forgone. </PARA>
<PARA> By this means, the development incentives will retain their attractions for Australian investors and allow them to compete on favourable terms with investors from other countries as they will not be negated by the imposition of Australian tax. </PARA>
<PARA> I note here that the agreements were negotiated on the basis of the existing income tax laws of the respective countries. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government recognises that aspects of proposed changes to Australia's general foreign tax credit system, which have been foreshadowed as applying from the beginning of the 1990-91 income year, could affect the practical operation of the tax credit provisions of the agreements, including the tax sparing mechanism. </PARA>
<PARA> For example, proposed income tax exemptions under our domestic law for certain dividend payments and branch profits derived by Australian companies from comparable tax countries are likely to provide at least a great relief from Australian tax, and would operate in relation to such income from foreign countries including those with which tax treaties have been concluded. </PARA>
<PARA> The protocols to Australia's double taxation agreements with France and Singapore will amend these agreements in a number of respects in relation to the prevention of double taxation and the removal of possible avenues of tax avoidance. The protocols will generally update those agreements in line with Australia's more recently concluded comprehensive tax rebates. </PARA>
<PARA> The French protocol, signed on 19 June 1989, will amend the agreement to provide that Government service pensions will only be taxed by the country paying the pension, except where the recipient is a citizen or national of the other country. As announced by the Treasurer when the protocol was signed, this measure will partially restore an arrangement previously applicable under the French agreement for retirement pensions derived before 1 July 1987. It will have effect in relation to Government source pensions derived from that date. </PARA>
<PARA> Other pensions will continue to be taxable only in the country of residence of the recipient. As a related measure, the protocol allows contributions to a recognised pension fund in one country to qualify for a purchase price offset against pension income that is taxed in the other country. </PARA>
<PARA> Of other measures of some significance, one will assist each country to apply its current domestic law provisions relating to international profit shifting arrangements and another will bring the definition of ``royalties'' more into line with Australia's income tax law and modern comprehensive taxation agreements. </PARA>
<PARA> The Singapore protocol was signed on 16 October 1989. It will operate to delete a provision of the existing agreement with Singapore under which Australia is required to provide a rebate of tax for dividends paid to a resident Australian company by a Singapore company in which the Australian company has at least a 10 per cent interest. </PARA>
<PARA> That provision is incompatible with Australia's general income tax law now that the intercorporate dividend rebate in relation to foreign dividends derived by an Australian company has been withdrawn. The deletion of that provision will be effective in respect of dividends paid after 11 March 1988, being the date of an announcement by the Treasurer which foreshadowed this change. </PARA>
<PARA> Another measure gives ``tax sparing'' relief for income which Singapore exempts, special incentive measures to promote economic development in Singapore. </PARA>
<PARA> An exchange of notes which took place at the time the protocol was signed will extend to 30 June 1987 the operation of earlier `'tax sparing'' provisions in the agreement with Singapore, after which the amendments contained in the protocol will bring new tax sparing arrangements into operation in relation to certain designated development incentives currently provided by Singapore. </PARA>
<PARA> Other amendments to be made by the protocol will modify the existing agreement in relation to taxing rights over royalties, business profits, dealings between associated enterprises, airline and shipping profits, and income or gains from property. </PARA>
<PARA> Each of the agreements and protocols will enter into force when all necessary constitutional processes are completed both by Australia and the other contracting countries. The enactment of this Bill will complete the processes required of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> The agreements and protocols will help facilitate trading relationships with the other countries but it is not possible to predict the eventual effect on the revenue. </PARA>
<PARA> May I commend the Bill to the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA>SOCIAL SECURITY AND VETERANS' AFFAIRS LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (No. 4) 1989</PARA>
<PARA> Over the last 6 years, the Federal Labor Government has reconstructed Australia's social security system. </PARA>
<PARA> Once regarded as little more than a passive payment agency, the social security system now has strong and active links to employment, training and labour market services. </PARA>
<PARA> Social security policy has become an integral part of the Government's economic, wages and taxation policies. </PARA>
<PARA> The social security, wages and tax systems have been restructured to deliver fairer and more adequate incomes to all at every stage of life. Together these systems now provide a solid base of economic security for all Australians. </PARA>
<PARA> The barriers and difficulties confronting the different groups within the social security system have been progressively identified and tackled. </PARA>
<PARA> Today's social security system offers incentives and opportunities for those of working age to move from payments, designed for short term support, back into jobs. </PARA>
<PARA> Assistance has been targeted to those most in need while administrative procedures have been constantly improved to minimise the risk of payment abuse. </PARA>
<PARA> The impetus for many of these changes has been the social security review which last year completed its historic `life cycle' examination of the system-the first time this has been done since World War II. </PARA>
<PARA> The results of our reconstruction are clear. </PARA>
<PARA> For the first time ever, Australia has a guaranteed level of income support for families with children. </PARA>
<PARA> Australia now leads the world in providing adequate, secure child support to separated parents. </PARA>
<PARA> The increasingly strong links between Australia's social security system and labour market assistance for the unemployed and sole parents are setting the pace for reform in OECD countries. </PARA>
<PARA> These links provide opportunities to participate in the mainstream of community life for people at risk of being excluded. They ensure that the community does not bear the cost of unnecessary and counter-productive welfare dependency. </PARA>
<PARA> This Bill would implement further fundamental reforms to the social security system. </PARA>
<PARA> In the 1989-90 Budget and retirement income policy statement, the Federal Government announced a fundamental restructuring of the relationship of the public pension and tax system on the one hand, and private savings and support for retired Australians on the other. </PARA>
<PARA> This restructuring will provide a sound basis of income security for the retired and for those who will retire-in the next decade and in the longer term. </PARA>
<PARA> These changes, like every element of the Government's social policies, are fully funded on introduction and sustainable in the long term. They complement the Government's reform of superannuation. </PARA>
<PARA> This Bill would reshape income support to take account of the different forms of savings available to retired people and ensure that they can live with dignity and security in their own homes. </PARA>
<PARA> Our policies will guarantee access to a fair, adequate, secure and sustainable retirement income for all Australians. </PARA>
<PARA> The most significant reform for older Australians will be a major restructuring of the overlap between the pension income test and taxation. </PARA>
<PARA> This Bill would implement our promise that, from 1991, the income test free area will be indexed annually. The free area will also be 100% tax free. Further, from 1995 no age or service pensioner-full rate or part rate-will pay income tax. </PARA>
<PARA> These plus other significant reforms to date mean that every major element of the social security system will be protected into the future by guaranteed automatic adjustment for inflation. </PARA>
<PARA> This Bill also contains carefully crafted and co-ordinated measures to provide better opportunities and incentives for self provision for the aged, the disabled, sole parents and the unemployed. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill would overhaul the interaction of private superannuation and the social security system. </PARA>
<PARA> The treatment of annuities and superannuation pensions under the income test will be brought into line with their treatment in the tax system. The Bill would exempt from the income test that part of the undeducted purchase price which represents the notional return of the after tax purchase price of a superannuation pension or an immediate annuity. </PARA>
<PARA> These changes would be complemented by exclusion of superannuation pensions from the assets test and by special rules for the treatment of immediate annuities under the assets test. This will ensure the changes have the effect of encouraging the use of private savings to provide retirement incomes-rather than becoming a vehicle for income test avoidance. </PARA>
<PARA> Labor's better incomes policy acknowledges the wide range of needs of retired and pre-retired people. This Bill would enable people who are disabled or have become unemployed before age pension age to retain the full benefit of their superannuation for retirement. Income which accrues on compulsorily preserved superannuation will be exempted from pension and benefit income tests until the pensioner or beneficiary reaches age pension age-except when the person draws on the superannuation. In those cases, the growth will be treated as income over the 12 months following the withdrawal. </PARA>
<PARA> Compulsorily preserved superannuation will be disregarded under the assets test. </PARA>
<PARA> Through our retirement income policy we will provide opportunities for all Australians to provide for their retirement. We will deliver better incomes in retirement to all Australians. </PARA>
<PARA> When the Whitlam Government was elected the age pension was only 19% of average weekly earnings. In 3 years Whitlam raised the level of the pension to almost 25%. However over the next 7 years the conservative parties in government allowed the pension to fall back to about 22% of average weekly earnings. </PARA>
<PARA> This Labor Government has steadily regained the ground lost under the conservatives. And through this Bill pensions would be lifted to more than 25% of average weekly earnings-in fact to their highest level relative to average earnings in 40 years. From April 1990, single rate pensions and benefits for people with dependants, will rise by $2 a week on top of indexation. Pensions and benefits for married people will rise by $3.30 a week on top of indexation. </PARA>
<PARA> When the department becomes aware of the death the balance of any entitlements under these new arrangements would be cashed out, as soon as practicable, to a lump sum to assist with funeral and other costs likely to arise. </PARA>
<PARA> The legislation would make it clear that where payments continue during the 14 weeks after death to an account in the name of the deceased-whether alone or jointly with the surviving spouse-the financial institution would be entitled to pay those amounts to the spouse. This will address a major practical problem that faces many newly widowed people-continuing access to their bank accounts. </PARA>
<PARA> This Bill would dramatically simplify the earnings credit-to provide extra assistance to pensioners who undertake short term jobs and to provide a springboard into employment for pensioners seeking permanent jobs-especially sole parent pensioners. </PARA>
<PARA> From April 1990, earnings credit accrual will be standardised. Pensioners will build up credit at a set rate depending on the income test free area that applies to them-this will be $40 a week for single people, $35 for each of a married couple plus $12 for each dependent child. The maximum credit will remain at $1,000. This amendment will create a more worthwhile, understandable and efficient earnings credit scheme. </PARA>
<PARA> The aged package included in this Bill, and complemented by other measures announced in the Budget, is the most comprehensive, detailed and coherent social policy development in the history of Australian Federation. It is based on the detailed work of the social security review and was crafted following extensive consultations conducted by the government on the issue. I would like to record in particular the government's appreciation of the efforts of the members of the Prime Minister's task force on retirement incomes jointly convened, by Mr Speaker, Mr McLeay, and the member for Phillip Ms McHugh. Their efforts and the efforts of the thousands of retired people who spoke with them ensured that this package is a package for the long term. </PARA>
<PARA> It is with deep regret that I record that the Opposition has still not committed itself to the long term commitments in this policy-the indexation of free areas in 1991 and the removal of all age and service pensioners from the tax system in 1995. </PARA>
<PARA> A retirement income policy must be stable and long term. If the Opposition is serious about all Australians having adequate incomes in retirement, if they are serious about enhancing our national savings effort they will use the debate on this Bill to unequivocally commit themselves for the long term to the national retirement income policy. Their failure to do so, or any qualification of their commitment, will be a clear signal to the retired and pre-retired people of Australia about the priority the Opposition gives to better incomes for all in retirement. </PARA>
<PARA> Many provisions of this Bill which address the needs of the aged extend to veterans and their dependants in receipt of a repatriation service pension in the same way as to social security age pension recipients. </PARA>
<PARA> This Bill also provides for increases in the rates of payment of a number of minor benefits for severely handicapped veterans. </PARA>
<PARA> Over the last 5 years Labor has rebuilt the integrity of Australia's unemployment benefit system. We have fundamentally restructured the system and converted it from a passive payment system to an active system linked to labour market policies and programs designed for the broad range of people dependant on unemployment benefit. This Bill would continue with the reform of benefits entitlements that has underwritten that restructuring. </PARA>
<PARA> The labour market and income support issues facing older unemployed people are of particular concern to the government in terms of social justice, economic and retirement income policy objectives. There has been a disturbing long term trend of declining labour force participation by people aged 55 and over. Together with the retirement income policy, this Bill would provide more adequate assistance and better opportunities and incentives for regaining employment to the older unemployed. </PARA>
<PARA> First, the work test for beneficiaries aged 55 and over would be restructured-to enable older beneficiaries to retain or regain close attachment to the labour market. </PARA>
<PARA> The dynamic newstart strategy-described by the Opposition spokesman as ``spectacularly successful''-introduced in February this year allows participation in CES-approved training courses and voluntary work while unemployment benefit continues. The strategy helps the long term unemployed to get back to work. This Bill would provide the basis to extend the strategy to all older unemployed beneficiaries regardless of how long they have been on benefit. </PARA>
<PARA> Further, older beneficiaries on benefit for 12 months or more will be able to engage in training or voluntary work for even longer-for up to 26 weeks in a year. They will also be able to participate in substantial ongoing part-time employment as an acceptable alternative to the requirement to seek suitable, full-time work. </PARA>
<PARA> The maximum rate of benefit for people aged 60 or more would be aligned with pension rates after 6 months receipt of benefit. </PARA>
<PARA> The 26 week rent assistance waiting period would be abolished for beneficiaries aged 60 or more. </PARA>
<PARA> Third, people aged 60 and above who have been receiving unemployment or sickness benefit for at least 12 months will become eligible for a health benefit card rather than the less beneficial health care card which they currently have available to them. This new card will provide the full range of Commonwealth fringe benefits. </PARA>
<PARA> These measures will be complemented by a hefty boost in availability and appropriateness of labour market programs-such as jobstart, jobtrain, skillshare and the new enterprise incentive scheme-for the older unemployed. Different methods of helping and encouraging older unemployed people back into work are being trialled over the next 12 months. </PARA>
<PARA> These measures stand in sharp contrast to the Opposition's approach. The Opposition argues that all long term unemployed people should be removed from unemployment benefit and placed on special benefit-or receive nothing. Their position is also that jobstart, skillshare and the new enterprise incentive scheme-centrepieces of Labor's approach for the older unemployed should be abolished. </PARA>
<PARA> There is no doubt that this Bill-in providing for modifications to unemployment benefit to help people back to work-is inconsistent with Opposition policy. The debate on the Bill provides to the Opposition an opportunity to put down the details of how they would deal with the older unemployed. </PARA>
<PARA> Over the last 4 years this Labor Government has completely restructured income support and labour market assistance for the young. The common allowance structure-under which Austudy for young people at school is paid at the same rate as job search allowance-or JSA-for unemployed young people has removed the incentive for young people to leave school for unemployment. </PARA>
<PARA> The JSA structure has also provided an integrated basis for delivery of income support and labour market assistance. </PARA>
<PARA> The results of Labor's approach are dramatic. The numbers dependent on social security have plummetted while the proportion staying on at school has sky-rocketed. However we recognise that some young people have missed out-and so we developed the youth social justice strategy announced in the budget. </PARA>
<PARA> That strategy involves an integrated comprehensive $100 million program to address the barriers facing disadvantaged young people and to respond to the concerns about youth homelessness highlighted in the Burdekin Report. This Bill would implement the social security aspects of that program. </PARA>
<PARA> Young homeless allowance would be increased on 1 January 1990 by $7.50 a week, bringing the total payment for homeless young people to $95.10 week-and the payment will be indexed every year from then on so that it keeps its value. </PARA>
<PARA> Young homeless allowance has been subject to a 6 week waiting period. To avoid the hardship that this may cause and recognising that delaying payment cannot actually resolve family problems, the government has decided to reduce this waiting period to 2 weeks. For those who have faced a history of domestic violence, sexual abuse or other similar serious problems, the waiting period would be abolished altogether. </PARA>
<PARA> This Bill would implement an independent rate of JSA for young people who are exempt from the parental income test because of their independent status. the rate payable would be $95.10, an increase of over $41 a week. The new rate, which would be indexed every year, would be paid from the beginning of 1990 to young people who have not lived at home for 6 months, who have worked full-time for at least 13 weeks since then and who do not get any financial support from their families. </PARA>
<PARA> In addition the $25 minimum rate of JSA would be indexed on 1 January each year commencing in 1990. </PARA>
<PARA> This Bill would reinforce the government's encouragement for young unemployed people to move back into the labour force or to continue full-time studies. </PARA>
<PARA> An employment entry payment of $50 would be available to people who take up full-time employment after being on JSA for 9 months or longer. Their spouses would be eligible for the same payment which acts as a recompense for some of the hidden costs involved in taking up a job. </PARA>
<PARA> People who receive JSA or junior rate sickness benefit for 9 months before starting work would no longer have to serve the normal 13 week waiting period if they need to reapply within 13 weeks of losing benefit. </PARA>
<PARA> The newstart work test concession which is currently available to long term beneficiaries would be extended to young people who have been on JSA for at least 3 months. This would enable them to participate for a total of 8 weeks each year in CESS-approved voluntary work or short training courses. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, students who reapply for JSA or unemployment benefit within 4 weeks of attempting a return to study would not have to serve a second 13 week education leaver's deferment period. </PARA>
<PARA> In addition to this significant range of reforms for our youth, the labour market package announced in the budget continues the promotion of a more active unemployment benefit program through several innovative measures. </PARA>
<PARA> To encourage married beneficiaries and their partners to make the most out of the labour market opportunities that come their way through part-time work, the Bill would provide for them to earn a further $30 a fortnight between them above the usual $60 without losing any benefit. </PARA>
<PARA> A sole parent beneficiary whose youngest child receives JSA would receive an increase in the rate of benefit to the same rate which is paid to the sole parent of a child receiving Austudy. </PARA>
<PARA> To remove another inequity in this area, a sole parent pensioner or beneficiary whose only child attracts Austudy or a similar payment would no longer be paid the higher ``with dependant'' rate of benefit or mother's/guardian's allowance once that child turns 18. </PARA>
<PARA> To provide appropriate assistance to sole parents, formal training allowance payable for part-time training would not be counted as income under the pensions income test-bringing it into line with the way formal training allowance for full-time training is handled. </PARA>
<PARA> Recipients of unemployment benefit and JSA would be automatically issued with health care cards as from June 1990 without the need to apply a separate income test. Those beneficiaries along with sole parent pensioners who have received payments for at least 12 months would be entitled to health care cards for at least 6 months after starting full-time unemployment. This measure will remove a significant disincentive to regaining employment. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government is committed to providing adequate support for Aboriginal people in rural and remote areas. </PARA>
<PARA> Family payments at present can be made only to the immediate family or sometimes to an institution. More appropriate mechanisms may be available for Aboriginal children living in remote or isolated communities. From next year, bulk payments of family allowance at the higher rate would be available to Aboriginal community organisations which provide services of benefit to the children concerned. This arrangement would apply only with the agreement of the people concerned. </PARA>
<PARA> These measures form part of a package to lift the standard of service provided by the Department of Social Security to isolated and remote communities. </PARA>
<PARA> This Bill contains several other measures in the area of family payments. </PARA>
<PARA> From next year, parents with a child under 16 earning $100 or more a week would no longer be entitled to child payments for that child. The $100 would be indexed each year. </PARA>
<PARA> Child payments for a student child would cease when the student turned 16 unless Austudy or its equivalent was not payable. </PARA>
<PARA> Parents with children who are receiving formal training allowance would no longer be eligible to receive family payments for those children. </PARA>
<PARA> From April 1990, invalid pension would not be granted to people over age pension age. Currently, infirm elderly people who do not meet the residency requirements for age pension can gain access to the same rate of payment through the invalid pension system which does not have the same residency requirements. The amendment would reflect the clear purpose of invalid pension as a payment related to incapacity for work for people of workforce age. </PARA>
<PARA> Section 19 of the Social Security Act provides a scheme for the protection of personal information held in the social security system by making it an offence for departmental staff to record or disclose such information outside the course of their duties. Where there is a legitimate public interest reason to disclose information, those receiving it, whether officers or not, are bound by the same section 19 restrictions in passing on that information. </PARA>
<PARA> This Bill would close a loophole in the provisions which could allow people who have acquired personal information from officers acting in breach of the section, and who may in turn use or disclose that information, to do so without themselves committing an offence. Receiving, using or disclosing information concerning a client without lawful excuse or authority, or advertising or holding out that one has access to such information would be an offence under the Act. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill would continue Labor's vigilance in guaranteeing the integrity of the social security and veterans' systems. It would provide for the imposition of an interest charge of 20% on amounts defrauded from either system through major frauds. </PARA>
<PARA> I now refer to the significance of 1990 in the annals of the ANZAC tradition and to the government interest in the commemoration of this historic event which is to include a visit to Gallipoli by a number of World War I veterans. The Government is concerned to preserve the integrity of the significance of this event. Misuses of the term ``ANZAC'' have already taken place. To prevent further misuses and abuses of this sort, this Bill introduces increased penalties for the use of the term ``ANZAC'' without the authority of the Minister for Veterans' Affairs. </PARA>
<PARA> I commend the Bill to the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA> Debate (on motion by Senator Tambling) adjourned. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Last evening we commenced consideration of the appropriations relating to the Aboriginal Affairs portfolio. I had the opportunity to make some general comments about the administration of the portfolio of Aboriginal Affairs during the past 18 months. The major point I was reflecting on was that the dead hand of the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs, Mr Gerry Hand, appears to be involved in each and every one of the issues where we appear to have struck stumbling blocks or frustration. Whether they relate to the non-reply to questions on notice to the Senate or to the numerous inquiries that have been conducted across the portfolio on each and every occasion, it is easy to ascertain that most of the problems that have arisen over the last year or so have been due largely to the incompetence of the Minister or the inadequacies of his staff in his personal and private office.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I paid credit to the work under very difficult circumstances of the officers of the Department of Aboriginal Affairs and the Aboriginal Development Commission (ADC). Most of the problems that have arisen in the area of the Aboriginal Development Commission have come about since the appointment by Mr Hand, in May 1988, of a new board of commissioners, which occasioned considerable frustration and problems and has resulted in most of the inquiries by either this Parliament or the special inquiries instituted by the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke). </PARA>
<PARA> It is very interesting to note the comments that have continued to flow to Estimates Committee E from the Australian Audit Office. Over the last month, following the October 1989 Estimates, the Australian Audit Office felt it incumbent to comment in a series of letters on various pieces of evidence given to the Estimates Committee. I will draw a couple of these points to the attention of this Committee. In a letter dated 7 November, Mr J. S. O'Neil, First Assistant Auditor-General from the Australian Audit Officer, comments about the Aboriginal Benefits Trust Account and the evidence given by an officer of the Department, Mr Castine. Mr Castine had replied, as recorded at page E180 of the Hansard, that certain things had been implemented from the beginning of the calendar year. The Auditor comments that he has had an officer in Darwin very recently. He says:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . but ABTA has not yet investigated them further. Therefore the more significant defects of a lack of investment strategy and formal review mechanisms for monitoring investment performance (Audit Report No. 12, paragraph 1.3.6) have not been remedied. </PARA>
<PARA>I forwarded this letter to the Secretary to the Department following its receipt and also to the Aboriginal Development Commission because there are other comments in it with regard to that Commission. I have since received a detailed response from the Aboriginal Development Commission but have not yet had a response from the Secretary to the Department of Aboriginal Affairs. Of course, there are many other comments indicating continuing Audit concern. I believe that this chamber can well expect that, over the coming six or 12 months, we will hear a number of continuing comments and, in particular, criticisms from the Australian Audit Office as it catches up on the many areas that have come to its attention. </PARA>
<PARA> Honourable senators will also be aware that, as a result of various Senate inquiries, the issues of the Aboriginal Development Commission have been under tight scrutiny. We currently have before the Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration an inquiry into the last annual report of the ADC, which in my view was proven to be most inadequate. There have been allegations that there were forged signatures on that report and a number of gross inadequacies came about. We will, of course, see that report in due course and, as I mentioned yesterday, the Chairman of Estimates Committee E has now called for further inquiries by Senate committees in that regard. I am sure that Senator Alston, who will be following me shortly, will voice some further concerns arising from the Aboriginal Development Commission. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the questions that I placed on notice this year related to the legal costs of the Aboriginal Development Commission that were instituted as a result of an inquiry by the Senate Standing Committee on Privileges within the last year. It was ascertained that the legal costs incurred during the 1988-89 financial year relating to the privilege matter before this chamber were of the order of $160,409.30. This was for the reference that was given on 3 November 1988, and the figure relates only to the period from then to 30 June. The breakdown of these costs which related to a matter of privilege before this chamber concerning the Commission is of major concern. It is certainly one on which I will yield to my colleague Senator Alston who, as a lawyer, has taken a much closer interest in it. </PARA>
</SPEECH>
<SPEECH PAGE="3269" SPEAKER="Alston Sen R.K.R." NAMEID="LD4" PARTY="LP" ELECTORATE="VIC">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="LD4">Senator ALSTON</NAME><ELECTORATE>(Victoria)</ELECTORATE><TIME.STAMP>(9.14)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think this is a matter of considerable concern to this chamber and to the taxpayers of Australia. We are looking here at very large sums of money in terms of legal expenses. One can understand that a reference to the Senate Standing Committee on Privileges is not to be taken lightly. Indeed, given the turmoil within the Aboriginal Development Commission (ADC), the vote of no confidence in the Chairman and the allegations of various improprieties and mismanagement, it warranted serious and close scrutiny, and I think it is fair to concede that it would have required laymen to seek the advice of those with considerable legal expertise.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> But the matter that I think warrants further investigation is the question of the nature and extent of that legal advice. Of course, it is traditional, except for the very brave or foolhardy, to insist upon specialist legal representation by barristers or advocates when appearing before courts, tribunals or boards of inquiry. So I do not think anyone could be critical of counsel being retained for that purpose. But in respect of this question of privileges there was never a hearing. Therefore, the legal advice that was obtained was in respect of matters of presentation, preparations of submissions, the taking of evidence and consultations with various witnesses and advisers. It seems to me, from almost 18 years at the Bar in Victoria, that it is somewhat of a luxury to retain senior and junior counsel to undertake that sort of work. The normal role and function of counsel is to provide advice in the initial stages as a sort of general outline approach, to assess what the inquiry might be about, what the nature of the assembling of material might involve, and then to commission it, in effect. People go off and take evidence, statements and the rest and then, quite commonly, it is brought back before counsel for perhaps a day or two of fairly intensive analysis of all that has been obtained and further advice is given as to the manner of the conduct of the proceedings. </PARA>
<PARA> But in this instance senior and junior counsel seem to have been retained for a very extensive period, travelling around Australia for the purpose of various consultations and discussions. I suppose that the brevity of counsel's opinion is often in inverse proportion to the extent of the work undertaken. On the most charitable assessment, it is hardly illuminating to be told that Mr Adams, QC, charged $2,500 a day for reading documents, various consultations, conferences and tape-recordings. That description appears consistently throughout his memorandum of fees. It throws no enlightenment on the adequacy or the necessity for that work to be undertaken by, presumably, one of the leading counsel at the New South Wales Bar. </PARA>
<PARA> When one is talking about charging at the rate of $300 an hour for senior and junior counsel-this would seem to be not at the usual two-thirds rate; nonetheless junior counsel are being engaged separately and solicitors, expenses are running concurrently-one is talking about a very expensive exercise. It seems to me that this matter requires some further explanation. The notion that only senior counsel can conduct interviews and discussions seems to me to be overstating the position. It would certainly be a field day if one were at the Bar and maybe my view would be somewhat different then, but, in trying to be objective about the matter, I have to say that, when all we have in the accounts is basically general descriptions of that order without much condescension to detail, there is a need for further explanation.</PARA>
<PARA> For example, in Mr Adams's memoranda the only mention made of persons with whom he consulted seems to be of Mr Cedric Wyatt, who at one stage was the Acting General Manager of the Aboriginal Development Commission. Other than the reading of documents, conferring with Mr Howie, an instructing solicitor, and drafting a submission, there is no mention at all of any of the persons with whom conferences were held or discussions conducted. It seems to me that, if all Mr Adams was doing was reading material and talking it through with a range of people, that did not need to extend over a period of weeks, as it obviously did. The idea of charging $2,500 a day for one counsel seems to me to be verging on the extravagant. I note that there seem to have been some occasions when Mr Adams travelled interstate but did not charge an additional travel cost. On another instance, on 24 November, he charged $250 for fares but also $175 for car hire. </PARA>
<PARA> It is hard to escape the conclusion that if the client had been in the private sector, and not one of Australia's largest companies, there would have been a much greater reluctance to authorise this sort of expenditure. I think we need to know whether counsel's briefs were marked beforehand, whether there were any discussions about whether this was an open-ended commission, to what extent it would be necessary and desirable for senior counsel to conduct these conferences and discussions first hand or, indeed, whether they could not just as adequately have been carried out by an experienced solicitor from one of Australia's leading firms, Minter Ellison. </PARA>
<PARA> I have no doubt at all that under the occasional guidance of senior counsel there would have been any range of people within the firm who could have done the job just as well. Minter's, as one might expect, was not backward in rendering a bill of costs. I do not seek to quarrel with that. I do quarrel with its judgment in retaining senior counsel on what would seem to be an open-ended and pretty generous basis. It seems to me that the Parliament is entitled to an explanation. </PARA>
<PARA> When we are talking about fees in the order of $51,000 for Mr Adams, QC, and $44,000 for Minter Ellison we are talking about very considerable sums of money payable from the public purse. Given that the Aboriginal Development Commission has on a number of occasions been accused of extravagance and mismanagement, I have some sympathy for it in the sense that I do not think it really had much control over its own destiny other than the decision to seek legal advice in the first instance, which no doubt was a proper one. From then on it is basically in the hands of its lawyers. It would seem to me at first blush that the primary responsibility resides with the solicitors not only to investigate the matter fully and thoroughly but also to have very close regard to their obligation to minimise the costs. There would also be a temptation when one has a client in the public sector with very deep pockets not to be really troubled greatly by the cost factor. I think this does rebound on the client, the Aboriginal Development Commission, and the taxpayer down the line. That can then have very unfortunate consequences for the Aboriginal community, which could be regarded superficially as having incurred very large sums of expenses. We are talking about $160,000 in respect of a reference to the Privileges Committee which did not ever come to trial. That seems to me to be a very--</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="LD4">Senator ALSTON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, Mr Temporary Chairman, but I would like to take account of what the Minister says. It seems to me that his knee-jerk reaction is that somehow extravagance is the norm in the private sector. I would very much dispute that. The reality is that there are a number of commercial imperatives that bear down on open-ended extravagance on legal costs. To the extent that they do not the corporation that would normally be involved bears the brunt though its shareholders. If we are talking about the public sector somehow being different or having a licence to be as extravagant as some major corporations might be, it seems to me that the shareholders in this instance are entitled to be just as querulous. After all, one cannot simply say that no matter what it costs it is worthwhile. One could bring in any number of silks; one does not have to restrict oneself to one. One could have two or three and no juniors. One could have a bevy of solicitors or a battery of law clerks. It is not good enough to say it is a serious matter and therefore warrants endless expense. I think there is a very clear obligation to minimise the costs. That involves a decision at the outset as to whether it is necessary to retain senior counsel.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I have been involved as counsel, as I am sure Senator Durack has been, in any number of cases where I was delighted to be retained on the basis that I wandered around the country talking to various people. The question that has to be asked is whether that is justifiable and responsible. The suspicion in my mind is that if it had been a private sector client there would not have been quite the same willingness to incur this level of expenses. After all, there were people travelling to Broome. Junior counsel was retained. A Mrs Katzman went to Broome and charged $1,000 a day. There is not much explanation for how that $1,000 is arrived at. There are airfares involved. Presumably, as Senator Tate would know, Broome is not an easy place to get to. The notion of counsel being allowed to charge $1,000 a day basically to get on a plane and read some papers seems to me to be verging on the extravagant. I think it calls for further explanation. At the end of the day there may well be cogent reasons why it was necessary for senior counsel to be intimately involved at almost every stage of the process. On the face of it I can only say from my experience that in very many instances decisions are taken that senior counsel will commission work to be done by others at a much lesser expense. It seems to me that that is a proper procedure and one that if it has not been followed in this instance should be explained publicly and to the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA> I therefore seek leave to move a motion recommending that the question of legal expenses incurred by the Aboriginal Development Commission in connection with the Senate privileges matter be referred to the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;What we have here is yet another part of the vendetta that has been waged relentlessly against the Aboriginal Development Commission (ADC) and, in this instance, against Mr Adams, QC. Despite the appearance of objectivity, if we look at the history of the discussions in this chamber, in various Estimates committees and in the Committee of the Whole, we will see that there has been an animus very evident against the fact that Mr Adams, QC, has been retained by the Aboriginal Development Commission to undertake this very serious work on its behalf.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I say `serious work' because to be confronted as the Board was with the prospect of being hauled up before the Privileges Committee of the Senate is not a matter to be taken lightly. The prospect of a hearing was always there. Senator Alston informs us that at the end of the day no hearing occurred. I do not know why. Perhaps it was resolved that there was nothing in the complaint. Is that the reason?</PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="NJ4">Senator TATE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Nevertheless I do not have an immediate recollection of it. Apparently the matter could be resolved without a hearing. Senator Alston seems to suggest that because it did not get to the stage of a hearing the retaining of Mr Adams for what turns out to be steps which did not lead to a hearing but which at the time I suppose could have been thought to be preliminary steps is somehow an extravagance. The fact is that Senator Alston speaks as though the excellent firm of Minter Ellison played no part in this. According to the document I have in front of me, Minter Ellison was engaged as the solicitor. Senator Alston ought to get the facts; they might be helpful.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As to the breakdown of the costs, the Commission engaged Minter Ellison and paid them $44,712.08. So there is a little bit of new information for Senator Alston. The very firm which he said had the expertise and was the body best placed to provide the sort of advice that he thought should be provided by personnel of the eminence of those available within that firm was the firm to do so. I have no doubt that from time to time they were the ones, who indicated that it was appropriate that Mr Adams, QC, be also involved in the process of considering the matters which might come before the Privileges Committee. I am not in a position-because I did not know this matter was coming up-to say exactly how that relationship worked, but I notice that there are some coincidences of days in relation to Minter Ellison and the fees payable to Mr Adams, QC, and there are some days that are not exactly the same. But no doubt-in other words-a very eminent firm of solicitors was engaged, and they played their part, along with Mr Adams, in trying to aid the Board of the Aboriginal Development Commission in the preparation of a very serious privilege matter, which apparently was serious enough to warrant the giving of a reference, the placing of the matter before the Privileges Committee. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Alston also has to go back to the atmosphere of those days. I had hoped that we were now in a sort of calmer aftermath of the tremendous turmoil and upset that has occurred in all elements of the national administration of Aboriginal affairs. At the time of the giving of the reference, Senator Alston will recall the almost hysterical atmosphere that prevailed in this chamber in relation to these matters. It was a constant situation of Question Time being dominated, of motions being moved, of allegations that there had been breaches of privilege tumbling one after another. It is no wonder that the Board of the Aboriginal Development Commission sought to get the best possible advice. That is surely its right, surely its entitlement. All we have so far is a substitution by Senator Alston of his view as to the appropriations of the conduct of the matter by senior counsel. </PARA>
<PARA> Unless the honourable senator is alleging some sort of professional misconduct-which I do not understand him to be doing, and I take that certainly not to be the case-I do not think that he can come into the Senate and say, `I would have conducted the matter differently', or `If it had occurred in Melbourne, we would have done things differently', or `Perhaps Minter Ellison should have been engaged'-which was one of his claims. In fact the Board did engage Minter Ellison and had the best possible advice from them. What the honourable senator is really asking is that the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs further his role and substitute his judgment as to whether the fees charged by counsel in the conduct of his discussions, of his review of papers, of his dealing with questions that were raised, and of his trying to prepare and anticipate what the Privileges Committee might be concerned to investigate and follow up, were handled in a professional way. That is what it amounts to, I think. I do not think Senator Alston is saying that the Board of the Aboriginal Development Commission was not entitled to seek the best possible advice in regard to such a serious matter. He is just concerned about the costs. It seems to me that there must be other professional forums-if, indeed, there is any allegation that the costs charged were extravagant or beyond those which one would normally think to be reasonable-where those sorts of matters can be judged. As I understand it, there are such forums where the profession itself can undertake an examination of those sorts of allegations. I do not believe that the Senate Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs is such an appropriate forum. I certainly do not know whether the Chairman of that Committee, Senator Barney Cooney, has been consulted by Senator Alston in relation to the other references before the Committee and on the question of whether he or any other members of the Committee consider it an appropriate reference at this stage, or an appropriate reference at any stage. I would have thought that they would want to consider and deliberate on very serious questions before they readily accepted from the Senate chamber such a reference as Senator Alston is trying to provide to them this morning. </PARA>
<PARA> On a couple of counts I do not think the honourable senator fully understands or has knowledge of the legal advice and the sources of that legal advice which the ADC Board sought-and I refer to Minter Ellison in addition to Mr Adams-so therefore his claims are really inadequate and not well founded. I think he is asking a Senate committee to undertake a role and a task on which quite clearly it has not been consulted. It has given no indication-I do not know whether it is in a position to give an indication to the chamber-as to whether it considers it appropriate. As I say, it is just part of a continuing saga whereby the Board of the Aboriginal Development Commission, under pressure at a time of virtual hysteria in Aboriginal affairs late last year, sought the best advice possible in order to protect itself against a charge of breaches of privilege, which is something, I think, which would fill any person or any organisation which might be accused with grave misgivings and fears and which would naturally lead them to seek the best possible legal advice. That is what the Board has done, and the accounts are presented in a full and open way. They are available for some criticism, I suppose, if the honourable senator wishes to make that criticism, but I do not think he has made out any case for the matters to be referred to a committee of the Senate.</PARA>

Government has a responsibility to be scrutinising carefully the costs that are incurred. It is just not good enough-and I would not have expected it of someone with not only legal training but legal eminence and ministerial experience-to try somehow to raise the canard that because one queries costs, one is somehow questioning people's integrity or that one is indulging in another bash.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The fact is that with the best goodwill in the world, one is not entitled to a blank cheque for anything. We do not say in this place, `Because this is a serious matter, you go off and spend as much money as you like looking after yourself'. No-one says that in the private sector. One is constrained by various realities. One of those is that there is a scarce allocation of resources in government and the private sector. I find it particularly offensive for the Minister to engage in such casuistry. He misunderstood completely what I said about Minter Ellison. He said that I said Minter Ellison had played no part in this and purported to enlighten the Committee that Minter Ellison had charged $44,000. I said that 10 minutes ago. I said that one of the matters of concern was that Minter's bill was $44,000 and Mr Adams's bill was $51,000. I thought I had made it abundantly clear that it was right and proper to engage a firm of Minters considerable expertise. If any criticism prima facie attaches it is to the firm that engages counsel on an open-ended basis. </PARA>
<PARA> I am not prejudging this matter. Honourable senators may not be aware that the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs currently has before it a reference on the costs of justice. Some of Senator Cooney's colleagues, such as Senator Schacht, work themselves into a lather at every petty example of counsel charging anything more than the base rate and somehow regard this as yet another example of the greediness and grasping nature of all lawyers, Senator Cooney and me included. If they were to have their way no lawyers would be retained to represent people before courts, tribunals, boards of inquiry, special audits, privileges committees and the like. They would say that it was an unwarranted extravagance and that we were ripping off the system, no matter how reasonable we might think the charges to be. If Senator Schacht views charges of $2,500 with equanimity, I am delighted to hear it. </PARA>

I find it a matter of deep regret that somehow the mere raising of the question is treated as a slur, because it is not. We have an obligation on both sides of the chamber to be satisfied that costs incurred for which the taxpayer will be responsible are reasonable. That is all we are talking about. All I have said, without any element of prejudgment, is that the memorandum of fees rendered is inadequate to make this sort of judgment. When we are talking about $160,000, we are entitled to have a bit of detail.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> If Senator Tate is trying to run the proposition that a board of inquiry or a hearing of the Privileges Committee coming up justifies the retention of senior and junior counsel over a period of months, he is putting that sort of inquiry into a completely different category. Senator Cooney would know that just because a trial is coming up it does not mean that counsel remains involved with the meter ticking for a matter of weeks beforehand. There is a conference with counsel at which the material which has been obtained is considered; there may be the odd conference with a witness; counsel then goes away-the solicitor does the work-and goes back the day of the hearing, or maybe the day before, and has another decent conference to consider the tactics that will be applied, and in some instances decides to settle the case-in my experience, Senator Cooney was rarely interested in settling cases, certainly not for reasonable sums of money-and gets on with it. It is quite out of the ordinary to suggest that senior counsel can be retained over a period of months in the lead-up. </PARA>
<PARA> All I am saying to the Committee is that we are entitled to an explanation. I am not prejudging the matter. Senator Tate suggested that somehow I am doing that and that I want the Senate Committee to impose its judgment. That shows an abysmal misunderstanding of what is involved in the concept of prima facie reasonable. All we are seeking is some further elaboration that will satisfy us and put at rest the concerns of those who might on the face of it say that $160,000 worth of legal costs seems pretty high. Not too many cases incur legal costs of $160,000. It is not good enough to say that as this was a reference to the Privileges Committee any sum was justified. Quite clearly, some implicit restraint was exercised in that only one silk was retained. It is not usual to retain senior counsel over that length of time and we are entitled to know why that was so. </PARA>
<PARA> I would much prefer that Senator Tate resumed his usual objectivity and treated this matter seriously. It is not a question of taking sides. It is not a question of defending or attacking the legal profession. I would not have thought that I could be accused of having a bias against the legal profession. All I am saying is that in the public interest, where sums of this magnitude are involved, we are entitled to a bit more information than we have to date. </PARA>
<PARA> The material was made available to me by the Aboriginal Development Commission (ADC) with a note saying, `Given to assist the senator and to this end we waive privilege'. I do not know what that means exactly. Presumably it was to assist me to make a judgment about the adequacy of the charges. Having gone through the accounts in some detail, the most that I find is `read documents', `various conferences and consultations', `listening to tapes', `read documents', `travel to Canberra' and `various consultations and conferences'. That is about the extent of it. </PARA>
<PARA> I would have thought that a client likes to know what he is being charged for. The client may know and may have copious notes that will tell us what was going on. However, I want to know why that work could not have been undertaken by Minters. After all, Minters did something for $44,000, which is not an insignificant sum. I simply ask why senior counsel seems to have been doing what may well have been routine work that either was undertaken in conjunction with the solicitors or could have been undertaken by the solicitors instead of senior counsel. That is all we are asking. </PARA>

Being confronted by a Privileges Committee hearing is a very serious matter deserving of outside and expert legal representation. I do not quarrel with any of that. Going to Minters-I regard Minters as one of the best law firms in the land-was a perfectly proper thing to do, but that does not mean one has carte blanche and from then on goes for broke and runs up whatever amount of money one likes, irrespective of its reasonableness. The public, as the ultimate payer of the bill, is entitled to know why certain work was undertaken at a particular level. All this braggadocio in which Senator Tate engages misses the point entirely. I will give him the benefit of the doubt and suggest that it is a Pavlovian response rather than a considered reaction.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I am not seeking to prejudge anything. I hope that I have at least an elementary understanding of the matter to the point where it raises concerns that can be examined carefully by Senator Cooney's Committee. I have every confidence that Senator Cooney and his colleagues will take this on board very seriously in the context of their current inquiry. I do not think that it will involve a tremendous amount of work. It may involve mere correspondence to elucidate some of the matters of concern. That is very properly within their scope. If they choose to reject this on the basis that this is part of an unwarranted attack, they will be doing the legal system in this country an injustice and will bring into disrepute the notion of legal representation before parliamentary committees. Ultimately they will be quite counterproductive to the cause that I think Senator Cooney and I share-that is, to see people properly represented, to see them get the best possible advice and to see that the costs they have to pay are reasonable in the public interest. That is what I am concerned to see continue into the future. </PARA>
<PARA> I would not like to see a situation where there is one episode that, on the face of it, seems pretty high and to some people perhaps even extravagant, and a knee jerk reaction which says, `Oh, you are just having a bit of a bash, you are playing the man not the ball, so we will reject any reference'. All that will happen as a result of that is that the Government will be seen to have buried the issue. People will say that their concerns have not been allayed, and it will be just that much harder next time around to justify those sorts of expenses being incurred. </PARA>
<PARA> In the interests of taking a considered and responsible approach to an issue, I think it would be perfectly proper for Senator Cooney's Committee to look at the matter. It will not do it in any sort of public atmospherics; it will do it in a careful and considered manner. The people on that Committee are more than capable of looking objectively at the issue. Given that the Government is in control of that Committee, I would not have thought that there was any risk involved from the Government's point of view. No doubt the outcome will be one that I, as a member of that Committee, will be satisfied with. I hope that the Minister will reconsider his first reaction to this, look at it in the longer term and bear in mind the interests of those who one day may well require the very sort of high powered legal representation that many of us would regard as necessary. The last thing we want to do is encourage a perception that somehow, if it is the public purse, one can go for one's life; that one does not have to answer any questions or justify any bill, no matter what size it might be. If we get to that point, I can assure the Government that there will be a very serious reaction. </PARA>

When an extraordinary event involving a set of legal costs amounting to $160,000 is revealed in answer to a question on notice after the conclusion of the sitting of an Estimates committee-it has, therefore, come to the attention of the Committee of the Whole-it is appropriate for senators to draw to the attention of this chamber the nature of this extraordinary cost.

We were thorough and careful in the pursuit of the reference that the Senate gave to us. The Minister for Justice (Senator Tate) has said that there does not need to be any further investigation of this matter. I hope that the Minister is not inferring that this is not an extraordinary total bill. I hope that the Minister is not giving the impression that a bill of $160,000 for several days of legal inquiry on a matter that did not come before the Senate Committee is quite acceptable.

I said in my speech during the second reading debate on the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission Bill that I have not made such a charge before of a Minister. I make it with the greatest degree of reluctance, but I happen to be persuaded of it by the facts. The disarray in the ADC followed the Minister's ideological commitment to the pursuit of his Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission (ATSIC) legislation at all costs. What are some of the costs? Some of the costs are this $160,000 bill. The Senate is given the responsibility of examining appropriations and assessing items of appropriation. In my opinion, the Senate is not at all happy that this is one of the costs that have flowed from that disarray. </PARA>
<PARA> The root cause of these costs is the intervention by the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs, Mr Hand, into the affairs of the ADC by sacking all but two of the commissioners-persons whom he could not sack because of the terms of their appointment by the Governor-General. This caused an immediate civil war in the ADC. Is there anyone in this chamber who wants to deny that there was a civil war in Aboriginal affairs last year? The silence is very eloquent. Of course there was a civil war. Before May last year the ADC had the very clear view that the reorganisation of Aboriginal affairs by this ideological Minister was an error, that it was wrong, that it was not in the interests of Aboriginal affairs and that it was not in the interests of the people of Australia-and it had every right to hold such a view. When the Minister detected that the ADC had that view, and because the ADC is a principal witness in this matter-this was in the period before the legislation came to us for final debate; it had been referred by us to a committee, and the views of the ADC, which is responsible for the majority of programs in Aboriginal affairs, must be taken into account-the Minister pulled the political carpet from under the ADC and sacked all its members, bar the two he could not sack, and put into the ADC cronies of his own choosing who would have his pro-ATSIC view. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Teague, there is a motion before the Chair and I think you are starting to drift away from it. The motion is the one that was moved by Senator Alston. I would ask you to stick to the motion before the Chair.</PARA></TALK.START>
</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="PJ4">Senator TEAGUE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I support the motion. In the following months the new commissioners carried out the views of the Minister. They supported ATSIC. There was an entrenched war between the two whom the Minister could not sack and the officers of the ADC who had their own conscientious views-and, of course, those officers included the principal legal adviser of the ADC. In the middle of this disarray when all these costs were run up, Mr Brendan Bailey was forced to retire from the Commission. He had to leave. He retired on 13 January 1989, so there are questions to be asked as to whether there was any competent legal advice after 13 January 1989.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I note that the $160,000 bill is broadly made up of three amounts: $102,000 for legal costs arising from the defence of the new commissioners that the Minister had appointed to the ADC-$102,000 to give legal representation to those who had been pushed into office to do the Minister's bidding; $18,000 to defend the interests of the Chairman and the former General Manager of the ADC, who had the contrary views; and $41,000 to defend the interests of one person, the Secretary to the Department of Aboriginal Affairs, a person who was appointed, as Secretary to the Department, to be a new commissioner on the ADC, that is, Mr Perkins. So that is $41,000 for Mr Perkins's legal costs, $18,000 for Mrs McPherson's and Mr O'Brien's costs and $102,000 for all the new commissioners, which amounts to the $160,000 before us. </PARA>
<PARA> There has not been an explanation as to how those costs could have arisen. Putting aside the considerations of privilege-which I have already spoken about and had every opportunity to contribute to as a member of the Privileges Committee which reported to the Senate-that all stands. Without referring to anything that Senator Alston has already said about the procedures of determining responsible legal costs, that all stands. I am concerned about the unanswered questions as to how this burden on the taxpayer of $160,000 can arise and not be fully explained. I hope that the Minister is not implying that this is anything other than an extraordinary amount of money. I am not debating whether there was disarray in the ADC-there was disarray. There was a civil war between the ADC and the Department as a consequence of the determined position of the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs. </PARA>
<PARA> If this motion is not supported by this chamber because of the numbers on the other side-and I ask the Minister to consider the merits of this matter being fully resolved by an inquiry by the Senate Committee-then it is an attempt by the Government to put yet another matter under the mat so as not to embarrass itself or its Minister. It is a scandal that there has been a civil war and such total disarray in Aboriginal affairs in this nation. This kind of cost is totally extraordinary and must be fully accounted for. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am very tempted to answer some of the comments made earlier by honourable senators on the other side of the chamber on matters concerning Aboriginal affairs in general, but we have had a very extensive debate on that-one of the longest debates which has ever occurred in this Senate. I will resist the temptation yet to again defend the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs (Mr Hand). I do not think he needs further defending; it has all been put on the record and continuing smear and innuendo will not change that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> However, I want to make a very important point, and I know Senator Teague will be interested in this, as will other honourable senators. We have here a further motion to refer a matter to a Senate committee. Honourable senators will know that certainly on two occasions this week I sought the permission of the chamber for a Senate committee, because of the compression of time and pressure of business, to be allowed to sit while the chamber was sitting. Permission was rejected on one occasion, and on the second occasion it was granted for a committee to sit for half an hour. The reason is that we are rapidly running out of time. There is far too much for Senate committees to do and we just do not have the time. Honourable senators who are considering how they will vote on this particular motion should give some thought to the days and hours of sitting that this chamber has to complete before it ends its business this year, and the pressures on individual senators who not only have to serve in the chamber and on committees but also have to serve electorates. </PARA>
<PARA> This motion concerns a reference to Senator Cooney's Legal and Constitutional Affairs Committee. At the moment Senator Cooney and his Committee are in deliberations-he has just arrived in the  chamber--</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="1I4">Senator McKIERNAN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;They are very heavy deliberations, on the pilots dispute. That Committee had to get the permission of the Senate in order to meet while the Senate is in session and complete its important inquiry. I am not knocking the merits of this particular reference, but I would argue that it is a physical impossibility. I am aware of the previous inquiry conducted by Senator Cooney's Committee, a committee of which Senator Alston is a member. Its report entitled Company Directors Report on Social and Fiduciary Duties and Obligations of Company Directors was brought down in this chamber earlier in the week. I am aware of the difficulties that the Committee had in meeting the deadline that the Senate itself imposed upon it. Quite frankly, I do not think that enough thought has been put into the demands that are made of senators, committees and the chamber as a whole when we move to refer things to committees with deadlines-in this case, the first day in March. Some senators not only want but absolutely need a break, and I suggest that many of those senators are members of that Legal and Constitutional Affairs Committee, which is so well chaired by my eminent colleague Senator Cooney.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I regard this morning's performance by Senators Tambling and Alston as absolutely disgraceful. It is a continuation of the drama of theatre rather than being concerned about the issues. I concede that the question of costs in any particular matter is one of concern to the Australian community and of obvious concern to the Senate, and hence a general reference was given to the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs. I talked about animus before-and I do not say this of Senator Alston, who has obviously been brought in to do a job, as Senator Barney Cooney quite often is by us, and act in a very professional and reasonable way at the tail end of a debate when all of us have exhausted our histrionics and hysteria in this chamber as parliamentary performers. But the fact is that the only counsel he mentioned was Mr Adams-a person who has been denigrated in this chamber before and has been the subject of comment by senators on the other side of the chamber in the Committee of the Whole, as I recall. There was no mention of the $7,500 paid to Mr Ellicott, QC; no mention of the $9,000 paid to Professor Jack Richardson; and no mention of the $4,000 paid to Chester Porter, QC. All the attention was focused on Mr Adams.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="NJ4">Senator TATE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;No, but Senator Teague gave the name to Senator Alston, and that is the person he mentioned when he moved the motion on behalf of Senator Teague. The fact is that the Opposition has zeroed in on one counsel but at least three other counsel have been paid very considerable amounts of money. Without saying anything adverse about Senator Alston-I think he was acting on instructions-he could have given an impression of greater objectivity on the other side if he had mentioned the other counsel.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> But that is not my real complaint. My real complaint against Senator Tambling is that last night we had three or four conversations about the progress of these Estimates through the Committee of the Whole. We had several discussions about what subject matters might come up this morning and the pace of proceedings so that, if he wanted information, I could get it from officials. Never once did he mention this matter. It was sprung on us 10 minutes into the debate this morning. It has obviously been prepared; it is in typewritten form. I am sure we could have been informed of this last night and had conversations with the Chairman of the relevant Senate Committee in order perhaps to come to some better understanding of what is sought and whether the Senate Committee could take it on in the context of its larger reference. </PARA>
<PARA> What we have here is just a continuation of the constant theatre. I did use the word `vendetta'. I am not sure that that is an inappropriate word in relation to these matters. I have since been informed that Senator Cooney is of the view that the matter could be dealt with by the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs, given the larger reference that it has. He is not happy that this has been foisted on him, and I am sure the other Committee members will not be happy that this has been foisted onto the wider inquiry. In deference to the expression of consent by the Chairman of that Committee, I am prepared to indicate that the Government will not oppose the motion. But I hold to the view that this could have been handled by Opposition senators in a much more professional way than the deceitful and theatrical way it has been handled in this morning's proceedings. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am indebted to the Minister for Justice (Senator Tate) for his indication that the Government will not oppose the motion. I just want to say a couple of things by way of explaining my position. It needs to be understood that I had not heard of Mr Adams until I saw these documents. I am not aware of any previous attacks on him, about which Senator Tate is obviously exercised. Any vendettas that may have been conducted previously against Mr Adams or anyone else have taken place without my knowledge. Senator Tate asked why I focused on Mr Adams and not on Messrs Ellicott, Richardson and others. I have the answer that Senator Tate also has, which sets out some totals, but I know nothing more than that Professor Richardson charged $9,000 and the account is dated 20 April. That is meaningless to me.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> But, as a result of a request for further and better particulars from the Aboriginal Development Commission (ADC), it has provided me with quite a substantial wad of papers. Those papers relate only to Mr Adams and junior counsel, Mrs Katzman. It is on that basis that I have expressed the concerns that I have because I regard those accounts as inadequate as all they do is talk in the most general terms about various consultations and conferences. That is what really exercised my reference to the Committee. I am glad that the Minister has calmed down sufficiently to allow that inquiry to be undertaken. It does not need to be an extensive inquiry; the matter may well be resolved by an exchange of correspondence. </PARA>
<PARA> It is quite unfair for the Minister to suggest that somehow we were selective in our choice of Mr Adams and Mrs Katzman and that we omitted to mention the others. I know nothing at all about the other accounts; that should be pursued separately. I do not suggest that the Senate Standing Committee concentrate only on the accounts of Mr Adams and Mrs Katzman. All of those items should be investigated in more detail. But, having obtained a level of further detail, it was my judgment that that was inadequate to make any sensible judgment of whether those costs incurred were reasonable. It is simply on that basis that Mr Adams and Mrs Katzman have been the primary focus of attention in this debate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I certainly did not anticipate that the debate on that topic would take the time that it has. The time has really blown out due to the reaction and response of the Minister for Justice (Senator Tate) to the initial comments raised by Senator Alston, which were very professional, very reasonable and a proper request. However, before going on with other comments, I reject totally the Minister's assertion that I or the Opposition senators have conducted a vendetta in this portfolio. My objectivity in this regard since I became very active in the portfolio in October 1988 has been continually one of accountability and efficiency of a portfolio. As Senator Teague has said, the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs (Mr Hand) has continually caused the agitation of problems that have continually needed further scrutiny by the Senate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Minister would probably not concur with this, but I believe there should be a royal commission into the whole portfolio. Whilst there has been a plethora of inquiries and reviews and we now have a new mechanism, the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission (ATSIC), coming into effect, when one considers that some 600 questions were asked in this year's consideration of the estimates-we should study in detail the index of those questions and compare them with previous years-one cannot help but be amazed at the continuing problems in this portfolio because of the lack of ministerial control and direction. </PARA>
<PARA> I will take another general issue first and then proceed to several points of detail. During the recent hearings of Estimates Committee E I requested that certain witnesses be brought before the Committee. The Committee, as a result of the casting vote of the Australian Labor Party Chairman of that Committee, decided that it was not appropriate for officers of the Northern Land Council to be brought before the Committee. The Minister certainly concurred with my request for officers of the Aboriginal Benefits Trust Account to appear, and I appreciate his reaction and response in that regard because it was most helpful. In the area of the Aboriginal Benefits Trust Account and the administration of land councils, we certainly ascertained a number of very important issues, which are highlighted in the report of Estimates Committee E. </PARA>
<PARA> However, the issue of the calling of witnesses was contentious. The Labor Party chose to use its numbers on the Committee and the result is recorded on pages 5 and 6 of the Estimates Committee E report. However, since that time it has again been necessary to look at the issue carefully. I am aware that the Clerk of the Senate, Mr Harry Evans, has had an exchange of correspondence with the Chairman of the Committee, Senator Michael Beahan. For the record, it is important that the exchange of correspondence become available and official. I seek leave of the Committee to table that exchange of correspondence. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="6E4">Senator TAMBLING</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I turn to the more specific matters of the Aboriginal Benefits Trust Account and land council administration. History will show that the very measures that I continually use on the portfolio, accountability and efficiency, point to the need for a more independent inquiry. If the Minister does not take note of them much more seriously than he has in the last two years, the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) will again have to force an inquiry on him because of the events that will take place in the next few months. Alternatively, there may be a need for a royal commission.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The funds flowing from the Aboriginal Benefits Trust Account to the land councils are special appropriations and are in effect the mining royalty equivalents. Even so, they have already been commented upon in a very graphic report by a consultant to the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs, Mr Crough. Honourable senators will recall that I tabled a copy of that report some time ago in the Senate. It had been made available to me, although not by the Minister. It is obvious from the Crough report and from information that we ascertained during Estimates Committee hearings that the Aboriginal Benefits Trust Account has been eating into its capital base in order to meet the increasing demands of the two major land councils. The situation as revealed by Mr Crough's report is serious. The Estimates Committee intends to keep this matter under review at future hearings. </PARA>
<PARA> Earlier today with respect to comments of the Australian Audit Office I commented that some of the information which was given to us by an officer of the Aboriginal Benefits Trust Account and a Department of Aboriginal Affairs officer did not accord with the information available to the Australian Audit Office. That means that future Estimates committees will have to keep the matter under review. By the end of the current financial year some $85m will have passed through the coffers of the Aboriginal Benefits Trust Account. By far the largest proportion of that has gone on the administration of the Northern and Central Land Councils. The Northern Land Council has obviously had major financial problems for the last year or so due to its administrative incompetence. Again, in this regard I sheet the blame home to the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs, Mr Hand, because through the entire saga of his promotion of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission and various other changes he has topped up the funds to the Northern Land Council from the Aboriginal Benefits Trust Account in an unprecedented manner. </PARA>
<PARA> The historical records to be found in the Hansard reports of the Estimates Committee hearings and Hansard records of the other occasions on which I have tabled information show that the Minister has to a large extent used top-up funds to provide for the administrative mechanisms of the Land Council. This has happened at a time when the Department and the Aboriginal Development Commission have been under tremendous administrative pressures and have experienced many problems. The Minister has used these moneys by directing them through the land councils to give him access to an alternative bureaucracy both for political advice and for stratagems in seeking to communicate with Aboriginal people in the Northern Territory. It has created huge divisions and tensions in the Aboriginal constituency in the Northern Territory. It has created huge chasms that I believe need never have been created, particularly in view of the functions of the Land Council. </PARA>
<PARA> The Director of the Northern Land Council bureau, Mr John Ah Kit, and I have been engaged in what could be described only as an interesting press exchange for the past few weeks with regard to the issue of administrative incompetence. My statements in the media and in other public places have been based on information that has been provided to me by the Department of Aboriginal Affairs through Estimates Committee E. Unfortunately, Mr Ah Kit has chosen to use figures that are not as comprehensive as those to which I have access through the Estimates Committee. For example, the 30 June 1989 audited report of the Northern Land Council is with the Council and Mr Ah Kit himself has acknowledged that it will be tabled in the Parliament by the end of this sitting. I certainly hope that he has consulted his Minister and that the Minister intends to honour the undertaking given by Mr Ah Kit because in the last few years those audit reports have been kept away from the Parliament until well into the following financial year. It has been acknowledged that the report is currently with the Northern Land Council and that it contains considerable qualifications and reservations with regard to the financial estimates to 30 June. Therefore, the report is very important and should be tabled so that the full position with respect to the Land Council's financial situation can be fully understood. </PARA>
<PARA> In the hearings of the Estimates Committee Mr Beadman acknowledged that there were considerable problems as at 30 June. I am led to believe that at that date the indebtedness of the Northern Land Council was some $1.6m. Since then, Mr Ah Kit has publicly acknowledged that the indebtedness is $1.2m, but he has totally ignored the indebtedness for holiday pay, sick pay, accrued leave, and all the other employee benefits of some $400,000 of the Northern Land Council. Fiddling with figures and misleading people is most dangerous. We therefore need on the table that fully audited report of the Northern Land Council. </PARA>
<PARA> For the last couple of years the Northern Land Council has received $7m per annum from its usual funding source as well as its ministerial discretionary grant top-up funding. The results of the work of the Northern Land Council have not been in any way a reflection of that funding. I have continually called for inquiries into the Land Council, but have been disregarded. The Minister has certainly not come back to me and Mr Ah Kit seems to be hiding from the issues I want addressed. I refer, for example, to the cost and extent of the Northern Land Council's political activities since Mr Hand was appointed the Minister in July 1987. I also refer to the administration of the extensive Land Council trust funds, particularly those relating to mining royalties, particularly as in the last few annual accounts of the Northern Land Council it is acknowledged that only cost accounting figures are shown with regard to the trust accounts. There is no accounting on a proper accrual basis of trust funds which the Northern Land Council administers for the some 50 Aboriginal communities in the Northern Territory. Funds have been used to fund protest rallies; for extensive travel of members from the Northern Land Council and other people from the communities to Darwin; and for entertainment expenses accrued by the Northern Land Council at hotels such as the hotels at Nhulunbuy, Katherine and Darwin where various rallies and other functions have taken place. </PARA>
<PARA> The Northern Land Council has not been held accountable for or given information in respect of its motor vehicle fleet. Senior officers drive around in turbo-charged four-wheel drive vehicles and special vehicles are purchased for the Chairman's friends and other people to use. Mr Ah Kit says there has been some rationalisation lately in this area, but that does not give accountability for what has gone on in the last two or three years. The Northern Land Council has also become involved in a number of proposals for commercial operations which, I would argue, are much more appropriately the functions of the Aboriginal Development Commission. In all these areas, we seek accountability. The land councils need to be put under constant and thorough review. Close scrutiny must be made of them. </PARA>
<PARA> I invite the Minister to explain what action has been taken with regard to the tabling of the audited financial statements for the Northern Land Council for the financial year ending 30 June, which I am aware are with those councils or the Minister; the Touche Ross report, which the Minister has subsequently instituted as a degree of consultancy to himself, with regard to the NLC's administrative and financial problems; and the fortnightly departmental reviews that it was acknowledged are being undertaken. The Department currently has, I believe, some seven members of staff sitting in the offices of the Northern Land Council to hold its officers' hands and help them administer themselves out of this problem. They are issues that need to be acknowledged. This Senate needs to know when those reports and the answers to the questions that I have had on the Notice Paper for several months in this regard will be properly addressed. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am advised that on 15 November, which is only a few days ago, the Department of Aboriginal Affairs received, I think, a faxed copy of the audited financial statements of the Northern Land Council (NLC) for the financial year ending 30 June 1989. Those statements show that at that date the NLC had a bank overdraft of $787,687 and $455,154 owing to creditors, a total of $1,242,841. The total working capital deficit, which includes allowances for provisions such as staff annual leave, fares and long service leave, amounts to $1,519,909. I emphasise that obviously this is as at the end of the financial year, 30 June 1989.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As to the current situation, the Minister prefers to wait until he has received information from the Touche Ross consultant who is assisting the NLC in measures to reduce the deficit. He is aware that the NLC has given priority to cost cutting initiatives in which it has the support of its full Council. At this stage of the consultancy, which is an early stage, the Minister believes that it would be premature to release the report. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Tambling will know that the audited financial statements will be included in the NLC's annual report for 1988-89, which the Minister expects to receive by the end of this year. As required by legislation, the report will then be tabled in the Parliament. So the ordinary processes are at work. As I say, the Department has received a faxed indication of the audited financial statements for the year ending 30 June, 1989. As soon as the NLC's annual report is forwarded to the Minister, I am sure that it will be tabled in the Parliament as is required. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I acknowledge and appreciate the answer given by the Minister. However, I ask him to clarify two issues for me. He mentioned the total amount owing to creditors which had accumulated to $1.2m. Then he used another figure, which I think was $1.5m. That acknowledged staff indebtedness for accruals, holiday pay and the like. Is that $400,000 in addition to the $1.2m or is there over $1m in staff accruals? Given the particular sensitivity of the issue relating to the audited annual statements, I think it is unreasonable to expect the Senate to wait until March or April of next year to receive a full report. If qualifications and reservations of a serious nature have been submitted by the auditor, I ask the Minister to make available the qualifications and reservations of the auditor's report at 30 June, the various reports of the Touche Ross consultancy and the fortnightly departmental reviews that have now been going on for some time.</PARA></TALK.START>

I can arrange for that to be done probably by the close of business-a couple of paragraphs putting in terms understood by accountants the true nature of the situation, which I am not in a position to do. As to the audited financial statements, I presume that when they are published they will have the various qualifications if any-I do not know whether there are any-attached to them, otherwise they would not be a full and proper disclosure of the opinion of the auditor. That will be done, as I say, when the annual report is tabled in the Parliament and attached to that annual report. As I understand it, the Minister would hope to receive that annual report by the end of the year. As we are sitting until 22 December, I would imagine there is every likelihood that it will be tabled in the Parliament before the end of this calendar year.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As to the Touche Ross consultancy, I have already indicated that the Minister regards the release of those reports at this stage to be premature. At the moment there is a consultancy and a cooperative effort with the Northern Land Council in taking measures to reduce the deficit. The Minister regards it as too early to release those reports. As to some fortnightly assessments made by the Department, I will have to put that matter to the Minister and seek his response. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the Minister for his reply. I am disappointed that the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs (Mr Hand) has chosen not to fully account to this Parliament in what I consider would be an appropriate and proper manner. The course of history once again will prove where it is the actions of the Minister. Obviously he has this information available to him from Touche Ross and departmental officers, yet he chooses to keep it in his bottom drawer because it is embarrassing. We have seen over the last 18 months that he continually gets caught out. It is a matter of the Labor Party closing ranks behind this Minister. That is the only reason that he survives in this portfolio. If he wants to run this sort of situation, rather than acknowledging the events at the time, the events will again come home to haunt him.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I would also like to comment on the Estimates Committee E report relating to the transition to the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission (ATSIC) by the Department of Aboriginal Affairs and the Aboriginal Development Commission (ADC). The Committee made some pretty stringent remarks when it expressed concerns relating to the ADC's corporate plan, the suitability of some of its senior staff and the forward financial commitments and the level of bad debts that will, by course of nature, have to be transferred to the new ATSIC. Once ATSIC is up and running, if the Labor Government stays in office after the next election, which I certainly believe will not happen and therefore the course of history will be radically changed-but given that in the next month or two the Minister might push the button and bring into force the interim commission-it will inherit some inadequate staff and some commitments that certainly need to be highlighted as matters that will demand early attention by the Estimates Committee. </PARA>
<PARA> As I also mentioned earlier, we need to know what implications as a result of ATSIC and other initiatives that are currently being taken ATSIC will inherit in a financial sense. I would like to address what I believe are initiatives within the Department of Aboriginal Affairs for a new industrial award for Aboriginal communities, advisers and resource agencies. I believe that a draft award is currently under consideration and being developed and that such an award could well have very serious financial implications on the budget, given the nature of the funding of the Department of Aboriginal Affairs, and the way in which funds flow through to various resource agencies and communities. I would like to ascertain from the Government the likely funding implications of such an award that could increase this budget and how it will impact on the financial situations of communities in remote areas. I also ask the Government to come clean and to say whether it has been holding discussions with the Northern Territory Government and other governments and, in particular, groups such as community associations, local government associations and unions with regard to a new award that could have serious implications on the finances available for Aboriginal services. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will just go back to the concluding remarks that Senator Tambling made about the previous matter of discussion when he claimed that the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs, Gerry Hand, was involved in yet another instance of a cover-up. He said that the chickens would come home to roost and he used other colourful language. The fact is that I indicated that the Minister has not yet received the annual report with the attached audited statements. I am sure that as soon as they arrive the Minister will discharge his obligation to the Parliament and table them as is required.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As to the fortnightly reports that Senator Tambling referred to, we are having some difficulty. I do not know that they are departmental reports. I think that the reports that Senator Tambling referred to are Touche Ross reports; he may be a little confused. As I told Senator Tambling, I am prepared to take his request to the Minister. I cannot do more than that. To assert that there is a cover-up is absolutely ludicrous. </PARA>
<PARA> As to this matter of awards, I understand that the matter is before the Northern Territory Industrial Relations Commission. It is by no means resolved. No decision has been handed down. Once a decision is handed down in relation to those awards then, of course, the costs that might be imposed will have to be discussed by the Department of Aboriginal Affairs with various client groups. At the moment the matter is very much, as I understand it, within the jurisdiction of the Commission and it has not been the subject of a determination. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is a little racist joke. I want to raise a matter with the Minister which I raised on a previous occasion. That is the question of what is deemed by the Department of Aboriginal Affairs in respect of the Freedom of Information Act to be in the public interest. As honourable senators would know it is with no great pleasure that I have established on a number of occasions that a number of Aboriginal communities have white advisers and bookkeepers who have improperly dealt with the finances of the association and the taxpayers' money. Almost without exception on each occasion that I have sought the auditor's report for an Aboriginal group I have found that it has been woefully inadequate: the funds have not been properly accounted for, the bookkeeping has been in a shambles and on some occasions the money has been misappropriated or it has disappeared with the bookkeeper. Invariably grants have not been properly discharged within the terms required by the Department.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> For instance, over the last 12 months I have sought the auditor's report from the Wangkatjungka community, the Junjuwa community, the Kalumburu community, the Marra Worra Worra community and the Oombulgurri community-just to name four or five that come to mind immediately. On each occasion the audited report has shown that gross deficiencies existed in the bookkeeping arrangements and that major failures existed within the guidelines of the Department. On each occasion I have been required to obtain information under the Freedom of Information Act and to pay the appropriate fee-about which, of course, I quite properly should not complain. On each occasion I have made application for refund of the fee on the basis of it being in the public interest. On each occasion the Department has denied the refund. It has refused a refund on the ground that I have not established public interest. </PARA>
<PARA> I have to say, with respect, that I cannot imagine what yardstick the Department can use. If it is not in the public interest to establish that, by virtue of the disclosure of the auditor's report of the auditing and the accounting of public moneys, there have been gross discrepancies, incompetence or failure, what is? It is not because of some perverted, perverse or curious interest that I have in the matter that I have requested the audited reports. I have asked for them because I have not been satisfied that the Department's guidelines have been complied with or that the funds have been used properly on behalf of the Aboriginal community for whom they are intended. </PARA>
<PARA> Honourable senators will all know, of course, the result of the special Auditor-General's inquiry in the past 12 months in respect to the failure to discharge certain grants. The Auditor-General has without exception found gross failures by the Department, by officers of the Department and by members of the communities. I have brought those matters to the attention of the Senate because I think it is fundamental to the use and the application of public funds that there be proper accountability and proper disclosure of that accountability. On each occasion when I have written to the Department and sought a refund simply on the ground of public interest, it has been denied unilaterally because the Department considers it not to be in the public interest. If that is a clever trick to dissuade, to discourage or to put off people from seeking this sort of information, because there is a financial penalty for so doing, let us have it out in the open; let us know where we stand; let the Department just double the fees to make it intolerably impossible for the average citizen-never mind a member of the Federal Parliament-to learn how these funds have been allocated, whether they have been accounted for properly, whether they have been used for the purposes for which they have been intended and whether they have been applied in a proper, decent and responsible fashion. </PARA>
<PARA> We now know as a result of the Auditor-General's report and as a result of the release of these audited reports that there has been an abysmal failure, that there has been a gulf between standards of requirements and standards of application. So I just ask the Minister whether it is unreasonable for a Federal member of parliament to seek to demonstrate by the exposure of these reports that there is a public interest issue in question. I would have thought that the Department would have judged under these circumstances that it is in the public interest. I do not know that it necessarily ought to rest upon whether or not the audited report demonstrates some failures to deem that it is not in the public interest; but in the event that it demonstrates that there is some failure of proper accountability, surely that is in the public interest. If it is not, a less charitable person than I could conclude that it is an attempt to coverup and I hope that is certainly not the case. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The first point is that obviously there is no attempt to coverup because the documents were made available. The second point is that I think there could be a good argument that, even if the audited reports indicated absolute adherence to the highest standards of accounting and that there was no problem, it was in the public interest that that be disclosed. It is of interest to know whether Aboriginal communities are operating in a way which is impeccable in regard to accounting for public funds. I, of course, cannot substitute myself for the departmental officers who are properly vested with the function under the legislation of making decisions as to whether remission of fees is permissible or justified in terms of the legislation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I express a view, though, that I think the sorts of matters that Senator Crichton-Browne has raised require to be given weight. I believe that the sorts of matters that he has raised are matters which should be given great weight by any departmental officer who is making a judgment as to whether there should be a waiver of fees in the public interest. As I say, I do not think it depends in any sense on the nature of the outcome of the audits. I refute the idea that there has been any attempt at a cover-up, because there has been full provision of the documents, as I understand it. I believe that, in the many relevant and proper considerations which are taken into account by departmental officers, the question of the judgment of a parliamentarian as to whether a matter is in the public interest should be given a good deal of weight in considering the competing interests which must be balanced. Obviously it is a question of balance. I express that view as to the weight which ought to be attached to the sorts of considerations which Senator Crichton-Browne has brought forward for the chamber. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would not want it thought that my measure of public interest is weighted by the level of failure by officers, whoever they might be, either of a department or of the associations, to administer their duties properly. Quite to the contrary, and I think Senator Tate makes a very valid point; that is, it is in the public interest to expose and demonstrate that the funds have been applied for the purpose for which they have been intended and that appropriate bookkeeping standards are met. If they are impeccable, I think that is all the more reason for showing that there is a public interest cause.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Without wishing now to debate the fundamental issue which caused me to seek the documents under freedom of information, the great tragedy is that, every time it is demonstrated that there has been an improper administration of funds or even an improper use of funds, in the minds of some in the community a dichotomy is created between white taxpayers and Aboriginal recipients. That is a tragedy for all Australians. The people who inevitably get hurt when there is a lack of adequate standards and accountability are the very people for whom the funds are intended. At the end of the day the only people who are deprived are not the taxpayers-it is just that their funds are used improperly or inadequately-but the people for whom the funds are intended. For that reason it is important that there be demonstrated to all of the community that there is proper accountability and application of the funds. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The final issue that I would like to raise this morning in looking at the Aboriginal Affairs portfolio relates to the use of shelf companies by the Aboriginal Development Commission (ADC). On 10 October I asked in Estimates Committee E a series of questions that related to the use of shelf companies for purchasing properties. I had used a particular example relating to the financial arrangements for the purchase of Atula station in the Northern Territory. It was acknowledged that the Department was using shelf companies for the purchase of properties because of peculiar and particular circumstances that it saw surrounding the commercial purchasing of properties in various parts. On that date-I stress that it is nearly six weeks ago-I quite firmly indicated that I required a response. I asked:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> How many shelf companies are currently owned by the ADC? Are all those companies named in the annual reports of the ADC? Are deeds of trust established in all instances before any such commercial transactions are carried out? Have they been, in all instances, where shelf companies have been used by the ADC to purchase commercial properties?</PARA>
<PARA>That last question was acknowledged in a follow-up reply with the answer, `Yes, there are instances where shelf companies are being used'. There was an acknowledgment that there were not deeds of trust established in instances before they were carried out. I feel it is a very serious matter that deeds of trust are not created which could create particular and special problems in the future. To the first two questions-`How many?' and `Are they named in the report?'-I received an answer in the written response: `The response is still being researched'. I find that totally inadequate. Now that it is some six weeks later I would have anticipated that we would have had the names and the numbers of the companies, where they were being used and how extensive their use is. I am aware that a Senate committee is currently looking into the use of subsidiary companies by various departments and agencies. I think that Senator Durack has already acknowledged that he will be including the ADC in the ambit of that inquiry and that full investigation will be necessary. </PARA>
<PARA> My personal investigations into the company searches of Syracuse Pty Ltd, which is an ADC-owned company in the Northern Territory that was connected with Atula station, on my reading of the search revealed totally inadequate records at that time. I would like to ascertain whether the ADC will provide to the Committee the names, numbers and the reporting of the various shelf companies. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think we are on the last lap. As far as the use of shelf companies is concerned, I recall that there was some discussion in Estimates Committee E and the Aboriginal Development Commission (ADC) has noted the concern of the Committee. In fact, as I understand it, the audit management committee of the ADC has requested its internal auditors, Price Waterhouse, to review the procedures and circumstances in which shelf companies are used for the purchase of land. That is the general answer.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As to the four specific questions that had been asked by Senator Tambling, as I understand it, a response is being sent to the Committee today, but I can read it now. His first question was:</PARA>
<PARA>How many shelf companies are currently owned by the ADC?</PARA>
<PARA>The answer to that is: Five, and the ADC is currently awaiting a company search to clarify the status of a deregulation application for a sixth. The second question was:</PARA>
<PARA>Are all those companies named in the annual reports of the ADC?</PARA>
<PARA>The response is: Yes; however, Apiwentye Pastoral Co. Pty Ltd and Peake Pty Ltd were not acquired until 1988-89 and will, therefore, not appear in the previous annual report. The third question was:</PARA>
<PARA>Are deeds of trust established in all instances before any such commercial transactions are carried out?</PARA>
<PARA>The answer to that is: No; however, the Commission does endeavour to arrange deeds of trust as soon as possible thereafter, as has been done in the case of Peake Pty Ltd and Apiwentye Pastoral Co. Pty Ltd. It is not always possible to finalise such documentation before a commercial transaction which is often governed by factors of timeliness and commercial urgency. Senator Tambling's final question was:</PARA>
<PARA>Have they been, in all instances, where shelf companies have been used by the ADC to purchase commercial properties?</PARA>
<PARA>The answer to that is yes. I believe that that response is being sent around to the Committee either at the moment or certainly in the course of the day. </PARA>

I hope that the various State divisions and offices have not been engaging in this practice and that in the history of the ADC that is the total figure and there are no historical situations where other companies have been used that are no longer in operation.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The problem is that I want answers to my questions. I want to raise some questions about the National Film and Sound Archive where the answers I received in the Estimates committee were rather incomplete or unsatisfactory. The national collecting bodies in the arts budget are the Australian National Gallery, the Australian National Maritime Museum, the National Library of Australia, the National Museum of Australia, and the National Film and Sound Archive (NFSA). All these are bodies with a role of collecting and preserving important Australian materials, whether of cultural, artistic or historical significance. I want to bring up a curious feature in this year's Budget which involves a policy issue that could not properly be put in the Estimates committee. The policy issue concerns how the relative amounts are assigned amongst these collecting bodies.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Let us look at what happened this year. The amount allocated to the National Gallery will go up from $17.4m to $18.8m. The amount allocated to the National Maritime Museum-which is not yet in operation-will go up from $7.5m to $11.6m. The amount allocated to the National Library will go up from $28.2m to $33.7m, and that allocated to the National Museum-which also is not yet in operation-will go up from $2.8m to $3.7m. These are all substantial increases. That is understandable in the climate of the times and the economic situation. But it is surprising that the National Film and Sound Archive allocation will actually go down, from $7.36m to $6.68m. This is disturbing because of its collecting task. </PARA>
<PARA> All the bodies I have mentioned are collecting bodies. I do not want to give the impression that I am denigrating any of the other collecting bodies; it is the question of the relative allocation of resources that is important. The National Film and Sound Archive has a more urgent role than any of the other collecting bodies. Even while I am speaking, several cans of film will be lost forever because of the lack of funds to keep up with the urgent task of preserving them. I am not destroying them; I am merely saying that by natural processes they are decomposing in the short time I am talking. There is an enormously urgent task to stop them deteriorating and decomposing. In the few years since it was established, in 1984, the National Film and Sound Archive has made enormous progress in accelerating the copying and preserving processes, but it does not have time to waste. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like to ask the Minister-and I do not know whether Senator Tate can answer this on behalf of the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories (Senator Richardson)-how the funds are allocated amongst the various collecting bodies. In assessing how much the Government has to give them, it must take into account how much the NFSA could be expected to gain from commercial activities. In the past the National Film and Sound Archive has seemed a very fruitful area for getting community support-non-government support-from rich film-makers, television channels and so on. I think that has been the cause of a relatively low government subvention to the organisation; in fact, there has been a fall this year. But those situations have dramatically changed. Will the National Film and Sound Archive go to Mr Skase, or Mr Bond, or whoever now owns Channel 10 for preservation?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank Senator Baume. The answer is negative. They will not get it. I think that the allocations have been distorted because of what can now be shown to be an obsolete concept through a change in circumstances-of how much community support the National Film and Sound Archive can expect. I would like the Minister to say whether he accepts this diagnosis and whether, in the changed circumstances which affect the National Film and Sound Archive and may do irreparable damage to our film and sound collection, particularly our film collection, the Government will in the Supplementary Estimates give sympathetic consideration to the changed circumstances.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> My second question relates to questions I placed on notice at the Estimates committee hearings. I asked:</PARA>
<PARA> It is now five years since the National Film and Sound Archive was established. When will the appropriate legislation be introduced into the Parliament by which the now not-so-new National Film and Sound Archive will operate?</PARA>
<PARA>I was provided with the following answer:</PARA>
<PARA> The Minister has asked that a submission to the Government be prepared concerning the establishment of the NFSA as a statutory authority. </PARA>
<PARA>That is the normal bureaucratic response: `Let us have another inquiry'. One inquiry, whose report was called Time in our Hands, was held when the National Film and Sound Archive was set up. All these structural questions were dealt with then. Why do we need another inquiry now to gallop over the old battlefield that was dealt with in 1984? Can I have an assurance that this is not a bureaucratic delaying mechanism but that a proper structure for the National Film and Sound Archive will be addressed quickly?</PARA>

I had the great pleasure of opening the site of the display which the Association provides in Hobart, near the Theatre Royal, for those who care to go to enjoy perusing the collection of old radiograms and listening to old records which record so much of our past-not only the great performances of entertainers but also great moments in our history, our common memory and culture. There is a special relationship between that voluntary community organisation and the National Film and Sound Archive. The former acts as a sort of outpost of the National Film and Sound Archive in Tasmania and does much work on the Archive's behalf in a way which entails very low cost to the National Film and Sound Archive but nevertheless preserves much material in Tasmania which would otherwise be lost. I take that to be the burden of Senator Hamer's remarks today.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator Hamer asked whether I accept his diagnosis of the reason for increases for some other collecting bodies and a decrease for the National Film and Sound Archive. That must be a factual matter, and naturally I accept that. I cannot give an expert opinion on whether it will lead to the drastic consequences which are feared-namely, that there will be an inability to preserve materials which are deteriorating due to the manner of their composition. I am not sure that that would be the case because I can imagine that all resources are being diverted to ensure that that should not occur. The question of whether a supplementary appropriation will be sought will be a matter for the Minister to consider should evidence be brought forward of a very real crisis as opposed to the continuing matter of which we are aware. </PARA>
<PARA> As to when appropriate legislation might be introduced, that is a matter for the Minister to take into account. There is a general desire, I believe, that a statutory basis be found for the Film and Sound Archive. I am not sure whether, having regard to the heavy legislative program which the Government faces and the difficulty of managing to get legislation through this place, such legislation will find a place towards the top of the list of legislation to be brought into this Parliament. I am sure that the Minister will regard that as a matter for his further deliberation. I pay tribute to those Australians, particularly in Tasmania, who take a very enthusiastic and thoughtful interest in preserving the records of our past. In particular, we should compliment Mrs Gwen D'Emden and the Sound Preservation Association of Tasmania. </PARA>

With the indulgence of the Committee, I will do so. I will not repeat all I said; I will only repeat the key points. I comment on Senator Tate's answer by saying that it is a fact that the resources available to the National Film and Sound Archive currently are insufficient to keep up with the deterioration of the nitrate film and disc stock. More resources are needed. To return to the questions, if one looks at the five collecting organisations, the Australian National Gallery, the National Maritime Museum, the National Library and the National Museum-of course, the National Museum and the National Maritime Museum are not yet in operation-one will see that all have received significant increases this year, whereas the vote for the National Film and Sound Archive has been decreased from $7.358m to $6.686m.</PARA></TALK.START>

I am in no way trying to denigrate the other organisations-I agree with the Government's intentions that all these organisations do their best to get funds from interested people in the community. The point about the Film and Sound Archive is that many of the people from whom it could reasonably have expected to raise funds no longer have the funds. I asked whether it could still expect to get funds from Mr Skase, Mr Bond or from whoever owns Channel 10 at the moment. Such people would have been assessed as potential donors, but the climate in which the National Film and Sound Archive might have expected to raise funds is now very much worse than when the Budget was produced. In view of the irreversible consequences of not giving enough funds to the Film and Sound Archive, will the Government look at the fundraising climate for the Film and Sound Archive and, if necessary, adjust the Government's subvention to correct what would now be a wrong assumption?</PARA>
<PARA> I asked another quite separate question which arose out of the Estimates Committee hearings. These was an inquiry, which produced a report entitled Time In Our Hands, at the time that the National Film and Sound Archive was set up, in order to make recommendations on its future structure. From answers given at the Estimates Committee hearings it now appears that yet another inquiry is to be set up. The Film and Sound Archive has been in existence for five years and it still does not have a statutory basis. I want to obtain an assurance from the Minister that there is a very real determination to get a statutory basis for the Film and Sound Archive. I hope that the commissioning of another inquiry is not a normal bureaucratic device to delay having to make a decision. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I share Senator Hamer's view that the natural field for fund raising in the area of the National Film and Sound Archive has been significantly reduced in recent times. Clearly, the television networks will not be in a position to provide much in the way of funds for the National Film and Sound Archive in the next few years. One would imagine that Mr Bond, Mr Skase and Mr Cosser are all engaged in fighting for their survival rather than being in the happy position of being able to devote more funds.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In the conversations I have had with Mr Scott in particular, it would seem that television is not the only area in which one can raise money. The National Film and Sound Archive has a degree of confidence that there are other areas in the media which will be prepared to contribute funds and that there is an affinity, if you like, in the media. Even if one is in the print media, it does not mean that one is anti-sound. Mr Scott's view was that more money could be raised. Mr Scott has a radio background and was confident that others in that industry might assist. As Senator Hamer is probably aware, a private group is also involved. Alan Rydge's company has a significant library which it is working to augment. I think Mr Scott is confident that money could still be raised from all of those areas. </PARA>
<PARA> I will get Senator Hamer an answer regarding how much the Archive raised from private sources in the last 12 months. I am not sure whether there is an adviser here who can tell us about that. As soon as I find out, I will let Senator Hamer know. With regard to a statutory basis for the Archive, a point that Senator Tate made with which I certainly concur, is that in recent times there has been difficulty in getting legislation through the Senate and even getting legislation listed is proving very difficult. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Before the Minister got to his feet I was just about to say that. I am well aware of the problem his adviser has. I hope to finish my questioning before Question Time. I start with a bit of history. The letting of the tender for the Aurora Australis has been of concern to me for some time. I know the effect it will have on our Antarctic program, which I think everybody is looking forward to. We all know that in recent months world attention has been switched to Antarctica. Both the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) and Senator Richardson, who is at the table, have made a lot of political mileage out of the environmental aspect of Antarctica.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In the time I have in this debate I do not intend to make cheap political points. I just repeat that the events leading up to the launch of the Aurora Australis were unusual to say the least. The fact that the Minister announced the contract of the tender for the ship to P &amp; O Polar before the contract had been signed certainly delayed the commencement of that operation because there were some six months of protracted negotiation before the final contract was signed. It could be said that in the final analysis that cost the taxpayer around $27m. Aspects about the tendering for the vessel, including whether it could have been cheaper to build overseas, have also been raised. There is some evidence to suggest that that would have been the case. Nevertheless, I agree with the argument put that there were certain advantages in having the ship built in Australia. There were certainly some political advantages in announcing prior to the New South Wales election in which Mr Unsworth was defeated that the ship would be built at Carrington Slipways Pty Ltd. </PARA>
<PARA> Events have now followed on. Originally the Aurora Australis was to be completed and ready for duty at the commencement of this season, which was in October. I know that it was delayed. I think that Senator Cook, in answer to a question I asked, said that it would be around January. I ask the Minister whether January is the expected date of commencement of service of the Aurora Australis. What will happen if it is delayed further?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am not certain where the figure of $27m extra costs comes from, how it is arrived at and what relationship it bears, if any, to the decision to announce the successful tenderer prior to the signing of the contract, which is of course quite normal. Had I not done so, the industry would have been in uproar. Senator Calvert cannot suggest that, with all of those people wanting the right to deal with this vessel, I could in some way keep quiet a decision to choose a successful tenderer, and then spend six months negotiating with him without the others gradually finding out. That sort of surreptitious behaviour would, in my view, have been stupid and would have provided no commercial advantage to the Commonwealth whatsoever. I will be interested to hear how Senator Calvert can tell me that that would cost another $27m.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The decision that it would be built in New South Wales was not for government but for the successful tenderer, which conducted negotiations with yards in New South Wales and Western Australia and chose New South Wales. The latest advice I have on the delivery dates is that P &amp; O Polar has advised the Department that delivery is expected in the period of 1 February to 15 February. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="5F4">Senator CALVERT</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 25 May I asked a question during the appropriations debate. Senator Richardson's colleague Senator Walsh was in the chair. I put it to him that, if the successful tenderer was announced prior to the negotiations being finalised, the known tenderer was put into a position in which he could extract further concessions from, in this case, the Government. Having gone back through the documents, I can say that there is no doubt that the extra concessions gained after the announcement of the tender could have been around $25m to $27m. Senator Walsh himself said that prima facie it was possible. He went on to give the sort of answer that Senator Richardson gave: he did not believe the tenderer had tried to exploit the potential advantages. Not only Senator Richardson's announcement by press release but also a letter of intent being made available to the tenderer certainly placed the tenderer in a position to extract further concessions. I am led to believe that that in fact happened.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I will get back to the other answer Senator Richardson gave me-that the delivery date is now the beginning of February. That is very interesting. Many people at the Antarctic Division will be pleased to hear that. I would like to know what effect the fact that the Rolls-Royce of polar shipbuilders, Wartsela, has gone bankrupt is having on the availability of the ship? As Senator Richardson realises, it was the main technical adviser to P &amp; O in building this ship. Will it have any effect on the program?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The fact that Wartsela is in liquidation is much more of a problem-if it were to be a problem at all-for P &amp; O than for the Government. In any event, I am advised by Aurora Australis operators that the equipment and material supply is essentially over; the job has been done. The outstanding technical assistance is not fundamental. We believe, therefore, that the effect of Wartsela's financial situation on delivery and on the actual ship that is delivered will be either non-existent or so minimal as to not matter.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have another query about the construction of the Aurora Australis. I have previously asked this question: Because the ship was being custom built for the Antarctic Division and the Commonwealth being the sole charterer of the Aurora Australis, how are our interests being protected during the construction phase? In the Estimates hearings I asked why the Commonwealth did not engage an independent qualified technical inspector to oversee the construction of the ship in the Commonwealth's interest. I got such answers as, `We do not pay if it does not perform'. The answers talked about the quantum of damages and the litigious situations that could arise. I also believe that some misleading answers were given to me about the role of the ship classification inspectors. I have been very concerned about the fact that the Commonwealth has been overseeing the building of the ship-I note this from the specifications-by way of progress photographs. I believe that, as a ship of this magnitude is being custom built for the Antarctic Division, the Commonwealth's interests should have been looked after by the appointment of an independent inspector. Given that that did not happen, has the approach that has been taken been rather impractical and akin to locking the stable door after the horse has bolted or, in this case, after the ship might have been sunk?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is the responsibility of P and O Polar to provide a vessel to the Commonwealth which meets the specifications and which is in accordance with the requirements of the Ship Classification Society for registration of the vessel. So both P and O and the Society have specialists on site and it is their job to monitor the details of construction. The Antarctic Division itself has a requirement for a vessel which provides the operational and functional requirements that were set out in the charter and all the accompanying specifications. So while the Antarctic Division ship project manager and other officers of the Division, in conjunction with specialist consultants, have monitored the construction in terms of those requirements, they are not responsible for the certification and registration of the vessel. It is the responsibility of P and O Polar to provide the Commonwealth with a vessel which meets the classification rules and regulations as certified by the Society and we have no reason to believe that that is not being done.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We have received progress photographs, which is normal in this situation. They are provided in the monthly reports that the Division gets on the monitoring of construction. They are required by the owner, in any event, as a record of construction, but they are of assistance to the Division. X-ray photographs are taken in accordance with plans drawn up between representatives of the Classification Society and the ship designer to meet the requirements of the Classification Society to survey the vessel. Given that those things are all being done together, I have no doubt that this will result in the job being done properly. </PARA>

During the Estimates Committee hearings I was told by the Acting Director that there is no doubt that we have to give more priority to questions such as the Antarctic wilderness park and the preparation of the Antarctic Treaty system. As I said in my opening remarks, this is because of the focus on the Antarctic, particularly from an environmental point of view. Resources have been diverted from the preparation of the Antarctic station management plans to the preparation of paperwork for the international meetings that are being held and also to provide support for the Government's posturing on environmental issues in the Antarctic.

If that is the case, the honourable senator ought to come out and tell us that; I think all Australians would be interested to hear it.

Clearly, the Division has a responsibility to service our requirements on that and it is doing so. Naturally enough, that has meant some delays in the plans being prepared.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the Minister for that assurance. I now move on to an area that was also raised in Estimates. I refer to the strategic transport planning. The Minister will be aware that in Estimates the matter of the Antarctic Division's budget for the conduct of Hercules flights to Casey was mentioned. I think the Acting Director mentioned a figure of $100,000 for the hiring back of construction equipment that was recently disposed of by the Division after I questioned him on that. During the discussions on the possibility of Hercules flights to Casey I asked whether any studies had been done in the past into the use of Hercules aircraft into Casey. I was told of a previous study on a compressed snow runway. Its major conclusion was that it was viable to make a compressed snow runway. I have since learnt that in the plans the Government has in place for flying Hercules into Casey it will not be using a compressed snow runway.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I also asked whether any studies had been done before on the use of Hercules aircraft into Casey. I did not receive what I believe was a proper answer. I am aware now that there was a study conducted for the Antarctic Division in 1985-a review of Antarctic air transport operations. One of the conclusions it made on the matter of an airfield at Casey was that it was impracticable as a regular transport link for operational reasons. The main reasons related to the poor and unpredictable weather conditions in the vicinity of Casey and the fact that it could lead to a high proportion of delayed and aborted flights. There was some mention about that during the Estimates by the Acting Director. He did say that this was one of the problems. The fact is that the findings of the 1985 study do not indicate that flights by Hercules planes down there are all that viable. I just want to know why, when I asked those questions about Casey, I was not told about this 1985 study. I would also like to know why, it having been said a compressed snow runway is viable, it is proposed not to use a compressed snow runway. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is proposed to use one. That is the main point. I go back to Senator Calvert's concerns about not being informed of the earlier study. The earlier study was actually looking at a different physical location of a proposed runway. The 1988 team of defence people found when it went down to have a look that there was a better position that was even closer to the base, so it settled upon that new position. As I understand it-I cannot claim to be an engineering expert-the compression of snow will be critical to the preparation of this ice-snow runway. It is a combination of techniques in which compressed snow is critical. It is at a different place to that which was looked at in the 1985 study. I hope that that answers Senator Calvert's queries.</PARA></TALK.START>

In any event, the Australian Government is not looking at ski equipped planes but at planes landing with wheels on this compressed snow-ice runway.

Obviously we could not guarantee those sorts of conditions on a permanent basis. Nonetheless, the trip was of value. We would obviously be putting in a forecasting centre for the Hercules flights going down. Mr Smith's use of Twin Otters was encouraging as far as the Division was concerned. It is one of the reasons why the Division has recommended a change from using long-range helicopters between the bases to using Twin Otters. While we would not take the Dick Smith flight on its own as a basis for future actions, certainly there were benefits for us all in looking at his experience. Hopefully we will be able to benefit from that experience by using Twin Otters between the bases.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr President, as luck would have it, my question is addressed to the Leader of the Government in the Senate, representing the Prime Minister and the Minister for Industrial Relations. I refer the Minister to Mr Peter Morris's reported comment on the court decision in the pilots dispute that, while the Government opposes the use of penalities against unions, anyone who chooses to go outside the system must face the consequences. I ask the Minister whether he recalls the Prime Minister saying on 20 August, after meeting with the airlines in Melbourne-incidentally, that was a Sunday, the day before the Industrial Relations Commission hearing at which the pilots were to appear-which was set for the Monday-and I quote:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I say, without equivocation, that when the airlines decide to initiate those legal processes with significantly very drastic financial penalities against individual pilots and their organisation, the airlines will be pursuing those legal processes with the full support of my Government.</PARA>
<PARA>Can the Minister confirm that this was the day before the pilots were required to meet an Industrial Relations Commission deadline on their nine to five campaign, in other words, when the dispute was still before the Commission and within the Government's much loved system? Why is the Government now trying to squirm out from under the fact that, even before the Commission processes had been completed, the Prime Minister gave the strongest possible endorsement to the use of common law remedies? Is it not further a fact that the common law is available, and has always been available, to be used by any party in an industrial dispute, regardless of whether the parties happen to be in or out of the centralised system? Does the Minister agree that, like it or not, the Government is now stuck with the fact that its Prime Minister has given total support for the use of such remedies in industrial disputes?</PARA>

The best thing I can do is to consult Mr Morris about what his attitude is, as apparently indicated by the statement Senator Chaney referred to today. It is certainly regrettable from the Government's point of view that the pilots chose to operate outside the system-Senator Chaney refers to the well loved system of the Government-and chose to resign.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I direct my question to the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade. In the light of the obvious and mounting public concern about the situation in Cambodia, does the Government have any ideas as to how the settlement process in Cambodia could be further advanced and the present stalemate in negotiations broken? Is the only possible form of transitional government one that gives a place to the brutal and genocidal Khmer Rouge? Would it not be a better reflection of reality, and create a better climate for the settlement of the Cambodian problem, if the seat in the United Nations (UN) presently held by the CGDK-the Coalition Government of Democratic Kampuchea led by Prince Sihanouk, Son Sann and the Khmer Rouge-were declared vacant?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="3298" SPEAKER="Evans Sen The Hon G.J." NAMEID="VD4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="VIC" MINISTERIAL="FOREIGN AFFAIRS AND TRADE" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator GARETH EVANS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;All of us share a passionate conviction that the killing in Cambodia has gone on too long, that it must stop and that a workable, durable solution-to ensure that it never happens again-must be found. All of us share an equally passionate conviction that Pol Pot and the other genocidal butchers of the Khmer Rouge killing fields should never again be allowed to exercise power in Cambodia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Australia has been among those countries working hard to try to find such a solution. Bill Hayden took a series of initiatives through the mid-1980s which were very important in helping break the log-jam which then existed, and more recently I have been involved in what seems like an endless series of meetings and conferences-with the regional countries, the permanent members of the Security Council, other involved and interested countries such as France, India and Canada, and the four internal Cambodian parties-trying to craft a strategy which will bring the conflict to an end once and for all.</PARA>
<PARA> At the Paris conference two months ago we came very close to succeeding. A comprehensive settlement strategy was mapped out involving, in broad terms, the monitored withdrawal of all Vietnamese forces; a cease-fire; the cessation of external support; the creation of a transitional administration; and the holding of free elections-all under the supervision of an international control mechanism. That settlement strategy foundered for a number of stated reasons. But only one of them was really crucial: one side to the conflict, the combined resistance forces of Prince Sihanouk, Son Sann and the Khmer Rouge, together with their international backers, demanded a place for each of the four internal parties, including the Khmer Rouge, in the transitional administration; this was a demand which the People's Republic of Kampuchea Government of Hun Sen, and its international backers, were not prepared to concede.</PARA>
<PARA> Since then there has been a resurgence of fighting. The external backers of the internal Cambodian parties have continued to supply them with arms and materiel, and positions have hardened rather than softened. A number of international efforts have been mounted to renew the dialogue process, some of them very public, others much less so. We particularly applaud the efforts that are being made to find ways through the impasse by Thai Prime Minister Chatichai, the Paris conference co-chairmen, Foreign Ministers Alatas and Dumas, and United States Secretary of State Baker. It is my sincere hope that these efforts will lead to real progress, but so far none have borne fruit.</PARA>
<PARA> International opinion remains overwhelmingly in favour of a comprehensive settlement-in which all the outstanding issues would be simultaneously addressed-as the support for the Association for South East Asian Nations (ASEAN) resolution in the United Nations last week made abundantly clear. But at the same time it is becoming obvious that some of the detailed elements in the kind of comprehensive settlement proposal that has been on the table to date may need some re-thinking if the new deadlock is to be resolved. Everyone acknowledges that the problem causing most difficulty is the composition of the transitional administration, and in particular the role proposed in that administration for the Khmer Rouge-even on the basis that the Khmer Rouge would have but a minority voice in a quadripartite administration, and that it would be shorn of its former leadership.</PARA>
<PARA> In the last few weeks I have been exploring with a number of my ASEAN and foreign ministerial colleagues, and with others including the Deputy Prime Minister of the Hun Sen Administration in Cambodia, Mr Kong Som Ol, and US Congressman Stephen Solarz, whether it might not be possible to create a form of transitional administration, still within the framework of a genuinely comprehensive settlement, which did not give rise to the same objections and apprehensions as the existing proposal on the table. I further discussed this whole issue this morning with the heads, or their representatives, of all the ASEAN diplomatic missions to Australia, outlining to them the possible approach that I now put on the public record, and which I will of course be following up with my foreign ministerial colleagues.</PARA>
<PARA> The idea that I have found most attractive, and which I believe deserves very close examination by all the participants at the Paris conference, is one that would involve building a transitional administration directly around the authority of the United Nations-some variation of the kind of UN administration which previously has been put in place in comparable circumstances, most recently in Namibia. Such an arrangement would mean that no Cambodian party would be in a position to decide the country's destiny pending free and fair elections organised by the UN and held under international supervision. It would involve a compromise by the present Hun Sen Administration-being prepared to step back from its present role as the de facto government of the country-and by the three resistance parties, which would not have a role in the transitional administration either.</PARA>
<PARA> The proposal addresses concerns about the Khmer Rouge being in a position of even marginal, transitional authority, which so many people have found abhorrent for obvious reasons, given its appalling record. It also clearly preserves the objectives of a comprehensive settlement and, crucially, provides the framework within which the external players, including China, may be prepared to draw back from the conflict. The idea is not, in fact, dissimilar from one suggested to me by Prince Sihanouk, at a meeting I had with him in early August in his residence in Paris, that Cambodia be placed under a form of `UN trusteeship'.</PARA>
<PARA> It would be difficult, if not impossible, for the UN to play the role envisaged for it were the Cambodian seat to remain occupied-as it is at the moment in New York-by one contesting group, the CGDK. Australia has never accepted the claim of either the CGDK or the Hun Sen Government to be the legitimate occupants of the UN seat, as was made clear on the last occasion the issue was tested-in 1982. Other countries have in the past taken different views about the occupancy question. But, as became very clear in the corridors of the Paris conference, there is very little, if any, dissent from the view that any international control mechanism to supervise the transition to peace in Cambodia should be under the authority of the UN, and that a logical corollary of this is that the Cambodian seat at the UN should be declared vacant, or at least occupied by whoever constitutes the transitional administration, for the duration of that transition period.</PARA>
<PARA> As the Australian permanent representative to the UN, Dr Wilenski, stated in the General Assembly on 15 November, Australia assumes `that as part of a comprehensive settlement a change in seating will take place-either the seat will be declared vacant or will be occupied by the interim authority, until elections install a legitimate government which can take its rightful place in this body'. If the UN itself were to be the interim authority, it follows that the Cambodian seat would have to be declared vacant. These are ideas that I shall be further exploring with my counterparts in the weeks and months ahead. A sane and civilised way through the present impasse in that tragic country must be found, and the Australian Government will not rest until it is.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question, which is directed to the Minister for Consumer Affairs, relates to the large variety of infant and children's toys now being retailed for Christmas shopping. Is the Minister concerned with the safety aspects of many of these toys, particularly those imported from countries which do not comply with a strict code of manufacture and safety testing procedures?

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="XE4">Senator BOLKUS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank Senator Colston for raising this issue because it should be of concern to the community and to government. It is not a minor issue. The cost to the community of accidental injuries is in the vicinity of $9 billion per annum and injury from products is an important part of that cost. The Government has approached the problem in a comprehensive and coordinated way. We have recognised the need for a system of injury surveillance and prevention as operates in both the United States and the United Kingdom. We also recognise that with a comprehensive system there can be benefits to all levels of government, to industry, to the community and, of course, to individuals.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> To this end we have taken a number of measures. The first, and probably the pivotal one, is to fund the Australian Institute of Health and the Federal Bureau of Consumer Affairs to assist in a pilot program on injury surveillance. It is based on information being available at selected casualty departments in hospitals in some States, and this program over its short term of operation has already logged and analysed in the vicinity of 150,000 inputs on injuries and their details.</PARA>
<PARA> The Commonwealth is taking the matter one step further by funding the Australian Consumers Association to analyse the data that the national injury surveillance prevention project (NISPP) holds and its own records primarily to identify products that are either defective or hazardous. The NISPP data has been the starting point for a Federal safety standard-and this goes very much to the heart of Senator Colston's question-for children's toys that was announced and made applicable earlier this year. In essence, it is a standard that protects children, particularly smaller children, from the dangers that are inherent in toys that are sold to their parents for them. That standard is mandatory and applies to items produced either inside or outside Australia. So toys sold in this category have to comply with the safety standard.</PARA>
<PARA> Senator Colston raises a broader question of enforcement. We have responded to the enforcement problem in two specific ways. In implementing that standard Bureau officers conduct random checks. In fact, quite recently, we had to ban a toy the paint on which had something like 40 times the permissible levels of lead. That toy has been taken off the market. In the lead-up to Christmas there is a greater need for parents to be alerted to the hazards involved in toys. At the moment the Federal Bureau of Consumer Affairs is conducting a regular annual survey of toyshops to locate which toys may pose a hazard. I expect the results and details of that survey to be announced in the near future. They should be available before Christmas so that parents can be alerted to them.</PARA>
<PARA> The other aspect of government response in this area is a fundamental one-that is, to educate the community, and particularly parents, about safe toys for children. To that end, we have been conducting a campaign and have in fact published a booklet for parents to alert them to the hazards inherent in buying toys. As I said at the start of my answer, the question is a fundamental one in that the range of injuries arising from accidents in our community results in a massive cost not only to the families and individuals involved but also to the whole budgetary process.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am not going to take a long time over it, but I am going to answer the question, which Senator Sanders is entitled to ask. I was asked in the first part of the question whether I am satisfied with the ACT Assembly's report on the National Aquarium. The reality is no, I am not. Because I am not satisfied with the Assembly's report I have asked my Department to assess it to make sure that the Murrumbidgee and Molonglo rivers are adequately protected. I am not saying that I believe they are not; I just do not know, and I think that the citizens of the ACT are entitled to know, as also are the citizens of New South Wales, who could well be affected by where the rivers flow.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As Senator Sanders would know, this matter arose in the first instance as a proposal for a trout farm. Certainly, an environmental assessment was conducted into a potential trout farm. What we now have is a National Aquarium and tourist development, which has also been physically moved to the other side of the river from where the original assessment was done. There appears to be some debate as to when exactly that change occurred and how much assessment of that change has been done. That is why I asked my Department to assess it for me. I expect an answer from the Department next week, and I hope to be in a position before the end of next week to make a statement on what I believe should occur.</PARA>
<PARA> I do not know the names of the biologists. That is one of the things I could not find out in the time I was given; so I cannot answer that part of the question. As I have already said, my Department's report next week should tell us exactly when this change occurred and whether or not any assessment was done of it.</PARA>
<PARA> Senator Sanders asked whether the proposal is subject to Commonwealth legislation. The answer to that is yes. As to what other Commonwealth legislation might be applicable to a development, I suppose the usual gamut applies. The Foreign Investment Review Board would be concerned if there was foreign money in it, but I do not think there is, so I doubt that. I do not think that the National Aquarium wants to export, so I cannot imagine that export controls are going to apply either. I think we are essentially relying on the Environment Protection (Impact of Proposals) Act, which does apply, and next week I will determine whether or not I will make an order as to its application.</PARA>

I note also that in this case the action brought by Ansett Airlines of Australia and Australian Airlines was undertaken with the `unequivocal' support of both Mr Hawke-who for 10 years was President of the Australian Council of Trade Unions (ACTU)-and of the present leadership of the ACTU, although they now appear to be backing away from that support. I ask the Minister whether he would agree that it will prove to be a supreme irony that perhaps the last act for which this shortly outgoing Prime Minister will be remembered is what I may call the Hawke-Brooking judgment-a judgment which serves notice on trade union bosses in this country that the end of their world is nigh?</PARA></TALK.START>

But he urged all States to set up screening programs for people in high risk groups for developing colorectal cancer, which affects some 8,000 people a year. I understand that the concerns expressed by Dr Giles that the results of these test kits might produce unnecessary anxiety or undue optimism are shared by the Anti-Cancer Council of Victoria and more recently by the health care committee of the National Health and Medical Research Council. I am also advised that restrictions are currently in force on the advertising of these products and the public is advised to take notice of the cautions expressed in their use.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I am further advised that while there is clearly a need to be careful in the interpretation of the results of the tests, they are considered to afford an acceptable level of accuracy in identifying hidden blood and would not justify consideration of a complete ban on marketing.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;A report by the Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics entitled Projections of Energy Supply and Demand Australia 1989-90 to 1999-2000 was released on 9 November. Its major findings were that domestic energy consumption will rise by an average of 2 per cent annually. Australian energy production will grow at an annual rate of 4 per cent. The major increases in exports are expected to be in black coal, uranium and natural gas-natural gas due to the North West Shelf project reaching full production and export. The rate of energy efficiency in Australia, which has not been as strong as the Government would have liked to have seen in recent years, is expected to improve as energy prices, mainly for oil, begin to rise slowly. The projections also included the fact that the Bureau of Mineral Resources has revised upwardly the future production of crude oil in Australia and revised its assessment of the prospectivity of Australia for oil and natural gas, recognising that Australia by world standards has been lightly explored for those two commodities.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The increases in our energy exports will be a major contributor to improvements in Australia's current account deficit. For example, the latest balance of payments figures released yesterday, those for October, show that for the first four months of this financial year coal exports have increased by 27 per cent over the same period a year ago. One of the major reasons for this is that the Hawke Labor Government has conducted a program of micro-economic reform for our minerals and energy exports. In the coal sector that has been quite significant. It was topped off by the decision last year of the Coal Industry Tribunal which enabled better utilisation of capital investment in the coal industry and which is still working its way through the coal industry-a significant achievement. In addition, the better industrial relations climate enabled the North West Shelf project to be completed ahead of time and under budget. Another contributing factor was the work done in that project by the national liaison group set up by Senator Evans when he was the Minister for Resources and Energy and by Mr Parker, the Deputy Premier of Western Australia.</PARA>

On the subject of the possible creation of a direct air link between Australia and the economy of Taiwan, we are anxious to explore, as we have been for some considerable time, what the art of the possible might be in that respect, consistently with the retention of our one-China policy. A lot of suggestions have been made in the public press and elsewhere that all sorts of countries have simply gone in and established direct air links without suffering any accompanying disadvantage in terms of the relationships with the People's Republic of China. That simply is not true. Most of the air services linking Taiwan with other countries are the product of agreements that considerably predate the emergence of a widespread one-China approach by the countries in question. The one case where such a service was established involved the Netherlands and was not without considerable difficulties for that country as a result. I simply make those points to indicate that we are familiar with the issue and have been actively pursuing it, but it is not one without its difficulties, particularly in light of the changed overall circumstances which have existed since June.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am aware of the reports. The most recent was a report in Tuesday's West Australian in which the member for Warren in the State Parliament of Western Australia, Mr Paul Omodei, had some things to say about nashi fruit which were just plain wrong. Since he persists-it is well enough known and has been well enough explained-with this line of public debate, all I can say is that he must be no respecter of facts and must believe that by simply conducting a big lie argument he is gaining some points.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Last week a Mrs Lewis, who is the National Party candidate for the seat of Calare, made outrageous, sensationalist and untrue claims about the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service and, in her eyes, about the importation of fireblight into Australia with New Zealand apples. The facts on fireblight are that the area under consideration for the importation of apples from New Zealand has been assessed as free of that disease. The Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service has already issued a discussion paper on the possibility of importation and invited discussion. It is to consult with the industry and then we will decide whether a protocol on that issue will be signed.</PARA>
<PARA> The pattern for all of this was set by Bruce Lloyd, the shadow spokesman for primary industry, on 24 October, when he sought to crank up fear and anxiety over a container of nashi fruit that was brought into Australia in which AQIS found some elements of infestation of the disease blackspot. Bruce Lloyd declared no confidence in AQIS. The little sir echo Omodei has repeated the Bruce Lloyd allegation. The facts about the nashi fruit are that an experimental importation came into Australia and that AQIS detected the contamination of some of that fruit with the disease blackspot. That indicates that AQIS is efficient, that AQIS is doing its job and that the procedures it employs work. That is not a reason to condemn AQIS; it is a reason to congratulate it.</PARA>
<PARA> Currently there appears to be a campaign to besmirch the very fine reputation of the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service. That campaign is conducted on matters that are either misunderstood or misrepresented. It is epitomised by exaggeration, by sensationalism and by trying to bring down the very fine reputation of the Quarantine and Inspection Service.</PARA>
<PARA> Australia is a leader in world forums advocating free trade. The Opposition claims to agree with our policy on that. It is supported by the National Farmers Federation as well. In order to win that argument, we need to do as we say and have our markets open. AQIS cannot be used as a non-tariff barrier to trade in this country. That is what is behind many of these allegations.</PARA>
<PARA> The attitude of the Opposition is myopic. No wool grower, wheat grower, beef producer or horticulture producer in this country will thank the Opposition for attacking the reputation of AQIS. If we lose an international market, our reputation for clean, disease-free protection, our market reputation and our penetration of foreign markets will be limited and reduced. If that is brought about by the attack the Opposition is mounting on AQIS, it will be its responsibility. So the Opposition's own constituency will attack it.</PARA>
<PARA> Under the Opposition's Economic Action Plan, released by the Leader of the Opposition recently, it provides, in effect, for a cut of $23m to the funding of the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service. The Inspection Service which the Opposition is attacking it is intending to cut quite significantly to the tune of $23m and impair its effectiveness.</PARA>
<PARA> The Government conducted a thorough review of AQIS, published in the Lindsay report. To meet some of these criticisms I have now directed AQIS to call in the commodity sections of the agricultural industry for an open day with AQIS with each of those sections so they can go back over what the proceedings and procedures of AQIS are and be satisfied that it is indeed a high quality service and is not a non-tariff barrier to trade.</PARA>

<PARA> Leave granted.</PARA>
<PARA> The document read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA> I am advised that the statement by Mr Gengos was in the context of a question by the Coroner regarding what would it have taken to detect the falsifications of records alleged at the inquiry to have occurred, how many officers did the CAA have available to conduct surveillance on Oxley Airlines, and what would have been the likelihood of successfully detecting the falsifications.</PARA>
<PARA> Mr Gengos advised the Coroner that he had about eight staff available for such tasks throughout NSW, and that, given the amount of falsification which was alleged to have occurred, it would have required at least 28 man-days of surveillance, with very little chance of a successful prosecution at the end.</PARA>
<PARA> It needs to be understood that The Civil Aviation Authority establishes and promulgates standards relating to air safety. The industry, that is, individual pilots and operators, have the responsibility to adhere to those standards. The CAA also monitors the industry's adherence to prescribed standards and takes the necessary action when it is found that the standards have not been complied with.</PARA>
<PARA> I am advised that in May 1989 it was found that officers of the NSW Field Office had interpreted a section of the Civil Aviation Orders regarding specific equipment in aircraft differently from all other Field Offices. This became apparent as a result of the operation of a Queensland based operator, operating into NSW. The Canberra Office of the CAA clarified the policy in this area and advised all Field Offices accordingly. The Coroner accepted this clarification and went on to say that the lack of Australian Distance Measuring Equipment in the Oxley Airlines aircraft was not illegal, nor was it a factor in the accident. Mr Gengos gave factual evidence on this and all other matters addressed.</PARA>
<PARA> I understand that Oxley Airlines has been subject to a greater degree of surveillance than any other Supplementary Airline in NSW since the accident. Recently, as a result of surveillance conducted in May and June 1989, the company and it's maintenance organisation were asked to show cause why action should not be taken against their Air Operator's Certificate and Maintenance Approval.</PARA>
<PARA> The company was able to satisfy the CAA that their operations at present were not being conducted in breach of any regulations. There are therefore no grounds on which action could legitimately be taken against the company.</PARA>
<PARA> Mr Gengos was selected to act in his present position as from 3 January 1989. A normal Public Service selection process was then followed and Mr Gengos was selected as the permanent occupant as from 1 June 1989. The Coroner's hearing commenced at a three day session in April 1989 and was put over until August, when Mr Gengos gave evidence. The Coroner handed down his findings on 14 November 1989.

<PARA> I seek leave to incorporate the second reading speech in Hansard. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The speech read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA> The purpose of the Bill is to implement changes to the operations of the Australian Heritage Commission as agreed by the government following a comprehensive public review of the Commonwealth Government's role in the conservation of the national estate. </PARA>
<PARA> Each of the amendments proposed in the Bill is concerned with one or more of the following matters:</PARA>
<PARA> clarification and improvement of the Commission's operational procedures;</PARA>
<PARA> the inclusion of powers for the Commission to administer the National Estate Grants Program</PARA>
<PARA> the removal of a sub-section unnecessarily discriminating against Aboriginal sites;</PARA>
<PARA> the exemption of authorities of the self-governing territories and Australian Airlines from the requirements of the Act, in accordance with government policy; and</PARA>
<PARA> administrative changes to clarify certain operations of the Act and correct some minor technical defects. </PARA>
<PARA> Before examining the provisions of the Bill in detail, let me first explain the history of, and the principles underlying, the Australian Heritage Commission Act and the reasons why the proposed amendments are considered essential. </PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Heritage Commission Act was passed by the Commonwealth Parliament in 1975 following a major public review conducted during 1973 and 1974 by the committee of inquiry into the national estate under the chairmanship of Mr Justice R. M. Hope. The principal recommendation of the committee of inquiry was that a commission be established to administer national estate matters and that its enabling legislation contain provisions obliging all Commonwealth agencies to act so as to ensure maximum possible conservation of all items in the national estate. </PARA>
<PARA> Subsequently the original act was amended in 1976 following a review by the new Government of Prime Minister Malcolm Fraser. The amendment act of 1976 re-affirmed the key elements of the original act as recommended by the Hope Committee. The main amendments related to:</PARA>
<PARA> the removal of specific powers from the Commission to advise the Government on expenditure and grants of financial assistance. (The current Bill aims to restore this power);</PARA>
<PARA> a reduction in the number of Commissioners from 19 to 7;</PARA>
<PARA> a provision to limit the Commission's power to enter aboriginal places in the register of the National Estate. (The Bill aims to repeal this provision);</PARA>
<PARA> the removal of permanent head powers from the Chairman of the Commission; and</PARA>
<PARA> a provision requiring the Commission to seek the approval of the Minister before appointing Committees (the Bill aims to remove that limitation). </PARA>
<PARA> Since 1976 there have been a number of other changes to the Act but these have concerned specific administrative issues such as public service reform. They have not affected the fundamental principles of the Act. </PARA>
<PARA> The Commission thus remains comprised of a part-time chairman and up to six part-time Commissioners with various skills and interests related to the natural, aboriginal or historic environment. The Commission's main responsibilities can be summarised as:</PARA>
<PARA> preparing and maintaining a register of natural estate places;</PARA>
<PARA> advising the Commonwealth Minister responsible for the environment on all matters relating to the National Estate;</PARA>
<PARA> advising other Commonwealth Ministers and Government authorities on Commonwealth Government proposals which might affect the National Estate; and</PARA>
<PARA> developing policies and programs for research, professional training and public information and education;</PARA>
<PARA>In addition, the Act requires that:</PARA>
<PARA> before a Commonwealth Minister, department or authority takes any action which might significantly affect the National Estate values of a registered place the Commission is informed of the proposal and given reasonable opportunity to consider it. </PARA>
<PARA>The Act also requires that:</PARA>
<PARA> no action be taken by a Commonwealth Minister, department or authority that adversely affects a place in the register, unless there is `no feasible and prudent alternative', and if there is no such alternative then all necessary measures must be taken to minimise the effects. </PARA>
<PARA> These responsibilities of the Commission, Commonwealth Ministers and agencies have remained unchanged since 1976. However, they were again subject to review in 1978 and 1979-this time by the House of Representatives Standing Committee on environment and conservation, chaired by the Hon. John Hodges MP. In general, the Committee concluded that the Act and the operating procedures of the Commission were satisfactory and appropriate. All the recommendations of the Hodges Committee for amendments to the Australian Heritage Act will be implemented by this Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> In June 1985, the Minister for Arts, Heritage and Environment, the Hon. Barry Cohen, MP, announced yet another review of the Australian Heritage Commission Act. The purpose was to assess whether, after ten years, the mechanisms were still adequate and appropriate and to recommend changes where necessary. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister invited public submissions from all interested parties including State and Territory governments, local government, conservation groups and development groups. Over 150 submissions were received and a two-day seminar held to discuss the review attracted over 100 participants. The report of the review, which also took into account the Hodges Committee report and representations made to the Government on the operations of the Act, was distributed to all interested parties in August 1986, with an invitation for comments before final recommendations were made for amendments to the Act. </PARA>
<PARA> Honourable senators can readily see that the amendments proposed in this Bill have not been lightly arrived at. Since its passage by the Parliament in 1975 the Australian Heritage Commission Act has been the subject of intense public scrutiny and almost constant review by Government or the Parliament. This process has identified a number of desirable changes to the Act to improve the Australian Heritage Commission's efficiency and effectiveness. However, it has also demonstrated beyond doubt the Commission's essential ongoing role in the Commonwealth Government's efforts to conserve and protect the National Estate.</PARA>
<PARA> The Commission's achievements have been considerable:</PARA>
<PARA> It has established a substantial database of places of National Estate significance. This includes over 9,000 places entered in the register of the National Estate and the interim list of the register of the National Estate. </PARA>
<PARA> Using its database, the Commission provides advice on the National Estate to a wide range of Commonwealth Ministers, Departments and authorities. In 1988-89 the Commission provided such advice under section 30 of its Act on 336 occasions. </PARA>
<PARA> In addition, the Commission's expertise on National Estate matters is acknowledged by State and local Government and private firms and individuals. The Commission's advice is often sought even though there is no statutory requirement. This occurred 83 times in 1988-89. </PARA>
<PARA> Educational activities to foster understanding of the National Estate have also been at the forefront of the Commission's priorities. The publication of The Heritage of Australia-the Illustrated Register of the National Estate in 1981 followed by individual State editions for Tasmania, South Australia and the Northern Territory, and Western Australia have been significant milestones. Film co-productions such as The Land of the Lightening Brothers and the highly acclaimed Nature of Australia: Portrait of an Island Continent have added substantially to Australians' awareness of and concern for the National Estate. </PARA>
<PARA> As the Commonwealth Government's principal advisory body on matters related to the National Estate, the Australian Heritage Commission has often faced a difficult task in carrying out its responsibilities. The Commission has been required to provide the Government with National Estate advice on some highly controversial issues-the destruction of the Bellevue Hotel in Brisbane, the Franklin Dam and the wet tropics of Queensland to name but a few. Nevertheless, its activities are not limited to such issues. Much of the Commission's most effective work is carried out in collaboration with Government and the private sector, out of the public limelight. This often leads to real achievement in the conservation of the National Estate-without controversy, without confrontation and without any public attention or fanfare. </PARA>
<PARA> This has been recognised by the Government in considering the review of its role in the conservation of the National Estate. While some legitimate concerns have been raised about the Commission's operations, these can be readily addressed through the amendments proposed in this Bill. The fundamental need for the National Estate to be conserved through the continued operation of the Commission is undeniable. Community and Government support for this proposition has grown even stronger since its initial articulation in the Hope Report of 1974. </PARA>
<PARA> This is not to say that there has not been some misunderstanding of the Commission's role. Indeed, I suspect that this misunderstanding, particularly regarding the effect of having a place listed on the register of the National Estate, has been deliberately and mischievously fostered by some development interests opposed to Commonwealth Government actions to conserve the National Estate. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course, this is the nub of the matter. People and organisations opposed to the Government's overall environmental policies often cannot or will not distinguish the basic concept of the register of the National Estate from decisions made by government on issues involving the National Estate. In fact the Australian Heritage Commission simply identifies the National Estate and advises on National Estate values. It has no power of intervention or proscription. It is the Government which is responsible for deciding about ``feasible and prudent alternatives'' to actions affecting National Estate values. </PARA>
<PARA> It is also incorrect to claim that listing on the register of the National Estate somehow locks up areas or forecloses options for economic and social development. There are many examples throughout Australia of listed areas being used for economically productive purposes which do not have an unacceptable impact on the heritage values of the area. </PARA>
<PARA> Calls for greater ministerial control of the Commission or the inclusion of other than National Estate criteria-for example, economic significance-in the registration process are therefore particularly ill founded. Parliament advisedly gave the Australian Heritage Commission an independent statutory role in registering places of National Estate significance and bringing them to the attention of Commonwealth Ministers and agencies. The judgments required in registration decisions are not and should not be political. They should be objective and backed by expert scientific assessment. Only through such a process can heritage values be considered alongside other values-land use, economic and so on-when Government decisions are being taken. </PARA>
<PARA> Turning now to the specifics of the Bill, clauses 1 and 2 deal with the short title and commencement date. </PARA>
<PARA> Clause 3 relates to interpretation and raises a number of issues. </PARA>
<PARA> The definition of `authority of the Commonwealth' will be amended to remove the authorities or bodies established under the laws of the Australian Capital Territory, the Northern Territory and Norfolk Island and Australian Airlines from the requirements of the Act. This is in accordance with the Government's policy of treating the self-governing Territories as States in most respects and with its decision to make Australian Airlines more commercially competitive. </PARA>
<PARA> Terms used in the proposed new part of the Act dealing with the National Estate Grants Program are also defined. Definitions of the interim list and of the term `owner' as used in describing those persons that the Commission must inform before publishing a notice of intention to register a place are also included. </PARA>
<PARA> Clause 4 of the Bill will insert into the Act specific criteria against which places under consideration for entry in the register will be measured. This will clarify the definition of the National Estate already included in the Act and will reflect procedures which have been used by the Commission for some time. </PARA>
<PARA> Clause 5 will reinstate the original wording of paragraph 7 (A) of the Act as originally passed and extend its provisions to allow the Commission to give advice on identification of the National Estate as well as its conservation, improvement and presentation. The reinstatement of subparagraphs concerning advice on expenditure and financial grants will be consistent with the Government's decision to transfer the administration of the National Estate grants program to the Commission. </PARA>
<PARA> Clause 5 will also insert specific functions in the Act for the Commission to administer the NEGP. </PARA>
<PARA> Clause 6 makes it clear that the Commission may enter into contracts. The Act has no specific provision for this at present. </PARA>
<PARA> Subsection 22 (5) of the Act provides for the removal of a place from the register. Clause 7 of the Bill will provide for the removal of part of a place from the register. </PARA>
<PARA> Clauses 8 to 12 of the Bill reflect the need recognised in the review for the operational procedures of the Commission to be more ``transparent'' to public scrutiny. Hopefully these changes will help inform people of the Commission's role and avoid some of the misconceptions I noted earlier. </PARA>
<PARA> The proposed amendments provide detailed procedures for the entry or removal of a place in the register including the notifying of owners, the provision of location maps and statements of significance, the handling of objections, the appointment of independent assessors by the Minister and clarification of the operation of the interim list. </PARA>
<PARA> Although objections to proposed registrations may be submitted on any grounds, the Bill makes it clear that the Commission must give prime consideration to the National Estate significance of places. </PARA>
<PARA> Clause 8 also provides for the repeal of subsection 23 (5) which currently restricts the Commission's ability to enter Aboriginal sites in the register. This subsection was introduced as an amendment in 1976 to avoid possible conflicts between decisions by the Commission on the registration of land and recommendations by Land Commissioners on Aboriginal land rights. The subsection is an unnecessary discrimination against Aboriginal sites and, on the experience to date, its removal will not result in the conflicts forecast in 1976. </PARA>
<PARA> Clause 13 of the Bill will legitimise an existing practice whereby the Commission is normally given an opportunity to comment on proposed actions by Commonwealth ministers and agencies that might significantly affect a registered place. The proposed amendment will require the Commission to provide comments as soon as practicable. </PARA>
<PARA> Clause 14 deals with the National Estate Grants Program and will transfer its administration from the Urban and Regional Development (Financial Assistance) Act to the Australian Heritage Commission Act. No major changes are proposed to the nature or administration of the program except a provision for the Minister to make grants to approved bodies directly as well as at present through State and internal territory governments. </PARA>
<PARA> Section 39 of the Act includes a requirement that the Commission must obtain the approval of the Minister before entering into a contract involving the payment or receipt of an amount exceeding $50,000. Clause 15 of the Bill will increase the amount to $200,000, reflecting inflation and the growth of the Commission. </PARA>
<PARA> Clause 16 will permit the Commission to appoint committees without restriction, returning to the original 1975 wording of the Act. </PARA>
<PARA> Clause 17 will correct technical deficiencies in public notices published prior to 20 November 1979. These deficiencies were minor in nature and the Bill will validate the notices which included them. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr President, this Bill re-affirms the basic principles underlying the Australian Heritage Commission Act while at the same time introducing a series of improvements to the operational procedures of the Commission. These improvements will clarify the Commission's role, make it more open and more accountable yet retain its independence as the Commonwealth Government's principal advisory body on the National Estate. </PARA>
<PARA> Australia is fortunate in having a unique heritage which in large part has not been degraded or destroyed like some other countries. However, this means that we have an even greater responsibility to protect it for future generations. This Bill should be seen as a measure of the Commonwealth Government's determination to do so. </PARA>

<PARA> That this Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>I seek leave to incorporate the second reading speech in Hansard. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The speech read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA> This Bill amends the taxation laws in a number of respects. </PARA>
<PARA> This Bill contains the measures announced in the 1989-90 Budget for a new tax collection system for companies, complying superannuation funds, complying approved deposit funds and pooled superannuation trusts, in conjunction with a move to full self-assessment. The changes also apply to trustees of unit trusts that are taxed as companies. </PARA>
<PARA> Other Budget announcements that the Bill deals with extend income tax deductions for fees paid to professional tax advisers and for expenses incurred by life assurance companies in gaining the investment component of certain premium income. Another Budget measure recognises the nature of certain share based financing arrangements as loans rather than as equity investments for tax purposes. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill also proposes amendments on the subjects of superannuation tax, approved deposit funds, the gift provisions and the prescribed payment system. Minor amendments as a consequence of earlier changes to the Social Security Act, and of the reduction in the top marginal rate of personal income tax on 1 January 1990, are also included. </PARA>
<PARA> Since the Budget, detailed consideration has been given to the most appropriate arrangements for the payment of tax by companies and superannuation funds. </PARA>
<PARA> In this process, the Government has considered the submissions of leading business organisations and professional bodies. </PARA>
<PARA> In the light of these further deliberations, the arrangements contained in this Bill differ in several respects from those outlined in the Budget Papers.</PARA>
<PARA> These differences address concerns expressed about the original proposal and were the subject of announcements by the Treasurer on 2 November 1989 and by the Acting Treasurer on 22 November 1989. </PARA>
<PARA> The major modifications announced respond in a significant way to the submissions of the business and professional bodies whilst preserving the fundamental basis of the new tax arrangements for companies and superannuation funds as an important initiative in improving the equity of the tax system. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn now to the details. </PARA>
<PARA>Collection of tax</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> The new system will first apply to assessments in respect of income of the year of income ending on 30 June 1990. </PARA>
<PARA> An initial payment of tax is to be due by the 28th day of the first month after the end of the income year-generally 28 July-equal to 85 per cent of the notional tax amount, that is, broadly, the tax payable on income of the preceding year at the current year rate, or 85 per cent of the taxpayer's estimate of the actual tax liability. </PARA>
<PARA> Payment of the balance of tax due for the relevant year is to be made by the 15th day of the ninth month after the end of that year-generally 15 March. </PARA>
<PARA> For early balancing companies and funds, payments are to be due on equivalent dates after the end of the substituted accounting period, but no initial payment will be due earlier than 28 January following the end of an accounting period. </PARA>
<PARA> Late balancing companies and funds will be on the same relative footing as all other entities that are subject to the measures. </PARA>
<PARA> Specifically, the dates for their initial and final payments of tax will be determined on the basis of their substituted accounting period, but in all cases final payment will be required not later than 15 June of the year of payment. </PARA>
<PARA> For tax payments attributable to the 1989-90 income year, or substituted accounting period, companies and funds with a notional tax in the range $1,000 to $400,000, or that have a notional tax of $400,000 or more but estimate their actual liability to be within that range will be given an option as to the basis of paying their tax. </PARA>
<PARA> They may make the two payments on the 28th day of the first month and the 15th day of the ninth month as outlined earlier or they may pay their total liability on the 15th day of the sixth month after the end of the year of income, or substituted accounting period. </PARA>
<PARA> In subsequent income years, the option to choose either of the two methods of payment will be available to companies or funds with a notional tax in the range of $1,000 to $20,000, or that have a notional tax of $20,000 or more but estimate their actual liability to be within that range. </PARA>
<PARA> There will be no liability to make an initial payment of tax where the notional tax or estimated total tax is less than $1,000. </PARA>
<PARA> Companies and funds in this situation will pay their total tax liability by the 15th day of the ninth month following the end of the income year, or substituted accounting period, subject to the payment being not later than 15 June of the year of payment. </PARA>
<PARA> The gain to revenue from the new system of collecting tax is estimated at $855 million in 1989-90 and $150 million in 1990-91. </PARA>
<PARA>Self-assessment</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> Under self-assessment of income tax returns, which has operated since 1986, taxpayers lodge a return which is not generally subject to technical scrutiny and determine their taxable income. The Commissioner of Taxation simply calculates the tax payable and issues an assessment. </PARA>
<PARA> The changes announced in the Budget merely take the present arrangements one step further for companies and funds under the new collection arrangements. </PARA>
<PARA> These entities will calculate their own tax payable and pay this amount to the Commissioner, in an instalment, if applicable, and a balancing payment with their return of income. </PARA>
<PARA> An assessment, which will retain all existing rights of objection or appeal, will be deemed to be made on the day the return is lodged. </PARA>
<PARA> To facilitate this change, the Bill makes provision for the self determination of foreign tax credits, and the offset of franking deficit tax against company tax liability. </PARA>
<PARA> These are not significant changes to the existing self-assessment system, but they do present an opportunity for other major improvements, to which I now turn. </PARA>
<PARA>Amendment of assessments</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> In debate over self-assessment, calls have been made for a review of the concept of ``full and true disclosure'' which exists in the present rules for amendment of assessments. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government accepts that this concept has reduced relevance in the context of a system of self-assessment, and has decided to remove it from the amendment rules for all taxpayers. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill will give effect to this decision and will alter to four years in all cases the limitation period applying generally to amendments increasing a taxpayer's liability, other than in cases of fraud or evasion or other special provisions where the right to amend at any time is retained. </PARA>
<PARA> The Commissioner will be able to seek an extension of this new four year statutory limit from the Federal Court of Australia, or by agreement of the taxpayer. </PARA>
<PARA> Consistent with this change, the period in which an amendment may be made to reduce a taxpayer's liability is to be increased from three to four years. </PARA>
<PARA>Keeping of records</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> In line with the changes to the time limits for amending assessments, records relating to tax information will be required to be kept for only five years, instead of the present seven years. </PARA>
<PARA> This period will be extended where the period for amendment is extended by the Court or under agreement with the taxpayer. The rules for the keeping of records are also being modified to require companies and funds subject to the new collection and self-assessment arrangements to retain for subsequent review documents used to calculate their taxable income and tax payable that they do not have to provide in simplified returns. </PARA>
<PARA>Other changes</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> Some related matters raised by the new system are under review. </PARA>
<PARA> Of particular importance are reviews being undertaken by the Commissioner of Taxation in relation to the information currently required to be furnished with returns generally, the tax agents' lodgment program, and the operation of present arrangements for the remission of penalties. </PARA>
<PARA> Under existing arrangements, a taxpayer in doubt about the proper tax treatment of a particular matter may request advice from the Commissioner. </PARA>
<PARA> The Commissioner is also reviewing the question of providing an avenue-by means of the remission of interest payable where an assessment is amended-to encourage entities subject to the new self-assessment system to lodge these requests ahead of their returns, and will release further information on this matter as soon as possible. </PARA>
<PARA> Some other issues which have been raised in the context of self-assessment are nearing settlement. In particular, you will be aware that the professional bodies have been working closely with the Commissioner on audit access guidelines and they have now been released. </PARA>
<PARA>Tax advice</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> Hand in hand with these arrangements goes the Budget proposal to allow tax deductibility for the management and administration of a taxpayer's income tax affairs, which also will be given effect in this Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> Examples of expenditure that will be an allowable deduction are fees paid to a recognised professional tax adviser for income tax advice, costs of disputing an assessment such as tribunal fees and court costs, and costs associated with an audit of a taxpayer's affairs by the Taxation Office. </PARA>
<PARA> Deductions will not be allowed for capital expenditure but depreciation of items, such as a computer, used in connection with the management or administration of a taxpayer's income tax affairs will be allowable. </PARA>
<PARA> No deduction will be allowed for expenditure incurred in relation to an offence under a law of the Commonwealth, a State or Territory or of a foreign country. </PARA>
<PARA> A related amendment will permit taxpayers to have amounts paid for professional advice concerning the impact of taxes on the acquisition or disposal of an asset included in the cost base used to calculate the taxpayer's capital gain or loss on the assets. </PARA>
<PARA> These changes will apply to expenditure incurred on or after 1 July 1989 and the cost to revenue is estimated to be $40 million per annum, commencing in 1990-91. </PARA>
<PARA>Life assurance companies</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> As announced in the Budget life assurance companies are to be allowed a taxation deduction for expenditure incurred on or after 1 January 1990 in gaining the investment component of life insurance premium income. This measure will put life assurance companies on an equal footing with other investment mediums but it does not extend to friendly societies and other registered organisations which benefit from a lower tax rate. </PARA>
<PARA> The revenue costs of this proposal are estimated at $30 million in 1991-92 and $125 million in  1992-93. </PARA>
<PARA>Share based financing arrangements</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> Share based financing arrangements entered into to obtain finance are more appropriately regarded as lending arrangements than as investments of share capital. It follows that dividends paid under such arrangements ought to be treated in an equivalent manner to payments of interest on loans. </PARA>
<PARA> Consistent with that concept, and as announced in the Budget, the dividend imputation system is to be modified so that all dividends paid in respect of shares issued under share based financing arrangements carry no entitlement to imputation credits or the intercorporate dividend rebate. </PARA>
<PARA> This measure will apply to dividends paid on shares issued on or after 16 August 1989 or under finance arrangements entered into on or after that date, and will prevent losses of revenue the potential size of which cannot be quantified but could have become substantial. </PARA>
<PARA>Tax exemption for approved deposit funds</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> The Bill also gives effect to a measure, announced on 26 June 1989, to enable more people to take advantage of the special tax exemption given to qualifying fixed interest approved deposit funds under the May 1988 changes to the tax arrangements for superannuation. </PARA>
<PARA> The amount of exempt income of a qualifying approved deposit fund is calculated by reference to balances that remain from time to time of amounts that were on deposit for eligible depositors at 25 May 1988. To assist people who may have withdrawn amounts from an approved deposit fund after 25 May 1988 before the special exemption was announced, the existing law treats withdrawn amounts that were redeposited in the same approved deposit fund before 1 July 1989 as though they were on deposit on 25 May 1988. </PARA>
<PARA> An amendment in this Bill extends the 1 July 1989 deadline for redepositing such moneys to 1 September 1989. </PARA>
<PARA> As details of people who took advantage of this extension are unavailable it is not possible to estimate the revenue effect of this measure. </PARA>
<PARA>Taxable contributions to superannuation funds</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> The Bill will also correct a technical deficiency in the superannuation tax provisions. </PARA>
<PARA> The amendment, announced on 16 October 1989, will ensure that fully funded complying superannuation funds cannot avoid tax on contributions by exploiting the tax exemption intended to cover cases where an employer does not fund benefits until retirement. Under the exemption, the fund is not assessed on the contributions and the benefits paid are treated as `untaxed' benefits and subject to a higher rate of tax. </PARA>
<PARA> This aspect of the law was drawn to the Government's attention because of concerns at the potential effect on the superannuation industry. </PARA>
<PARA> The intention of the law in this area has always been clear, and the amendment to the Bill is therefore to apply from the commencement of the new arrangement for superannuation funds on 1 July 1988. </PARA>
<PARA>Gifts</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> An amendment to the gift provisions of the income tax law is proposed by the Bill to allow gifts of the value of $2 or more made on or after 7 April 1989 to funds that provide money for the acquisition, construction or maintenance of hostels for school students from rural areas. </PARA>
<PARA> The proposal is part of the Government's $637 million Education and Training Strategy for Rural Australia announced in April by the Minister for Employment, Education and Training and the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy. </PARA>
<PARA> The revenue cost of the proposal is estimated to be less than $500,000 in a full financial year. </PARA>
<PARA>Owner builders</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> Finally, the Bill will modify the prescribed payment system provisions of the law to ensure that a householder will not be treated as an owner-builder if the actual work on a major part of a domestic construction project is actually carried out by a builder or by others on his or her part. </PARA>
<PARA> I present the Explanatory Memorandum, which contains more detailed explanations of the provisions of the Bill. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I draw particular attention to the fact that the matter of public importance being debated here this afternoon refers to the `disastrous consequences for interest rates paid by home buyers, farmers and small businesses'. We hear a lot about the disastrous interest rates being paid by home buyers. There is no question that those rates are disastrous; there is no argument about that. But I often think that that charge is too narrowly based. After all, home buyers are paying what for them is a disastrous rate of 17 per cent. The Treasurer (Mr Keating) has recently seen fit to do one of his rather grubby deals with the four major trading banks whereby those banks will receive, in addition to their pre-tax profits, $230m or thereabouts in the next full year in return for some kind of undertaking by them that they will not raise the home interest rate even higher than its already exorbitant level, at least for the time being.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> If I may say so, I think we should in passing spare more than just a thought for the other groups mentioned in the matter of public importance-namely, farmers and small businesses. They are not paying interest rates of 17 per cent but are paying interest rates of anywhere between 21 and 25 per cent. What is more, the Treasurer is not doing deals on their behalf to keep the rates down even to those very high levels. I hope that when people in South Australia tomorrow and in Queensland tomorrow week are considering how they should cast their ballots, they might consider very seriously sending a message to Canberra on this matter. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Notwithstanding the interjections from an over-excited senator across the chamber, there is not the slightest doubt that the people of this country understand where these interest rates are coming from. They are coming from the Treasurer and the Government of this country. There used to be a bumper sticker that had a certain appeal. It was in the terms `Don't vote-it only encourages them'. I certainly hope that tomorrow and on Saturday week people do not vote Labor because, if they do, it will only encourage the Prime Minister, Mr Hawke, and the Treasurer, Mr Keating. Whatever else people do, they ought to keep that point very clearly and firmly in mind.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Even over the past six weeks or so interest rates have not so much been pushed higher but have been very strongly shored up at their existing very high levels by official action. The Reserve Bank of Australia-which really determines, through its actions in the money markets, what the level of official cash rates in those markets will be-has acted so as to produce a rise of almost a full percentage point in the official cash rates over the past eight weeks. I seek leave of the Senate to have incorporated in Hansard a small tabulation which demonstrates that fact. I spoke to the Minister about it beforehand. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;For months now Ministers have been holding out in one way or another the prospect of some decline in interest rates in what was, at the time in question, the not too distant future. In fact, we can go right back to the Western Australian elections in the earlier part of this year, when in late January in Perth the Prime Minister forecast that interest rates would fall before the end of 1989. Subsequently, of course, the Prime Minister has had to admit that that forecast was totally incorrect, as events have proved, and was made simply in a desperate-and, indeed, a barely successful-attempt to keep the Dowding Government in office. However, those promises are beginning to ring very hollow. Yesterday, in the light of the balance of payments figures which were published for the month of October, the Acting Treasurer (Mr Dawkins)-Mr Keating being overseas, and I will come back to that later-pointed out in a press release as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> . . . the Government does not believe that today's figures provide any basis to allow moderation of monetary policy. </PARA>
<PARA>There could not be anything much clearer that that. Mr Dawkins was saying that there will be no reduction in interest rates on the basis of those figures. He continued:</PARA>
<PARA> Today's current account outcome, even though an improvement-</PARA>
<PARA>that is debatable-</PARA>
<PARA>continues to be above sustainable levels. </PARA>
<PARA>He concluded by saying:</PARA>
<PARA> Consequently the Government is determined that policy will continue to be directed at reducing our current account imbalance and the related build up in Australia's external debt. </PARA>
<PARA>What he means by those words is that that will be done by reducing overall demand in the economy, and hence the demand for imports, through the maintenance of these present crushingly high interest rates. That is almost a matter of little remark today, because people have become numbered by these interest rates to the point where they no longer really look for any reduction in the near future. In today's Australian Financial Review, Mr Steve Burrell has written an article, obviously based upon some discussions he has presumably had with `senior officials', as he calls them. He states:</PARA>
<PARA> Monetary policy is set to remain tight well into 1990 . . . </PARA>
<PARA>Later he says:</PARA>
<PARA> There is a strong view among senior officials that the Government must err conspicuously on the side of caution on monetary policy, keeping interest rates at present levels until it is absolutely clear that the slowdown evident in some sectors has spread throughout the economy. </PARA>
<PARA> While the authorities concede there is a risk that keeping interest rates high well into the middle of next year-</PARA>
<PARA>I ask you to mark those words, Mr Deputy President, `well into the middle of next year'-</PARA>
<PARA>could tip the economy into a deep downturn, they-</PARA>
<PARA>the senior officials he is quoting-</PARA>
<PARA>believe the risks of easing policy too early and too fast are greater. </PARA>
<PARA>What has Mr Keating said about yesterday's figures? Mr Keating, of course, was in London yesterday. He has been embarking upon a little globe trotting, I think principally with the objective of keeping out of the country while the election campaign in South Australia is going on. Mr Keating had very little comment on the figures themselves. He contented himself with talking about wages policy. He said:</PARA>
<PARA>The obvious point of all this is that if you can't run a proper wages policy, you can't run the Australian economy. Wages are the key to reducing inflation.</PARA>
<PARA>He is, of course, quite right in those two comments. Wages are part of the key to reducing inflation. The other part, of course, is productivity. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="LJ4">Senator STONE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;He never talks about it, as Senator Parer says. In the last 24 hours there has been a remarkable event which does have some bearing on the capacity of governments in this country and, indeed, citizens, to run a wages policy, that is, the judgment by Mr Justice Brooking in the Supreme Court of Victoria yesterday-what I call the Hawke-Brooking judgment-which will have some bearing upon that matter. I do not have time in these remarks to expand further on that matter.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Other people have made judgments about the Australian economy today. The Business Council of Australia in its latest bulletin has produced a major article on the so-called accord, entitled, `The Accord-Success or Failure?'. In the executive summary to that article the Business Council of Australia talks about Australia's relatively poor performance in nominal wages growth, productivity, unit labour costs, inflation, interest rates and, therefore in international competitiveness. It states:</PARA>
<PARA>The growth in investment and employment-</PARA>
<PARA>which are supposed to be a couple of the hallmarks in this area-</PARA>
<PARA>has also been achieved at the cost of high external debt which has left us vulnerable to adverse movement in the world economy. </PARA>
<PARA>It concludes with the following:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . the price being paid for the Government's special relationship with the trade union movement-</PARA>
<PARA>that is the process by which we run a wages policy according to the Treasurer in London yesterday-</PARA>
<PARA>includes allowing the ACTU, and not the Government, to determine the nature and pace of labour market reform. </PARA>
<PARA>The conclusion of the Business Council of Australia is that the costs of the accord are now increasingly outweighing its benefits. There is no dissent on that point. A debt summit is being called by the Business Council of Australia next March in order to attempt to energise the Australian public to the serious nature of the debt crisis beginning to confront us. Indeed, it has been confronting us for some years now. </PARA>
<PARA> Sir Arvi Parbo, one of the very senior members of the Business Council of Australia and the Chairman of Broken Hill Proprietary Co. Ltd, when discussing this matter a week or so ago on radio, said: `Australia's name stinks today overseas'. What a deplorable position when probably the most respected businessman in Australia-I do not wish to be drawing invidious comparisons but I think most people would agree with that-is asked a question of that kind on public radio and has to say that Australia's name stinks abroad today. No wonder Mr Keating has gone overseas trying to drum up a bit more confidence in this country. </PARA>

<PARA> We have had another document published in the last week or so by Citibank Ltd predicting a doubling of Australian assets owned by foreigners in the next five years. In other words, Citibank arrived at very much the same conclusion as did Macquarie Bank. Goldman Sachs, one of the major four or five New York investment banks, has talked about the same topic. This week the Melbourne Sun, under the heading `Hawke Blow', stated:</PARA>
<PARA> A leading United States bank has predicted an economic nosedive for Australia next year. </PARA>
<PARA> And it's the Government's fault, according to influential investment bankers, Goldman Sachs. </PARA>
<PARA>. . . . </PARA>
<PARA> The bank's ``Autumn Statement 1989'', says Australian authorities had:</PARA>
<PARA>Allowed a prolonged period of excess demand growth to persist;</PARA>
<PARA>Failed to respond to signs that activity had rebounded strongly in the wake of the 1987 share market crash;</PARA>
<PARA>Maintained easy monetary policy for too long during 1987-88 . . . </PARA>
<PARA>The newspaper article went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA> The report said current tight monetary policy had led to concerns that `a sharp economic slow-down' was imminent. </PARA>
<PARA> It compared Australia with the UK under the heading `Two Peas in a Pod' but said Australia . . . was the more likely to face a recession in 1990. </PARA>
<PARA> Australia's centralised wage fixing policy would make a recession more extended, it said . . . </PARA>
<PARA> These worries have been accentuated by a sharp recent decline in both consumer and business confidence in both countries the report said. </PARA>
<PARA>The writer of the article said:</PARA>
<PARA> The assessment will come as a severe blow to the Hawke Government, which quoted Goldman Sachs extensively during the 1987 election campaign. </PARA>
<PARA> The bank's International Economic Analyst, released in the middle of the campaign strongly endorsed the Government's economic management. </PARA>
<PARA>Whether it was wrong or right in its endorsement at that time, there is not the slightest doubt that the Government cannot now turn around and describe this as an unrespectable source. </PARA>
<PARA> What have been the consequences of all this? We have debt growing apace, we have the foreign debt clock ticking. We have a current account deficit of, let us say, $20 billion-it is probably more than that-for this financial year. That means that debt is accumulating in this country at $55m a day. That is the rate at which the clock is ticking. We are accruing debt at the rate of $2.3m per hour; $40,000 a minute. In the 20 minutes that it takes me to complete my speech our foreign debt will have clocked up by about $800,000. That is the pace at which things are going. </PARA>
<PARA> Where is all this debt coming from? It is coming from the fact that we are not paying our way in the world; we are not internationally competitive. As I said just a moment ago, we have a deficit in our balance of payments of at least $20 billion; it is probably more like $22 billion today. The Government says that we will see a slowdown in imports in the second half of the financial year and that will improve things. But where will the slowdown come from? If it was going to produce a really sharp fall-off in imports in the second half of the year, it would already have had to have started because there are lags in these matters. So the only way in which we can now achieve that kind of downturn in imports is if we have a real crash in the second half of the year. I am not suggesting that we will have a crash, but I am saying-and I can see the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories (Senator Richardson) shaking his head-either we will have a crash or we will not achieve the forecast. One or the other must be true. </PARA>
<PARA> The result of this is that the Government cannot now let interest rates fall. If it let interest rates fall, the Australian dollar would take a nosedive of a major kind. Indeed, the Prime Minister more or less said exactly that the other day in his address to the National Farmers Federation. He said that that, of course, would then result in interest rates being driven up again-which is true. It might be said, `It is okay to criticise, but what would you do?' Indeed, we often have that kind of slick charge or response from the Government or, for that matter, from the toy politicians on my left, the Australian Democrats. </PARA>
<PARA> That reminds me of the example of the patient who has been going along to a doctor for 6 1/2 years and who suddenly finds that he has cancer. He goes to another doctor for a second opinion and then says, `What are you going to do about it? The first doctor has neglected me for 6 1/2 years and allowed me to get into this state, now what are you going to do about it?'. Mr Deputy President, I suggest to you that the first thing that person should do about it is change his doctor; sack the first doctor. Let us get that quite clear for a start. </PARA>
<PARA> I agree that, given the state to which the Australian economy has been reduced at present with interest rates at their present level and unlikely to begin to decline until well into the next year-the Australian Financial Review says the middle of next year-no-one will have a magic wand to produce a dramatic change in that situation, given the mess that Mr Hawke, Mr Keating and Mr Richardson have created.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I find it staggering that anyone in the Opposition, particularly Senator Stone, could ever raise the spectre of what ought to be done about micro-reform. If ever any group in Australia's political history avoided micro-economic reform like the plague, it was the Fraser-Howard Government of 1975 to 1983-not one achievement in the field of micro-economic reform. We have just had a little list from Senator Stone. That is about all we can get. We cannot get written, definite policies on what the Opposition will do about any of this. All we have is a list from Senator Stone. He says that it is slick of the Government to say, `What are you going to do about it?'. The great difficulty facing Senator Stone and the Opposition is that over the course of the next six months the Australian people are going to demand to know what it is going to do about this. The Opposition will have to do better than recite a list. That will not work. It will have to say something definite.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Before I move on to some of the things that have been said by the Opposition, let me try to put this debate about debt into some perspective, not in any way to attempt to downplay the debt problem but at least to make sure that we understand what the problem is we are seeking to deal with. Australia's gross external debt of $137 billion represents a net debt of about $108 billion after we take into account our official reserve assets, et cetera. That is a debt ratio of about 32 per cent of gross domestic product (GDP). That is about 2 per cent less than the peak in 1986. Debt as a proportion of GDP is dropping. At the end of 1987-these are the last figures available-any suggestion that Australia's performance in world terms on external debt was in any way bad can be immediately dismissed by a comparison with other Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) countries. Australia's gross external debt as a proportion of GDP was almost exactly equal then to the OECD average. It was lower than the figures for Belgium, Denmark, Finland, Greece, Ireland, New Zealand, Norway, Portugal or Sweden. It was half that of Argentina and Mexico-the two countries that Senator Stone keeps raising as some sort of reasonable comparison. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Stone has referred to the Macquarie Bank predictions of a few days ago. I think the bank suggested that external debt may get as high as 59 per cent of GDP by the year 2000. I suppose that in this game of economic forecasting anything goes. That is the Macquarie Bank's best guess. That is fine. Research done for the Economic Planning Advisory Council suggests that debt is more likely to stabilise at around 30 to 35 per cent of GDP by the mid-1990s. When we look at our external debt burden, we see that the Commonwealth is, in fact, a net creditor. In round figures there is $18 billion of debt offset by $21 billion of reserves. So we get down to the real problem. When members of the Business Council of Australia sit down to their debt summit they will look carefully at each other around the table, because sitting around the table will be those who carry 62 per cent of Australia's external debt. They will have a good long hard look at themselves. </PARA>
<PARA> The Commonwealth Government has been actively paying debt abroad, to such an extent that its foreign currency debt has fallen from $15 billion at the end of June 1987 to $9 billion at the end of June 1989. By the end of this financial year Commonwealth debt on issue will be equal to only 13 per cent of GDP-less than half of what it was four years ago. In fact, total Commonwealth debt just will not exist in four years time-provided, of course, that there is a responsible Labor Government re-elected, and provided that that responsible Labor Government continues to deliver Budget surpluses of the order that we have had in the last couple of years. None of what I just said seeks in any way to trivialise the problem of debt burden but it does seek to place it in some sort of realistic position, whereas what we are getting from the other side is sensationalist posturing. </PARA>
<PARA> The issue is clear: in order to slow the build-up in our debt we must reduce our balance of payments deficit. That, of course, is what the current settings of Commonwealth policy are aimed at doing. There are a number of key features. Let me run very briefly through those. First, we have been running, and will continue to run, the tightest fiscal policy since records in Australia have been kept. No other government of any political persuasion can claim to have run anything like the tight fiscal policy of this Government. Secondly, we have also had a workable wages policy which has delivered realistic and competitive wage outcomes at a time of unprecedented jobs growth. There we have just one of the glaring weaknesses of the Opposition's approach to this problem. The Opposition has never been able to come up with anything like a wages policy. All it can ever come up with is a bash the unions recipe for industrial relations disasters-for strikes, confrontation and the assurance of economic ruin. Thirdly, monetary policy is set firm to play its proper role in moderating demand. Last financial year it ran at 8 per cent compared with product growth of 3 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government concedes that it did not pick the strength of demand in the Australian economy. The Treasurer (Mr Keating) certainly did not pick just how well his policies had been received by the business sector, just how much they would kick demand along. But, in the end, if the biggest admission we have to make is that we did what we did too well, perhaps things are not as bad as some may seek to paint them. Fourthly, the Government has sought to lift product growth. We have had the most comprehensive economic reform program in Australia's history. It is long overdue. When one looks at the record one realises that the great sadness is that Labor has been in government so rarely that the real opportunities have been missed. Senator Stone's forebears, such as Black Jack McEwen, refused absolutely to look at the manufacturing base. All they cared about were minerals, wool and primary products. Consideration was never given to building up a manufacturing base. They had no policies on manufacturing. Such policies were totally ignored for three decades. That is what conservative government gave Australia. That is when the opportunities were missed. </PARA>
<PARA> This Government has been saddled with the task of reversing those decades of lost opportunities. To do that the first thing we looked at was structural reform. There has already been a comprehensive reform of the taxation system. We have had financial deregulation, we have had airline deregulation and we have had oil industry deregulation. We have reformed ports and coastal shipping. There have been productivity based wage rises, award restructuring, cuts to import tariffs, and a better skilled work force-one can go on and on. This is the first government to tackle any of those problems. But more than that, we have fostered greater investment. Investment was brought to a halt by the Fraser Government years. At the end of them there just was not any. Investment was completely stopped. Business lost all confidence-and not forgetting the million workers who were pushed out of work in the last two years of that Government. Investment has been stimulated by corporate tax cuts and imputation and by a fundamental rebalancing in the wage-profit share. </PARA>
<PARA> Last financial year business investment was 13 1/2 per cent of GDP. This year it is expected to be 13.9 per cent. We compare those figures with the slump of under 10 per cent that the Fraser Government years brought us. Domestic savings have been encouraged by tax cuts, more people being in employment, a fundamental shift towards superannuation savings and being able to deliver Budget surpluses. Those policies will turn around Australia's balance of payments deficit and in turn reduce the build-up in our external debt. </PARA>
<PARA> It must be remembered that the policy stance adopted by the Government not only is successfully addressing the problems of our external debt and balance of payments but also has led to a vigorous restructuring of Australian industry and has resulted in the creation of 1 1/2 million new jobs since the Government came to office. Before we came to office a million jobs were lost. We have reversed that trend by creating 1 1/2 million. That is what the Hawke Labor Government has delivered. But there is no suggestion in any Opposition policy, even in its rhetoric-no Opposition member has had the decency to mention it-of getting more Australians back to work. That is something that has never concerned conservative governments in Australia. It certainly does not concern the current Opposition parties. </PARA>
<PARA> In the last 24 hours we have had a balance of payments figure of over $2 billion. There has been a fair degree of hysteria from the Opposition about that figure. That hysteria is not shared by the National Farmers Federation whose leader, Mr Allwright, last night stated how relieved he was that the figure indicated a turnaround. Looking at the seasonally adjusted result, there is some room for optimism. It is still not sustainable-no-one in the Government would suggest that-nonetheless it suggests that there are better times ahead. </PARA>
<PARA> The main contribution to this outcome was a 6 per cent fall in seasonally adjusted imports, which is precisely what Government policies have been attempting to achieve. It should be noted that export earnings remained steady despite a fairly significant decline in wool receipts against last year's level. As I have said, there is some cause for optimism. Overall, the pattern in the figures is consistent with what was predicted at Budget time. Far from agreeing with what Senator Stone said earlier, what the Government's policies have been designed to deliver is a slow-down in demand without the short, sharp, shock routine-which usually turned into a long one under the previous three or four decades of coalition government rule-of bringing about a recession, forcing up unemployment and forcing those in the community least able to afford it to pay for the previous lack of any real appreciation of this problem. </PARA>
<PARA> There is a temptation to adopt some quick fix policy in this area and to say that monetary policy can be relaxed and interest rates lowered. No doubt, in accord with what Senator Stone said today, that is what the Opposition will attempt to do over the next six months. But six months is a long time. I have no doubt that, as we go through that period, the Government will be able to show the people that such a quick fix solution does not exist. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Stone began by reciting a procession of figures and said that foreign debt is accruing at the rate of $40,000 per minute. I overheard this senior economic shadow spokesman for the Opposition and a backbencher discussing just what figures they might use that could best highlight, best distort, the real position but best give them some political hope. When Australia faces serious economic difficulties, such trite political treatment does not stand up. It is not good enough. The recitation of those figures by Senator Stone means nothing whatsoever. I have already been through the real figures of Australia's foreign debt and what it really means to Australians and the fact that 62 per cent of it-almost two-thirds-is private sector debt. We also hear today of Senator Stone's concern for home buyers. It must be a great relief to home buyers. They have not heard a great deal from Senator Stone about that over the years. In Senator Stone's previous life as a public servant, they did not get any joy out of him at all. But fortunately most of them remember and know what to expect from Senator Stone, and that is why they would not touch him with a barge pole. </PARA>
<PARA> To go past that, one has to look at what the alternatives are. What alternatives do the Opposition offer to the Government's policy settings? On fiscal policy the Opposition says that it supports and endorses the Government's tight stance. Of course, the Opposition has abandoned its previous commitment that it was going to tighten fiscal policy further. But given the Opposition's dismal record in fiscal policy in the previous Government, no-one would have believed that. It is on wages policy that we start to see just how threadbare Opposition alternatives really are. We have this great leap forward into enterprise bargaining overnight with no system above and around it; just this leap into the unknown. The Opposition's wages policy is going to do two things. Somehow it is going to produce lower aggregate wage outcomes than the accord does and, at the same time, it is going to produce better wage outcomes for individual workers. One cannot do one and do the other-and, of course, the Opposition has no intention of doing either. I am staggered that the Opposition learnt nothing from the years 1981 and 1982. That experiment in enterprise bargaining led to a massive blow-out in wages in Australia, one that the country could not afford. It could not afford it in 1981-82 and it will not be able to afford it in 1990-91. </PARA>
<PARA> What is left is monetary policy. This apparently is somehow going to be used by the coalition to eliminate inflation. I concede, Senator Stone, that the coalition could probably do it. If it got interest rates up to 25 per cent, it would stand half a chance. If the coalition had massive unemployment, a prolonged recession, it might do it. Of course, those are the tools to which Senator Stone and his predecessors have always had to resort. All the Opposition knows is to kick unemployment up and make a recession really hurt ordinary people. That has always been the way the coalition would go, and it is the way that any future government would go. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course, the coalition would not be the first to try it. Maggie Thatcher has had a go, and she has done really well with it! If one lives in the south of England, one is laughing; one has had a good few years. But if one lives in Glasgow, Birmingham or one of those other industrial cities, one has suffered dramatically. Unemployment has soared and the country has suffered greatly for it. But one also finds out that it does not work over time and that, as Mrs Thatcher has found out, five years later back comes inflation anyway. What can she do about it now? She tried sacking the Chancellor of the Exchequer. I am not sure that works either. In the end, no matter who is promoted or sacked, one just cannot do it. </PARA>
<PARA> What is worse is that this coalition and Senator Stone propose to abolish the capital gains tax for this so-called speculative gains tax. The only achievement of the Fraser years was, in the words of Costigan, to make tax avoidance the only industry that grew. But the Opposition is proposing now to do it all over again. The Opposition learnt nothing. It is all about returning billions of dollars into the pockets of the few. The Opposition always was and always will be. The accountants will be rubbing their hands with glee. The tax lawyers think it is marvellous. But one wonders what happens to Australia in the process. </PARA>
<PARA> What does the press-not the `socialist rags'-think of the Opposition? What does the Australian Financial Review say? It says:</PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition has created a political issue by proposing a weak and philosophically unconvincing proposition. Its policy response, instead of showing some fiscal spine, lacks any philosophic coherence . . . </PARA>
<PARA>The Australian states:</PARA>
<PARA> The Liberal Party's speculative gains tax plan has little inherent logic and encourages tax dodging. </PARA>
<PARA>The Sydney Morning Herald comments:</PARA>
<PARA>the policy gives an enormous windfall to around 1 per cent of Australia's richest taxpayers. </PARA>
<PARA>Is it any wonder that in the coalition party room, members of the shadow Ministry gather around telling each other how worried thay are about any suggestion that John Elliott will gain in a big way from this policy? The question is, if business generally, and big business in particular, gain out of this, just how much does one particular businessman gain? The fact is that he gains one hell of a lot. For all the criticisms about Labor enjoying any relationship with business, the Opposition still has to give an answer over the next six months as to just what it will do about John Elliott and that big windfall gain. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am always staggered when we engage in a debate in this place generated by the Opposition complaining about the economic performance of the Hawke Government. It is especially fascinating today when Senator Stone, the proposer of the matter of public importance before the Senate-which talks about the disastrous consequences of interest rates paid by home buyers, farmers and small businesses and the continuing lack of action by the Hawke Labor Government to deal effectively with the balance of payments and foreign debt crises-left himself one minute to provide a list of what his Party, which is putting itself forward at this very moment out in the community, proposes to do about those very problems. He had 20 minutes available to him in this debate. After 19 minutes of invective based on the proposal he has put before the Senate, in one minute he very hastily-with the orange light showing on the clock-rattled off a list of tax breaks, spending cuts, measures to restructure the labour market, deregulation and privatisation. That is the menu for the people of Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is important to look at the economic debate in Australia. Here we have one brought on by Senator Stone, the spokes- person for finance in the proposed alternative government. On both sides of politics it is a debate which the Australian Democrats believe is myth driven. The same myths are used by the Government-which budgets for a $9 billion surplus, cuts welfare to the bone, deregulates everything in sight and even engages in the destruction of a trade union, casting in doubt the very right to strike in this nation-and, equally, by an Opposition which sheets home to the labour force all the blame for the economic ills of this country. According to all the wisdom on both sides, Australians are overtaxed, there is overspending at government level and Australians are overpaid. Those are the myths. They survive, I contend, largely because in our opportunistic and adversarial political system the experts, of whom we have heard much already in this debate, seldom let facts get in the way of a good argument. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like to look at those myths and establish some facts. The first myth is that Australians are overtaxed. On Senator Stone's hasty list was the proposition that the coalition would reduce taxation, on the heels of a government which has done that dramatically for the corporate sector-which was not even paying its 49 per cent tax rate anyway-and initially for the high income earners and, finally, for lower income earners, and proposes to do more for the higher income earners again. </PARA>
<PARA> The total overall tax paid as a percentage of gross domestic product (GDP) in Australia is in line with the average for similar industrial countries in a list including Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United States of America and the United Kingdom. Our proportion of GDP is 31 per cent. We are sixth in a list of eight. So it seems that that is rather a hollow myth. On that list, the highest taxed are the French at 44.4 per cent and the lowest are the Japanese at 28.1 per cent, which is not dramatically below the 31 per cent of GDP that Australians pay in tax. </PARA>
<PARA> However, when looking at taxation statistics, it is worth noting that with respect to personal income tax we are top of the list at 45.6 per cent, especially when compared with the economies of Japan and Germany. But Australia's rate of tax on the corporate sector is quite low-well below that of Japan or even the United Kingdom. So the mix of taxation-and the failure of the corporate sector, even though it has been remarkably well treated by this Government-is a feature of our taxation system. </PARA>
<PARA> The second myth is that the Government overspends. Again, on Senator Stone's hasty list at the end of his speech, while the light was burning, was a promise that the Opposition would cut government spending. We need to remember, when trying to cast some light around this myth, that this Government produced a $9 billion surplus in this year's Budget and that public sector borrowing is virtually zero. However, I remark that I understand that New South Wales, under the premiership of Liberal Premier Greiner, is heading in the opposite direction with regard to public sector borrowing overseas. I am using 1986 figures here because they are the latest complete figures amongst the nations surveyed. As a percentage of GDP, Australia's spending comes out at 38.3 per cent. In the United Kingdom, under the dry economic bent of Maggie Thatcher, the figure is 49.5 per cent. In Japan it is 33.1 per cent and in the United States of America it is 36.9 per cent. The average for the seven major industrial economies is 40 per cent, compared with Australia's rate of 38.3 per cent, and the average for the nations of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development is 41 per cent. So that is another hollow myth. </PARA>
<PARA> We hear very often the bleat that Australian workers are overpaid and that the Opposition wants to deregulate the labour market and get rid of that problem. But is it a problem? Added to that myth should be the complaint that Australians do not work hard enough for all of the money they are paid. Let us look at that myth. I am looking at a survey of the Union Bank of Switzerland of earnings per hour, which is in common usage. I will take the figures for Sydney, even though it has the most highly paid work force in Australia. Those workers rank twenty-second in a selection of 52 world cities. The highest paid workers are those living in Zurich. Using as a base those workers in Zurich, who are paid $100 an hour, comparatively, in Los Angeles the figure is $72.10, in New York $67.90, in Tokyo $67.20, in London $57.90 and in Sydney, our highest paid city, $46.70. So that is another hollow myth. </PARA>
<PARA> Another complaint we hear in this myth-based economic debate is that welfare spending as a proportion of GDP in this country is the lowest of any industrialised nation. I stress that that has been reduced by the Hawke Labor Government, through its targeted welfare policies, from 6.3 per cent of GDP at the time of the Fraser Government to 6 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> In these economic debates too little attention is paid to the real problems in this country. Perhaps the first problem is that all the decisions in this country are short term ones, whether made by governments or the private sector. Of course, we cannot have longer parliamentary terms. This Government put a proposal for that before the people of Australia-of course, it was a watered down proposition; this Government does not want a fixed term; the Prime Minister, whoever he is, always wants to have the final say-but the Opposition actively opposed it out in the community. In the private sector we have just had too much of a history of opportunistic corporate entrepreneurship in individual interests. That might change now that a few of them have fallen on their faces and they might not be the heroes of our society and our media much longer. </PARA>
<PARA> A second problem is that everybody blames everybody else for whatever goes wrong. Of course, we are having that in this debate. Somehow, perhaps, that is human nature. But I think the adversarial political system in this country is very much a measure of that and we will see a lot more of it before this year is over and into next year, I would submit, as we come into an election in which Tweedledum and Tweedledee will be desperately trying to persuade the electors that they are a little different from each other. </PARA>
<PARA> The last of the two serious problems should be linked. They are serious. As a nation we simply are not saving enough and hence investing enough local Australian money in our economy. Finally, the rent, interest and dividend outflows from foreign investment and foreign borrowings are hitting new and ever more glorious heights each year. They are serious problems. The Democrats actually agree with the Opposition's proposal that the Government has not acted in these areas sufficiently. But we ask the question: What about the Opposition?</PARA>
<PARA> The Democrats at least have had legislation before this Parliament to encourage savings through tax deductability on interest earned on savings accounts and to assist home buyers through the deductability of mortgage payments. The Opposition allowed its Leader, Mr Peacock, to fly kites on these issues in his mock election campaign earlier in the year. He was reined in. The Opposition rejected the Democrat moves in the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA> Then the tax package came from Mr Peacock. It simply presented a picture of increased social and economic polarisation and an increase in overseas indebtedness. The private sector now has its particular scare campaign running. It is not a mock election campaign any more. That scare campaign is focusing, as does this motion, on foreign debt. The private sector will have a summit next March. Sir Roderick Carnegie sought to reassure us all through the media during the last few days. He said, `We can do it. We have great confidence in this country'. It is always good to see confidence in this country. Sir Roderick said that we can get out of this foreign debt problem, that we did it in the 1890s, we did it in the 1930s and we can do it again. </PARA>
<PARA> But let us ask the question of Sir Roderick and of the Opposition and even of the Government: How did we do it in the 1890s and the 1930s? Is that the way that we will do it in 1990? We did it, of course, through depression. Perhaps for 1990 we should read `deep recession'. We did it through severe unemployment and great social deprivation. I want to add that our $9 billion surplus is not achieved without great and quite considerable social cost. In any case, cutbacks in government services have their own economic impact. The Democrats fear that Sir Roderick is right: both the Government and the alternative government appear headed in the direction of solving this problem a la the 1890s and 1930s. </PARA>
<PARA> The satisfaction of the Government and of the Opposition so far with our plateau of 6 per cent to 8 per cent unemployment in recent years is disturbing. The Government's toughness on unemployment benefits and further restrictions coming in in legislation that we will be dealing with in the next week or so are of concern. Of course, we are staring down the barrel of an Opposition which would remove unemployment benefits altogether for the long term unemployed in its proposed package. While deregulating the labour market, the strong will survive and the weak will fail. That is the way we are told we solve our problems-a chilling prospect. </PARA>
<PARA> The Democrats have other proposals. We have had them for a long time. First and, perhaps, foremost we should make those overseas borrowers contribute to this economy, particularly through removing the ability to negatively gear; discourage those imports at a luxury level; encourage savings-we have already had initiatives on that; allow enterprise and initiative to develop and encourage it in this country. Let us get some brain-based development in this country. There should be industrial democracy, not industrial chaos; appropriate regulation, not deregulation and privatisation for their own sake; and a change in attitude to surplus budgeting and welfare squeezing. Members of the Opposition will be out there trying to make the public believe that they are different, but I think the public is getting the picture now of Tweedledum and Tweedle-even-dumber. They have come together on tertiary taxes; they have come together on tax breaks for the wealthy; they have come together to concentrate ownership of the media; they have come together as birds of a feather; and they will continue to do that unless this community makes its feelings felt and looks for something different. The public opinion polls are showing that the community is doing that-looking for alternatives. We certainly need alternatives unless we are to sink severely into dire economic stress next year. </PARA>

<PARA> The disastrous consequences for interest rates paid by home buyers, farmers and small businesses of the continuing lack of action by the Hawke Labor government to deal effectively with the balance of payments and foreign debt crises. </PARA>
<PARA>There is no doubt that there is a crisis. I listened to Senator Richardson today. I would like to deal with some of the comments that he made. There is not much point in dealing with the comments that Senator Powell made; they are of the usual Democrats non-sensical variety, which makes it very hard to put one's finger on matters of substance, let alone establish any sort of coherent response to them. It is a blancmange of nonsense. The Australian Democrats, never having the requirement to be responsible because they will never be in power to do this, can say anything, and do say anything, no matter how irrational and nonsensical. </PARA>
<PARA> A major concern is the fact that Senator Richardson is not only a member of this Government but is the most senior New South Wales inner adviser of the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke): he is his numbers man; he is the eminence grise-we can tell by looking at his hair-of this Government. This man, this senator, came into this chamber and spoke the most incredible nonsense, basically along the lines: `Don't worry, we know what we are doing. The Opposition doesn't'. He pursued the most incredible line: `Look, don't worry about the foreign debt. It is not the Government's fault; it is private enterprises'. He said, `Sixty-two per cent of Australia's external debt is theirs'-referring to the Business Council of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> If Senator Richardson is so economically ignorant that he would make an assertion like that, we can understand why this Government has pushed Australia into such an economic crisis. The simple facts are these: our foreign debt does not emerge from someone like Skase or Bond running around the world borrowing money. It emerges from one very simple thing. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;If the honourable senator would be kind enough to listen, he would learn. Their borrowings simply alter the composition of the debt we face in the world; it does not alter its total. The Democrats have never been able to comprehend this because, frankly, it does not suit them politically to think about it. The reality is that we go broke every month-by $2.3 billion in the latest month-not because someone has rushed overseas to borrow money, but because Australia's total exports have not matched its total imports and its borrowing costs from overseas. In other words, like any family-certainly any family under this Government-we are not earning enough to pay our way. As a result, every month we as a nation have to borrow more from overseas to pay our bills. All that Mr Skase and Mr Bond have done is change the composition of that borrowing, because that borrowing otherwise would have to come into our money markets.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> When we sell goods overseas we earn foreign currency; when we buy goods from overseas we have to buy foreign currency. If we are not earning enough we have to keep buying at a higher and higher price. The simple fact is that we are not exporting enough. As a result, as a nation suffering from the Government's economic policies, we face a disaster. In the latest month, $2.3 billion is our current account deficit. Basically, we have to borrow that money. For people like Senator Richardson to maintain what appears to be a central plank of the Labor Party's policy is to maintain the big lie. It is false for the Government to pretend that our massive deficit has nothing to do with our hopeless economic policies; it is a direct consequence of them. Every observer recognises that to be true. </PARA>
<PARA> The consequence is that the Government must slow down the economy. It has admitted that, so it must have some sense of responsibility even if it does not know how to act properly to resolve the problems. The Government recognises that it must keep interest rates high; it is doing nothing else to try to resolve this terrible problem. That is why it has a tight monetary policy. That is why it pretends it has a tight fiscal policy; it knows it is responsible for the balance of payments deficit. That is why it keeps talking about the need for things such as high interest rates. If it was not its problem, why does it bother to have high interest rates? Why is it talking about the need for tight fiscal policies? Why do its Budget Papers even mention the need to resolve the balance of payments problem? It cannot have it both ways. </PARA>
<PARA> The major disaster with the balance of payments and the current account deficit has meant that Australians will continue to face the massive interest rates that have forced so many farmers and businesses to the wall and so many Australians out of their homes. Interest rates will remain high, despite the Government's mouthings of promises that interest rates will soon fall. Such promises have been made continually by the Prime Minister. Basically, immediately we hear the Prime Minister say that interest rates will fall, we know that there will be a rise, because it has happened every time. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn to a consideration of the consequences to Australia of the massive balance of payments deficits in the last few months. One newspaper heading today is, `Near record deficit throws doubt on Keating's forecasts'. There is nothing new about that. Keating's forecasts on this matter have always been ludicrous. Another heading is, `BoP: Government snuffs rate hopes'; it is referring to the balance of payments and interest rate hopes. Another newspaper heading is, `$2.2bn deficit will keep rates high'; the `rates' referred to are interest rates. Another such heading is, `Government confronts its debt dilemma'. That is right. However, we do not know what policies the Government has to resolve its problems. The coalition has put out its policy, one that has been widely discussed over the last two months, despite Senator Powell's ludicrous comment that only one minute of Senator Stone's 20-minute speech was addressed to it. The Opposition has put its money where its mouth is. It has said, `This is the way to fix it'. We are still waiting for the Government to come out with any kind of policy, even an incoherent one. </PARA>

<PARA> I turn to the nub of the debate. The interest rates paid by home buyers, pharmacists and small businesses are the disastrous consequences of the continuing lack of action by the Hawke Labor Government to deal effectively with the balance of payments and foreign debt crisis. Yesterday, 42,000 people signed a petition which was presented to the House of Representatives. That is the tip of the iceberg of public concern-and very justifiable concern-about this Government's failed economic policies. But 42,000 is quite a coincidental number when one thinks of what is happening in South Australia tomorrow. South Australians have the opportunity of sending a message to Canberra about high interest rates. In the South Australian election the significance of the number 42,000 will no doubt be recognised because 42,000 happens to be the number of South Australians who are on the waiting list for public housing-the South Australians who cannot afford to buy a house. No-one on average weekly earnings can afford to pay the interest bill that this Government has imposed on Australians because of its reliance on high interest rates as the only way of trying to control this economy. </PARA>
<PARA> Forty-two thousand people in South Australia are on the public housing waiting list, which has doubled under the Hawke Government and, coincidentally, under the Bannon Government because they have been in harness. Not only have they been in harness but also Mr Bannon, the Premier of South Australia, is the Federal President of the Australian Labor Party. We all know what significant roles Labor Party executives play in the creation of party policy. It is not quite as bad as the 42 faceless men situation, where the parliamentary leader of the Labor Party and his deputy had to sit outside the room waiting to hear what the Labor Party's policy was on something. Mr Bannon and Mr Hawke are closely linked in these economic policies which have brought so many people to bankruptcy and forced so many out of their homes. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us consider the reality of the balance of payments problem and how the Government has absolutely no answer to it. It has its fingers crossed and hopes that the problem will go away. We have heard Senator Richardson say, `EPAC says that things will get a little less worse perhaps. The balance of payments will stop getting worse, as it is doing every month. It will stabilise about the mid-1990s'-they hope. But that is if Australia's exports can be maintained. When this Government came to office and there were balance of payments problems after a few years we heard that the reason for those problems was the terms of trade. Was it not terrible? It was not the Government's policies; it was the terms of trade that were destroying this economy. Back in 1986, I think, the terms of trade had fallen by about 13 per cent, so maybe the Government was right in saying that it was the terms of trade. It was not. The basic economic policies were wrong. But the Government's excuse was that it was the terms of trade. </PARA>
<PARA> What are the terms of trade now? Instead of being 87.5 on that index, which they were in 1986, they are now 112.8. They have gone up by about 20 per cent. The terms of trade have never been stronger in recent years than they are now. Yet we are still in trouble, still in deep crisis. I seek leave to incorporate in Hansard a table showing that the real reason for our problems is the massive incompetence of this Government. The massive debt and the huge interest bill on that debt will not go away. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The table shows that, because of this Government's policies, Australia's exports will have to rise to a level that has never previously been achieved. Never in Australia's history have we been able to achieve a merchandise export surplus. But we will need to do so if we are to pay the mounting interest bill. Last year something like $13 billion was paid. More than $1 billion a month went out in what are called total income debts. The table shows that gross interest of $10.7 billion was paid overseas last year. That has gone up by something like almost four times under this Government. Why has this happened? It has happened simply for one reason: this Government's economic incompetence. The world's greatest Treasurer has turned into the world's greatest flop.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will not argue that Australia's balance of payments situation is not a problem. Of course it is a problem. But it is a lot more complex than Senator Michael Baume, Senator Stone or Senator Powell seems to believe, despite the histrionics that accompanied each of their speeches. It is not all bad news, but I will come to that later. I am appalled at the propensity of the Senator Stones, the Peacocks and the Hewsons of this world constantly to attempt to talk down the economy. That is not in the interests of Australia as a whole. They seem to have little interest in the well-being of the Australian people or, for that matter, the Australian economy. Senator Stone and others want to talk down the economy for purely political ends, as has been made clear by all opposition speakers so far. They have raised this matter for debate purely because there is an election tomorrow in South Australia and there will be an election in Queensland the week after. There is more concern about these elections than about the impact of interest rates on ordinary Australians.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I am also constantly amazed at what I can only call the unmitigated gall of the Opposition, and particularly of Senator Stone, when one considers, firstly, the record of conservative parties when they have been in government and, secondly, the current policies of the Opposition in relation to the economy. The Opposition's record is important for two reasons. Firstly, as the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories (Senator Richardson) has already pointed out, conservative governments have governed for 30 of the last 40 years. They were in office when many of the current problems developed. They were the cause of many of the problems of distortion within the economy with which this Government is grappling. </PARA>
<PARA> The second reason it is important to talk about the Opposition's record, is that it says a great deal about the character of the conservative mind. Let us look briefly at this record. Many of the distortions, as I have said, first appeared during the Menzies-McEwen era. While Senator Richardson briefly alluded to this, I will deal with it in a little more detail. At that time Australia was seen as the lucky country, rich in resources, with vast areas of land and almost limitless capacity, it seemed. This led to a sort of cargo cult mentality that we would always produce enough and that a sleepy Australia did not have to worry about what was happening in the rest of the world and particularly in our immediate region of South East Asia. This was the period in which we developed many of the bad habits which are now presenting as problems-bad habits such as over-protection, not facing the realities of a competitive world, bad work practices which we have been attempting to overcome not only through award restructuring but also through a whole range of other initiatives, bad management practices and unwieldly structures generally. While the Fraser Government generally was certainly more aware of the problems, it still did nothing to correct them. </PARA>
<PARA> I remind honourable senators of the report of the Jackson Committee to Advise on Policies for Manufacturing Industry which was delivered in 1975 towards the end of the Whitlam Government's term and was ready to be acted upon by the Fraser Government when it took office. That report was headed Policies for Development of Manufacturing Industry. The report was a stinging indictment of management practices in Australia. It did not criticise unions; it criticised management. No action was taken about that. I remind honourable senators of the report in 1981 of the Campbell Committee of Inquiry into the Australian Financial System. It recommended deregulation of the financial market. Again, no action was taken. The conservatives backed off. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Button referred yesterday to the 1977 Industries Assistance Commission report which recommended a general reduction in tariffs. Again, nothing was done about that. I remind honourable senators of a point raised by Senator Button yesterday: tariffs have been reduced since 1972 by 65 percentage points and not one percentage point is attributable to a conservative government. Labor has had to take the burden of all the change not only in that area but in almost every other area. The conservatives talk a lot about micro-economic reform but they did nothing. They did nothing about the waterfront, air transport, award restructuring or work or management practices. We have tackled all of those things. I am not suggesting that all of our initiatives have worked equally well or that we have finished the task of restructuring the economy, but at least we have had the fortitude to have a go. </PARA>
<PARA> If there is one thing that has characterised the Opposition over these years it is a lack of courage. Nothing has changed. Despite carping and consistent criticism of the Government's tight monetary policy, for example-and it is repeated in this proposal-the so-called Economic Action Plan, which I think Senator Button more accurately described as the `Fosters' family package', does nothing to change macro-economic policy. In fact, it is more notable for what it is not than for what it is. It is not, for example, about inflation adjustment, despite Mr Peacock's commitment to this just a few months ago. The one area on which I must agree with Senator Michael Baume is that the Australian Democrats' solution to this and other problems is gobbledegook and nonsense. Their idea of inflation adjustment for interest on individual savings is a nonsense which simply distorts the financial system without achieving anything. It is easy for the Democrats to come up with these sorts of solutions because, as Senator Baume says, they do not ever have to face the responsibility of government, so they never have to implement the silly ideas that they project. </PARA>
<PARA> The Economic Action Plan is not about wages. There is no explanation of how a conservative government would control the radical changes-and they are radical changes-involved in abolishing the centralised wage-fixing system and replacing it with enterprise bargaining and individual contracts. It is not about the new tax scales which Peacock has frequently promised, although there is a vague and uncosted reference to reducing the top marginal tax rate from 49 per cent to 39 per cent, thus making the tax system less progressive and therefore less fair. </PARA>
<PARA> It is not about, as I said initially, macro-economic policy and this is not just my idea. I quote from an article on page 13 of the Melbourne Age of 13 October by Ken Davidson. In the opening two paragraphs of the article he says:</PARA>
<PARA> The coalition expenditure/tax document makes no attempt to offer a different budgetary and monetary strategy to that now being offered by the Hawke-Keating Government. </PARA>
<PARA> Despite the pious noises about the creation of a more productive and fairer Australia, the document in reality offers an alternative budget for 1989-90 which has, for all practical purposes, the same bottom line in the form of a surplus, excluding asset sales, of about $8 billion. </PARA>
<PARA>So it is not in any sense an economic plan or a tax plan. It is in fact a cynical political document designed to play on the prejudices of some Australians by attacking the long term unemployed, education leavers, newly-arrived migrants, Aborigines, invalid pensioners, sole parents, and single income earners. It takes Australia back to a new dark age of inequality, social division and deprivation. It takes from those in greatest need and gives to the wealthy and those on two incomes who are comfortably well off. As Ken Davidson comments, it is a crude Robin Hood in reverse. </PARA>
<PARA> Far from taking the opportunity to set up some grand design to reshape the Australian economy, Senator Stone has participated-it ought to be noted that he is a key member of the Opposition team, the so-called kitchen cabinet that has put this package together-in putting together a traditional political grab bag of handouts and, like all previous coalition fistfuls of dollars, the package was not adequately costed and cannot be funded from the savings measures described. This is not the hard-headed, disciplined, fiscally responsible, economically rational former Treasury head that we all love and respect; it is more like that meretricious player that he so disdainfully rejected-John Hewson. The Opposition's package demonstrates the same lack of courage. The Australian Financial Review of 25 October 1989 refers to the Opposition as follows:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . proposing a weak and philosophically unconvincing proposition. Its policy response, instead of showing some fiscal spine, lacks any philosophic coherence . . . </PARA>
<PARA>It shows the same spinelessness and the same lack of courage. The important fact in this debate is that the Economic Action Plan explicitly states that monetary policy would be used at at least the same level as currently to reduce inflation. This means support for high interest rates. How the Opposition has the gall to debate this when its own policy statement put out as recently as a couple of weeks ago says that it has the same prescription to retain high levels of interest rates, to dampen demand and reduce inflation, beats me. We must add to this first the unfunded promises implicit in the statement and second the severe doubts about the accuracy of costings. The Department of Finance costed the savings at $615m compared with the savings in the document of $1,149m. Thirdly, there is the inevitable policy making and additional spending which will be promised in the run-up to an election. The result will be less scope to manoeuvre and a high probability that Dr Hewson and Senator Stone will have to engineer a recession through even higher interest rates to create the climate they need for the labour market deregulation which they are so fond of. It will be 1982 all over again with inflation high, unemployment high, in double digit figures, negative growth and a wages blow-out. We do not think that Australia needs that prescription. </PARA>
<PARA> Having failed hopelessly to offer an alternative economic strategy, Senator Stone and his colleagues try to talk down the economy. They totally ignore the positive elements in this week's balance of payments statement. They ignore for example the fact that it represents a 14 per cent fall in the seasonally adjusted deficit; that it contains a significant indication of export diversification, which we have been aiming at and working hard for and which is now happening; that it contains a welcome fall in seasonally adjusted imports; and that it demonstrates continued evidence of investment imports to feed the investment boom that is at a 40-year high-higher than anything the Opposition was ever able to achieve. Even the shadow Treasurer, Dr Hewson, finally acknowledged this in an interview on The World Today on Thursday, 23 November. It is also worthy of note that markets have generally received the current account figures quite favourably. There is a broad consensus out there in the market that the figures for the year are unfolding as expected at Budget time; that is, that they will peak in the early part of the year and improve in the second half. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, in the few minutes I have left, I would like to look at the nature of the debt because a lot of simplistic nonsense is talked about it. It is not mainly public debt; it is mainly private debt-62 per cent of the debt is private debt. The net public sector borrowing requirement of the Federal Government is zero. In fact, we are net lenders, not net borrowers. We cannot, therefore, compare ourselves, as the Opposition likes to do, with South American countries whose level of sovereign debt-that is, public debt for things such as health, welfare, roads and so forth-is as high as 80 per cent of gross domestic product. As Senator Richardson has already pointed out, our debt is around the level of 32 per cent of GDP. It is over 60 per cent private in any case, and in most cases it is well geared so that it will be repaid. That is why the finance people are not so worried about it. It is a reducing debt also. As has already been indicated, that 32 per cent is a reducing amount. So there is no way in which we can compare ourselves with South American countries or with the sorts of difficulties that those countries face. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In the few minutes remaining I want to pick up some of the points that have been made by speakers on the Government side-Senator Richardson and Senator Beahan-in emphasising the significance of the matter of public importance that has been submitted to the Senate today by Senator Stone on behalf of the Opposition, namely:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The disastrous consequences for interest rates paid by home buyers, farmers and small businesses of the continuing lack of action by the Hawke Labor Government to deal effectively with the balance of payments and foreign debt crises. </PARA>
<PARA>Earlier this week in the other place, in a debate on interest rates the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Peacock) made the very accurate observation that this Government has developed a policy paralysis. There are no answers to questions about interest rates. We had that confirmed to us today, par excellence, by Senator Button during Question Time, and I am pleased to see that Senator Button is at the table. There is virtually no movement on micro-economic reform, despite the much vaunted promises at the last election that this would be the Parliament of micro-economic reform. Increasingly, few policy decisions are being taken that have any rational economic coherence about them at all. </PARA>
<PARA> We are seeing a government that is living at the moment very much on the basis of the politics of the big lie and the politics of the quick fix. We just have to look at the decisions that have been made in relation to Kodak (Australasia) Pty Ltd, Coronation Hill, and the banks-subsidising their interest rates policy-to name but three of the more notable ones, to see what disarray this Government's economic policy making is in at the moment. That is the reason we have brought forward this matter of public importance today in the Senate. That is why every economic commentator around the place is expressing increasing concern about our balance of payments situation, the level of our national debt and the implications that that will have not just for the living standards of Australians today but for the living standards of our kids, our grandchildren and future generations. </PARA>
<PARA> The debt we are building up in this country, which is increasing at the rate of $2 billion per month, is a debt that future generations will have to deal with. It is a totally unsustainable debt which, if it is not brought under control in the very near future, will sink this nation in terms of the living standards of every Australian. Yet the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) addressed his Caucus earlier this week and said that our debt problem was not a crisis. That is the problem facing this country. We have a government led by a Prime Minister who does not realise that the debt that is accumulating externally at the rate of $2 billion a month is a serious problem. He says that we do not have a crisis. I have news for the Prime Minister: everyone else in Australia believes that we have a crisis. Virtually every commentator not only in Australia but increasingly around the world believes it. If one wants a very good description of what is happening and the attitude of this Government one can do no better than read from the Macquarie Bank's summary of Australia's economic challenge, the summary released the other day, which talks about the boiling frog syndrome. It says:</PARA>
<PARA> Throw a frog into a pot of very hot water and it will immediately jump out. No frog in its right mind wants to be cooked. </PARA>
<PARA> Place a frog into a pot of cold water, on the other hand, and it will usually stay there. Then, as you slowly turn up the heat, the frog acclimatises to the changing temperature and stays put. </PARA>
<PARA> As the water gets warmer, the frog remains unconcerned-it will sit there indefinitely saying, in effect, `she'll be right, mate'' . . . as the water gets hotter and hotter . . . until the poor old frog is boiled. </PARA>
<PARA>That is absolutely what is happening to this country under the policies of this Government. Let me pick up two of the fundamental points that were made by Senator Richardson and, very surprisingly, parroted by Senator Beahan today. They are part of the politics of the big lie that we have heard non-stop from the Government in recent years. We remember the Prime Minister's policy speech that by 1990 no child will live in poverty, interest rates will fall and, the beauty of all beauties the other day, that the pilots dispute is over. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the problems of the politics of the political lie is that it undermines the understanding that people have of the economic situation. We saw that today when Senator Richardson, followed as I said by Senator Beahan, said that the private sector accounts for 62 per cent of Australia's external debt. His whole approach was that the Government has no involvement in or responsibility for this, that it is not the Government's problem. That is a line that I have heard peddled by other Government spokesmen in recent months, including, notably, the Treasurer (Mr Keating). All that demonstrates is just how pathetically little the Treasurer and other Government spokesmen understand about economics. Obviously, the Treasurer has no understanding at all about the impact of government policies on the private sector. </PARA>
<PARA> Several points have to be made to show the real situation. The first one is that the Government's policies of disastrous economic mismanagement have led to a record high level of domestic interest rates in Australia. The second point follows from that: interest rates to commercial borrowers within Australia are twice or more times as high as they are in many other capital markets around the world, for example, in the United States and Japan, where rates are single digit figures. Here commercial rates are 20 per cent plus. The third point is that as a result of that it is not only inevitable but nothing more than sound business practice that if Australian companies have a need to borrow then those that are able to do so will look overseas for that borrowing. The alternative is to borrow within Australia at the crippling-high interest rates prevailing here as a result of deliberate government policies. If they borrow in Australia they will thereby jeopardise the viability of their businesses and, in many instances, their very livelihoods. </PARA>
<PARA> As to the fourth point in relation to this matter, I marvel at the rampant hypocrisy in the Government's implication that somehow or other the private sector is harming the economy with its overseas borrowing. It is hypocritical because the Government positively wants the private sector to borrow externally in order to prop up the value of the Australian dollar. The Government's whole economic strategy is based around this very point. If the private sector was not borrowing overseas, then the Government's whole economic strategy would be blown even further out of the water unless the Government took over the foreign borrowing role. If it did not take over that foreign borrowing role, then the Australian dollar would plummet in value. That would in turn feed heavy additional inflationary pressures into an already far too inflationary environment. The only solution to that situation would be to adopt the policies that the Opposition has been pursuing publicly for a long time now. They are now encapsulated in the Economic Action Plan  of the Opposition. They involve a balanced mix of policies which are essential for the operation of this country. </PARA>

<PARA> (1) Is it correct that Australian food regulatory authorities do not accept the juice extracted from the whole orange as orange juice.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) What are the reasons for the differentiation between the juice extracted from the whole orange and the endocarp of the orange.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) Are there any appreciable cost savings in the former so-called `diffusion extraction' method and will it give Australia a technological edge.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="XE4">Senator Bolkus</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) Yes.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) Orange juice is defined under State and Territory food legislation, as the liquid portion expressed from the `endocarp of sound, mature oranges'. In the case of citrus fruit, the endocarp is made up of the `juicy' segments after the pith and skin of the fruit is removed.</PARA>
<PARA> The definition of fruit juice is in line with the international definition of the CODEX Alimentarius Commission. The product extracted from the whole orange contains the juice from the endocarp plus other water soluble components extracted from the skin and pith.</PARA>
<PARA> However there is nothing preventing the manufacture and sale of the counter current extraction (CCE) product or the blending of such with orange juice, providing it is not described as `orange juice'.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) The Australian Fruit Juice Association advised that the advantage to the manufacturer of juice by using counter current extraction is an increased yield of approximately 50%. This would include additional water soluble components not found in traditional orange juice.</PARA>
<PARA> Information on whether this increased yield translates to a cost saving has not been documented.</PARA>
<PARA> I understand other countries are using this technology.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) The Australian Food Standards Committee (AFSC) of the National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC) which is responsible for the development and review of standards for the description, safe manufacture, composition, packaging, labelling, storage, transport, display, advertising and sale of food for human consumption, has received submission from and met with representatives of the Australian Citrus Industry Council (ACIC) to discuss the marketing of CCE products in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA> The Government is awaiting the advice from the NHMRC on this issue.</PARA>
