<TITLE>Interest Rates</TITLE>
<PARA>To the Honourable the President and members of the Senate in Parliament assembled. The petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth that:</PARA>
<PARA> Recent huge rises in mortgage interest rates have pushed the cost of buying their own home beyond the reach of most Australian families.</PARA>
<PARA> Those Australians already paying off home mortgages are now suffering severely and unfairly through increased mortgage payments or longer repayment times so that many will never pay off their mortgage and go further and further into debt unless interest rates fall substantially.</PARA>
<PARA> Now, therefore, your petitioners request that the Senate in Parliament assembled require the Hawke-Keating government to cease its excessive reliance on high interest rates as its major economic policy weapon and instead to use other measures which would allow interest rates to return to levels that do not force most Australian home-seekers out of the housing market-and many Australians out of their homes-so that the traditional right of home ownership is returned to average Australian families.</PARA>
<PARA> And your petitioners, as in duty bound, will ever pray.</PARA>

<TITLE>National Flag</TITLE>
<PARA>To the Honourable the President and members of the Senate in Parliament assembled. The humble petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth that whereas:</PARA>
<PARA> 1. They are completely satisfied with the design of the existing Australian National Flag.</PARA>
<PARA> 2. They are aware it properly reflects the immutable characteristics of Australia, namely:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) The Union Jack, itself the creation of three Christian Crosses, represents the nation's historical origin and the source of its language and law;</PARA>
<PARA> (b) the Southern Cross on an azure blue background signifying its geographical location on this planet Earth;</PARA>
<PARA> (c) the large star depicting the advent of Federation in 1901.</PARA>
<PARA> 3. They know the Flag has been a source of inspiration to generations of Australians in peace and war.</PARA>
<PARA> 4. They recall that millions of native-born Australians and newcomers to these shores from other parts of the world have become united under its proud symbolism.</PARA>
<PARA> 5. They are certain that any change to the Flag will produce division in the Australian community.</PARA>
<PARA> Your petitioners therefore pray that your honourable Senate will:</PARA>
<PARA> Propose and pass a motion that ``the existing Australian National Flag be changed only with the approval of the Nation as expressed in a Referendum''.</PARA>

<PARA> The petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth:</PARA>
<PARA> That your petitioners are offended and outraged by the direction of the AIDS Programme in Tasmania, in that it actively promotes Homosexual Acts and in particular anal intercourse, and that taxpayers money is being used to fund literature which directly promotes homosexual behaviour as a normal and desirable human activity.</PARA>

<PARA> that your petitioners deplore the Federal Government's decision to remove 53 Pharmaceutical drugs-including the best available for the treatment of high blood pressure, cancer, epilepsy, high cholesterol and uneven heartbeat-and place them for cost saving reasons only on a special list requiring Authority from a Canberra bureaucrat, and;</PARA>

<PARA> The petition of certain citizens of Australia draws to the attention of the Senate that the Government is about to introduce into the Senate legislation changing health insurance. These changes will increase the cost of health insurance to members of employee based funds and will do nothing to help the elderly as is being claimed. Big public funds will increase their surpluses by taking money from more efficient funds. People will be forced back onto Medicare, which will not help to maintain private health insurance.</PARA>

<PARA> 1. The Australian Taxation Office disregarded its privacy obligations to the citizens of Queensland, Western Australia and the Northern Territory in February, by sending an admitted 55,000 to 77,000 tax file number letters to people who were either deceased or had changed address.</PARA>
<PARA> 2. The Australian Taxation Office disregarded its privacy obligations to the citizens of New South Wales, Victoria, South Australia, Tasmania and the Australian Capital Territory in March, by sending an admitted 29,000 to 58,000 tax file number letters to people who were either deceased or had changed address.</PARA>
<PARA> 3. The Australian Taxation Office disregarded its privacy obligations by sending out a large number of tax file number letters during March in unsealed envelopes.</PARA>

<PARA> The speeches read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA>CO-OPERATIVE SCHEME LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 1989</PARA>
<PARA> I am introducing the Bill pursuant to the Commonwealth's obligations under the cooperative companies and securities scheme. A detailed description of the provisions of the Bill is contained in the explanatory memorandum which has been circulated. </PARA>
<PARA> For the benefit of honourable Senators, I will explain the role of this Bill in the context of the Commonwealth's own proposals to regulate companies and securities and futures industries in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> As the Attorney-General indicated in the Second Reading Speech when introducing the Bill into the House of Representatives, the introduction of this Bill in no way diminishes the Government's commitment to the early implementation of the Commonwealth's Corporations legislation. That legislation has now been passed by both Houses of this Parliament and incorporates a number of amendments recommended by the Joint Select Committee on Corporations Legislation. The Government will be proceeding to set up the machinery necessary for proper implementation of the national scheme as soon as possible. </PARA>
<PARA> In the meantime, the Government has indicated its commitment to maintain the existing scheme of regulation, including provisions for the protection of investors, pending the commencement of the national legislation. The Bill I am introducing today represents part of that commitment. In accordance with the formal agreement governing the cooperative scheme, this Bill has been agreed to by the Ministerial Council for Companies and Securities. If passed by this Parliament the Bill will, in addition to altering the law of the Australian Capital Territory, have the effect of automatically amending the corresponding legislation of the States and the Northern Territory. </PARA>
<PARA>Outline of Proposals</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> The Bill contains provisions which will enable a company to re-purchase its own shares in certain circumstances. The Ministerial Council released an Exposure Draft Bill in relation to this proposal in September 1988. Many valuable comments were made in submissions received from the public on the Exposure Draft Bill. The Ministerial Council responded to the public comments by making a number of significant amendments to the proposals. The Ministerial Council is now satisfied that the buy-back provisions in this Bill will enable companies to purchase their own shares without compromising the interests of shareholders and creditors. The Government will be giving consideration to the inclusion of corresponding amendments on buy-backs in the Corporations Bill after that Bill is passed by the Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill also includes important deregulatory proposals that are adopted from the national Corporations Bill. The licensing of representatives of securities and futures dealers and advisers will be discontinued as provided in the Corporations Bill. At the same time, securities and futures dealers and advisers will be given increased responsibility for the conduct of their representatives. Provisions have also been included to remove existing delays in the transfer and registration of securities occasioned by unnecessary procedures. The Bill gives legislative support for the pilot testing by the Australian Stock Exchange of a new share transfer and registration system known as the Flexible Accelerated Security Transfer system, or FAST. </PARA>
<PARA> Other provisions in the Bill enable the inspection of computer generated documents and resolve problems experienced by the Corporate Affairs Commissions with the retrieval of information in annual returns. Importantly, the Bill contains the legislative basis for the new proposal to give the NCSC additional funding and support from the 1989-90 financial year. The Bill will enable charges to be made for the performance of certain functions by the NCSC and State Corporate Affairs Commissions which more accurately reflect the actual resources devoted to those functions. </PARA>
<PARA> I will now outline in greater detail the more important features of the Bill.</PARA>
<PARA>Share Buy-Backs</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> The reforms contained in this Bill which give companies a power to buy-back their shares have their genesis in the report of the Companies and Securities Law Review Committee entitled ``A Company's Purchase of its own Shares'', published in September 1987. The Australian business community has strongly argued for the removal of the current statutory prohibition on share buy-backs contained in s. 129 of the Companies Act 1981 and for the introduction of a regime which permits greater flexibility in the arrangement of a company's capital structure, in line with procedures available under the law of other major overseas commercial centres such as the United States and United Kingdom. </PARA>
<PARA> In the development of these proposals, the Ministerial Council has been particularly concerned to ensure that shareholders and creditors are not exposed to some forms of abuse of share buy-back procedures which have been experienced in overseas jurisdictions. The Exposure Draft Bill attracted substantial comment from the business community which was taken into account by the Ministerial Council in reaching a settled position on the provisions in this Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> Because of this concern about possible abuse and because buy-backs are difficult activities to regulate, public companies generally have been confined to an aggregate 10% annual limit on the amount of the share capital that can be reclaimed in any of the following ways:</PARA>
<PARA> (i) Pari passu offers to shareholders on a proportional basis;</PARA>
<PARA> (ii) Selective purchases approved by a resolution of 75% of the shareholders of the company (excluding the vendor shareholder), with an expert's opinion that the price is fair and reasonable; and</PARA>
<PARA> (iii) On-market purchases regulated by Australian Stock Exchange (ASX) Listing Rules. </PARA>
<PARA> Strong representations were received supporting the use of on-market purchases and the Ministerial Council has decided to include provisions in the Bill allowing that method of self-purchase. The provisions will not be proclaimed until the ASX, in consultation with the NCSC, has devised Listing Rules which satisfy the Ministerial Council that shareholders will be given appropriate protection. </PARA>
<PARA> The Ministerial Council has been concerned about the use of interposed companies and cross-shareholdings to achieve ``indirect'' buy-backs. The Bill contains provisions to regulated such arrangements to ensure that they are not used to circumvent the buy-back provisions. At the same time, the Ministerial Council has responded to the concerns expressed by the business community that cross-shareholdings can be a common and legitimate commercial relationship between companies. Both concerns have been met in this Bill. Under the Bill, in addition to the procedures described above, companies will be permitted to hold a 10% indirect interest in their own shares through cross-shareholding arrangements. However, over the 10% threshold, it will be open to the NCSC to examine all the relevant factors of a particular arrangement and to intervene if it considers the cross-shareholding transaction is unacceptable. The Bill sets out the criteria for NCSC intervention. </PARA>
<PARA> In response to submissions from business, the financial assistance validation procedure in s. 129 (10) of the Companies Act will be retained to permit legitimate commercial usage. Specific anti-avoidance provisions will be inserted to prevent the use of s. 129 (10) for ``backdoor'' buy-backs. The Bill provides that the s. 129 (10) validation procedure cannot operate if it is used for the purpose of avoiding the buy-back provisions of the Bill. </PARA>
<PARA>FAST and Licensing of Investment Advisers</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> As mentioned above, the amendments to the Securities Industry Act 1980 relating to the simplification of the share transfer system (FAST), and the reform of the licensing system, adopt the corresponding initiatives that are presently contained in the Commonwealth's Corporations Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> The FAST system will allow shares to be transferred without share certificates and without transfer signatures thus reducing the amount of paperwork and procedural steps in the share transfer process. At the same time, the protection already afforded investors by the National Guarantee Fund will be reinforced by extending protection to shareholders for any losses arising from unauthorised transfers. A limited number of companies representing a range of large and small listed companies will participate in a pilot scheme to be run by the Australian Stock Exchange. If successful, the pilot scheme is expected to lead to the full operation of FAST. </PARA>
<PARA> The provisions facilitating the pilot scheme were exposed for public comment in December 1988. The provisions contained in this Bill have been slightly modified following public submissions and further discussions with the Australian Stock Exchange and representatives of the business community. The companies participating in the pilot scheme are to be commended for their willingness to participate in a somewhat costly program. If the pilot scheme is successful, the entire Australian community will benefit from a streamlined system for the transfer of securities. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill also introduces reforms to the existing securities and futures industry licensing systems that have been adopted from the Corporations Bill. The licensing of representatives of securities dealers and advisers and of futures brokers and advisers will be discontinued. To ensure that proper responsibility is taken for the activities of their representatives, dealers, brokers and advisers will be made more fully liable for the conduct of persons who are, in fact, their representatives. </PARA>
<PARA> Securities dealers and advisers and futures brokers and advisers will still require a licence. The Bill, like the national Corporations legislation, contains additional sanctions against persons who act as dealers, brokers or advisers without obtaining a licence. The Bill will enable clients of such persons to rescind agreements made with the unlicensed person, provided third party rights are not adversely affected, and to recover any commission paid to the unlicensed person. In addition, the NCSC will be given power to ban undesirable persons from acting as participants in the securities or futures industries. </PARA>
<PARA> Consistent with amendments that were made by the Senate to the corresponding provisions of the Corporations Bill, amendments to this Bill were passed by the House of Representatives on 24 May 1989. These amendments remove the general right of a client of a non-licensee to rescind agreements and recover commission from the non-licensee, where the client was made aware before the relevant agreement was made that the non-licensee did not hold a licence. The amendments were approved by the Ministerial Council on 19 May 1989. </PARA>
<PARA>Computerisation</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> Presently, the public searching of Corporate Affairs Commission records takes place by manual inspection of original documents or microfiche transparencies of those documents. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill contains amendments to enable the use of computer-generated documents, or the display of information on a visual display unit, to satisfy most, if not all, company searches. In conjunction with this proposal, it is proposed that, to save administrative costs, microfiche transparencies and original documents will no longer be made available for inspection. Section 31 of the Companies Act will be amended to give effect to this decision, which does not affect a person's right to obtain a certified copy of a document. </PARA>
<PARA> A new section 31a will also be included in the Companies Act to clarify the rights of a person to inspect registers maintained by the Commission. At present the Act does not expressly provide that a person may inspect or search those registers. </PARA>
<PARA>Annual Return</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> In 1985 the Companies Act was amended to enable the NCSC to partly complete the annual return of a company using information kept on computer. The partly completed annual return would then be served on the company, which was expected to complete it and lodge it with the NCSC. </PARA>
<PARA> Experience has shown that as many as 40% of companies have preferred to disregard the returns served on them by the NCSC and, instead, prepare returns using their own computer or word-processing facilities. The processing of such returns has caused problems for the NCSC (mainly because information is presented in a different format from that used by the NCSC) and it is proposed that section 263 be amended to require companies to complete the annual return served on them by the NCSC. </PARA>
<PARA>Funding of National Companies and Securities Commission</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> The Ministerial Council decided at its meeting on 2 March 1989 that the very necessary additional resources required by the NCSC should be funded through revised or increased fees in those areas where the actual cost of performing certain functions is not met by the fees presently able to be charged for those functions. For example, the current maximum fee chargeable for labour intensive functions such as the registration of prospectuses and takeover documents and the granting of applications for exemption from requirements is $1000. The decision included targeting those parts of the business community that are the principal `users' of NCSC services, and imposing additional fees on the annual returns of listed corporations and on licence holders in the securities and futures industries. </PARA>
<PARA> The amendments to the various co-operative scheme Fees Acts contained in this Bill will give effect to the decision of the Ministerial Council. </PARA>
<PARA> The amendments to the various Fees Acts will permit the making of regulations prescribing the revised fees. The major changes include:</PARA>
<PARA> increasing the maximum amount that can be prescribed to $5,000;</PARA>
<PARA> enabling fees to be prescribed in terms other than monetary amounts (for example, percentages);</PARA>
<PARA> permitting more than one fee to be prescribed in respect of each matter;</PARA>
<PARA> imposing a limit of $25,000 on the size of the fee that can be charged for any one matter;</PARA>
<PARA> allowing the Commission to require payment of a deposit when the amount of a fee cannot be ascertained prior to carrying out the function; and</PARA>
<PARA> giving a power to prescribe a fee for supplying, or for other parties accessing, information kept on the Commission's computer. </PARA>
<PARA> Not all the increased fees will necessarily be directly related to the actual service provided. For example a prospectus registration fee may be based on a proportion of the amount to be raised or an annual return fee may be based on the capitalisation of a listed corporation. Thus the amendments recognise there may be a taxation component to the fee. In accordance with usual Commonwealth Parliamentary practice, the authority for imposing that part of any fee which includes an element of a tax will be contained in separate ``fees: taxation component'' bills under each of the principal pieces of scheme legislation. </PARA>
<PARA>Other Amendments</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> The Bill amends a number of other provisions in the Companies Act and makes extensive amendments to the Fees Act for each of the substantive pieces of co-operative scheme legislation. </PARA>
<PARA>COMPANIES (FEES: TAXATION COMPONENT) BILL 1989</PARA>

<PARA> The speeches read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA>COMMUNITY SERVICES AND HEALTH AMENDMENT BILL 1989</PARA>
<PARA> I bring before the Senate a Bill to enact a number of changes to improve a range of human services provided through the Community Services and Health Portfolio. </PARA>
<PARA> The most significant changes involve the implementation of the first stage of the new general practitioner fees package as agreed between the Government and the Royal Australian College of General Practitioners, and new private health insurance arrangements which are designed to maximise the security and protection of the insured aged. </PARA>
<PARA> The new GP arrangements are the most far reaching advances which have ever been achieved in general practice in this country and are consistent with advances occurring in many similar western nations. The new arrangements will promote better quality patient care, resulting in improved treatment and assessment outcomes through the provision of incentives to GPs to take part in continuing medical education and quality assurance programs. </PARA>
<PARA> Private health insurance arrangements are to be changed to protect the elderly and share the insurance risk of Australia's ageing population fairly among all private health insurance funds. The changes will lead to increased stability within the private health sector, advantaging the majority of health fund contributors in the short term, and the entire private health care industry in the longer term. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill also proposes strengthening of the confidentiality provisions of the Australian Institute of Health Act 1987. It introduces a new pathology services table and changes the arrangements for future alterations to the table. The Bill establishes a private health insurance administration council to take over many of the health insurance functions currently performed by the Department of Community Services and Health. It introduces new health benefit arrangements to encourage greater use of day surgery, and establishes differential day only benefits based on the different types of treatments provided. </PARA>
<PARA> A further amendment will enable an independent person or body to apply for the classification of residents in nursing homes where the proprietor has frequently misclassified residents. The Bill provides for transitional funding arrangements for 38 nursing homes for disabled persons still covered under the Nursing Homes Assistance Act 1974 until that Act ceases to operate after 30 June 1992. Finally, there is a minor amendment in relation to the transfer of nurse education to the higher education sector and the dates of collection of higher education census data. </PARA>
<PARA> Part two of the Bill provides for amendments to the Australian Institute of Health Act 1987 to impose more stringent controls on release of information by the Institute, preventing the disclosure of information, other than to the Minister, contrary to the conditions under which it was supplied to the Institute. </PARA>
<PARA> The amendments recognise the concerns of States and Territories to ensure adequate safeguards of confidentiality of data which may be supplied by States and Territories to the Institute, in particular, the minor amendment to paragraph 29 (4) (b) which ensures that an information provider includes a State or Territory as a body politic and therefore gives that State or Territory power to set terms and conditions for the release or publication of the information it provided to the Institute, represents an agreed response to these concerns. </PARA>
<PARA> The amendments in part three of the Bill relate to an agreement between the Government and the Royal Australian College of General Practitioners on a package of measures designed to improve the quality and cost effectiveness of medical services provided by general practitioners. </PARA>
<PARA> The package provides a number of inter-related measures to provide incentives for general practitioners to strive to improve the quality of care:</PARA>
<PARA> A vocational register of general practitioners;</PARA>
<PARA> the requirement that for general practitioners to remain on the register they undertake continuing medical education and quality assurance programs accredited by the RACGP;</PARA>
<PARA> the introduction of new items into the Medicare benefits schedule for consultations by vocationally registered general practitioners;</PARA>
<PARA> the new items to attract higher fees than those currently available to general practitioners and to generally be based on both complexity of the service provided and the time taken; and</PARA>
<PARA> the introduction of improved audit and monitoring arrangements, involving an independent professional organisation, for services provided by vocationally registered general practitioners, which will extend to examining, referral and prescribing patterns and the ordering of diagnostic tests. </PARA>
<PARA> This Bill makes provision for the establishment of the vocational register which will enable the new items to be introduced from 1 August 1989 by regulations. Existing items for general practitioner services will remain for use by other doctors providing primary medical care. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government intends to introduce further legislation in the Budget session to permit the establishment of the improved audit and monitoring arrangements.</PARA>
<PARA> The proposed register will be maintained by the Health Insurance Commission. The Bill provides that the Commission shall register a medical practitioner who has been certified by the RACGP-or other body as determined by the Minister-as practising predominantly in general practice and as having appropriate training and experience in general practice or who is otherwise eligible in accordance with the regulations. Enrolment on the register will be voluntary. </PARA>
<PARA> In assessing a practitioner's medical practice, the RACGP will have regard to whether the practitioner provides a comprehensive primary medical service, including treating a wide range of patients and conditions using a variety of accepted medical skills and techniques, providing services away from the practitioner's surgery on request (for example home visits) and making appropriate provision for the practitioner's patients to have access to after hours medical care. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has accepted that fellowship of the RACGP, or an equivalent post-graduate qualification in general practice, should ultimately be the only experience and training which make it appropriate for a practitioner to be placed on the vocational register. This will apply from 1995. However, to protect doctors already engaged in general practice, other qualifications and training will be accepted in the meantime, including membership of the RACGP, a certificate of satisfactory completion of the family medicine program, or five years experience in general practice. This will ensure that doctors who are currently in practice will be able to qualify for vocational registration on the basis of experience before the tighter requirement comes into effect in 1995. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to stress that any medical practitioner whose practice has been predominantly in general practice as defined for five years-whether full-time or part-time-will be eligible. The RACGP has defined part-time practice as a minimum of two sessions a week, which the Government regards as a generous provision. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government is concerned that the AMA has been involved in a campaign of misinformation, with its claims that part-time GPs, the majority of whom are women, will not be eligible to register, when a simple inquiry would have revealed that this was patently false. Likewise, doctors who work in sports medicine, student health clinics, women's health clinics and family planning clinics-other areas targeted by the AMA-will be assessed on an individual basis against the eligibility criteria. </PARA>
<PARA> It has been the aim of the Government and the RACGP to include as many GPs as possible within the eligibility criteria-not to exclude them. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government also takes issue with the AMA's attempts to depict the new arrangements as in some way discriminating or disadvantaging those doctors who are found to be ineligible. Rather, the reverse is true in that the arrangements will reward those GPs who are prepared to improve their skills by taking part in continuing medical education and quality assurance programs. </PARA>
<PARA> Certainly not all doctors will be eligible, but neither should they be if they are not prepared to meet those requirements. What the government and the RACGP are in effect seeking are changes in work practices which result in increased productivity in general practice through an improvement in the quality of patient care. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill also makes provision for a doctor's name to be removed from the register in certain circumstances. </PARA>
<PARA> The proposals provide an active role for the relevant professional body, the RACGP, in ensuring the quality of general practice in Australia. It conforms with the role of other specialist medical colleges as the arbiters of professional standards in this country. </PARA>
<PARA> The RACGP will provide a review mechanism for its decisions relating to vocational registration, including independent arbitration, to ensure that its assessment processes are fair for all doctors. An independent arbitrator who is acceptable to both the aggrieved doctor and the RACGP will perform this function. Should such processes present difficulties, there are provisions in the Bill to enable registration to be done by other means and another body to be substituted for the RACGP. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill also provides for the general public to be able to find out from the Commission the names of medical practitioners on the register and for the Commission to make information about the register available to the RACGP. These provisions will assist the public to make informed choices about medical care and will facilitate the RACGP's role in registration and removal from registration. The Government and the RACGP are jointly developing a program to better educate and inform the medical profession and the public about the new arrangements. </PARA>
<PARA> Taken together with the proposal for monitoring arrangements, these proposals will create a climate for improved patient care at the primary level, a more professional approach to general practice, and improved public accountability for the $1.4 billion in medicare benefits which go to underwriting the costs of general practitioners' services. In the longer term, the government expects general practitioners to be more willing to care for more complex conditions within their competence and to be more discriminating in their use of specialist referrals, prescribing and diagnostic tests. </PARA>
<PARA> This should lead to reduced costs in the secondary and tertiary sectors and overall a much more effective use of health resources. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government is confident that this package will have the overwhelming support of the majority of general practitioners, and of the community in general. </PARA>
<PARA> Part 3 of the Bill also includes new provisions for variations and alterations to the pathology services table. As a result of findings of the Joint Parliamentary Committee of Public Accounts Report Number 236, on `Medical Fraud and Overservicing-Pathology', a new statutory body-the Pathology Services Advisory Committee (PSAC)-was created to review pathology items and fee levels and related matters and to make recommendations to the Minister for Community Services and Health on such matters. </PARA>
<PARA> The framework of PSAC was designed to bring about a more appropriate level of financing of pathology services which would adequately compensate the industry, while at the same time removing the potential which had been identified by the PAC report for abuse and overservicing. </PARA>
<PARA> PSAC made its first recommendation, which the Government accepted, for an increase in fees of 6.62% to all pathology services, to take effect from 1 December 1987. In July 1988, PSAC recommended a new pathology services table (PST) aimed at rectifying most of the major concerns raised by the Parliamentary Accounts Committee. This new table came into effect on 1 November 1988. However, following a challenge in the Federal Court, the new table was ruled to be void and benefits reverted to the 1 December 1987 PST. </PARA>
<PARA> I should stress that the Federal Court ruling on the November 1988 table was not made on any inherent structural deficiency in the pathology table but on the basis that PSAC, in making its recommendation, had not followed parts of the principles determined for the performance of its functions. Subsequent legal opinion was that PSAC's previous recommendations to the Minister for Community Services and Health were also void-because PSAC had followed a similar approach in regard to the principles that had applied to the 1988 table-and payment of medicare benefits for pathology services therefore had to revert to the table in effect prior to PSAC's establishment, that is the August 1986 pathology table. This table against which medicare benefits are currently being paid has all the deficiencies identified by the PAC. </PARA>
<PARA> Late in 1988, the RCPA withdrew its nominees from PSAC, rendering the committee inoperative. In effect, under the existing legislation, this means that the pathology table cannot be amended. The Government therefore has no option but to introduce this amending legislation so the pathology table can be varied when necessary. </PARA>
<PARA> This legislation proposes that those provisions in the Health Insurance Act relating to the pathology services table and PSAC mechanisms be repealed and replaced with a structure which allows the Minister for Community Services and Health to determine an appropriate table which is then prescribed by regulation. This is a similar mechanism which is in place, and has been in place for many years, in respect of the general medical services table. </PARA>
<PARA> The new table is based broadly on the 1988 table recommended by PSAC, but with modifications to reflect some of the concerns raised by the profession. While it simplifies the existing table, taking into account advances in technology which have occurred since the last major restructuring of the pathology services table in 1977, and reduces the overall number of items, it also eases some of the restrictions contained in the 1988 table in relation to the availability of some tests. The Government is confident that the new table will promote good medical practice and reduce the potential for abuses, and believes it essential for it to be put in place to allow for a more appropriate level of medicare benefits for patients compared to the existing table. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister for Community Services and Health would like to place on record his appreciation of the considerable input made by the pathology industry through the Australian Association of Pathology Practices (AAPP) in the development of the new PST which is appended to the draft Bill. AAPP gave freely of its time and expertise throughout this process and the Minister is pleased that agreement has been reached on the structure of the new table and the description of individual items within it. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government is confident that the continuation of this consultative process in relation to matters concerning the pathology services table will be of benefit to the Government, pathologists, and patients. </PARA>
<PARA> Part 4 of the Bill seeks to make two main changes which affect people with private health insurance, firstly in relation to revised reinsurance arrangements which will commence from 1 June 1989, and secondly in relation to the establishment and functions of the Private Health Insurance Administration Council. </PARA>
<PARA> The reinsurance account arrangements form an integral part of community rating, which has always applied to the health insurance arrangements in Australia and has an important social welfare role. This principle provides that all people are treated equally for health insurance purposes, regardless of age, medical history or family size. The alternative is a risk rated system where the young and healthy would pay lower premiums but the aged, the chronically ill, and people with large families would find the cost of insurance prohibitive-they would pay far more than they do currently. </PARA>
<PARA> The reinsurance arrangements provide a mechanism for part of the benefits liability for heavy claiming contributors to be shared between funds on an equitable basis. The current system, which has remained largely unchanged since 1978, involves sharing the benefits liability at the basic table rate for any days in excess of 35 per contributor unit in a 12 month period. The effect of this system is that funds with a higher than average reinsurance claims experience are subsidised by funds with a lower than average experience. </PARA>
<PARA> As a result of concerns that the current arrangements were not equally reflecting the varying experience of funds with a disproportionate share of heavy drawing contributors, a detailed review was conducted. That review showed that benefits paid out to the 65 and over age group amounted to about one third of total hospital benefits, although the group represented only about 15 per cent of the total insured population. Moreover, there was a significant disparity between funds in the liability for these benefits, some 70 per cent of which related to hospitalisation under 35 days in a year and were thus not included in the current reinsurance arrangements. </PARA>
<PARA> It also became apparent that total hospital experience, as opposed to basic table only, would be a more appropriate basis for reinsurance as some 83 per cent of all those insured have supplementary cover. In addition, basic table cover is being increasingly aligned with public hospital experience and thus increasingly out of step with benefits paid for private hospital services. </PARA>
<PARA> After extensive consultation with the private health care sector, preference was given to a reinsurance system that covered the total hospital experience of the 65 and over age group as well as total hospital experience over 35 days for the under 65s. The proposed new arrangements therefore provide a much fairer basis for reinsurance and specifically recognise those people, that is, the aged and chronically ill, who are the heaviest users of hospital services.</PARA>
<PARA> These changes will provide greatest assistance to those long established non-profit funds with a disproportionately high share of aged and chronically ill members. Where possible, the Government will be looking to those funds to reduce their contribution rates or forgo planned future increases. Some funds, particularly the small new for-profit funds and the closed funds with restricted membership, and which have a better than average claims experience related to age profile, will, of course, face an increased liability, which is the very nature of reinsurance. </PARA>
<PARA> Many of these funds have enjoyed a privileged position within the health insurance market, either because they are relatively new or because they have been able to be more selective of their members. The Government has decided that this unfair competitive advantage should not be maintained at the expense of the majority of contributors and that there should be a more even playing field between funds. </PARA>
<PARA> The extent to which these changes will need to be reflected in contribution rates will vary from fund to fund, depending on factors such as the profitability of current contribution rates and the level of accumulated reserves. Many of those funds with an increased liability already possess substantial reserves. </PARA>
<PARA> As well, the Government will be making a one-off contribution to reinsurance of $20 million this financial year to minimise the effect of the new arrangements. This money will be disbursed over the next eighteen months to December 1990 so as to cushion the impact of the reinsurance changes on those funds most heavily affected. Apart from this one-off contribution, there will be no further Commonwealth contribution to reinsurance. </PARA>
<PARA> This combination of factors will mean that any increases in contribution rates as a direct cause of the new arrangements will be minimal. </PARA>
<PARA> It should be noted that although the changes will increase the reinsurance pool from $200 million to more than $600 million a year, this will result in a redistribution of only an estimated $70 million, as compared to $29 million under the current arrangements. This represents less than 5 per cent out of total hospital benefits of $1.54 billion. </PARA>
<PARA> Thus, while these new arrangements will provide for a greater sharing of risk and therefore greater stability within the industry, there will still be ample scope for competition and cost efficiency. </PARA>
<PARA> As a further incentive for funds to seek to expand their memberships, newly insured members-not including those who transfer between funds-will be excluded from the reinsurance count for the first year of their membership, although their claims will be included in the reinsurance pool assessments. </PARA>
<PARA> The new arrangements remove the disincentive to insure people aged over 65. They also provide a positive incentive for funds to offer better supplementary benefits and therefore will encourage the use of private hospitals-a fact which the Australian Private Hospitals Association attempts to gloss over. The supplementary benefits which will be acceptable for reinsurance purposes will be defined by ministerial determination. </PARA>
<PARA> By providing for a greater sharing between health funds of the cost of caring for the aged and the chronically ill, the Government is underwriting its commitment to community rating-a commitment which to date has been shared by those opposite and which I would hope they would continue to share, as community rating works to the benefit of the aged, the chronically ill, and large families. </PARA>
<PARA> Much needless anxiety has been generated in recent times by hysterical claims about a supposed crisis in the private health care industry, yet an analysis of the facts shows that this is simply not the case. Over the past four years, the private health sector has remained relatively stable, with only small variations overall in both the levels of private health insurance coverage and in private hospital utilisation. Indeed despite what some prophets of doom have claimed, the number of people with private hospital cover has grown by more than one million in that period. The Government has always maintained that Medicare's continued success and high popularity is dependent upon the maintenance of a strong, viable private health care sector. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government recognises that there are particular pressure points within the private health care market and indeed these changes are designed to alleviate some of those pressures. However they are not intended to solve every problem besetting the private health care market as some would wish. </PARA>
<PARA> It is not the Government's responsibility to maintain the viability of every private hospital bed in Australia. That would simply better sustain an inefficient private system at public expense. Nor is it the Government's responsibility to compel or encourage people to take out private health insurance. Under Medicare, all Australians are covered for essential medical and hospital treatment and then have the freedom to choose whether to take out additional private cover. </PARA>
<PARA> With this initiative, the Government is ensuring increased stability for health fund contributors and a more even playing field for the private health funds-it is now up to the private health funds, private hospitals, and private doctors to make the private health care market work. </PARA>
<PARA> For example, if private funds and private hospitals cannot agree to closely align their charges and benefits, and if private hospitals will not observe the step down periods, so that patients are left substantially out of pocket even after paying top table insurance, then quite naturally they will question whether they should retain their private cover or go to private hospitals. But these are problems which only the industry can resolve. </PARA>
<PARA> This Bill also provides for the devolution to an industry body of certain private health insurance functions currently carried out by the Department of Community Services and Health. This proposal accords with the Government's budget strategy to reduce the size of the public sector and its policy of reducing the degree of regulation in the private sector. </PARA>
<PARA> The industry body is to be known as the Private Health Insurance Administration Council. It will be under the control of an independent Commissioner, who shall have four advisers-three representing the Health Insurance industry with the remaining adviser also being independent. Members of the Council will be appointed in accordance with guidelines which will be developed in consultation with the industry. </PARA>
<PARA> The main functions of the Council will be to:</PARA>
<PARA> administer the reinsurance arrangements;</PARA>
<PARA> monitor the financial performance of health funds to ensure viability and to make recommendations as to the action to be taken where a fund's experience declines;</PARA>
<PARA> collect and disseminate financial and statistical data, including an annual report for tabling in Parliament, on health funds' operations; and</PARA>
<PARA> administer the funding arrangements for the operation of acute care advisory committees. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill proposes to allow individuals to seek an injunction from the Federal Court against an organisation that appears to be acting in breach of Section 67 of the National Health Act. This section was primarily designed to ensure that health insurance business could only be offered by registered health benefits organisations in accordance with community rating. </PARA>
<PARA> Section 67 has, in the interpretation of `Health Insurance Business' versus `Accident and Sickness Insurance Business', generated a substantial number of legal challenges which have proven to be both complex and time consuming. Departmental resources will no longer be available to be devoted to the resolution of these disputes. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill also provides that organisations may register as a health benefits organisation on a national basis rather than a state basis as at present. However, organisations will still need to conduct a separate fund for each state in which they have approval to operate. Also, they will still need to seek approval to transfer reserves between states as a safeguard against predatory pricing to increase their membership size. </PARA>
<PARA> The repeal of Section 73baa of the National Health Act which controls diversification activities by registered organisations is merely in keeping with decreasing unnecessary regulation. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill also provides for tighter solvency requirements for health funds, similar to the requirements for general insurers provided under the Insurance Act. </PARA>
<PARA> Organisations will be required, nationally, to maintain the greater part of $1 million (with provision to prescribe a higher amount to maintain monetary value because of the effect of inflation) or two months' contribution income. Provision is included to exempt funds from this requirement-for example, for small funds which would have to cease business if forced to carry reserves of $1 million. Where exemptions are sought by existing organisations they will need to produce satisfactory actuarial and other evidence to demonstrate their viability. No exemption will apply, however, to a new organisation seeking registration. </PARA>
<PARA> These more stringent requirements are considered imperative as a safeguard against a fund collapsing, particularly in this increasingly `de-regulated' environment. However, in the unlikely event of a collapse two measures are proposed to protect the interests of contributors. </PARA>
<PARA> Firstly, the Private Health Insurance Administration Council will be empowered to impose a levy on health funds for the purposes of meeting any outstanding claims for benefits of the collapsed fund. Secondly, the Bill proposes an expansion of a condition of registration on funds to accept former contributors of a collapsed fund with full continuity of benefits entitlements. </PARA>
<PARA> The changes proposed to section 78 of the National Health Act are designed to simplify the processing of changes in health fund rules and complement the reduction in departmental staff resources. </PARA>
<PARA> The purpose of the changes in clause 48 of the Bill is to facilitate mergers between registered health benefits organisations located in different states. Currently mergers can only take place between organisations in the same State. This amendment is consistent with that contained in clause 28 to provide for national registration of organisations. </PARA>
<PARA> Clause 51 makes provision to prescribe by national health regulation a specific modification to the operation of the basic private table. The purpose of this amendment is to allow for a health fund to seek ministerial approval for self-funded pilot or demonstration schemes to advance private health insurance. </PARA>
<PARA> As part of the devolution process, provision is made for a rationalisation of the acute care advisory committee review process and hands over responsibility for the administration and financing of the process to the Private Health Insurance Administration Council. However, the purpose of the review process, namely to adjudicate on whether certain long term patients in hospitals are acute care patients or nursing home type patients, remains unaffected, as will the medical basis for that adjudication. </PARA>
<PARA> Clause 17 is designed to close a loophole whereby `gap' type medical benefits can be paid when not related to the actual loss sustained in meeting medical expenses. This practice is contrary to the Government's policy of prohibiting certain medical insurance, as intended by section 126 of the Health Insurance Act. </PARA>
<PARA> In clauses 20, 21 and 22, changes are proposed to remove anomalies in the current day hospital arrangements, as well as to encourage day only admissions in lieu of overnight inpatient hospital stays, for a range of surgical operations and medical procedures. </PARA>
<PARA> Overseas experience suggests that up to 40 per cent of surgical procedures can be safely undertaken on a day-only basis. The amendments proposed should ultimately achieve a similar result for Australia, which will:</PARA>
<PARA> be more convenient for patients;</PARA>
<PARA> assist in reducting public hospital waiting times;</PARA>
<PARA> reduce hospital costs; and</PARA>
<PARA> contain health fund premiums. </PARA>
<PARA> The proposals allow for the identification of a range of largely surgical procedures considered suitable for day-only admissions to either hospitals or licensed free-standing day surgery centres. These procedures will, where the patient is privately insured, qualify for a day-only basic table benefit rather than a full inpatient hospital benefit unless the patient's doctor certifies that an overnight admission was warranted because of medical, social or environmental reasons. </PARA>
<PARA> As an adjunct, in recognition of the varying levels of complexity of procedures which can be carried out on a day-only basis, a grouping of the procedures will be undertaken to which a differential scale of basic insurance benefits will apply. The present arrangement of a flat rate benefit does not recognise the differing costs and complexities of individual procedures. </PARA>
<PARA> These changes are designed to further promote day surgery in line with the special funding being provided to the States and Territories under the new medicare agreement incentive package arrangements which provide specific grants for the development and improvement of day surgery in the public hospital system. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill also amends the National Health Act to introduce provisions designed to prevent abuse of the resident classification system. Under current arrangements nursing home proprietors are able to abuse the resident classification system by providing information leading to the classification of residents at unjustifiable levels, thereby obtaining excess benefits. </PARA>
<PARA> These amendments enable the secretary of the Department of Community Services and Health to determine that an independent person or body should apply for the classification of residents in cases of flagrant and frequently provided inaccurate information leading to the classification of residents at levels which have not been sustained at review. A nursing home proprietor will have the right to request a review by the Minister of the secretary's determination. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill also facilitates the phased transfer of all nursing homes for disabled persons from the Nursing Homes Assistance Act 1974 to the Disability Services Act 1986, which provides access for people with disabilities to a more appropriate and extensive range of services. </PARA>
<PARA> Honourable Senators would be aware that all aged persons nursing homes previously covered by the Nursing Homes Assistance Act have been transferred to the National Health Act. The Nursing Homes Assistance Act now covers only 38 nursing homes for disabled persons, with the further 20 nursing homes for disabled persons covered by the National Health Act. </PARA>
<PARA> It is the Government's intention that all nursing homes for disabled persons should be brought under the Disability Services Act by June 30, 1992. All of these homes were advised of this in May 1988. Eight have transferred and a number of others have indicated their intention of doing so. </PARA>
<PARA> The nursing homes have also been advised that once they transfer under the Disability Services Act, additional funding, as necessary, will be made available to enable them to deliver a less restrictive range of services to people with disabilities. </PARA>
<PARA> Consistent with the Government's view that the nursing home model does not provide the most appropriate, least restrictive, accommodation for people with disabilities, the Bill introduces a sunset clause to the Nursing Homes Assistance Act to provide that the Act will cease to operate after 30 June 1992 and provides that no approvals will be given for new nursing homes under this Act. This brings services funded under the Act in line with those services formerly funded under the Handicapped Persons Assistance Act 1974, which are already required to have transferred to section 10 status under the Disability Services Act by that date. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill also amends the definition of ``nursing home care'' by including a specific reference to ``personal care'' which is defined as ``assistance of a personal nature given to help a person attend to his or her daily needs or carry out his or her daily routine''. This recognises that many people with disabilities are in nursing homes because they have high personal care needs, not because they require the medical model of nursing care provided in such homes. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill also seeks to establish an indexed upper limit on the level of funding that can be provided to nursing homes that choose to remain under the Nursing Homes Assistance Act. The Bill therefore provides for the continuation of the previous deficit financing arrangements, with the proviso that the level of ordinary expenditure per occupied bed in 1988-89 can be increased only in accordance with an approved level of indexation. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, the proposed simple amendment to the States Grants (Nurse Education Transfer Assistance) Act 1985 is consequent upon a change introduced by the Department of Employment, Education and Training to collect census data on students enrolled in higher education courses on 31 March and 31 August rather than 30 April and 30 September. The census data is used to check, for payments purposes, that the planned numbers of students are actually enrolled. </PARA>
<PARA> Any future amendments to the key dates for collection, or other matters required or permitted by the Act to be prescribed, may be made by regulation of the Governor-General. </PARA>
<PARA>Financial Impact Statement</PARA>
<PARA> The amendments to the AIH Act have no financial impact on government outlays.</PARA>
<PARA> The financial impact of the new GP fee arrangements will be announced separately as part of the government's statement on Medicare fee increases for 1989/90. The revised pathology services table arrangements will result in a saving of $45 million on the forward estimates for 1989/90 and 1990/91. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government will be providing a one-off payment of $20 million to the Reinsurance Trust Fund in this financial year but will remove its $1 million annual contribution from 1989-90. The effect on the CPI of the full impact of the reinsurance changes as reflected in contribution rates will be nil. </PARA>
<PARA> An amount of $300,000 will be provided over three years to assist with the establishment costs of the Private Health Insurance Administration Council. All other expenses will be borne by the industry, with the Council having the power to impose levies to meet the costs. </PARA>
<PARA> The amendments to the Nursing Homes Assistance Act are expected to provide moderate savings in the order of $1 million a year, although this will be offset by the requirement for additional funds to assist nursing homes for disabled persons to make the transition to the models of service delivery required under the Disability Services Act. </PARA>
<PARA> I commend the Bill to the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA>SUPPORTED ACCOMMODATION ASSISTANCE BILL 1989</PARA>
<PARA> This Bill authorises the Commonwealth to enter into a new five year agreement with each State and with the Australian Capital Territory and the Northern Territory for the provision of services for homeless people in crises under a new supported accommodation assistance program (SAAP). </PARA>
<PARA> When this Government came to office in March 1983, it identified homelessness as a major priority for urgent attention. At that time, there were no clear policies or directions to remedy youth or older age homelessness and there was no coordination of emergency accommodation services for women and children. Some programs were administered and funded by the Commonwealth and others were administered and cost shared by States. </PARA>
<PARA> There was no overall planning and programs were uncoordinated and unnecessarily complex. Needs were not being met due to lack of planning and due to restrictions on the assistance which could be provided. Funding of approved projects under existing program guidelines was often inadequate. </PARA>
<PARA> On coming to office, we established, in 1983, a major review of crisis accommodation programs. The review found that there was no logical basis for the existing arrangements. As a result of the review's recommendations, the Government established the Supported Accommodation Assistance Program-the SAAP program-in January 1985, bringing together existing services under a common funding and policy auspice. </PARA>
<PARA> SAAP is a jointly funded Commonwealth/State program administered by the States. Under the program, non-Government organisations and local government authorities receive recurrent and non-housing capital funds to provide supported accommodation and related support services to homeless people in crisis and who need help to move towards independent living. </PARA>
<PARA> A wide range of services are provided including refuges, drop-in centres, half-way houses, meals services, counselling in daily living skills and referral and advocacy services. The program's operation is governed by a Commonwealth/State agreement which will expire on 30 June 1989. </PARA>
<PARA> A jointly funded national evaluation of the SAAP program was conducted by an independent consultant, Ms Colleen Chesterman, in 1987, to examine the program's effectiveness and to advise on ways of refining its design and focus. </PARA>
<PARA> In the course of the review, virtually all SAAP service providers were consulted as well as numerous organisations supporting the homeless in every State and Territory. </PARA>
<PARA> The SAAP review report, `Homes Away From Home', was publicly released in February 1988. The report noted the program's very major achievements to date. It concluded that SAAP was well targeted, providing vital emotional and material assistance to the most disadvantaged people in Australia-people who are poor with insecure housing, many of whom have suffered physical abuse, addiction or institutionalisation. </PARA>
<PARA> The review noted that there has been a marked increase in the level of resources allocated by both Federal and State Governments since the introduction of SAAP which has resulted in greatly expanded assistance for homeless people in crisis. There are now some 800 SAAP services operating in a co-ordinated fashion from some 1200 outlets. </PARA>
<PARA> Data from the national SAAP client data collection indicated that, on any one day, over 11,000 people throughout Australia are assisted under SAAP, of which:</PARA>
<PARA> 1,500 are in youth refuges;</PARA>
<PARA> 2,500 are in women's refuges;</PARA>
<PARA> 4,200 are in general crisis accommodation services; and</PARA>
<PARA> 3,100 receive non-accommodation services such as meals, counselling and advice. </PARA>
<PARA> Moreover, the introduction of SAAP has placed many services on a secure financial footing for the first time. This has enabled providers to improve the quality of accommodation and appropriateness of services provided, particularly through the provision of non-institutional client focused services. </PARA>
<PARA> The SAAP review recommended the continuation of SAAP as a jointly funded Commonwealth/State program supported by a new five year agreement with each State and Territory. </PARA>
<PARA> The recent report of the National Inquiry Into Homeless Children undertaken by the Human Rights and Equal Opportunities Commission, known as the Burdekin Report, reinforces the need for a supported accommodation assistance program. Clearly, responses to the complex web of issues related to youth homelessness cannot be confined to one policy area or level of Government. However, the new SAAP program will provide major improvements to the Government's response to the problem of homeless young people. Some States have already increased the emphasis on medium and longer term alternatives to youth refuges and this trend will continue under the new program. </PARA>
<PARA> The development of a range of types of services with an emphasis on moving to independent living as soon as possible will be encouraged, consistent with the recommendations of the SAAP Review Report. </PARA>
<PARA> A draft Commonwealth/State agreement was presented to Social Welfare Ministers at their meeting on 20 March 1989. State Ministers endorsed that agreement but the Commonwealth was concerned to ensure that the position of young children was clarified. To this end, a definition of young people has been included. </PARA>
<PARA> The agreement, which forms a Schedule to this Bill, covers the joint arrangements for a new jointly funded Commonwealth/State program administered by the States and Territories which would operate for five years from 1 July 1989. </PARA>
<PARA> The agreement takes account of the experience of the current program, the views of States and community groups expressed through the operation of the program and its advisory processes and the SAAP Review's findings and recommendations. </PARA>
<PARA> The objective of the new program will be the provision by non-profit organisations and local governments, with financial assistance from the Commonwealth and the States, of transitional supported accommodation services and related supported services to men, women and children who are homeless and in crisis to help them move towards independent living, where appropriate, or other alternatives such as long term supported housing, as soon as possible. </PARA>
<PARA> The primary principle of the new program is to ensure that homeless people in crisis in Australia have access to adequate and appropriate transitional supported accommodation and related support services. In implementing this principle, assistance provided will also reflect the following detailed principles. </PARA>
<PARA> The focus of the program will be on transitional assistance. Services will be designed to be of varying duration and levels of support to meet the needs of individuals to move towards independent living or other appropriate alternatives;</PARA>
<PARA> The emphasis will be on ensuring individuals retain maximum independence;</PARA>
<PARA> There will be early assessment of clients' needs, referral to more appropriate services or programs where required and available and assistance to secure long term housing alternatives;</PARA>
<PARA> Services will be available to all sections of the community;</PARA>
<PARA> Services will be sensitive to the problems of homelessness, domestic violence and personal crisis and will actively work to enhance the dignity, self esteem and independence of clients;</PARA>
<PARA> Services will assist clients in ways which recognise the individual needs of clients, develop clients' independence and enhance their own support network; and</PARA>
<PARA> Priority will be given to services involved in direct service provision for homeless people in crisis and whose focus is on assistance for individual clients. </PARA>
<PARA> The new program will cover a range of service models of varying duration, type and level of support. It will include services designed to meet the particular needs of women who are homeless and/or in crisis as a result of domestic violence as well as services for Aboriginal people and people from non English-speaking backgrounds. Services for chronically homeless people with limited capacity for independent living will continue to be eligible. </PARA>
<PARA> It is important that SAAP is not used as a substitute for other programs of assistance by State governments for homeless youth. State governments have responsibility for children under 16 years and the Commonwealth is concerned to ensure that SAAP does not become the easy way out for States. </PARA>
<PARA> For this reason, the agreement provides that new services which cater exclusively for children under 16 years will not be funded under this program. As well, the agreement provides that SAAP will not be used to replace or duplicate services and assistance already provided by, or which are the responsibility of, other government programs or services such as substitute care and aged care. </PARA>
<PARA> Under the new program all people who are homeless and in crisis are able to be assisted. However, for some groups such as young people under 16 or the frail aged, SAAP cannot provide the specialised services required. The program embodies the principles that for all groups helped under the program there is to be early assessment or clients needs and referral to more appropriate services or programs where required and available. </PARA>
<PARA> No existing SAAP services will be disadvantaged by the introduction of the new arrangements. Services currently funded under SAAP will continue to be funded under the new program, subject to normal accountability and performance standards. </PARA>
<PARA> Financial assistance to the States shall be by way of grants. The Commonwealth and the States will continue to provide base funding equivalent to the level of their annual contribution to the program as at 30 June in this year immediately preceding the relevant financial year, indexed on an annual basis. At 30 June 1989, Commonwealth base funding for SAAP will be $64.1 million and States' base funding will be $40.3 million. This represents a real increase of 248% in Commonwealth/State funding for SAAP since the commencement of the program in 1985. </PARA>
<PARA> Despite the very great increase in Commonwealth/State resources devoted to homeless people in crisis, there is an urgent and increasing need for additional services. Accordingly, the Commonwealth is providing $5 million per year for new and expanded services for the first three years of the new program on the basis of equivalent forward commitment and dollar for dollar matching by the States. Commonwealth and State growth funds accepted in one year would be incorporated in the program base for the following year and the total base indexed. In total, this represents an increased Commonwealth commitment of $40 million over three years. These additional Commonwealth funds will bring the total Federal Government commitment to the program, including maintenance of current expenditure, to about $240 million over the three years to 1992 which represents real growth of some 20% over the three year period. </PARA>
<PARA> An important new feature of the SAAP program will be the development of Commonwealth/State plans which will set out the operation of the program for each year in the State. The plans shall include:</PARA>
<PARA> An assessment of existing service provision and distribution;</PARA>
<PARA> An assessment of unmet need;</PARA>
<PARA> The agreed Commonwealth/State priorities for the year, including identified target groups;</PARA>
<PARA> Program finances for the year;</PARA>
<PARA> The timing, content and process of major program reviews;</PARA>
<PARA> Proposed research and data collections for the year in relation to the State program or on National issues; and</PARA>
<PARA> The timetable for planning and approval processes in the current and the subsequent financial year. </PARA>
<PARA> Feedback and advice from SAAP service providers and relevant community groups is a vital element in the development of the Commonwealth/State plan. Accordingly, the new program provides for the development of new and enhanced advisory structures. A ministerial advisory committee will be established in each State comprised of members drawn from service providers and other parties with relevant expertise (forming the majority of the committee) and Commonwealth and State Government officials. </PARA>
<PARA> The ministerial advisory committee shall provide advice to Ministers on priorities to be taken into account in the annual planning processes, levels of unmet need and matters such as program accountability requirements, service standards and data needs. The plan itself will be jointly approved by the responsible Commonwealth and State Ministers. </PARA>
<PARA> Within the current SAAP program, there are three sub-programs for homeless people in crisis relating to women, youth and general services. The SAAP review found that the current SAAP sub-programs have played an important role in the establishment phase of SAAP but suggested that the sub-program focus had created unnecessary complexity, led to restrictions which disadvantaged certain high need groups (for example, single homeless women and families) and hampered flexibility in planning and referral. It recommended the replacement of sub-programs with target groups. </PARA>
<PARA> Accordingly, under the new program, funds will be allocated within States each year according to priority target groups rather than sub-programs. Planning for the development of services and the allocation of resources will be on the basis of priority target groups identified in the planning process. </PARA>
<PARA> The new program covers a range of measures which will lead to improved program effectiveness and efficiency. Apart from the plan, these include service agreements between all SAAP services and State Governments incorporating agreed nationally consistent provisions, and regular review of service performance. </PARA>
<PARA> Another important feature of the proposed agreement is in the area of user rights. The Commonwealth and States will agree within two years of the commencement of the agreement on mechanisms for resolving breaches of individual rights. </PARA>
<PARA> Such mechanisms will include principles and strategies for the protection of users' rights, which may include such matters as participation in decision making. Mechanisms will also include internal grievance procedures for the resolution of breaches of user rights at the service provider level and external review procedures. SAAP has been to the forefront in involving clients in decisions about issues which affect them. These proposals will continue to provide protection and dignity to people at a traumatic time of their life. </PARA>
<PARA> Assistance for homeless people in crisis is a shared Commonwealth/State responsibility and an area which requires close cooperation in order to achieve the best possible outcome from available resources. </PARA>
<PARA> Both the Commonwealth and States have vital but different roles to play. To ensure that there is no duplication of effort, the agreement clearly sets out Commonwealth and States roles and areas in which joint action is required. While the States will continue to be responsible for administration of the new program, joint ministerial approval will continue to be required in respect of matters such as the funding of new services and variations to, or defunding of, existing services. </PARA>
<PARA> Capital funds for SAAP services will continue to be made available under the Crisis Accommodation Program (CAP) within the Commonwealth/State housing agreement. In 1988-89 the Commonwealth will provide $19.5 million under CAP. SAAP and CAP will be dealt with by the same advisory committee in each State to provide a co-ordinated approach. </PARA>
<PARA> Apart from authorising financial assistance to the states, this Bill seeks authority for the Commonwealth use up to 2 per cent of Commonwealth growth funds each year for the purpose of national research and development. This will provide scope for Commonwealth initiatives in program development and national research. </PARA>
<PARA> Access to adequate and affordable housing for all is a major priority within the Government's social justice strategy. The new supported accommodation assistance program will build on the experiences of SAAP over the last four and a half years and will provide a more coherent and effective approach to the problems of people who are homeless and in crisis. </PARA>
<PARA> Through this Bill, the Commonwealth, in partnership with the States, is continuing its commitment to the funding of supported accommodation and related services. I thank the State and Territory Ministers for their cooperation in the formulation of the new program. </PARA>
<PARA> I commend the Bill to the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA> That this Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>I seek leave to have the second reading speech incorporated in Hansard. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The speech reads as follows-</PARA>
<PARA> The purpose of this Bill is to give effect to major changes to the operation of the Income Equalisation Deposits (IED) scheme. </PARA>
<PARA> The IED scheme provides a mechanism whereby farmers can reduce fluctuations in their income by putting money aside in good years for the bad years that are likely to follow. The scheme has operated, in various forms, since 1976. </PARA>
<PARA> In the May 1988 Economic Statement, the Government announced that it would introduce a tax-linked IED scheme for primary producers from 1 July 1989. The new scheme, it was announced, would be designed to overcome the drawbacks associated with the tax-linked scheme which operated until 1983. </PARA>
<PARA> Income stability has long been a major issue confronting the rural sector. Unstable incomes in the rural sector are due to cyclical movements in the prices of commodities and the variations in weather, which can be experienced in their most extreme form in floods or droughts. The timing and magnitude of variations in prices and the weather are impossible to predict. </PARA>
<PARA> As a result the incomes of farmers will be highly variable and subject to sharp and sometimes prolonged upturns and downturns. For example, the wool industry is presently enjoying relatively high prices while the wheat industry is only now showing signs of emerging from a significant downturn. There are a number of adverse implications of rural income instability, particularly for farm production, investment and farm welfare. </PARA>
<PARA> On the production side, resources are often misdirected as a result of price and production instability. After the event, it is often clear that farmers have over-produced or under-produced; resources have been employed producing the wrong things in the wrong places in the wrong quantities. </PARA>
<PARA> Large swings in the level of activity in farming industries result in large swings in demand for associated services, such as wheat storage and transport facilities, abattoirs and factories and businesses providing farm inputs and services. This results in considerable inefficiencies for all concerned and the costs are borne directly or partly by the primary industries. </PARA>
<PARA> Farmers, of course, seek to protect themselves from instability and its consequences. Common farm responses are maintaining higher liquidity than otherwise, following more flexible operating patterns and diversifying production into a range of products. However, all these strategies result in some profitable on-farm investments not being made and can increase the asset base necessary for farming. </PARA>
<PARA> Similarly, risk and uncertainty tends to result in farmers being willing to borrow less and lenders being willing to lend less than would have been the case with stability. However, the service sector now provides facilities to farmers which act to reduce the risk associated with production and borrowing. Finance is now rationed according to price rather than quantity. Loans are increasingly being structured to reflect the characteristics and requirements of individual producers. </PARA>
<PARA> Greater stability in farm incomes, however, is likely to result in more farm confidence and borrowing power and, as a consequence, encourage farmers to adopt more efficient production methods over the long run. </PARA>
<PARA> There are also considerable `welfare' costs associated with instability. Widely fluctuating incomes have to be reconciled with regular debt repayment obligations and the rational planning of family living expenses, including health and education. This is particularly serious for lower-income farmers, who face the prospect not only of painful disruption to their family life but also the possible loss of the farm. The problem also extends to many non-farm rural families whose welfare depend on the prosperity of surrounding farmers. While these welfare costs are difficult to determine, they could be very large. </PARA>
<PARA> The implications of unstable rural incomes clearly are not restricted to the agricultural sector, but flow throughout our economy, influencing the level and nature of economic activity. You will recall the depressing effect upon the economy of the drought of 1982-83, when the net value of rural production fell by 80 per cent. Conversely, strong prices for a number of commodities increased the net value of rural production by 68 per cent in 1987-88 making a significant contribution to exports and national income. </PARA>
<PARA> Because of the diversity of commodities produced and the wide range of climatic conditions in Australia, the variability of incomes for individual farmers is likely to be proportionately much greater than the variability in the net value of rural production. </PARA>
<PARA> In view of the significance of farm income fluctuations and their wider implications, the Government accepts that some incentive is justified to encourage farmers to provide for them. This view was supported by the 1974 Green Paper-``Rural Policy in Australia'', the Industries Assistance Commission in its 1975 report-``Rural Income Fluctuations-Certain Taxation Measures'' as well as its 1978 report-``Rural Income Fluctuations'' and Professor Lloyd in his Victorian ``Rural Economics Study'' of 1986. </PARA>
<PARA> A device which operates directly on income to allow farmers to take action to reduce income instability would reduce the pressure on Government to support a variety of alternative stabilisation measures. Many alternative measures act directly on prices or the quantity of production, with adverse implications for generally efficient industry operations. As well, we would wish to avoid measures which conflict with our general goal of an open international trading environment. </PARA>
<PARA> For example, primary industries frequently seek to take common action through arrangements such as commodity price stabilisation schemes, although these rely on Government backing to operate effectively. The Government is supporting a number of price underwriting schemes but as a general policy believes that they should deal only with extraordinary downwards price movements and that industry should assume increasing responsibility for meeting their costs. That is, the Government, while acting to alleviate the pressures created through fluctuating incomes, believes that the price mechanism, which is transparent and rapidly transmits prevailing conditions, forms the most important base for decision making by producers. </PARA>
<PARA> The original IED scheme, established in 1976, was tax-linked, providing tax deductibility on deposit and tax liability on withdrawal and a non-commercial interest rate on the full deposit. However, the operation of both IEDs and tax averaging was distorted by the operation of ``in-out'' averaging (introduced in 1977) whereby primary producers were taxed at the lower of the average and standard rates. </PARA>
<PARA> The IED scheme was revised in 1983, replacing the tax deductibility incentive with an interest subsidy so that the interest earned on deposits was two percentage points above the short term Government bond rate. At the same time ``in-out'' averaging was abolished. </PARA>
<PARA> However, deposits have fallen away rapidly since the introduction of the new scheme. To some extent this would reflect the greater range of financial instruments available following the deregulation of financial markets in 1984. It may also reflect the significant downturns in the sector, for example, the 1982-83 drought and severe downturns in industries such as wheat, sugar and rice. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has therefore decided to introduce a tax-linked IED scheme which overcomes the drawbacks associated with the tax-linked scheme which operated until 1983. </PARA>
<PARA> Because this new scheme is tax-linked amendments are needed to two Acts-the Loan (Income Equalisation Deposits) Act 1976 and the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936. The amendments to the Loan (Income Equalisation Deposits) Act 1976 are necessary to establish how deposits can be made, the determination of interest on deposits, the withdrawal of deposits and the application of a withholding tax to withdrawals. The amendments to the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 are necessary to provide tax deductibility of eligible deposits and for the taxation of deposits when withdrawn. </PARA>
<PARA> In the new scheme deposits will be tax deductible in the year of deposit and assessable for income tax purposes in the year of withdrawal. However, a number of changes will be introduced to ensure that unwarranted benefits are not available. </PARA>
<PARA> Interest will be paid not on the whole deposit but only on the ``investment component''. The investment component reflects the value of the deposit when reduced by the notional tax that would have applied in the year in which it was deposited. This will ensure that interest is not paid on that part of the deposit which would otherwise have been paid in tax. </PARA>
<PARA> As it is not possible to calculate the investment component for each deposit according to the depositor's individual marginal tax rate in the year of deposit, as the marginal tax rate will not be known then, a standard adjustment will be made to all deposits to determine the investment component. The adjustment rate will reflect the typical marginal tax rate of depositors. The rate will be initially set at 39 per cent, to apply from 1 July 1989. Consequently the value of deposits will be reduced by 39 per cent to determine the investment component which will earn interest. Interest will be paid at the short term Commonwealth bond rate. </PARA>
<PARA> A minimum deposit term of one year will apply to deposits. Further, a withholding tax will apply to withdrawals to ensure that there is no undue deferral of tax in the year of withdrawal and that withdrawals aren't manipulated to gain tax advantages. </PARA>
<PARA> As the taxpayer's marginal tax rate for the year of withdrawal will not be known when a withdrawal is made the rate of tax to be deducted will be set at a standard rate to apply to all withdrawals. This rate will represent the typical marginal tax rate of withdrawees in that year. For 1989-90 the rate will be 29 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> The withholding tax will have provisions allowing withdrawees to have the rate of withholding tax reduced if they expect their marginal tax, based on their total taxable income, to be significantly lower that year. This will ensure that the withholding tax is not harsh in its treatment of farmers who seek to withdraw IEDs in years of poor income. Variations may be obtained through an application to the Department of Primary Industries and Energy when making a withdrawal. </PARA>
<PARA> As the purpose of IEDs is to encourage farmers to provide for income fluctuations the tax deduction will be available only to primary producers. Consistent with this, deposits in any year will be limited to net taxable income from primary production in that year. An upper limit of $250,000 will apply to the amount of tax deductable deposits that can be accumulated. This represents a generous provision to maintain against income instability. For example, $250,000 is equivalent to total farm costs for three years for an average farm. Deposits will be deemed to be withdrawn when a taxpayer ceases to be a primary producer. </PARA>
<PARA> The scheme will be administered by the Department of Primary Industries and Energy. Deposits must be made by 30 June of the financial year. A minimum sum of $5,000 will apply to deposits and withdrawals. Deposits must be accompanied by a fee of $20 which will cover administrative costs. </PARA>
<PARA> In the light of the introduction of the new IED scheme, the Government has developed arrangements to phase out both the present scheme as well as the remaining deposits in the pre-1983 tax-linked scheme. </PARA>
<PARA> Deposits will not be accepted in the current IED scheme after 30 June 1989 and deposits in the scheme will be deemed to mature on 30 June 1992, when they will be repaid. This is consistent with the nature of the scheme, under which deposits are essentially financial instruments of the nature of bonds. </PARA>
<PARA> A sum of deposits remains in the pre-1983 tax-linked scheme, notwithstanding that interest on these deposits has been phased to zero. These deposits will be automatically transferred to the new scheme and will attract interest and be subject to the conditions on withdrawal which will apply to the new scheme. They will also form part of the $250,000 limit on the total amount of tax deductable deposits which may be held. Such deposits would not, of course, attract a further tax deduction when transferred. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government is confident that the new IED scheme will make a significant contribution towards assisting farmers stabilise their incomes. </PARA>

<PARA> The Customs Tariff Amendment Bill (No. 3) 1989, which is now before the Senate, contains amendments to implement new tariff measures for the sugar industry and comes into operation from the 1st of July 1989. </PARA>
<PARA> These changes follow a report by the Senate Standing Committee on Industry, Science and Technology and form part of an assistance package which also includes:</PARA>

<PARA> The speech read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA> Honourable Senators, I rise to commend to you a Bill for motor vehicle standards. </PARA>
<PARA> Each year in Australia some 2,800 people are killed on our roads and 30,000 seriously injured. In addition to the trauma and suffering which results from these crashes, the aftermath of this carnage costs the Australian community some $5,700 million annually. This is equivalent to approximately $350 per head of population. </PARA>
<PARA> Fortunately, concerted road safety activities have been able to reduce this pointless waste. It can be shown, for example, that road fatalities are decreasing when compared with the number of vehicles on the road and the distances being travelled. </PARA>
<PARA> A vital component of the Federal Government's road safety strategy is to make the motor vehicle as safe as possible. </PARA>
<PARA> Our aim is to prevent the crash in the first place and, in the event that a crash occurs, to protect the occupants. </PARA>
<PARA> To this end, over the past 20 years, a certification system for motor vehicles has been developed between Federal and State Governments and the vehicle industry. This is managed by the Federal Office of Road Safety, and the cornerstone is the Australian Design Rule System. </PARA>
<PARA> Australian Design rules were introduced in the early 1970s to provide minimum standards for motor vehicles and trailers. Each design rule sets down performance and design standards for particular features or characteristics. </PARA>
<PARA> There is now a range of design rules covering a wide variety of safety requirements. These include seat belts, brakes, tyres and other features to improve occupant protection. There are requirements for areas such as lighting which are intended to help prevent crashes. There are also standards for vehicle exhaust emissions, noise and anti-theft requirements. </PARA>
<PARA> This system has undergone a major review in recent years which has resulted in significant cost savings for the industry by way of reduced paper work and administrative workload. The System today includes a comprehensive program of audit and surveillance of manufacturers' performance against the Design Rules. This helps ensure that production vehicles continue to meet the standards. </PARA>
<PARA> There have been significant successes and progress since the introduction of the Design Rules in the early 1970s. </PARA>
<PARA> There have also been some continuing problems. These have largely resulted from inconsistencies in the way the Design Rules have been implemented by individual States or Territories. </PARA>
<PARA> The vehicle certification system has in the past rested largely on co-operation and consultation. The Commonwealth has traditionally prepared the standards, but has had no legal basis for enforcing them. The States and Territories have used their vehicle registration laws, to call up the Design rules. </PARA>
<PARA> Despite considerable efforts to standardise the implementation of the Rules, uniformity has proved an elusive goal. </PARA>
<PARA> Local interests have unfortunately meant continuing instances where the Design Rules have not been implemented uniformly by the States and Territories. </PARA>
<PARA> Vehicle manufacturers have therefore been faced with the need to negotiate with up to eight separate administrations in order to get clearance to market their vehicles across Australia. In some cases, it has meant that special model variants have had to be produced to satisfy registration requirements of one State or Territory. </PARA>
<PARA> Needless to say, honourable senators, in a market the size of Australia's, the costs involved in this approach can be significant and are invariably passed on to the consumer. In today's climate, I am sure honourable senators will agree that Australian industry can no longer afford to carry unnecessary costs. The Federal Government must make every effort to ensure that we provide the right environment to develop an efficient and competitive vehicle industry. This Bill represents another step on that path. </PARA>
<PARA> Moreover, now that Australian vehicle manufacturers are looking to rationalise operations with their international parents and increasingly to export their vehicles, the question of international harmonisation also arises. </PARA>
<PARA> The Design Rules have been drafted, for some time, on the basis of harmonising with international standards wherever possible. Over the past five years we have moved from a situation where about 30% of Australian standards were harmonised to some 60% harmonisation today. Obviously more can and must be done. </PARA>
<PARA> Greater harmonisation means that Australian vehicles can compete more efficiently in the international market. I don't have to remind senators that Australia needs to develop more manufactured exports to survive in today's competitive world. </PARA>
<PARA> Alignment with international standards also means that the Australian community gets the benefit of the latest international safety standards. </PARA>
<PARA> In 1988 the Inter-State Commission prepared a major report into the need for harmonisation of road transport regulations in Australia. The first recommendation of the report was that a single set of Federal legislation be introduced to ensure uniform vehicle design and construction standards on a national basis. This Bill is intended to put that recommendation into effect. </PARA>
<PARA> The principal objective of this Bill then, is to enable the Federal Government to establish and apply nationally uniform standards for motor vehicle safety, gaseous and noise emissions and anti-theft devices. </PARA>
<PARA> All new vehicles manufactured in Australia will conform with the declared standards. These same standards will apply to imported vehicles, whether new or secondhand, thus ensuring that all vehicles coming onto the market in this country provide the high level of safety and environmental quality expected by the community. </PARA>
<PARA> This legislation is consistent with the Government's micro-economic reforms, in that regulatory costs to industry are reduced. Eight sets of regulations will be replaced by one. </PARA>
<PARA> Transport is a key issue in the Government's reform agenda. This legislation will help motor vehicle industry efficiency with benefits for both domestic and international trade. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill will underpin national uniformity. It includes provisions aimed at avoiding additional local requirements, by applying the same standards to all vehicles at the time of their first sale in Australia, regardless of source. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill will ensure the maintenance of the levels of safety and environmental quality that the community rightfully expects. This represents a major improvement over the current situation, particularly concerning secondhand imported vehicles. </PARA>
<PARA> As it happens, this is a timely Bill. As honourable senators may be aware, there has been a rash of imports of substandard, secondhand motor vehicles. These do not have a number of major safety features and the fact that they are permitted registration in some States but not others is a vivid demonstration of the problems of non uniformity. A truly national approach will avoid these situations. </PARA>
<PARA> I am advised that some examples of the way in which these vehicles do not meet the Design Rules include lack of protection against side impacts, inferior seat belts and lack of child restraint fittings. Other examples include inferior tyre and braking standards. This is because they are built for low speed driving in densely populated Japanese cities-Japanese cars just don't travel as far or as fast as cars used in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> These standards will be declared by Ministerial Order and I intend to call up the existing Australian Design Rules as soon as this legislation comes into effect. </PARA>
<PARA> Honourable Senators will be interested to know that the Australian Design Rules have been developed as a result of an extensive process of consultation with State and Territory Governments, industry, unions and users. The Rules have been endorsed by Federal, State and Territory Ministers at the Australian Transport Advisory Council and the Australian Environment Council as appropriate. </PARA>
<PARA> The Design Rules thus reflect the views of the Australian community regarding the level of safety and environmental quality they want. </PARA>
<PARA> At the time of declaration, the standards will automatically apply to all vehicles coming onto the market in Australia for the first time. </PARA>
<PARA> Advance notice has been given to vehicle importers by my press statement this week. They can now make the necessary arrangements to ensure that cars that they import comply with the Design Rules, or can be modified to comply. </PARA>
<PARA> This Bill derives its powers from the Constitution, section 51 (XX) in relation to corporations, and section 51 (1), the trade and commerce power, in relation to individuals and unincorporated bodies. </PARA>
<PARA> The declared standards will apply to vehicles offered for sale in Australia prior to first registration. After first registration State/Territory laws will apply. Recalls of defective vehicles will be handled under industry codes and the provisions of the Trade Practices Act, as they are today. </PARA>
<PARA> Under the arrangements proposed in this Bill it is intended that States and Territories will retain their responsibility to register motor vehicles for use on Australian roads. In the same way, the States and Territories will retain responsibility for ensuring that vehicles remain roadworthy throughout their useful life. </PARA>
<PARA> However it is intended that the Australian Design Rules be the sole criteria for the supply of vehicles to the Australian market. The Bill contains appropriate provisions to achieve this. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that comprehensive consultation arrangements are essential to ensure that the best possible advice is received during the development of new or revised standards. This should include advice from all interested parties including State and Territory regulatory authorities, industry and road users. I propose to retain the existing Advisory Committee structure agreed to under the auspices of the Australian Transport Advisory Council and the Australian Environment Council unless experience with the new arrangements shows that better alternatives can be found. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill provides power to declare national vehicle design and safety standards by Ministerial Order. Orders will be tabled in both Houses of the Parliament and will be subject to disallowance in the normal way. As I have said earlier, it is my intention to call up the existing Australian Design Rules as the national standards. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill also provides for identification of vehicles that comply with the Design Rules. It covers monitoring the manufacturing and testing processes of manufacturers to ensure that production vehicles continue to meet the standards. </PARA>
<PARA> There will be provision for the appointment of inspectors to carry out the auditing and surveillance functions. These inspectors will comprise a central group of Commonwealth officers assisted where appropriate by State and Territory officers. Officials of other countries' regulatory authorities working under contract or other cooperative agreements will help to audit overseas manufacturers. There will also be provisions to allow the appointment of agents from the private sector. </PARA>
<PARA> I should point out to Honourable Senators that the Federal Government already provides the resources to operate the existing system. The Federal Office of Road Safety manages the development of standards and the certification procedures but until the present has had no legislation to administer them. </PARA>
<PARA> The new arrangements proposed in this Bill will be administered within the Department of Transport and Communications, with only a modest supplement to existing resources in the area. There should be savings available to the States as they will be able to redeploy scarce resources to other priority areas. </PARA>
<PARA> Furthermore, it is important to note that the costs of the existing certification system are fully recovered from the vehicle industry. The Bill provides for cost recovery under the new arrangements. This is yet another illustration of this Government's commitment to the `user pays' philosophy, which is the only way to achieve proper resource allocation and efficiency. It is unlikely that charges will need to be increased at the present time. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill provides for the appointment of an Administrator who will be responsible for the day to day operation of the system. The Administrator will not have the power to declare new standards or withdraw approvals but will have the delegated powers necessary for the efficient and effective operation of the new arrangements. </PARA>
<PARA> There will be provision for the cancellation or suspension, under prescribed circumstances, of the approvals held by manufacturers or importers. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill provides for appropriate sanctions for prescribed offences such as falsely identifying a vehicle as complying with the standards or for supplying a vehicle which does not meet the national standards. </PARA>
<PARA> While it will not be possible for other Governments to impose unique local standards, there will be no restrictions on manufacturers offering additional features on their vehicles as part of their marketing strategy. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill provides control over the import of vehicles, both new and secondhand. There will be procedures to allow non-standard vehicles into Australia provided that the Minister is satisfied that proper arrangements exist to modify the vehicles to ensure that they meet the standards. </PARA>
<PARA> Provision will also be made in the regulations for the importation of vehicles which are bona fide personal possessions. This will apply to migrants or Australian citizens returning from long periods overseas. </PARA>
<PARA> There will also be provision to allow for test or evaluation vehicles and for the exemption of certain classes of vehicles such as tractors and road-making machinery, from the requirements of the Act. </PARA>
<PARA> Consistent with this Government's policies on open government the Bill provides avenues for access to the normal administrative law arrangements. Anyone who is aggrieved by a decision made under the provision of the Bill will be able to seek redress in the normal way. </PARA>
<PARA> In summary, Honourable Senators, this Bill will provide for the first time in Australia a single set of standards for the design and construction of motor vehicles and trailers. </PARA>
<PARA> As a direct result of this national uniformity, every Australian will benefit. The vehicle industry will not be faced with additional costs which have to be passed on to the buyer. The safety and environmental standards which we have all come to expect will be enforced and those few unscrupulous operators who are looking to make a quick profit at the expense of our community safety will have to meet the same standards. </PARA>

<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The speech read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA> The Bill provides for an increase in the level of general purpose financial assistance being provided for Local Government in 1989-90. </PARA>
<PARA> The 1989-90 level of assistance is to be $671 million. This compares with last year's assistance of $652.5 million, an increase of $18.5 million. </PARA>
<PARA> It is necessary to amend the Local Government (Financial Assistance) Act 1986 because of changes regarding general purpose payments to the States which were proposed at the recent Premiers' Conference. </PARA>
<PARA> Under that Act, general purpose financial assistance for Local Government, for 1989-90 and subsequent years, was to be determined by changing the amount with respect to the previous year, by the percentage change to Commonwealth general purpose payments to the States. </PARA>
<PARA> For this purpose, general purpose payments to the States are defined by the Act, under section 6 (5) (A), to include financial assistance grants, identified health grants and general purpose capital assistance payments. </PARA>
<PARA> It is proposed that part of the capital assistance to the States and the Northern Territory be transferred to the Commonwealth/State housing agreement.</PARA>
<PARA> So that Local Government is not unintentionally disadvantaged by this change, the Government has decided to include in the Act an amount in lieu of the existing formula. </PARA>
<PARA> The amount of $671 million presents a 2.8% increase over Local Government's entitlement in 1989-90 of $652.5 million. It is a greater increase than would have occurred had the present formula not been amended. Had this not occurred payments to Local Government would have been $18.8 million less than the proposed payment. </PARA>
<PARA> The payment will also be some $5 million more than if Local Government funding had been aligned to the increase which the States are to receive. </PARA>
<PARA> As a result, the increase in payments is 2.8% which is more than the increase in comparable payments to the States and the Northern Territory. </PARA>
<PARA> Consistent with the treatment of the States, the base amount of funds for Local Government will also be adjusted for any differences between the current forecast of the consumer price index and the actual inflation rate. </PARA>
<PARA> The changes to the Act are consistent with an earlier undertaking of the Government to treat Local Government no less favourably than the States in respect of general purpose financial assistance. </PARA>
<PARA> Given the Government's continuing need to restrain its own expenditure this Bill provides a good outcome for Local Government. </PARA>
<PARA> When taken with the Government's decision in April to permit Local Government to levy rates and charges on Telecom and Australia Post properties it means that in 1989-90 Local Government is estimated to be some $47 million better off. </PARA>
<PARA> I commend the Bill to the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA> That this Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>I seek leave to have the second reading speech incorporated in Hansard. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The speech read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA> Today I bring before the Senate new legislation to establish the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission. This legislation, the principles of which were first outlined by the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs seventeen months ago, has undergone the most extensive process of consultation and examination of any piece of legislation in recent times. It fulfils the commitments first given by the Minister on 10 December 1987 and reaffirmed, by the Prime Minister and the Minister, in statements to the Parliament on 11 April this year. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government will proceed with ATSIC, which provides for an overdue and radical restructuring of the Aboriginal Affairs portfolio. We will proceed with ATSIC because of the urgent need for change, because of the urgent need to streamline the current administration and, above all, because of the urgent need to give Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people a real say in the decision-making process. </PARA>
<PARA> There are three Bills-the ATSIC Bill which I have just presented, the Australian Institute of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Studies Bill, and a Bill to amend the Aboriginal Development Commission Act 1980. </PARA>
<PARA> The first two of these replace the Bill which was passed by the House of Representatives last year but which the Senate set aside for report by a Select Committee. The changes to the proposals put to the Parliament in that Bill do not affect the essential features of ATSIC. The Government decided, however, that it would be more convenient to the Parliament and to the public generally, and in particular to the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander community, to present new Bills which can stand on their own rather than to amend the 1988 Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> The third Bill amends the Aboriginal Development Commission Act in ways to make the operations of that Commission-the ADC-consistent with the way in which ATSIC will operate. Although the ADC will cease to exist when ATSIC comes into existence the Government considers it desirable to make these changes to address the problems that recent enquiries by the Auditor-General and the Department of Finance have brought to public attention. </PARA>
<PARA> The new ATSIC Bill is further evidence of the Government's willingness to consult on our original proposal. We have listened to the views and suggestions of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people and have made the relevant changes. We have accepted the overwhelming majority of recommendations made by the Senate Select Committee on the Administration of Aboriginal Affairs and included them in this new Bill. And we have taken on board the comments of the Auditor-General and the Department of Finance and have acted on the very important questions of accountability. </PARA>
<PARA> We now have a Bill which has had extensive input from a range of people. It is a piece of legislation which will give effect to Aboriginal and Islander self-management and it will do this through a structure which will be effective and accountable. </PARA>
<PARA> I will now highlight the main features of the ATSIC proposal, as contained in the original Bill of August last year, and then outline the main changes. </PARA>
<PARA> The 1988 Bill provided for-</PARA>
<PARA>the Commission to replace the Department of Aboriginal Affairs (DAA) and the Aboriginal Development Commission (ADC);</PARA>
<PARA>a system of 60 Regional Councils, elected by Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander residents, which would determine priorities, develop regional plans, and generally represent the interests of the Regions;</PARA>
<PARA>a Commission of 15, of whom 12 would be elected by Regional Councillors grouped in Zones for this purpose;</PARA>
<PARA>programs administered by Commission staff in line with regional priorities, with funding direct to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander organisations and individuals;</PARA>
<PARA>Aboriginal Hostels Limited (AHL) and a renamed Institute of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Studies to retain their independent existence, but with 3 Commissioners on their governing bodies;</PARA>
<PARA>staff to come under the Public Service Act;</PARA>
<PARA>ministerial powers balancing the requirements of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander self-management with those of accountability to the Parliament;</PARA>
<PARA>a new body, the Aboriginal Economic Development Corporation (AEDC) providing finance and services, on an independent commercial basis, for major Aboriginal enterprises. </PARA>
<PARA> Thus ATSIC is to combine, in the one organisation, the means for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people to have a real say in the management of their own affairs with an administrative structure that eliminates existing overlaps, is more responsive to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander wishes, and attains appropriate standards of accountability for public funds. </PARA>
<PARA>Main changes arising from recent inquiries</PARA>
<PARA> The Minister's statement of 11 April this year, and the Government's response to the recommendations of the Senate Select Committee, contain the main elements of the proposed amendments to the legislation before the Senate today. </PARA>
<PARA> The first group of these changes deals with issues relating to accountability. We have sought to balance the objective that Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people should have greater control over matters affecting them, with the principle of Ministerial accountability for the correct and efficient use of public funds. </PARA>
<PARA> The new Bill therefore-</PARA>
<PARA> establishes within ATSIC an Office of Evaluation and Audit, to undertake evaluations and internal audits on programs, projects and procedures, and to report at least quarterly to the Commission and the Minister. The Head of the Office will have senior rank, and will be appointed by the Minister;</PARA>
<PARA> requires ATSIC to observe financial directions determined by the Minister;</PARA>
<PARA> requires ATSIC to keep the Minister informed about specific projects that are encountering difficulties;</PARA>
<PARA> specifies that a corporate plan will be prepared, and the Minister will be consulted about it; and</PARA>
<PARA> clarifies the distinction between commercial and non-commercial activities-a problem which has bedevilled the ADC. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government's consideration of the recommendations of the Senate Select Committee has also produced a second set of changes, including-</PARA>
<PARA> an increase in the number of Zones, and hence of elected Commissioners, from 12 to 17. This will achieve a better population balance between Zones;</PARA>
<PARA> a sliding scale of numbers of Regional Councillors, commencing at 10 for Regions with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander populations of under 1,000 and rising progressively to 20 with populations of 10,000 or more;</PARA>
<PARA> a separate Bill, as mentioned at the beginning of this speech, for what is now to be called the Australian Institute of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Studies;</PARA>
<PARA> a strengthening of provisions in such areas as eligibility for elected or appointed office, pecuniary interests, requiring full written assessments before substantial expenditures are approved, acting appointments, and employment of consultants. </PARA>
<PARA>Voting system</PARA>
<PARA> One matter which had not been settled at the time of the Minister's statement to the Parliament last month was the system of voting for Regional Councils. It was made clear then that the Government would prefer to have a system which did not involve the establishment of a separate roll based on race, and that it would explore certain possibilities with the Australian Electoral Commission. I now inform the Senate that it is proposed that the electoral system will have the following features:</PARA>
<PARA> 1. Voters fill out a `voter card' which is printed on an envelope-the voter will certify that he or she is an Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander person, and will establish their entitlement to vote by reference to the Federal Electoral roll. </PARA>
<PARA> 2. Each polling booth will have at least one Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander Liaison Officer. If the Liaison Officer is of the view that a person is not eligible to vote, he or she must note that fact on the voter-card envelope. </PARA>
<PARA> 3. Those people whose eligibility to vote has been challenged will have seven days to satisfy the Senior Liaison Officer for the Region of their entitlement to vote. If they do so their votes will be included in the count. Those people whose votes are not counted will be able to petition the Court of Disputed Elections. </PARA>
<PARA> 4. Completed ballot papers are sealed inside the voter's `voter card' envelope, and are only opened if the vote is not rejected, and once the count begins. </PARA>
<PARA> 5. Postal votes close off 6 days after the poll. Postal votes will be witnessed by a person on the electoral roll in the normal way. The sealed `voter card' envelope will be endorsed by a second person who is either an Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander person who is an office-bearer of an Aboriginal Corporation active in the region, or a member of the staff of ATSIC. The endorsement will certify that the person voting is in fact an Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander. A false certification of Aboriginality will be an offence under the electoral rules. </PARA>
<PARA> 6. The Australian Electoral Commission will satisfy itself that all voters are enrolled at an address which is in the relevant region or otherwise entitled to vote. </PARA>
<PARA> 7. The vote of any person not on the Federal Electoral Roll at an address within the relevant region or otherwise entitled to vote will be rejected. </PARA>
<PARA> 8. The Commission will prepare for each region a statement showing the particulars of all cases where voter cards have been set aside on the grounds that the voter was not an Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander person. The statement will be available for inspection by interested parties. </PARA>
<PARA> This system will ensure that Aboriginality or Torres Strait Islander status is open to challenge and determination on an open and fair basis, and will avoid the negative factors associated with the establishment and maintenance of a special public roll for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. </PARA>
<PARA> The system outlined will be part of the election rules to be gazetted under Part 3 of the Bill, and could be disallowed by the Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA>The Preamble</PARA>
<PARA> The Senate will recall that the statement of 11 April explained why the Government was not accepting the recommendations of the Senate Select Committee in relation to the Preamble to the Bill, and for the transfer of certain functions of the ADC to the proposed Aboriginal Economic Development Corporation. </PARA>
<PARA> It is clear that concerns that have been expressed about the Preamble are not well based. The majority report of the Select Committee confirms this. Note, for example, paragraph 3.7 which states:</PARA>
<PARA> ``a preamble is of no legal force by itself. It is generally treated by the courts as an aid to ascertaining the intent of the Parliament in making a particular piece of legislation.''</PARA>
<PARA> And later, in paragraph 3.16, they say:</PARA>
<PARA> ``some may be misled into thinking the Preamble has some force in law which it does not.''</PARA>
<PARA> In paragraph 3.9 the Committee notes that the Preamble does not relate to the content of the Bill, and expresses the belief in paragraph 3.12 that the legal position of a preamble as set out in the Acts Interpretation Act, combined with my second reading speech, would tend to ensure the legal neutrality of the Preamble. </PARA>
<PARA> Such views support the Commonwealth's carefully considered position. </PARA>
<PARA> May I remind the Senate of what the Minister said about the Preamble in the second reading speech to the 1988 Bill. I shall repeat it all, because of its importance in interpreting the Government's intentions. First person references are, of course, to the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs in another place. </PARA>
<PARA> ``In my Statement of 10 December (that is, of 1987) I indicated that it would be fitting, particularly in this our Bicentennial year, for the legislation establishing the Commission to contain a declaration, in the form of a substantial Preamble, which sets down the Australian people's commitment to the recognition and protection of the rights of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people and to measures to overcome their disadvantage. </PARA>
<PARA> In addition, I made it clear that the Preamble would contain a significant and historic recognition by the Commonwealth Parliament that Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people of Australia were the prior occupiers and original owners of this land. Since making that statement, much has been said and written about the proposal to have the Commonwealth formally recognise what the vast majority of Australians have been prepared to acknowledge for some time as historical fact. </PARA>
<PARA> There has been considerable discussion amongst Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander groups, and between them and the Government, about the wording of the Preamble. In particular, I wish to inform the House of consultations which have taken place on recital three of the Preamble and the role of these consultations in the formulation of recital three. </PARA>
<PARA> During the consultations some Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander groups expressed concern about the Government's original formulation of recital three. They feared it could lead to certain Aboriginal and Islander groups being disadvantaged in current litigation. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government's intention has, by contrast, always been that the language of the Preamble would be neutral and have no legal consequences for present or future litigation in relation to land claims. The language was, and is, in no way intended to recognise land rights claimed to exist, to create new rights for land or compensation or to remove or qualify rights under existing law. Nor was it, or is it, intended to restrict any future developments in the law. Accordingly, the Government was prepared to agree to amend the original language of recital three to meet the perception by some groups of a possible negative impact upon current litigation. </PARA>
<PARA> I emphasise the neutrality of recital three conscious of the fact that courts can, in certain circumstances, have regard to Second Reading Speeches and other extrinsic material to assist in ascertaining the Parliament's intention with regard to relevant legislation. Recital three, as now written, is intended simply to record the historical fact that up to the present time the Australian courts have not recognised Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander property rights in land except in relation to title granted by Federal, State and Territory Governments. </PARA>
<PARA> When endorsed by the Parliament in the name of the Australian people, the Preamble will stand as an historical expression of philosophy and principle. The intention that the Preamble has no legal consequences in no way detracts from its importance as a statement of those facts. I am happy to state that the Preamble has the support not only of the vast majority of the indigenous groups of this nation but also will, I am confident, enjoy the support of the wider community throughout Australia.''</PARA>
<PARA> This Parliament has already passed a resolution affirming its commitment to Australia's indigenous peoples. It should therefore not shrink from recognising, in a symbolically significant way through this Preamble, the facts of history, and of the Australian people's commitment to the recognition and protection of the rights of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people and to measures to overcome their disadvantage. </PARA>
<PARA>The Development Corporation</PARA>
<PARA> The Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commercial Development Corporation-which was previously named the Aboriginal Economic Development Corporation-is intended to operate on a totally commercial basis. To transfer to it functions of the ADC, containing as they frequently do concessional elements such as grants and lower-interest loans-would jeopardise the commercial standing of the Corporation in the market-place. </PARA>
<PARA> In addition, such a transfer would be at odds with a prime purpose of ATSIC-to achieve better co-ordination of portfolio programs and administrative efficiencies. </PARA>
<PARA>Implementing ATSIC</PARA>
<PARA> As foreshadowed in the 11 April statement, the Government's preferred position is that the legislation be passed by the Parliament in the current Sittings, and that ATSIC commence, on an interim basis under 5 appointed Commissioners, on 1 October 1989. </PARA>
<PARA> I should remind the Senate that the 1988 Bill allowed for the possibility, in clause 221-replicated as clause 203 in this Bill-that ATSIC might need to operate on an interim basis with appointed Commissioners only. </PARA>
<PARA> The interim Commission arrangement will allow the administrative machinery time to shake down and to prepare for the vital tasks for servicing Regional Councils and the full Commission. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government also recognises that Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people need time to understand the changes that are being made and, more broadly to get to know more about ATSIC and how it will work. They need this information before being asked to make the important decisions of electing their Regional Councillors and then those Regional Councillors electing Commissioners. </PARA>
<PARA> Following passage of this Bill the Government will provide adequate resources to assist in these processes. </PARA>
<PARA> It has always been envisaged that only 3 Commissioners would be Ministerial appointments. For an interim Commission, however, this would result in unacceptable heavy burdens for Commissioners; accordingly, for the interim period only (which cannot exceed 12 months), the number will be increased to 5. It is the Government's intention, however, that the Regional Council elections be held as soon as possible after October 1. </PARA>
<PARA>Detailed Provisions</PARA>
<PARA> I turn now to the main elements of the Bill itself, focusing particularly on those elements that are changed from the 1988 Bill. Details are, of course, included in the Explanatory Memorandum. </PARA>
<PARA> I have already referred to the Preamble, and the Government's firm resolve that it should remain in the Bill. The text of the Preamble, I should say, is unchanged. </PARA>
<PARA> Clause 2 provides for the Bill to commence on proclamation or, failing that, at 6 months from the date of Royal Assent. </PARA>
<PARA> The objects of the Act in Clause 3 have been expanded, consistent with the recommendations of the Senate Select Committee, to include reference to past dispossession and dispersal of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples. These words, I remind the Senate, are taken from the similar section of the Aboriginal Development Commission Act 1980. </PARA>
<PARA> A number of clauses relate to questions of accountability and administrative priorities. Clause 11 requires the Commission to prepare a corporate plan and to consult the Minister about it. Clauses 14, 17, 18 and 19, dealing with the Commission's powers in relation to grants of interest in property, enterprise loans and grants, grants for specific purposes, and guarantees, have been substantially tightened, and clause 20 requires repayments where conditions of grants or loans have not been met. </PARA>
<PARA> Clause 27 provides for the establishment of the interim Commission of 5 members, while clause 57 deals with the estimates of ATSIC during the life of the interim Commission. </PARA>
<PARA> Clause 73 requires the Minister to give ATSIC written directions about financial administration. </PARA>
<PARA> Clauses 74 to 77 establish the Office of Evaluation and Audit; in clause 70, the Commission is required to include in its Annual Report a report by the Director of the Office. </PARA>
<PARA> Part 3 of the Bill establishes the system of 60 Regional Councils, comprising elected representatives of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people living in those regions. Functions of the Councils include formulation of regional plans; proposals for ATSIC expenditure in the region, including the preparation of regional budgets; and to generally advise on the views, and interests, of the residents of their region. This Part also deals with regional Council elections, though as noted earlier in my speech the detailed provisions will be contained in electoral rules to be made under clause 110. As I mentioned earlier, the numbers of Regional Councillors will vary, as recommended by the Senate Select Committee, between 10 and 20 according to population; this is covered by the definition of ``prescribed number'' in clause 4 of the Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> There are to be special provisions for the Torres Strait Regional Council, and these are enabled by clause 113. The Minister has reached agreement with the Islander Co-ordinating Council for a Regional Council of 20 members, to comprise the Chairpersons of the 17 Island Councils established under the Queensland Community Services (Torres Strait) Act 1984, a representative of the Tamwoy community, plus representatives of two other communities in the region who do not have Council status under that Act. </PARA>
<PARA> Part 3 also establishes Zones for the purpose of elections of Commissioners. As I have mentioned, the number of Zones is to be increased from 12 to 17. The new Zone structure is set out in Schedule 1 to the Bill. The additional Zones will be-</PARA>
<PARA> one each for the Sydney, Brisbane and Perth regions;</PARA>
<PARA> one for the Darwin, Tiwi Islands and Daly River regions in the Northern Territory; and</PARA>
<PARA> one for the existing Aurukun and Doomadgee regions in Queensland, combined with two new regions-Yarrabah/Palm Island, and Woorabinda/Cherbourg. </PARA>
<PARA> Clause 137 and Schedule 4 provide for disputed elections. Such disputes will now be taken before a Court of Disputed Elections; the previous Bill provided for a system involving application to the Minister for an inquiry, which if agreed to would have been considered by a suitably qualified person. </PARA>
<PARA> Part 4 of the Bill establishes the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commercial Development Corporation (`the Corporation') which would have Commission representation on its Board of Directors. The Corporation would concentrate wholly on commercial activities, and thus provide a focus for the commercial and economic development of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people through the accumulation and utilisation of a substantial capital asset for those people. </PARA>
<PARA> Apart from the change of title to the proposed Corporation, the main changes in this Part relate to strengthened administration and accountability. </PARA>
<PARA> Parts 5 and 6 deal with a range of miscellaneous, consequential and transitional provisions. Included in Part 5 is the provision, in clause 199 that the staff of Aboriginal Hostels Limited will come under the Public Service Act. Apart from this change, and the intention that 3 members of the Company's Board be drawn from the numbers of ATSIC Commissioners, the operations of Aboriginal Hostels Limited will not be affected. </PARA>
<PARA>Conclusion</PARA>
<PARA> For the last sixteen months the Government has been consulting with interested groups about this legislation. We have extensively examined our original proposal as well as the first ATSIC Bill introduced into this place last year. We have listened to people's concerns and we have followed their recommendations. We have been extremely flexible on this piece of legislation because we wanted to get it right. We wanted to ensure that the new structure we put in place was an improvement on the current arrangements. We wanted to ensure above all else that any new administrative body would work to the benefit of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government believes that this Bill will achieve all of these aims. </PARA>
<PARA> There have been some people who have criticised the proposal to involve Aboriginal and Islander people in the decision making process. The main argument used against ATSIC by these people-and in the main they are our political opponents-is that the new Commission will ``divide'' Australia. They tend to justify this by alleging the Government is setting up a separate ``Black Parliament''. </PARA>
<PARA> ATSIC is not a parliament. It has no powers to make laws. Its own power is derived from legislation and it is accountable to the Minister and to this Parliament. The Opposition knows this. They use the term only to distort the debate and to attempt to do exactly what they accuse us of doing-divide Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> There has been no critical analysis of ATSIC by the Opposition. They have never offered anything constructive, nor have they come up with any viable alternative. Their only contribution has been to say that the existing system is fine and doesn't need changing. </PARA>
<PARA> The debate on this legislation provides an opportunity for the Opposition to make some contribution on the future directions for Aboriginal Affairs. The Opposition's response should be closely examined by all of us to see if they really are interested in the improvement of delivery of service and in Aboriginal and Islander self-management. </PARA>
<PARA> In summary I want to stress again what was said in introducing the 1988 Bill.</PARA>
<PARA> The establishment of ATSIC will lead to a very significant change in Aboriginal Affairs and in the way the portfolio will be administered in the future. It is important, however, that this change not be looked at in isolation, but as part of a series of changes aimed at bringing about long overdue reforms. These reforms can and should only occur with the proper participation and involvement of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. The implementation of reform in Aboriginal Affairs depends largely on how Governments, the bureaucracy, the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities and the broader community tackle the challenges that now confront them. </PARA>
<PARA> At a Government level it is important to maintain the political will to follow through the changes. The challenge for the bureaucracy is to adapt positively to changes in their roles in a responsive and constructive way. It is equally important that the broader community builds on the understanding and support that currently exists in society to bring about far reaching reform. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, in order to realise the philosophy of self-determination and self-management-demands Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people have been talking about since well before the 1967 Referendum-it is crucial that Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people take up the challenge and provide the direction for all of us. </PARA>
<PARA> I present the Explanatory Memorandum, and I have great pleasure in commending the Bill to the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA>AUSTRALIAN INSTITUTE OF ABORIGINAL AND TORRES STRAIT ISLANDER STUDIES BILL 1989</PARA>
<PARA> As a consequence of a recommendation of the Senate Select Committee into the Administration of Aboriginal Affairs, the Government has agreed to introduce this Bill as separate legislation, rather than as a component part of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission Bill 1989. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill establishes a new body to replace the Australian Institute of Aboriginal Studies (AIAS) established by an Act of this Parliament in 1964. </PARA>
<PARA> In large measure, the legislation enables the new Institute to operate very much as the AIAS currently operates, but with a new emphasis on the participation of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander persons with an interest and involvement in Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander studies. </PARA>
<PARA> In essence, the Institute's functions are to undertake and promote Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander studies, to encourage and train research workers, particularly Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander researchers, and to undertake research in its own right. The Institute also has a role in encouraging greater understanding in the general community of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander societies. </PARA>
<PARA> Membership of the new Institute will be made up of those persons who are now either full, associate, or corresponding members of the AIAS, plus such other persons appointed by the Council to be members. </PARA>
<PARA> The Council of the new Institute will consist of four persons elected by the members of the Institute, one person who is a Torres Strait Islander appointed by the Minister, and four other Aboriginal persons or Torres Strait Islanders appointed by the Minister, of whom at least three will be members of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission. </PARA>
<PARA> As a consequence, the Council will henceforth comprise a majority of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander members. As at present, the Council will determine the policy of the Institute with respect to all matters. </PARA>
<PARA> There will be a Research Advisory Committee with a majority elected by the membership of the Institute. The functions of the Committee will be to advise the Council in relation to research matters, applications for research grants, and applications for Institute membership. </PARA>
<PARA> The staff of the new Institute will be engaged under the Public Service Act 1922. Provision will be made for the Institute to engage research fellows as consultants to undertake research as at present. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government, in formulating this Bill, consulted with representatives of the Council, and has attempted to meet the various concerns articulated where consistent with its overall objectives. For example, in response to concerns regarding the status of information held by the Institute, the legislation now provides that the Institute, in providing advice to the Commission or the Minister, is not required to disclose information which is either held sacred by Aboriginal persons or Torres Strait Islanders or which infringes the privacy of particular persons. </PARA>
<PARA> It is the Government's firm intention that the provisions of the Bill maintain the scholastic excellence and independent research capability which is very much a part of the operation and history of the AIAS. The Government is confident that the new Institute will remain an internationally recognised focus for study and research related to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander societies. </PARA>
<PARA> I commend the Bill to the Senate, and present the Explanatory Memorandum. </PARA>
<PARA>ABORIGINAL DEVELOPMENT COMMISSION AMENDMENT BILL 1989</PARA>
<PARA> This Bill was foreshadowed by the Prime Minister in his Statement on 11 April, when in referring to the recommendations of the various inquiries, he stated:</PARA>
<PARA> ``We have, moreover, considered to what extent the thrust of those recommendations should apply to the ADC while it continues to function in the lead up to ATSIC.''</PARA>
<PARA> The main elements of this Bill which I will outline will ensure that the ADC, during its remaining life, operates in a similar basis to ATSIC and in a manner that properly reflects Government priorities. </PARA>
<PARA> The functions of the Commission will be amended to enable the Commission, upon request, to provide information or advice to the Minister, including information regarding the Commission's expenditure. This will clarify the Minister's right to request information from the Commission. </PARA>
<PARA> The business enterprise provisions in section 24 of the Principal Act will be modified to take into account the concerns identified by the Auditor-General in his recent report. In particular, the Commission will be required to satisfy itself that the enterprise is likely to become or continue to be commercially successful. This criterion replaces the previous criterion which merely referred to the capability of the Aboriginal persons involved to engage in the enterprise. The capability criterion is inadequate, because it leaves open the possibility that an enterprise may be funded notwithstanding that it has no prospects of commercial viability. In the Government's view, the `commercial viability' criterion is much more appropriate, focussing as it does on outputs rather than inputs; in effect, it encompasses the capability criterion without the paternalistic undertones. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill also provides for a number of changes to the financial provisions of the Principal Act. The Minister will be given the power to approve the Commission's estimates of expenditure and to issue financial administration guidelines and directions. This will ensure that appropriate ministerial oversight can occur, and that the Commission operates within the parameters of Government policy. The Bill also extends the potential role of the Auditor-General to the audit of subsidiary companies controlled by the Commission. Section 24 (4) of the Principal Act already provides for the recovery of business enterprise loans and grants where the terms and conditions of funding are breached; this provision is to be extended to cover all grants/loans of the Commission. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, a number of changes are proposed to staffing arrangements. The Commission currently determines terms and conditions of employment in consultation with the Public Service Commission under section 33. In fact, the approved terms and conditions are almost identical to Public Service Act terms and conditions. The Amendment Bill will formalise this by providing that all ADC staff be engaged under the Public Service Act 1922. Staff currently employed will be transferred into the Public Service under s 81b of the Public Service Act 1922. </PARA>
<PARA> The Amendment Bill will also provide for the appointment by the Minister, after consultation with the Commission, of a General Manager with responsibility for managing the day to day administration of the Commission. The ancillary provisions relating to appointment, remuneration, leave of absence etc. are consistent with the analogous provisions proposed for the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission. </PARA>
<PARA> In conclusion, let me state once again that this Bill is directed toward remedying the administrative defects in the legislation which established the Aboriginal Development Commission, while maintaining an appropriate balance between accountability and Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander self-management and self-determination. </PARA>
<PARA> I commend the Bill to the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the Manager of Government Business in the Senate (Senator Robert Ray) for moving the motion in that amended form. I acknowledge that the Opposition agreed that we should, in the normal way, forgo consideration of general business from this week, although we said that that was subject to the completion of two private members' Bills which came up in general business yesterday. The first was Senator Watson's Bill, which yesterday completed its passage through the Senate. The other Bill was Senator Walters's private member's Bill relating to videos. We had hoped to see that completed yesterday. I wish to make it public that the arrangement with the Government is that we will seek to deal with only so much general business next week as is required to complete the passage of that Bill. I undertake to discuss with the Opposition senators who are concerned with that Bill the steps that should be taken to ensure speedy passage in dealing with the remaining amendments, and to discuss that with the Government, the Australian Democrats and Senator Harradine who, of course, has a vital interest. The Opposition believes that it would be desirable to see the consideration of that Bill completed during the current session. It has been around for a long time.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I disagree with the whole of paragraph 3 (c). There is precious little time available to members of this Senate to discuss business and thereby truly and effectively exercise their representative functions. I admit that there is plenty of opportunity for senators to debate matters of public importance, urgency motions and amendments to Government Bills, but matters of public importance and urgency motions tend to beat the air. They are not dramatically effective. They offer an important opportunity for senators to air the views of the persons whom they represent in this chamber but, as far as being legislatively effective, there are only two real means available to senators to exercise that vital representative function. They are by way of amendments to government initiated legislation at the committee stage or through the initiation of legislation by an individual senator.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator Walters's Bill is a prime example. As far as the sessional orders are concerned, we have effectively only 1 1/2 hours in this chamber to deal with legislation which has been initiated by a senator other than a Government senator, or it might even be a Government senator. We have Buckley's chance of being able effectively to initiate legislative procedures. How many Bills do honourable senators on my right have on the Notice Paper? I have not counted them but there must be dozens. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think what I have said has touched a chord amongst a number of honourable senators. I honestly feel that it is a farce that the standing and sessional orders enable us to discuss General Business for only that time once a week. The Government is now seeking to knock that off for the last two sitting Thursdays. I entirely disagree with that proposition. I hope that the Procedures Committee will take what I am saying on board. The only other alternative in attempting to exercise some legislative initiative in this chamber would be to tack amendments on to Government legislation. That is a second best option. I think everybody would agree that that would be necessary only if this situation continued whereby we have only 1 1/2 hours in which to effect some legislative initiative.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;in reply-I guess one would not dispute with Senator Harradine the desirability of giving rights to individual senators to pursue private legislation. As Manager of Government Business, I say that maybe that should not be at the expense of a very limited amount of time for Government Business. I do not think we can argue that Government Business gets a high percentage of time in this place, either, by the time we take into account papers and the ongoing tendency to move disallowance motions or discuss notices of motion the day after they are given through the suspension of standing orders. These days one does not even have to move for the suspension of standing orders. The threat is good enough to have the matter brought on. I think Government Business should take precedence in the next three weeks. It does not deflect from any of Senator Harradine's points about the rights of senators. There are many private business matters on the Notice Paper. It would be very nice to be able to go through them. If I took a poll to see who wanted to come back for three weeks in the middle of July to do so, I doubt that I would get his vote.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA>Who is the member of the Rothwells Board who received a character reference from the West Australian Government at the time that the settlement with the NCSC was being negotiated in October 1987?</PARA>
<PARA> Response: The NCSC advises that it was Mr W. A. Burgess who had been a director of Rothwells since 1982. </PARA>
<PARA>Who signed this character reference on behalf of the WA Government?</PARA>
<PARA> Response: The NCSC advises that it was signed by Mr Brian Burke MLA</PARA>
<PARA>Has the NCSC investigated why Dalleagles purchased the portfolio of non-performing loans from Rothwells? If so, what conclusion has been reached?</PARA>
<PARA> Response: The NCSC informs me that it had investigated the matter and that its conclusion was that it was a means whereby Mr Connell would eliminate $350m of his ``non performing'' debts to Rothwells. </PARA>
<PARA>What conditions of the settlement between the NCSC and Rothwells were broken by Rothwells?</PARA>
<PARA> Response: The NCSC advises that the following conditions of the settlement were broken by Rothwells:</PARA>
<PARA> 1. Rothwells was to establish a Policy Committee to review the company's activities and determine policy. It was to meet on a regular basis. The new Board of Directors failed to ensure that it met on a regular basis. In fact it met only twice. </PARA>
<PARA> 2. Rothwells agreed that the new management team would review outstanding loans and the security covering those loans and the likelihood of recovery. It was to inform the NCSC of its conclusions by 28 February 1988. The review and report presented by way of audited accounts as at 31 January 1988, was false and misleading. </PARA>
<PARA> 3. Mr L. Connell was to commit ``$70 million of his own money to support the company''. In fact by means of a round robin, Rothwells itself later advanced much of this sum to Mr Connell. </PARA>
<PARA> 4. Rothwells was to implement a new ``Management Restructure and Business Plan'' which set out ``the principal decisions taken that will govern the future of Rothwells''. These included statements that:</PARA>
<PARA> (i) ``Rothwells will establish and maintain a match between the maturity of borrowings and assets''. In fact most of the bills and loans were `non-performing' so that the company was not receiving interest or loan repayments in accordance with the repayment schedule. Many of the loans and bills were continually rolled over with interest added so that cash inflows were well below expected levels. </PARA>
<PARA> (ii) ``Rothwells will seek investments in hard assets and cash flow''. However a substantial sum of the $370 million injected into Rothwells from the October 1987 rescue package was soon diverted to fund part of the Connell's subordinated loan. </PARA>
<PARA> (iii) ``. . . Rothwells will be very conservatively geared''. This statement was made in relation to a summarised balance sheet which showed shareholders funds of approximately $287 million and total assets of approximately $763 million. This information was misleading. Further misleading information was given in the audited accounts for the period ended 31 January 1988. For example the provision for `doubtful debts' was stated as $100 million, however the Dalleagles Portfolio of $350 million was in fact described by the company in July 1988 as `non-performing'. </PARA>
<PARA> My question ``How were the non-performing loans with a face value of $350m selected'' was answered ``Unable to say''. However the Interim report states (paragraph 8.01): ``The selected loans were later seen by the commission to be those most closely associated with Connell.''</PARA>
<PARA> I ask:</PARA>
<PARA> (i) In what way were these loans associated with Connell?</PARA>
<PARA> (ii) What proportion of the loans were owing by:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) L. R. Connell and Partners</PARA>
<PARA> (b) Oakhill Pty Ltd</PARA>
<PARA> (c) associated companies?</PARA>
<PARA> Response: The NCSC advises:</PARA>
<PARA> (i) cross guarantees and inter company loans involving Mr Connell. </PARA>
<PARA> (ii) Inter relationships between Mr Connell and his companies on the one hand and Mr Connell's associates, including the ``Pier Street'' group of companies, on the other hand were extremely complex and varied over time. This is the subject of further investigations by the Special Investigator. Of the $350m, $69.2m appears to have been loans to Oakhill Pty Ltd, $1511.7m to the ``Pier Street'' Group of companies, $56.2m to companies associated with Mr Brian Yuill. </PARA>
<PARA> The following answers have been provided by the National Companies and Securities Commission to written questions by Senator Durack:</PARA>
<PARA>When did the NCSC first decide to investigate Rothwells?</PARA>
<PARA> Response: On 17 March 1987 the NCSC commenced an investigation into Vital Technology Ltd. As it progressed, the investigation concentrated on particular conduct of the controllers of Rothwells Ltd. </PARA>
<PARA> What allegations/events led to this investigation?</PARA>
<PARA> Response: The NCSC received a written complaint about the affairs of Vital Technology Ltd. As the investigation proceeded the NCSC became suspicious that Rothwells and associated companies may have engaged in warehousing and ramping of shares in listed companies. </PARA>
<PARA> What stage had the investigation reached prior to the crash of the stock market in October 1987?</PARA>
<PARA> Response: Several months before the crash NCSC staff decided to concentrate the investigation on whether Rothwell's dealers licence should be revoked because they suspected, as a result of the investigation, that Rothwells was not operating efficiently, honestly or fairly. </PARA>
<PARA> Had the NCSC formed any opinion at that time whether Rothwells should be rescued or allowed to go into liquidation? If so what was its view?</PARA>
<PARA> Response: No. The NCSC investigation was not into the financial position of Rothwells; it was into Rothwells' conduct as a licensed dealer. The audited accounts and financial returns of Rothwells did not indicate that the company was in financial difficulties. </PARA>
<PARA> Why did the NCSC enter into the settlement with Rothwells at this time?</PARA>
<PARA> Response: The objectives of the NCSC had been fully achieved and comprehensive assurances obtained. On the information then known to it, the NCSC formed the view that nothing further could be achieved. Rothwells had agreed to surrender its dealers licence and had further agreed that:</PARA>
<PARA> (i) the Chairman, Mr L. R. Connell, would step down as Chairman and from any executive position on Rothwells and other Board changes required by the NCSC would be made;</PARA>
<PARA> (ii) the Managing Director, Mr P. Lucas would resign and the NCSC was informed that the Western Australian Government would make available a senior public servant to replace him;</PARA>
<PARA> (iii) a new ``Management Restructure and Business Plan'' would be undertaken. It appeared to the NCSC that the Plan addressed the problems which were being investigated by the NCSC;</PARA>
<PARA> (iv) an audited statement of Rothwells' financial position would be issued as soon as possible; and</PARA>
<PARA> (v) substantial shareholder notices would be lodged to ensure that there was full disclosure to the market of Rothwells shareholdings in listed companies. </PARA>
<PARA> After the December 1987 settlement the NCSC, in accordance with Co-operative Scheme practice, referred the material gathered in its investigations to the Western Australian Corporate Affairs Department to consider whether further investigation and/or prosecution of possible criminal offences was warranted. </PARA>
<PARA> Was any pressure/persuasion applied by any person, organisation or government in favour of this? If so by whom?</PARA>
<PARA> Response: No pressure was applied to or perceived by the NCSC staff who negotiated the settlement. There was a letter to the NCSC staff involved in the negotiations from the Western Australian Government providing a character reference for one member of the then Rothwells Board. As a consequence, the NCSC was persuaded to allow that member to remain on the Board. </PARA>
<PARA> Subsequent to the settlement, when did the NCSC again become concerned about Rothwells affairs?</PARA>
<PARA> Response: Following the announcement by Rothwells on 15 July 1988 that it proposed to sell a $350 million portfolio of loans to Dalleagles Pty Ltd, the NCSC commenced enquiries directed at Rothwells' financial position. </PARA>
<PARA> What were the major reasons for its concerns?</PARA>
<PARA> Response: The NCSC was concerned whether and how Dalleagles could finance the purchase of the portfolio of loans as Dalleagles was controlled by Mr Connell and Mr T. F. Hugall; why it was purchasing the portfolio; and whether the shareholders of Rothwells were properly informed in relation to the proposed transaction. </PARA>
<PARA> What conditions of the settlement were broken by Rothwells?</PARA>
<PARA> Response: The NCSC relied on the audited statement of Rothwells' financial position, which was made public as required by the terms of the settlement, and the resignation of Mr Lucas, and the Board of Management changes which were made in response to the NCSC's requirements. The NCSC had no evidence that the conditions of settlement had been broken until after Rothwells collapsed. However, investigations since the collapse indicate that the conditions of the settlement were honoured at best superficially by the new Rothwells Board. </PARA>
<PARA> When did Rothwells first show signs of being in difficulty?</PARA>
<PARA> Response: The NCSC first became aware on 15 July 1988 that Rothwells might be in financial difficulty. Until then the NCSC relied on the company's audited financial statements. </PARA>
<PARA> Did Rothwells take any steps to disguise these? If so, what steps did it take?</PARA>
<PARA> Response: Yes. The NCSC has identified in its interim report the complex steps taken by Rothwells to conceal its true financial position. </PARA>
<PARA> Why did Rothwells have so many non-performing loans?</PARA>
<PARA> Response:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) The controls exercised by management and the Board over the authorisation and servicing of the loans were seriously inadequate. </PARA>
<PARA> (b) the risk was exacerbated by poor or no security being taken over most of the loans. </PARA>
<PARA> Why were such loans `non-performing'?</PARA>
<PARA> Response: No detailed analysis of the loans has been undertaken by the NCSC. This is a matter for the provisional liquidator. </PARA>
<PARA> Were all the non-performing loans purchased by Connell from Rothwells in July 1988 for $350 million? If not, how were these loans selected?</PARA>
<PARA> Response:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) No. </PARA>
<PARA> (b) Unable to say. </PARA>
<PARA> What was the face value of these loans at the time of their purchase?</PARA>
<PARA> Response: $349,947,123.73. </PARA>
<PARA> What was the market value of these loans at the time?</PARA>
<PARA> Response: Difficult to say, but only a small fraction of the face value. Perhaps as little as 10 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> How often did Rothwell's Board of Directors meet?</PARA>
<PARA> Response: The evidence is conflicting but it appears that the Board seldom met. </PARA>
<PARA> What supervision did it maintain over the affairs of the Company?</PARA>
<PARA> Response: The Board of Rothwells appears to have played little part in the conduct of the affairs of the Company. </PARA>
<PARA> What was the relationship between Rothwells, LR Connell and Partners and Oakhill Pty Ltd?</PARA>
<PARA> Response: Rothwells, LR Connell and Partners and Oakhill Pty Ltd are business concerns in which Mr Connell has or had substantial interests. Their affairs were intertwined. </PARA>
<PARA> What were the prime causes of the final collapse of Rothwells?</PARA>
<PARA> Response: This question is addressed in the NCSC interim report. A special investigation is also under way. However, the most important single cause of the final collapse of Rothwells was a severe liquidity crisis as a result of the consistent failure of its loan portfolio to perform. </PARA>
<PARA> When did the NCSC extend its inquiry into a number of companies associated with Rothwells?</PARA>
<PARA> Response: The NCSC's inquiries in 1987 and 1988 addressed a number of companies associated with Rothwells. The number of the companies expanded substantially during 1988. </PARA>
<PARA> What was the nature of the association?</PARA>
<PARA> Response: The nature of the association varied. The primary association lay in Rothwells acting as financier to the associated companies. Otherwise, the associations emanated from common directorships between the companies funded by Rothwells, common location (such as at 19 Pier Street), or considerable influence in the conduct of their affairs being exercised by individuals associated with Rothwells. </PARA>
<PARA> How many such companies are involved in the inquiry?</PARA>
<PARA> Response: Approximately 100 companies, of which about 10 are listed companies, are involved, with the degree of involvement varying. </PARA>
<PARA> What is the nature of these inquiries and what stage has been reached in respect of them?</PARA>
<PARA> Response: Broadly, the purpose of the inquiries is to identify the reasons for the collapse of Rothwells, to identify breaches of the law and to obtain evidence for instigating civil and criminal proceedings where appropriate. </PARA>
<PARA> Did Beltech Corporation/Technology purchase Connell's half share in Petrochemical Industries Ltd (PICL) around July 31 1987?</PARA>
<PARA> Response: Some evidence indicates that Beltech Technology Pty Ltd acquired Mr Connell's 50 per cent interest in PICL prior to 31 July 1987. This is denied by Mr Connell. </PARA>
<PARA> What was the purpose of this transaction?</PARA>
<PARA> Response: The NCSC has received evidence that it was intended that the transaction be part of the process of reducing the level of debts owed by interests associated with Mr Connell prior to the 1987 Rothwells audit. </PARA>
<PARA> What was the purchase price and how was it funded by Beltech?</PARA>
<PARA> Response: It appears that the purchase price was $21.45 million and that it was entirely financed with funds from Rothwells. </PARA>
<PARA> What did Beltech do with this newly acquired asset?</PARA>
<PARA> Response: Nothing appears to have been done with this asset until in 1988 further transactions took place and the asset was returned to Connell interests. </PARA>
<PARA> What value was placed on the interest in PICL in Connell's books of account when it was `recovered' by Connell from Beltech?</PARA>
<PARA> Response: The only values of which the NCSC is presently aware are:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) September 1986: Mr Connell purchased half share in PICL from Mr Dallas Dempster for $105,000;</PARA>
<PARA> (b) July 1987: the sale to Beltech, which has been denied by Mr Connell, was at $21.45 million; and</PARA>
<PARA> (c) January 1988: LR Connell and Partners showed the half share in their balance sheet at $75 million. </PARA>
<PARA> What was the date of this valuation?</PARA>
<PARA> Response: See previous answer. </PARA>
<PARA> Has the NCSC discovered any evidence which would justify a valuation of $350 million for this interest. </PARA>
<PARA> Response: No. </PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="8G4">Senator DURACK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;When the Estimates Committee met there was grave uncertainty as to whether the report of the NCSC on its investigation of Rothwells Ltd would ever see the light of day in any shape or form. Apparently the Federal Government supported the view taken by the Ministerial Council that this report may have some serious consequences for possible prosecutions and the matter was referred to the special investigator for his opinion. There had been other opinions both for and against that proposition. I am not really quite sure where the Federal Government ended up on that matter but perhaps that is not important now.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> However, what was important was the fact that the findings of the national watchdog on such a major investigation, such a major financial collapse, should have been available for consideration by this or any other Parliament, particularly because of the very close involvement of the State Government with this company, both during its death throes and over a long period. The matter was of great public interest. That is why I felt that the NCSC should have been available to answer questions relating to a number of aspects of its investigation. </PARA>
<PARA> I put these questions on notice because it was uncertain whether this report would ever be made available. Before these answers were provided the NCSC's interim report was made public. Certainly that has put a different complexion on the urgency of the matter as I saw it at the time of the Estimates Committee. In fact, the interim report gives a very detailed and very frank account of its investigations of Rothwells' activities and of the major players in this whole sorry episode. So it is rather surprising that there was such a degree of coyness on the part of both State and Federal governments in having this information made available at an earlier stage than did occur. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not propose to say much about the very detailed information in the report; that has been the subject of a great deal of publicity and examination. But some of the answers provoked by the questions I asked have thrown a little clearer light on some of the major problems which are still outstanding. The answers to my supplementary questions were, in one or two respects, still a bit coy. I instance a question about a matter which was of great public concern at the time, so it was not an unfair question. At the time of the first rescue of Rothwells, after the crash in 1987, when the Western Australian Government became involved with its guarantee, there was widespread publicity and concern about this matter. I asked the following question:</PARA>
<PARA>Was any pressure/persuasion applied by any person, organisation or government in favour of this?</PARA>
<PARA>That is, the settlement entered into between the NCSC and Rothwells, which was backed up by the guarantee of the Western Australian Government. I then asked:</PARA>
<PARA>If so by whom?</PARA>
<PARA>The answer I got stated:</PARA>
<PARA>No pressure was applied to or perceived by the NCSC staff who negotiated the settlement. There was a letter to the NCSC staff involved in the negotiations from the Western Australian Government providing a character reference for one member of the then Rothwells Board. As a consequence, the NCSC was persuaded to allow that member to remain on the Board. </PARA>
<PARA>Of course, this was pretty important because one matter that was greatly worrying the NCSC was the composition of the Rothwells Board and the influence of certain persons in the conduct of Rothwells. Certainly, the NCSC in its settlement with Rothwells at that time was endeavouring to cope with that problem. I thought the answer was not as frank as I would have expected and was, as I said, somewhat coy. So my first supplementary question asked:</PARA>
<PARA>Who is the member of the Rothwells Board who received a character reference from the West Australian Government at the time that the settlement with the NCSC was being negotiated in October 1987?</PARA>
<PARA>The response to that question stated:</PARA>
<PARA>The NCSC advises that it was Mr W. A. Burgess who had been a director of Rothwells since 1982. </PARA>
<PARA>His connections with the whole affair are now set out in the report. Who signed this character reference on behalf of the Western Australian Government? The response was:</PARA>
<PARA>The NCSC advises that it was signed by Mr Brian Burke MLA. </PARA>
<PARA>That response is still a little coy because Mr Burke played the leading role, as the Premier of Western Australia, in having this settlement brought about. We have clear evidence of the very close and direct involvement of the then Premier of Western Australia, Mr Brian Burke, in the settlement on behalf of one of the directors of Rothwells. I think that answer does give some indication of the lack of full information provided to this Parliament-information which I would have expected to have been provided in the first place. </PARA>
<PARA> However, what I am really concerned about-and what is still a matter of great concern, particularly to Western Australia, although it should be of great concern to this Parliament as well-is the financial impact of a lot of those Western Australian Government decisions on the ability of the Western Australian Government to perform its ordinary obligations. I would have thought that this would be of interest to the Commonwealth Government because, in a sense, it has the ultimate responsibility for providing finance for all States so that they can carry out their obligations. The Western Australian Government made a commitment in about July last year, when the final collapse of Rothwells became imminent, to invest in the Petrochemical Industries Co. Ltd project in Kwinana in Western Australia. The leading player in the Rothwells collapse, Mr Laurie Connell, received $350m for his half share in the plant. As I said, an agreement was entered into in about the middle of last year. That amount of $350m which was made available to Mr Connell enabled him to pay an amount of money to Rothwells, the beneficiaries of which were largely, as we have now discovered, the Bond Corporation and the Western Australian Government itself. It would be remarkable if those events were not tied together. However, I am not claiming at this stage that there is any direct evidence that they were tied together. The question must obviously be posed: Were they tied together? Hopefully, that will be a matter for further investigation. </PARA>
<PARA> What has always intrigued me, and no doubt many other people, is how this valuation of $350m for a half share in the petrochemical plant was ever arrived at, especially as the other partner, Mr Dempster, received only $50m for his half share. So Mr Connell's half share was valued at seven times the value of the other half share-another very strange circumstance. I asked some questions on that matter. Again the answers I received were a little coy, even though the interim report had been received. The interim report went a long way towards providing answers, or at least pointing out how this figure of $350m was arrived at. However, some further extraordinary information was provided which I think is pretty much on the public record. I asked:</PARA>
<PARA>What value was placed on the interest in the Petrochemical Industries Company-</PARA>
<PARA>known as PICL-</PARA>
<PARA>when it was recovered by Connell from Beltech. </PARA>
<PARA>Those transactions took place prior to the purchase by the Western Australian Government. The answer I received was:</PARA>
<PARA>The values of which the NCSC is presently aware are: September 1986-Mr Connell purchased half share in PICL from Dempster for $105,000. </PARA>
<PARA>In July 1987 there was the sale to Beltech of this half share, which has been denied by Connell, but the books of accounts show a valuation of roughly $21.5m for that half share in July 1987, just a year before the Western Australian Government purchase. In January 1988 L. R. Connell and Partners showed the valuation of the half share in its balance sheet at $75m. That was only a few months before the purchase by the Western Australian Government of that half share for $350m. That certainly raises more questions as to how this $350m figure was ever arrived at. The Western Australian Government's case was that a valuation was obtained to that effect. However, the Western Australian Government has never been prepared to make that valuation public, so I think we should take it with a grain of salt. The question still remains: How was that valuation arrived at? Supplementary answers that I have received provide the clue. The NCSC provided me with some clue in the first answers I received.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I asked about the purchase from Rothwells of the non-performing loans by Dalleagles, which is a Rothwells company. This is the response from the NCSC:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>Following the announcement by Rothwells on 15 July that it proposed to sell a $350m portfolio of loans to Dalleagles Pty Ltd, the NCSC commenced inquiries directed at Rothwells' financial position. </PARA>
<PARA>I asked:</PARA>
<PARA>What were the major reasons for its concern?</PARA>
<PARA>The response was:</PARA>
<PARA>The NCSC was concerned whether and how Dalleagles could finance the purchase of the portfolio of loans as Dalleagles was controlled by Mr Connell and Mr Hugall, why it was purchasing the portfolio, whether the shareholders of Rothwells were properly informed in relation to the proposed transaction . . .</PARA>
<PARA>When this proposal was announced at the time, it attracted immediate attention from the NCSC for those reasons. In subsequent questions answers to which I have now received, the NCSC has thrown far more light on that matter. I asked:</PARA>
<PARA>Has the NCSC investigated why Dalleagles purchased the portfolio of non-performing loans from Rothwells? If so, what conclusion has been reached?</PARA>
<PARA>The NCSC has now replied as follows:</PARA>
<PARA>The NCSC investigated the matter. Its conclusion was that it was a means whereby Mr Connell would eliminate $350m of his non-performing debts to Rothwells. </PARA>
<PARA>It was not a matter of Mr Connell doing a great service to Rothwells and the public by buying $350m of its portfolio of non-performing debts. As the NCSC believes, it was a means whereby Connell would eliminate $350m of his non-performing debts to Rothwells. In my first list of questions I asked, `How were these non-performing loans with a face value of $350m selected?' The NCSC had already indicated that probably their market value was only about 10 per cent of this face value. We had $350m being paid for debts that probably were worth only one-tenth of that. Naturally, I was interested in how those loans were collected. Now we have the answer that I have just read out. The initial answer I got from the NCSC was that it was `unable to say', which rather surprised me because its interim report says that the selected loans were later seen by the Commission to be those most closely associated with Connell.</PARA>
<PARA> So I asked in my supplementary questions in what way were the loans associated with Connell and what proportion of the loans were owed by Connell and Partners, Oakhill Pty Ltd-the Connell company-or associated companies. The NCSC response was that the loans were cross guarantees and inter-company loans involving Mr Connell, and that interrelationships, between Mr Connell and his companies, on the other hand, and Mr Connell's associates, including the Pier Street group of companies, on the other hand were extremely complex and varied over time. This is the subject of further investigation by the special investigator. Of the $350m, $69m appears to be loans to Oakhill Pty Ltd, that is, the Connell company; $151m appears to be loans to the Pier Street group of companies, that is, the Hugall group with which Connell is very closely associated; and, $56m appears to be to loans to a company associated with Mr Brian Yuill, of even greater fame in view of his financial problems. </PARA>
<PARA> I am pleased to say that the matter is being investigated further. No doubt more will come out of it. What seems to be clear is the mystery of why $350m was the figure arrived at for the valuation of Mr Connell's share of the PICL project. From this evidence, that figure was arrived at because it was the face value of the non-performing debts of Mr Connell and his associates to Rothwells. </PARA>
<PARA> The Western Australian Government is participating in the purchase, at this totally fanciful valuation, of a half share of the PICL project. Western Australian and Australian taxpayers' funds are being used to enable Mr Connell and his associates to pay back their debts to Rothwells. That seems to be the inevitable conclusion from the information which is now on the public record. That is an assumption one would draw from the interim report of the NCSC. The answers which have been obtained as a result of my questions and which are now incorporated in Hansard make it perfectly clear that that solves the mystery of this $350m figure. </PARA>
<PARA> This raises matters of enormous significance for financial administration by governments in Australia. It shows that this sort of thing can occur. The wool was pulled over the eyes of people in Western Australia at the recent election. This is a matter which I would have thought was very important and which the Federal Government should take note of, be concerned about and take some action on. We are considering Appropriation Bills. It is clear from the constant answers we have received over the years from Senator Walsh as Minister for Finance that he takes the closest possible interest in the expenditure of money by the Queensland Government. That has been a constant theme of Senator Walsh in this chamber for years. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to ask Senator Walsh-as he has been asked from time to time-in light of the revelations of the NCSC report and the answers which have been received, and which I have been referring to, whether he is taking, and will he take, as the Minister for Finance, the same interest in the financial performance, activities and decisions of the Western Australian Government as he has taken-presumably in the national interest, because it is of national concern-in relation to the Queensland Government. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I agree with the Minister for Justice (Senator Tate) that the analysis we have just heard from Senator Durack-I congratulate him on it-highlights the enormous importance of the Rothwells Ltd affair and the associated aspects of what has now become infamously known as `W.A. Inc.'. We have pursued the matter in the Senate for a long time and I do not propose, in the context of this debate, to pursue it further, because Senator Durack has raised most of the points that I would have raised at this stage.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator Durack's contribution highlights the significance of the regulatory framework for companies and securities in Australia. It is that matter I wish to address. Following the Estimates committee hearings, the Joint Select Committee on Corporations Legislation was set up by the Senate late last year. It presented its report, which has been debated in this place, earlier this year. That Committee was established to look at the proposals by the Government to radically change the regulatory framework for companies and securities, to move away from the cooperative arrangements that had served Australia so well over nearly the last decade in the form of a linchpin organisation, the National Companies and Securities Commission, supplemented by State corporate affairs commissions, and a ministerial council whereby the Federal and State and Northern Territory governments had a say in the administration and direction of the regulatory arrangements in Australia. That is now being swept away by this Government with the abolition of the NCSC, the ministerial council and all the cooperative arrangements, and their substitution by the Australian Securities Commission (ASC). That is a matter that has been debated at length both by this chamber and by the Joint Select Committee on Corporations Legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> The Liberal and National parties were very strongly opposed to the Government's proposals to abolish the cooperative arrangements and substitute a new, bureaucratic, centralised framework based around an Australian Securities Commission. We have had the debate on that. Very regrettably, we, on this side of the chamber, did not get the support of the Democrats. Therefore, the legislation to establish the new arrangements has been passed by this Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> In the course of debates in the Estimates Committee, the Joint Select Committee on Corporations Legislation and this Senate, we raised time and again the importance of having adequate transitional arrangements from the existing situation to the new scheme proposed by the Government. In the debate on the corporations legislation package the Government said, in effect, as I understand it, that special transitional arrangements were neither envisaged nor necessary. That flew in the face of the very strong evidence that we received, as a Joint Select Committee, from a wide range of people in the business community and the companies and securities industry. </PARA>
<PARA> The report that the Joint Select Committee on Corporations Legislation brought into this Senate stated, in chapter 2:</PARA>
<PARA>The Committee was told that the transition from the Co-operative scheme to the new scheme would, in addition to being constitutionally uncertain, be difficult and of unknown cost. Uncertainty as to transitional provisions have been claimed to have already caused a great deal of uncertainty in State CAC's, leading to a loss of capable and professionally qualified officers, according to submissions by State CAC's. </PARA>
<PARA>The Law Council of Australia also stressed the need for adequate transitional provisions. The Joint Select Committee report quoted the following words from the Law Council's submission:</PARA>
<PARA>Transitional provisions are designed to safeguard existing legal rights and obligations. It is therefore essential that these provisions work effectively. Past experience has shown that, to achieve this, it is necessary for provisions of this kind to be subjected to public scrutiny before passage. However, the great bulk of the transitional provisions have not yet been formulated. </PARA>
<PARA>The Joint Select Committee noted in paragraph 2.11 of its report:</PARA>
<PARA>The Committee notes that in a letter dated 29 April 1988 the Attorney-General has notified State Ministers that he will not proclaim certain of the legislation in the Bills package until a case determining the Constitutional validity of the new scheme has been determined by the High Court. </PARA>
<PARA> The Joint Select Committee went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . that, as a part of its response to this Committee's Report, the Government should provide the Parliament with an outline of what transitional provisions are proposed to allow a proper and orderly change from the co-operative Scheme to the new scheme. </PARA>
<PARA>That was a specific recommendation. The Government has refused to take up that recommendation. The reasons for it not doing so were explained very inadequately in the debate on the corporations legislation package. Since that debate concluded I, Senator Durack and others of our colleagues have continued to receive expressions of concern from the business community about the transitional arrangements to be applied. Yet, the situation seems to remain in a state of glorious uncertainty. </PARA>
<PARA> On coming into the chamber this morning I found on my desk the second reading speech on the Co-operative Scheme Legislation Amendment Bill 1989. The speech states:</PARA>
<PARA> As the Attorney-General indicated in the second reading speech when introducing the Bill into the House of Representatives-</PARA>
<PARA>this must have been yet another of those Bills which have been guillotined-</PARA>
<PARA>. . . the introduction of this Bill in no way diminishes the Government's commitment to the early implementation of the Commonwealth's Corporations legislation. That legislation has now been passed by both Houses of this Parliament and incorporates a number of amendments recommended by the Joint Select Committee on Corporations Legislation. </PARA>
<PARA>I interpose to say it certainly does not incorporate the recommendations of the Committee in relation to transitional arrangements. The second reading speech goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA> The Government will be proceeding to set up the machinery necessary for proper implementation of the national scheme as soon as possible. </PARA>
<PARA>In other words, there is no machinery yet in respect of implementation. If that is not what that statement means, it is a very badly drafted sentence indeed. The second reading speech goes on as follows:</PARA>
<PARA> In the meantime, the Government has indicated its commitment to maintain the existing scheme of regulation, including provisions for the protection of investors, pending the commencement of the national legislation. </PARA>
<PARA>That raises an enormous number of questions. It indicates nothing more than that none of the concerns that were expressed on this side of the chamber in the earlier debates-those concerns were reflected as well in the minority report of the Joint Select Committee in which all the coalition members of the Committee argued very strongly against the Government's proposals; and the whole Committee unanimously argued for transitional arrangements-appears to have been taken into account. </PARA>
<PARA> This is a matter of which the Minister for Justice should be aware. I say to him that there is a considerable degree of uncertainty and concern out in the community at a time when the last thing we want in this country is a denting of investor confidence. For heaven's sake, we are getting enough of that now as a result of the incredible economic policy performance of this Government. The economy is being bashed around the ears; the business community is being bashed around the ears and now, through administrative incompetence, it is about to be bashed around the ears again. I point out to the Minister that this is a matter of very grave concern not only to the coalition, but also to the players involved in this whole area, that is, participants and members of the companies and securities industry. </PARA>
<PARA> I request from the Minister an explanation, not just for coalition members of parliament but, more importantly, for the community, whose interests are vitally affected, as to what transitional arrangements are proposed; what will be the timing of the move from the NCSC to the ASC; what mechanics will be used in terms of almost certain High Court challenges to the legislation; how will the Attorney-General (Mr Lionel Bowen) handle this matter when he says that certain elements of the legislative package will not be proclaimed until the High Court validity has been tested; and which certain elements will they compromise. In other words, there is an enormous number of unanswered questions that demand an answer. I hope that in this debate, brief though it is-and I appreciate the time constraints-we can at least start to get some of the answers to those questions and that we will get the rest of the answers very quick smart indeed. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I believe that many of these points were raised in the debate on the corporations legislation as it was passed through this chamber. I do not want to go over the same ground that I believe my ministerial colleague Senator Bolkus traversed at that time. I think it is important to realise that, with the passage of that legislation, there is a new phenomenon in the landscape as far as the Ministerial Council is concerned. That Council meets next week. I think at that meeting the reaction of the States to what is now a fact rather than what had been a matter of conjecture will become clearer. It may be that no challenge will ever emerge.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is clear that the State Attorneys-General have the right to mount a challenge to the legislation. They would have standing to do so, but it may not be taken up. I believe that until the Ministerial Council meets next week and the attitude of the States is known-whether a common attitude emerges or whether it is quite diverse-that is a matter for those discussions. I believe that the timing of the transition to the Commonwealth's preferred position will very much depend on that meeting. I do not think it would be very fruitful to anticipate that. In the meantime, as Senator Short points out, the current legislation is not repealed. If amendments to that legislation are approved by the Ministerial Council, passage through this Parliament will still be necessary in order to keep the legislative package up to date and reflecting the wishes of that Council so far as the legislative regulation of companies, securities, and so on, is required. As I say, I think everything really depends on the meeting next week. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like briefly to support Senator Short's remarks, particularly the concerns that he has expressed. Senator Short, being a member of the Joint Select Committee on Corporations Legislation, has the best knowledge of any of us as to the problems, both practical and legal, that are hanging there for the Government and for the business community of Australia. As recently as last week the same sorts of concerns were expressed to me by a number of prominent business people in Perth. Those were people who had organised to present their case to the Joint Select Committee and who are still as worried as ever about just where this whole scheme is going to go and how it is going to affect them and, in many cases, their clients.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Tate will not hear the question though, and Senator Evans presumably will not know what the answer is, despite his great command of these matters. What really worries me about what Senator Tate has just said is that in the Ministerial Council which is scheduled for next week it may well emerge that none of the States are going to mount a constitutional challenge to the validity of this package. I understood that the Government appreciated the fact that there were doubts about the ambit of the constitutional powers in relation to giving full certainty to this legislation. Therefore, if no State mounts a challenge, will the Government itself go on with such a major restructuring of the companies and securities laws of this country and establish its own mechanism? Even with the cooperation of the States, there would still be the problem, for instance, of whether a company registered with the new Australian Securities Commission could at some subsequent stage have the constitutional validity of that registration challenged. This raises horrific problems for the future. That doubt hanging there alone is the sort of thing that is not only worrying for the business community and their advisers but should also be of great concern, I would have thought, to the Government, as it is to members of this Parliament, in relation to how business can operate under that uncertainty. I really am more concerned than ever now to hear Senator Tate say that there may be no challenge. I want to know what the Government will be doing if there is no challenge.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I suppose the short answer is that we will bear that outcome with such fortitude as we can collectively command, as we have often done in the past when there has been a question raised about the constitutional validity of a piece of legislation or legislative scheme. The easiest route by which to put at rest uncertainties of this kind is for one or more States at an early stage to seek to have the matter resolved. I did not hear what Senator Tate said in that respect. He is back in the chamber; he can speak for himself.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is a matter for the States as to whether they think there is a sufficient basis for such a challenge. It is not only the States that arguably would have standing right at the outset, even to pursue a declaratory proceeding; innumerable companies themselves or, I suppose, stock exchanges, or institutes of directors, or business organisations, arguably would have the capacity, even before the legislation is formally in force, to seek a declaratory resolution of the matter if the uncertainty and fears are in fact as great as Senator Durack indicates. I am not sure whether there is that same degree of uncertainty. There are always risks involved in any major legislative endeavour. </PARA>
<PARA> What is clear is that for generations now the business community and many others in this country have been arguing that the way forward is a single, coherent national companies and securities law structure. Any change of this kind necessarily involves, I suppose, some degree of uncertainty in its initial formative stages. That is just part of the price of progress-something which I appreciate not so much Senator Durack personally but those on his side have always had great difficulty in coming to grips with. But that is the kind of outcome that I think we have just got to be prepared to risk if we are to make major progress. </PARA>

I understand Senator Durack's concerns and his legitimate interest in this matter, but I believe that the Ministerial Council will reveal the intention of the States in this matter at least in a preliminary way-which parts they might feel they are able to live with, which parts they really want to challenge, and which sections might therefore be able to be proclaimed at an earlier stage, leaving those matters to be challenged unproclaimed.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question to the Minister for Justice, Senator Tate, follows on the question that I asked in Question Time yesterday about uniformed Australian Federal Police at domestic and overseas airports. In essence, the Minister said-and I would like him to correct me if I am wrong-that Cabinet had made a decision to dispose of those jobs at the airports and was presently negotiating with the States for the State police to take over those duties. He said that negotiations were presently being undertaken. When does the Minister expect those negotiations to be finalised?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;To reiterate very briefly, the Federal Government is seeking to ensure that uniformed policing functions at airports are undertaken by the State or Northern Territory police force concerned. I am not absolutely sure, but I think there are some 14 airports concerned amongst the many in Australia. The Government is doing this on the basis of a report which indicated, with regard to both the anti-terrorism aspect of that uniformed policing role and the community policing role, that it made better sense for the uniformed police at airports to be under the one line of command and, therefore, that it would be a sensible thing to transfer that function-but not transferring the Australian Federal Police ports squad's function which is more of a plain clothes detective-type function-particularly monitoring and putting under surveillance persons of interest to the police.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In relation to the question of transfer and its timing, the Federal Cabinet has taken a decision. The Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) has written to Premiers seeking that the consultation process be opened up. I mentioned this to the Australian Police Ministers Council on Wednesday of last week in Adelaide. Ministers there took the matter no further than a very brief discussion, lasting perhaps 20 minutes, but are now in a better position to understand the proposal which we hope to have negotiated so that it is phased in-and it may be that some States come to the party quicker than others-by 1 January 1990. We have set ourselves a six-month period from 1 January 1990 to 30 June 1990 for this transition to be accomplished. It depends on many factors. Some States are more inclined to support the idea than others. From their point of view, the main question is funding. That is a matter which is still subject to discussions. </PARA>
<PARA> I might mention that I have had correspondence and discussions with the Australian Federal Police Association, being the union involved, about the proper arrangements that must be made in relation to its members who are engaged in airport policing functions. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to raise the matter of the war crimes prosecutions and seek clarification of the progress of the Government's program in that regard. The Estimates Committee has now been advised that there are 275 cases in various stages of investigation. Would the Minister for Justice (Senator Tate) confirm that that is still the case? When we questioned the Minister in the Estimates Committee as to how many prospective defendants had been interviewed, as I interpret his answer, he said that he believed that at that stage there were 30 and that he would seek to have that figure confirmed. In the additional information provided the figure is about 80 persons. That was in answer to the question: `How many persons have actually been interviewed by the Special Investigations Unit till now?'. There is obviously an ambiguity there. Are the 80 persons who have been interviewed 80 prospective defendants or is the Minister referring to the number of interviews that might be conducted with prospective witnesses, for example, in relation to a lesser number of potential prosecutions? I do not think that is the case. I think that the Minister is talking about 80 prospective defendants, but I would like that confirmed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The third area I wish to raise is timing and whether prosecutions will go ahead. The Minister would be well aware that there have been conflicting signs posted on this question. Comments were made some little time ago by the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) that there might be about 20 prosecutions. On 17 March comments were made by Mr Greenwood, the head of the Special Investigations Unit, to the effect that it was quite possible that no-one would even be charged. A previous Estimates Committee hearing was told that the Government expected to have its first files passed to the Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP) for final advice and then prosecution by April of this year. The Estimates Committee has been advised that none had reached that stage as at 13 April. Is it still the case that no files have been passed to the DPP? When does the Minister anticipate that stage will be reached? Is it still the Government's intention to pursue prosecutions? In what time frame does it now see such prosecutions taking place?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In relation to the prosecution of specific numbers of alleged war criminals in Australia, which I think formed the basis of Senator Hill's first two questions, I do not have an absolutely up to date document with me, so I would like to take the questions on notice and perhaps answer them after Question Time today. I should be able to telephone Mr Greenwood's Unit in order to get the exact number of cases. I do not see why that should vary. As to the number of people who have been interviewed and whether there is a discrepancy, I will have that looked into. I undertake to provide a precise answer as to those numbers certainly before the end of business today.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As to whether prosecutions will go ahead, this entirely depends on the assembling of what, in the end, would amount to admissible evidence to enable a prosecution to go ahead with some chance of success. With regard to that, there are two or three hurdles to jump. The Special Investigations Unit under Mr Greenwood is charged with making an initial survey of the materials, information and intelligence and deciding whether there is a strong probability that a particular person, within the terms of the War Crimes Amendment Act, could be properly considered by the Director of Public Prosecutions as a person who ought to be prosecuted for a war crime. </PARA>
<PARA> The Special Investigations Unit is required to look at and give weight to exculpatory evidence as much as that which points in the direction of attaching criminal blame to the person concerned. It is that process and that necessary balance and integrity rather than fanaticism in pursuit of these alleged war criminals that needs to be marked and reinforced. The Government wishes that to be the case in the operations of the Special Investigations Unit. That is even more the case in the operations of the Director of Public Prosecutions, Mr Ian Temby, who, as a statutory officer with autonomy bestowed by this Parliament, has to secure in the public mind its high independence. I am sure that will be continued by Mr Mark Weinberg. </PARA>
<PARA> It is very important that that Director of Public Prosecutions role also operate entirely consistently with the general principles relating to prosecution, which have been enunciated and published and, I think, tabled in this place. It is very important that those trials, as was reinforced by amendments put into legislation by this chamber, be conducted entirely in accordance with the ordinary rules of evidence and with all the protections available to the accused, so that the whole framework is not one which is designed to achieve a political result, namely the prosecution of particular persons. The framework which is there is one which I hope will achieve the greatest protection possible for those who have been accused, the subject of Mr Menzies' report, for example, and other allegations which have been received by the Special Investigations Unit. It is in that context as I understand it-as I say, I will confirm it with Mr Greenwood's Unit-that as of today no files have been handed to the DPP. I will check that and let the honourable senator know, certainly by the end of business today. The other questions about when prosecutions will go ahead of course do not fall to be answered at this stage. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to press the matter a little further, because although the Minister's information is helpful to a point, it really does not give us much idea as to what real progress has taken place in the whole exercise. Those of us who were engaged in the Senate inquiry on this matter, which was nearly 18 months ago, took evidence from Mr Greenwood who was even at that stage conducting his inquiries in Eastern bloc countries and building up evidence to put before the DPP. As I have just said, it is now almost a year and a half on and there has been a very large expenditure of Commonwealth money. We have had the reappointment of Mr Greenwood for a further year. We know that there is still a very large number of what are described as current matters, but we do not know whether there is any progress being made in relation to any of those investigations.</PARA></TALK.START>

As I have said, that is a note dated 28 April 1989, which I think is a fortnight or so after the Estimates Committee hearing, which must have been based on figures which were if not then out of date, certainly not current. In any case, I will get, I hope by the end of the day, an up to date figure as at 25 May 1989. Once again, my information dated 28 April 1989 indicated that the Unit had opened 564 files, each relating to an allegation that a particular individual has committed a war crime or crimes. As at 10 April, 78 of those files had been closed as the individual subject to the allegation was found to be deceased. A further 211 files have been suspended, that is, no further investigation is to be made into the allegation. A further 275 files relating to individual persons are in various stages of investigation. It was anticipated at that stage that as a result of review, a further number of those would be put into the suspended category.

I would like to know from the Minister what will be the cost of relocation of the National Crime Authority head office from Sydney to Melbourne? How many staff will be affected?

Some reasonable arguments were put up to support that proposal by a person who has the experience of being the chief administrative officer of that court, as the Acting Principal Registrar. I believe that the proposal, whilst not falling on deaf ears, has not by any means reached a stage where the Chief Judge's request-whether he be a good man or whether Melbourne be a good city-has been acceded to by the Government. The suggestion is to be included in terms of reference for an examination of the whole financial and administrative structure of the Family Court which is to be undertaken in the next financial year. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Family Court itself, the Attorney-General's Department and the Department of Finance will be undertaking an examination of the Family Court administration. This will be merely one facet of that examination. If the proposal were to be further advanced as a result of that examination, full consultation with affected staff would have to take place. That would be part of the Government's decision-making process, quite apart from the question of efficiencies and costs. The movement of staff and the loss of talent if staff decide not to move is a very important consideration.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> With regard to the National Crime Authority, the appointment of Mr Peter Faris, QC, of the Melbourne Bar to head the Authority-I will give some editorial colouring to my answer-has been extremely well received. He was introduced to the intergovernmental committee of relevant Ministers from all jurisdictions around Australia in Adelaide last Thursday and received the confidence of that committee for the task that he is now undertaking in succession to Mr Justice Stewart, who established the National Crime Authority. The proposal that the leadership group within the administration of the National Crime Authority be transferred to Melbourne is not one of enormous logistics. Partly as a result of the work of Messrs Costigan and Redlich and others, the National Crime Authority has a very considerable presence in Melbourne, with considerable administrative staff. We do not know for sure but we think only a small number of persons would be affected by any such proposal. </PARA>

I am quite confident that once again, given the expected passage of legislation in this place this session to ensure that the chairman of the National Crime Authority has a more direct and clear responsibility for the managerial supervision of that Authority, it would make sense for Mr Faris to be assisted by the physical presence of those who would implement the managerial directive and supervision that he would be required to give to the operations of the Authority.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is all very well, but the question is whether it is in the interests of the Commonwealth that the heads of these bodies move to the court or the tribunal or whether it should be expected that the court or tribunal, or the administrative framework in the case of the National Crime Authority (NCA), should move to the head of that body. It is a question of balancing the costs to the taxpayer and the disruption to the lives of the more lowly staff in the organisation as against the convenience of the head of the particular body. I look forward in due course to an answer-I will not press for it now-as to what the costs will be and how many staff will be affected by the NCA moving its head office.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I come back very briefly to the question of the Family Court and once more seek clarification. The Attorney-General (Mr Lionel Bowen) had agreed in principle to the movement of the Principal Registry of the Family Court, as the Minister is well aware, having advised the Senate of that fact on behalf of the Attorney-General. I take it that his answer, in which he said that there would now be an in-depth investigation into the cost of the administration of the Family Court, does not affect the previous answer; in other words, that it is still the intention to move the Family Court Principal Registry but matters of detail are yet to be concluded. </PARA>

I believe that the in-principle agreement of the Attorney-General was also subject to his being satisfied that there were true benefits able to be demonstrated by such a move.

Unless he is satisfied that such benefits will accrue, I do not believe that authorisation of or concurrence in the Chief Justice's wish would be obtained.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The mighty Clarence River in northern New South Wales runs very close to a small Aboriginal hamlet known as Baryulgil. Baryulgil is built on an asbestos mine and what has occurred there is quite disgraceful. Some of the matters are sub judice and I will be very careful about what I raise and what I do not raise during this discussion. It is worth reminding honourable senators that Woodsreef operated its mine at Baryulgil, the deposit of chrysotile having been discovered in 1918. The mining ceased in 1979. The tailings from the mine were used to fill in a couple of areas around the village. In an area known as Baryulgil Square the Aboriginal community built its houses on top of the tailings from the asbestos mine. The Government of New South Wales established the Baryulgil Primary School close by. It is built on tailings from the asbestos mine. The site contains a tonne of asbestos fibre.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Recently a handful of gravel from Baryulgil Square was sent to Western Australia coded. It was assessed in the laboratory of the Department of Occupational Health, Safety and Welfare as containing 10 per cent chrysotile, or white asbestos. That analysis was done in March 1989. A number of families with quite well known Aboriginal names-the Mundine family, for example- live in large numbers in Baryulgil. Most Aboriginals up there smoke. They were exposed to asbestos. It will not surprise honourable senators to know that the mortality was very high, that there were very few Aboriginals there who were more than 50 years old, that the rate of lung disease was high, and that the community suffered from the effects of exposure to asbestos fibre and, of course, from the effects of smoking-they exacerbate each other. The community there built shacks or houses on the area that became known as Baryulgil Square, which was eventually granted by the New South Wales Government to the then appropriate Aboriginal land body. </PARA>
<PARA> Soon after I became Minister for Aboriginal Affairs one of the first things I did, at the instigation of my Department, was to travel to Baryulgil and to make a ministerial decision that we would relocate that Aboriginal community away from the Square. Faced with the evidence that the community was living on top of asbestos fibre and the tailings from an asbestos mine, what other decision could be taken? The Department of Aboriginal Affairs-a very good department-constructed a village three kilometres away known as Malabugilmah. Many honourable senators collect trophies and the one of which I am proudest is a photo in my office of the tree under which we negotiated with the Aboriginal community the agreement which led to the establishment of Malabugilmah village. </PARA>
<PARA> The situation does not end there. From the asbestos-containing tailings on Baryulgil Square the run-off in heavy rain flows into Oakey Creek; from Oakey Creek the water runs into Joseph Creek and from Joseph Creek it runs into the Clarence River. About 50 metres down from the confluence of Joseph Creek and the Clarence River the water supply from the new Malabugilmah River is drawn. So one can presume that the water that is going to this Aboriginal community is rich in whatever comes from those tailings. I imagine that it contains some asbestos. </PARA>
<PARA> It took some time to get events under way. I started negotiations with the Government of New South Wales about the local school, because it was apparent that the schoolyard too was built on asbestos tailings. The then Minister in New South Wales, the late Paul Landa, and I corresponded. The school has not been moved, but some remedial work was done to the site. So great was the remaining problem of what was the proper course to be taken for the people who had lived their lives on Baryulgil Square, that in the mid-1980s-the report of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Aboriginal Affairs says 1984, but I think it has to be 1983-the then Minister for Aboriginal Affairs, Mr Clyde Holding, gave a reference to the Committee to examine the effects of asbestos mining on the Baryulgil community. The House of Representatives Committee brought down its report to the Parliament in October 1984. </PARA>
<PARA> Honourable senators will be interested to know that that House of Representatives Committee was chaired by Mr G. L. Hand, MP, the person who is now the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs and who is responsible for doing something about the matters which have been revealed. The report on the effects of asbestos mining lays out the history of the Woodsreef mine, the history of James Hardie, the company that ran the mine, making the point that it was in a very difficult position in relation to this investigation because of certain matters which are sub judice. The report sets out the history of housing at Baryulgil Square and the history of the development of Malabugilmah village. I interpolate here to say that there has been a failure to bulldoze what housing was built on the Square. The result is that as people moved from Baryulgil Square to Malabugilmah, other people moved into the housing that was left on the Square. So there are still Aboriginal families living on top of the tailings of the asbestos mine. My view is that we should find alternative housing and then get in there with a bulldozer and get rid of all the housing on the Square. Little children are still being brought up on top of the Baryulgil Square tailings from the Woodsreef asbestos mine, from chrysotile mining. </PARA>
<PARA> I have risen to make the point that this House of Representatives Committee made a number of recommendations in October 1984 and, to be fair, a number of those recommendations relate to action that is required by the New South Wales Government, but there are actions which are required to be taken by the Commonwealth. Mr Hand, who conducted the inquiry as Chairman, is now the Minister. At the very least there should have been pressure on New South Wales from the moment the report was brought down. Until one year ago the Government of New South Wales and this Government were of the same persuasion, so there should have been good communication. I have to say that there has been almost no action. There have been reports, there have been many meetings, there have been many pieces of paper going backwards and forwards and promises have been made, but I want outcomes. I want actions. I want to be able to look and say, `The children in the school at that village are no longer in any danger of asbestos exposure'-and I tell honourable senators that they are still in danger. As Minister I was very worried when I went there on my first visit. The school is too close to the tailings. Every time the breeze blows it blows asbestos into the playground. The playground itself had asbestos outcroppings. I do not believe that has been fixed, although I understand that the New South Wales Government has looked at remedial action. There might have to be a complete resurfacing of the school grounds. We want action and results so that no Aboriginal people continue to live on top of the asbestos tailings. That has not occurred. </PARA>
<PARA> Last night I saw a delegation from the community and it assured me that there are still significant numbers of people living on Baryulgil Square. How can that be? Mr Hand is the Minister who, as a backbencher, produced this report, so how can it be that he has taken no effective action? We know that the Malabugilmah village itself, the model village that was created, is having its own problems. Apparently there is some soil subsidence. Many of the houses have quite serious cracks. One of them has had the ceiling fall in because the walls have moved. What is being done to keep that housing in good shape? Recommendation 1 of the House of Representatives Committee states:</PARA>
<PARA>That the Attorneys-General of the Commonwealth and New South Wales consider ways and means whereby the technical difficulties presented by Aboriginality in seeking compensation may be removed. </PARA>
<PARA>What has happened since that recommendation in October 1984? Has the problem been fixed? Has any action occurred? Recommendation 2 states:</PARA>
<PARA>That the Commonwealth establish an Aboriginal Medical Service based in Grafton to cater for general health needs of the local Aboriginal communities and having expertise in the diagnosis and management of asbestos-related diseases.</PARA>
<PARA>Has it happened? Is it there? Recommendation 5 states:</PARA>
<PARA>That the Commonwealth Department of Aboriginal Affairs continue to use every effort to persuade the residents of Baryulgil Square to move to another site removed from any risk to health from the Baryulgil mine site. </PARA>
<PARA>That has not happened, and it was a Commonwealth responsibility. Recommendation 6 states:</PARA>
<PARA>That the Commonwealth Minister for Aboriginal Affairs recommend to the New South Wales Government that they institute a vigorous program to decontaminate Baryulgil Square as far as possible. </PARA>
<PARA>I am assured by the residents that that has not happened. Recommendation 7 states:</PARA>
<PARA>That the Commonwealth Minister for Aboriginal Affairs request the New South Wales Government to direct the State Pollution Control Commission to continue to monitor the health risks from asbestos tailings at Baryulgil Square and to take whatever remedial measures may become necessary. </PARA>
<PARA>I do not know whether that has happened. There are other recommendations, one of which concerns the possible closure of the school and what would need to be done should that be necessary. The problem is that we can see no evidence of outcomes yet. I am aware that two Bills are in the Parliament of New South Wales at this moment-the Dust Diseases Tribunal Bill and the Workers' Compensation (Dust Diseases) Amendment Bill-which relate to action by that State to overcome some of the problems which the situation at Baryulgil has revealed. I hope that the Greiner Government in New South Wales will enact these pieces of legislation speedily. I ask honourable senators to be aware that we have at this little hamlet in New South Wales a disgrace, a preventable health problem, a problem where all we have to do is remove the people from exposure to asbestos. We have a report that tells us some of the ways in which to do it. The Committee which made the report was chaired by the person who is now the Minister, but nothing has happened. It is quite disgraceful and it is an indictment of this Government that the recommendations have not yet been implemented. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Aboriginal Affairs, Mr Gerry Hand, takes a very close interest in the Aboriginal community at Baryulgil in northern New South Wales. His interest comes largely from the fact that he chaired a parliamentary committee which looked into the situation arising from the fact that members of the community lived on the tailings site of asbestos operations conducted earlier in the century. It is not true to say that no action has been taken in relation to the health service needs of the Aboriginal communities in the area. Although I will outline some points in a moment, I will not say that everything that can be done has been done. Indeed the Minister, as I indicated in Question Time yesterday, was due to meet with members of the community. Perhaps he was to meet with the same delegation as that which met with Senator Baume yesterday. I understand that the meeting has taken place, although I have no knowledge yet of what occurred at that meeting or what the outcomes were.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Department of Aboriginal Affairs (DAA) commissioned an examination of the health status of those communities. It was completed in 1988. That study recommended that a health service centre should be set up at Grafton in order to operate clinics and provide services to the various communities. As I understand it, the Department is funding a health worker at Baryulgil who ferries people to appointments in Grafton and helps the State Health Department's community health nurse who visits from Grafton once a week. That seems to be some attempt to have a regular and helpful health worker and community health nurse service available to the community. In the meantime, a committee has been set up with representatives from the Aboriginal Health Resource Committee, community representatives from the district DAA and the New South Wales Department of Health to discuss the establishment of a health service in the area. As I understand it, the Biripi health service at Taree has been commissioned by the Department to give advice on how that might best be achieved. So certain steps have been taken and further steps are clearly being undertaken. </PARA>
<PARA> I imagine that the conversations which took place yesterday, if they occurred as scheduled, between the Minister and representatives of the community will have further advanced the provision of these health services. I do not think it is at all straightforward. I understand that some in the community would prefer to see mainstream health services upgraded and be able to make use of them rather than have a separate service established. There is apparently no uniform view in the communities on these matters. No doubt the advice of the Biripi health service at Taree will be important in shaping any further health services that are established in the area. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is not my desire to take this much further, but I have to say to the Minister that while it is nice to know that there are committees, meetings and surveys, it is not impressive. When I was told of the problem in November 1980, we made a decision to commit funds and to relocate the village by December 1980. We started doing something. In 1981 people were moved into houses off the square. It is action and outcomes that count. The Minister told us that as a result of meetings a decision was taken in 1988 to recommend the establishment of a health service, but that was also the recommendation in 1984. Some action should have been taken. A service should have been established before the end of 1984.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We can have meetings and committees and good intentions, but all that will matter in the end are the things that we can see happening on the ground, such as people no longer living on the square on top of asbestos; enough houses at Malabugilmah village to move them out, and if there are not enough houses they must be built; a medical service; and adequate measures to ensure that the school is safe for the children. I repeat: outcomes and achievements are what matter, not good intentions. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I was sitting in the chamber waiting to participate in the health part of the debate this morning, but clearly the matter which is before us now is really in the health area and it nicely bridges those two aspects of Aboriginal affairs and health. I am moved to stand and comment on the Minister's loose use of the term `health services' where really he was referring to looking after people after they become ill; he was talking about illness services. If there is one thing that we have learnt about the desirability of health services, it is that if we can prevent people from becoming ill, not only are those people much better off but the community at large is much better off because it faces a much lower cost. Everything the Minister was saying was directed towards the monitoring and treatment of those people who may well develop mesothelioma and other forms of lung cancer and other diseases consequent upon exposure to asbestos. I extend Senator Peter Baume's remarks and point out that this has a long history. It is well known in medical literature that asbestos is an extremely dangerous substance.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As I have said, I did not intend to participate in this debate but, from memory, the first workers compensation case in the world which was successfully fought was in the United States of America in 1906. Of course, that was for chronic pneumoconiosis, the constrictive lung disease consequent upon the inhalation of very heavy fibre concentrations. In those early years most of the people who were exposed to asbestos died quite early from chronic lung disease, short of getting cancer. I believe that it was not until about 1918 that that was recognised and the concentrations of asbestos fibre to which people were exposed were sufficiently reduced so that people in that industry survived long enough for cancers to start to appear. I think the record shows that the Johns Manville Corporation knew by 1935 that asbestos was related to mesothelioma and lung cancer. Certainly by the 1950s there was a general and universal acceptance that that was the case. </PARA>
<PARA> Against that background I was absolutely shocked several days ago when people from Baryulgil came to see me and told me that an analysis done only within recent weeks indicated that the concentration of asbestos in the square in Baryulgil was still 10 per cent. That is an area where people are living; it is an area where children are playing; and that indicates a very high level of exposure. Senator Baume read into the record this morning the recommendations in the report of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Aboriginal Affairs. Against that, I can only say that the actions that this Government has taken to address that situation in a preventative sense are simply totally inadequate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Before we pass these appropriations I want to bring to the attention of this chamber the very real concerns that were expressed about numerous aspects of the operations and the administration of both the Department of Aboriginal Affairs and the Aboriginal Development Commission by all members of Estimates Committee E-and I stress the word `all'-who participated in that Committee's debate and considerations. These are included in the report of the Estimates Committee. As these Estimates committee reports tend to get buried I just want to put to this chamber some of the main points that were raised by Estimates Committee E in its considerations, because I think they are important points that often are not as widely recognised as should be the case.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In relation to the Department of Aboriginal Affairs, as distinct from the Aboriginal Development Commission, I draw the attention of this chamber to the concern that was expressed by members of all parties to the question of performance indicators, which are integral to the success of program budgeting and the financial management improvement program, which has been an important part of the improvement of financial and other management in Government departments over recent years. The Department itself acknowledged that it is having difficulties in this area. The explanatory notes that we received gave several reasons for this, in particular the broad policy objective of self-determination for Aboriginal and Torres Strait islanders and the community-based nature of many departmental programs. The Committee certainly recognised that problems with the development of performance indicators are not unique to the Department of Aboriginal Affairs; it is a problem that bedevils quite a few departments. However, we were concerned, as an Estimates committee, that so little progress had been made in this area by the Department, particularly in the light of the review by the Audit Office, at the request of the Government, following matters that were raised in the Estimates Committee and in other areas late in 1988. They culminated in a special audit report by the Audit Office of the Department and that report was very highly critical of many of the operations of the Department. I will come to that a little later. </PARA>
<PARA> The Estimates Committee endorsed the comment of the Audit Office in its special report, which said:</PARA>
<PARA>The aims and objectives of some projects were defined too broadly for assessment. Statistics which would be required to enable an objective assessment to be made were not provided and performance measures used in the assessment of some projects needed to be reviewed. </PARA>
<PARA>The Committee said in its report that it recognised that the Department was seeking to remedy these problems and that it looked forward to seeing the results of its efforts at the Committee's next hearings. I am not suggesting that we need any additional response from the Department or from the Minister on that, but it is a matter that this chamber ought to be aware of. </PARA>
<PARA> Estimates Committee E was also concerned about the public awareness program being conducted by the Department. It is a program to address the question of the public perception of Aboriginal people in Australia. There was no dispute about that objective. However, a matter of concern to us was that neither the consultant nor the research officer for whom provision had been made to assist in this program had been appointed at this late stage in the 1988-89 financial year, despite the fact that a very significant financial commitment has been made for that purpose. The Committee was also questioning of whether consultants hired at this late stage in the financial year could make any worthwhile contribution to the expenditure of the unallocated proportion of the appropriation for that public awareness program. That unallocated portion is a significant figure-$733,000. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee also drew attention to the extraordinarily high number of unacquitted grants made by the Department. In that context, I commend in particular Senator Crichton-Browne for having raised this issue in this chamber and for having brought it to our attention. The Audit Office report noted that a very significant number of grants by the Department remained unacquitted. According to the special audit report, no less than 783 grants totalling in excess of $67m remained unacquitted. All of those cases are in breach of the statutory requirement of the Aboriginal Councils and Associations Act 1976. </PARA>
<PARA> The Estimates Committee made it clear that the conditions for acquittal are not onerous. The recipient is required to produce within six months of the end of the financial year an externally audited financial management statement plus a certificate from the recipient's managing body that the recipient has complied with the grant conditions. Those conditions, as I say, are not onerous. The Committee also noted that a number of unacquitted grants had been significantly reduced in the past 12 months. But it did consider it a matter of continuing concern that grant conditions are not being met in such a large number of cases. I would like to hear from the Minister what actions may be being considered to improve that situation, which even the Prime Minister has recognised as being of an unacceptable standard. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Short raised a very good point regarding performance indicators in relation to the provision of services and the fulfilment of the hopes of programs provided for Aboriginal people throughout Australia. Indeed, as Senator Short and other honourable senators would be aware, the development of such indicators for any social welfare program is indeed a very difficult task. I do not think it would be fair to characterise the Department's attitude to the development of such indicators and their monitoring as casual if that means that there is a certain uninterested and lackadaisical attitude to the matter. It is a difficult one. Nevertheless, the prodding, perhaps, by persons and committees such as the Estimates committees galvanised the Department to analyse further the problems in the area. A working party was convened in mid-1988. That working party's deliberations have led to the production of a program budgeting manual, which I believe was forwarded to the Committee in the last couple of days and which is certainly available from the Committee's secretariat. That manual will come into operation on 1 July 1989.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Training programs are being undertaken throughout Australia to ensure that regional offices are aware of the requirements of that program budgeting manual. I believe that this is an important part of defining the objectives of the program and ensuring that the administration of the projects achieve the aims and goals that are so important. I will not ask for the manual to be incorporated in Hansard. Nevertheless, it is available from the secretariat. I congratulate those people under Mr Bill Gray who were responsible for putting together this performance indicators manual. </PARA>
<PARA> The work of the Senate Estimates Committee will be further enhanced by the development of this performance indicators approach. Perhaps it can now get on with the real task, which I know is certainly at the forefront of Senator Aulich's mind when he asks questions at Estimates committees, of seeing that the services that are delivered to Aboriginal people really achieve their objectives. </PARA>
<PARA> The only other matter that I would like to comment on is the question of unacquitted grants. The latest advice available shows that as at 19 May 1989 the Department had a total of 1,290 unacquitted grants. The distribution by State was New South Wales, 310; Victoria-Tasmania, 65; Queensland, 406; South Australia, 102; Western Australia, 322; and the Northern Territory, 90. I believe that the Department is conscious of the need to maintain rigorous action in that regard. I think a directors conference was held in February of this year in relation to those matters. There is a weekly monitoring of the matter by the Department. State and regional offices have been told that even in an era of tight resources they are to devote priority resources to the question of unacquitted grants. This is, as I say, despite the constraints at field level. I think that sufficiently answers the matters raised in relation to the Department. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Estimates Committee E again raised in its report several telling points of concern about the operation of the Aboriginal Development Commission. Indeed, we were concerned at the inability of the Commission to answer questions during the Estimates hearings. The Commission had to take on notice approximately 80 questions compared with only 30 for the Department of Aboriginal Affairs. That was despite the forewarning that we had given the Commission on the matters that we wanted to raise. Indeed, as the Minister would know, we gave prior notice of a large number of questions well in advance of the Senate Estimates Committee hearing.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The very fact that so many questions had to be taken on notice during the hearings themselves was a matter of concern. It was certainly a matter of concern because it prevented the Committee from pursuing issues through further questioning. This matter is of concern to the operation of Estimates committees in general because the further pursuit of an issue can be effectively closed off through an inability, refusal, or whatever to answer a question. There are, of course, legitimate reasons for taking questions on notice; for example, the complexity or obscurity of the question. But the Committee was concerned, and expressed this concern in its report, that in the case of the ADC the number of questions taken on notice was excessive and that the ADC should have been so represented that more questions could have been answered immediately. That is a matter which the Minister may not wish to comment on in this context, but it is a point which I hope will be taken up by this Commission when producing witnesses at further hearings. </PARA>
<PARA> The Auditor-General's special report attracted a very strong response from the ADC. It is of concern that there has been such obvious friction between the Australian Audit Office and the Aboriginal Development Commission. Indeed, the Audit Office went so far as to describe the ADC's approach to the Audit as characterised by `a relative lack of cooperation not seen before from an official body'. That is a very strong statement indeed from a normally prudent Audit Office. I do not know whether the Minister wishes to comment on the matter, but I draw it to the attention of the Committee because of the strength of the Auditor-General's response. </PARA>
<PARA> The Estimates Committee, examining both the Audit Office and the ADC on this matter, did agree that, on the evidence available to it, the ADC's attitude to the special audit was a matter of concern and that there was real evidence that an uncooperative approach had been adopted by the ADC. We were also concerned, as was the Audit Office, about the ADC having retained private counsel to deal with the Audit Office. Indeed, the Attorney-General's Department has rejected some of the grounds on which the ADC sought to justify the counsel's appointment. In particular, we were concerned, as was the Audit Office and as was the Attorney-General's Department, at the retention by the ADC of Mr Michael Adams, QC, at a cost of some $125,000 just to assist the ADC in its dealings with the Audit Office in relation to the special audit. I might point out that Mr Adams is a Queen's Counsel whose practice is principally in the area of criminal law, not in the interpretation of the statutory powers of Commonwealth authorities, which was essentially the subject of the Audit Office's investigation. The Attorney-General's Department, the Audit Office and the Committee were very concerned about the justification put forward by the ADC for its action to retain Mr Michael Adams. Indeed, setting aside the nature of the individual, the whole question of whether private counsel ought to be retained by a statutory body or other government agency or department in matters such as this is an issue of considerable importance about which the Attorney-General's Department has expressed considerable concern. </PARA>
<PARA> The Attorney-General's Department wrote a letter dated 1 May. I do not have the letter in front of me, but in essence it stated that departments and agencies ought to rely initially on the advice of the Attorney-General's Department, rather than on advice from outside the scope of that well-established machinery. That view was endorsed by the Audit Office itself, which in its report to the Estimates Committee said:</PARA>
<PARA>The Audit Office notes that included in the amount of legal costs by the ADC is $125,000 for legal advice obtained during the audit from barristers and solicitors. In the Audit Office's view, this expenditure was unnecessary because the ADC could have obtained legal advice from the Attorney-General's Department. The Department has advised and informed the Audit Office that it would have charged the ADC only $3,500 for the legal advice that was given and that preparation of private legal advice also caused an unnecessary delay in the audit. </PARA>
<PARA>The Attorney-General's Department has said that the ADC wasted approximately $120,000 of taxpayers' money by going outside the available legal resources of the Commonwealth and employing a private counsel whose expertise does not lie in the area relating to the investigation. I believe that is a matter of considerable concern. Would the Minister care to make any comment on that at this stage-in particular, as to whether steps have been put in train to ensure that this type of thing does not occur again?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The fact that Mr Adams apparently has a practice in the criminal jurisdiction perhaps well suited him to the task, because perhaps the Aboriginal Development Commission (ADC) felt that it was in the dock and was the accused in regard to this particular matter. However, I wish to get some facts on the record. I must admit that my understanding had been that Mr Adams had received $125,000. Apparently, that was the budget allocation made by the ADC. Indeed, the legal bills received from Mr Adams, QC, amounted only to some $51,000. That amount represents his entire bill; as far as we are aware, he will not forward any more bills in regard to the special audit. In fact, out of the allocation of money put aside, notionally $125,000, in relation to special audit legal costs in regard to Mr Adams, QC, legal bills received amounted to some $51,000.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The question of obtaining advice from outside the Attorney-General's Department is, I think, a legitimate question. Of course, the Attorney-General's Department is moving to a situation where it hopes to have considered by its legal officers the question of whether they should become more commercially oriented and go out seeking business, charging fees at market rates and getting into the marketplace in regard to the provision of legal advice even to Commonwealth authorities such as the Aboriginal Development Commission. I think that would be a more interesting test of the real comparability of the fees that might have been properly sought, or charged, by the Attorney-General's Department in regard to the same work undertaken by Mr Adams. </PARA>
<PARA> The work should not simply amount to the question of the provision of an opinion here or there, but rather to an examination of well over 100 files to see what legal questions might arise from examination of the audit of those files and to a considerable amount of research. There is much more to it than just simply providing an opinion here or there. I cannot say whether the comparability, now properly understood to be between $51,000 and $3,500, would, at the end of the day and in the real marketplace, be a real comparison. However, I believe that the Attorney-General's legal officers, the practitioners within that Department, are considering at this moment the whole question of getting into the marketplace and securing business. No doubt, if they are good at it, they will displace Mr Adams. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the Minister for that response. In the interests of time, which is getting away from us, I will not go into all the other matters that I would have otherwise raised and drawn to the Senate's attention. But I should draw the Senate's attention to the fact that Senator Tambling, Senator Michael Baume and I signed a reservation to the Estimates Committee E report because many of the issues that concerned us at the Estimates hearings in April 1989 were the very serious issues that also concerned us at the previous Estimates hearings in October 1988. Many of those issues remained unresolved. Indeed, the Australian Audit Office (AAO) special audit report had given additional cause for concern. I think that is a very serious matter. It fits in with the example and the important issue that Senator Peter Baume raised earlier in this debate about the asbestos problem for the Aboriginal community at Baryulgil. We have had dithering and lack of action for almost a decade in matters of vital concern to the well-being, health and livelihood of that particular Aboriginal community in New South Wales. But the same point applies to the advancement of the well-being of Aboriginal communities throughout Australia. Deeds and actions, not words, promises, committee reports and undertakings to follow up unresolved issues, are important in all of this. Hence there is the need to take very deep and urgent cognisance of the matters that have now been flushed out through a series of investigations and inquiries not only by the Estimates Committee but also by the Audit Office and others in recent times. It is about time we got some action.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The only part of the minority report that I wish to publicly put into the record relates to the problems that we have found evident in the Aboriginal Development Commission (ADC) board's handling of issues that come before it. The minority report said:</PARA>
<PARA>The problems evident in the ADC have been compounded by the less than responsible Board decisions which have been characterised by:</PARA>
<PARA> ignoring and acting contrary to staff advice, including legal advice;</PARA>
<PARA> decisions taken contrary to published policy and guidelines without justification or reasons being given;</PARA>
<PARA> resolutions passed without assessed written submissions or on the basis of inadequate submissions not prepared by ADC staff;</PARA>
<PARA> approving and seeking the unlawful use of public moneys;</PARA>
<PARA> dealing in situations where there has been obvious conflict of interest; and</PARA>
<PARA> acting in a manner which has resulted in the need to refer matters to the Senate Committee of Privileges. </PARA>
<PARA>Following those concerns, the minority report, in paragraph 4.1, said:</PARA>
<PARA> This low standard of conduct does not arise from any defect in the ADC Act but rather from intentionally ignoring the provisions and spirit of that Act and the responsibility which this imposes on Commissioners. </PARA>
<PARA>In that context I just say that most of the problems that we have been concerned with about the operation of the ADC Board have arisen since May 1988 when the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs, Mr Hand, sacked the previous Board and appointed his hand-picked replacements. It is since that time that most of the major concerns, that we very rightly feel, have occurred. </PARA>
<PARA> None of the criticisms that we have levelled at the Board of the ADC in any way relates to Mrs Shirley McPherson, who was the Chairman of the Board throughout that period and previously. She is a person of the highest possible integrity. The way that Shirley McPherson conducted herself before the Estimates committee, in April and especially last October, won the deepest and strongest admiration of all members of the Committee. I was very sad to see her resignation as Chairman of the Commission. I can well understand the reasons for that resignation. Indeed, only a woman of her enormous strength of character could have persisted in the environment in which she was operating over the last 12 months or more. I take this opportunity to put on the public record my deepest appreciation and regard-and I know this will be echoed by all members on this side of the Committee-for the work of Shirley McPherson as Chairman of the ADC. I hope that now that she has left that environment she will have a chance to recharge her batteries a little and be able to make a further contribution in whatever way she chooses to what has been an overriding goal for her for a long time, namely, the advancement of the Aboriginal people. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will not respond to most of the editorial colouring of Senator Short's remarks in relation to the Aboriginal Development Commission (ADC) except to take up the matter of Mrs Shirley McPherson. Obviously she is something of a heroine to Senator Short. Indeed, I can verify that she showed strength of character in coming into those Estimates committees hour after hour, day after day and in being subject to the battering which occurred there. I sat next to her on each of those occasions and I can assure honourable senators that she found the experience most unsettling. Indeed, the only reason I mention Mrs McPherson, apart from wishing her every success in the endeavours to which she now turns and hoping that she enjoys good health in her new career and time with her family, is to raise the matter of the legality of the January meeting. Honourable senators will recall that in the Estimates Committee meeting I took up, off the cuff, the Auditor-General's allegation that that meeting had been convened illegally.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I wish to indicate that in answering the questions and in making comments at that Estimates Committee hearing, I was depending on the advice from Mrs McPherson, who indicated to me the very personal reasons why she had been unable to return from Western Australia to attend a meeting on, I think, 27 January. I pointed to the terms of the Act, which made it clear that the Deputy Chairperson was entitled to convene a meeting in the absence of the Chairman. There has been a flurry of correspondence about that matter ever since. I understand that a file note of Mr J. O'Neill from the Australian Audit Office (AAO) was tabled at the Senate Estimates Committee hearing and probably formed the basis for the Senate Estimates Committee report. I note that the report concludes, in rather ambiguous language, that the legality of the meeting is still a matter of some question but I think the fair inference is that, even then, in the opinion of the Estimates Committee, it was more legal than not. However, I am authorised to say and I am advised that the Chairman of the Commission, Mrs McPherson, totally denies that she made the statements as alleged in the final note of Mr J. O'Neill from the AAO tabled at the Senate Estimates Committee hearing. </PARA>
<PARA> In the opinion of Mrs McPherson, the meeting was legally called by the Deputy Chairman. The Chairman also denies other statements as alleged in the file note. I understand that she will be writing to Mr O'Neill to that effect. I believe that a passage in the transcript of the Estimates Committee hearing required clarification. That clarification is now available from Mrs McPherson, and I believe it ought to be placed on the record. </PARA>
<PARA> The other matters raised by Senator Short were not matters of particularity so I do not feel that I need to respond, except to say that I believe that the Aboriginal Development Commission Act does have some weaknesses, in that the lines of ministerial responsibility are not as clear as they ought to be. Had the Act been drawn in a way which made clearer the responsibility of the ADC to the elected representatives of the Australian people, to the Parliament and to the Minister, perhaps there would have been a better relationship between the Parliament, the Minister and the ADC, such as would have been expressed in a supervisory role, which would have perhaps prevented the occurrence of some of the matters which have been the subject of concern. Of course, I am now referring to matters of more general policy. With regard to the matters of true concern to the Committee of the Whole, I have answered the concerns of Senator Short. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the Minister for his response. If I may say so, he is not entirely correct regarding the note for file by Mr O'Neill dated 8 February which was tabled-that is, the note for file that he was referring to. The note was not the prime reason for the view taken as to whether the 27 January meeting was illegal. The more important consideration was the examination by the Audit Office of the records of both the Minister's office and the Department, as I understand it, as was conveyed at page E220 of the transcript of the Estimates Committee hearing of 3 May, when the Committee questioned Audit Office representatives. Mr O'Neill said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>There are records we have cited showing that Mrs McPherson was on leave until 3 January. We have inquired of the Commission and of the Minister's office whether there is any record of her being on leave in a different period, and there is none. </PARA>
<PARA>One needs to interpret section 19 (2) of the Act, as to whether a meeting can be called when the Chairman is not available. The view of the Audit Office-and we agreed with it-does not accord with the proper interpretation of section 19 (2) of the Act. That is the point that needs to be considered, rather than the note for file that the Minister relies on. </PARA>
<PARA> I should also point out that this meeting on 27 January was a critically important meeting of the Aboriginal Development Commission Board because it was to consider the official response of the ADC to the very damaging report of the special audit by the Audit Office. Formal advice of that meeting was not issued until the day before-26 January. In other words, members of the Commission's Board were given formal notice of the meeting only 24 hours beforehand. As I understand it, that advice was not even conveyed to Mrs McPherson. I am not 100 per cent certain about that. Whether it was or was not is largely irrelevant. Quite clearly, in the absence of any evidence to the contrary, that meeting was convened in great haste and certainly not following any normal and due processes. That is quite extraordinary in the context of the very important subjects that that meeting was to deal with. </PARA>
<PARA> I ask my last question relating to a different subject. We have received advice, since the Estimates Committee hearings, in response to a question that Senator Tambling placed on notice, about the legal costs incurred by the Department. It has been indicated that $62,000 was required by the Department to pay certain of the legal expenses of the former Secretary, Mr Perkins. My question is: Why were those funds required? What were the legal expenses for?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I apologise to the Minister and to the Committee for backtracking at this stage. I heard the Minister give his response to Senator Peter Baume with regard to the proposed Aboriginal medical centre to service the Baryulgil communities. I also spoke with those people yesterday and they mentioned this matter to me. I heard the Minister refer to monitoring the health situation as far as the people of the Baryulgil communities are concerned by means of the Aboriginal medical centre. I ask the Minister whether he would also be prepared to take more positive steps because it is important that their health be monitored, as they are in grave danger of developing an asbestos related disease, as indeed are the non-Aboriginal managers and foremen who have now moved from that area. I believe that their driveways and some of their land was covered with tailings from the asbestos mine.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I ask the Minister whether he would be prepared to take a preventive measure. Recommendation 6 of the 1984 report Effects of Asbestos Mining on the Baryulgil Community states:</PARA>
<PARA>That the Commonwealth Minister for Aboriginal Affairs recommend to the New South Wales Government that they institute a vigorous programme to decontaminate Baryulgil Square as far as possible. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Coulter mentioned that a sample taken from the pre-school area of Baryulgil Square was examined by the Department of Occupational Health, Safety and Welfare in Western Australia and was found to be gravel which contained 10 per cent chrysotile, which is white asbestos. I believe that the whole area was covered with gravel and that the asbestos was not removed. But over time that gravel, through the elements of the weather, has moved around and the asbestos is in the top levels of the soil. Therefore, the people who live there continue to be in grave danger. So a preventive measure can be taken there. </PARA>
<PARA> These people do not want to move away. The Baryulgil area is part of their original tribal lands. They were not responsible for the Baryulgil mine being set up in 1943. They did not even have citizenship or a vote at that time. The mine was nothing to do with them. Although in 1949 a report was received in the United Kingdom Parliament which definitely linked contact with asbestos with carcinogenic diseases-that report was available in Western Australia in 1951 and, therefore, presumably, in other parts of Australia-the people still worked in those mines and lived in that area. There is a very strong responsibility on the Federal Government to take preventive measures now so that no other people can be affected. </PARA>
<PARA> Another positive measure which I ask the Minister to consider pressuring the Government to take is to contribute to the research currently being done in Western Australia by Dr Bruce Robinson and others on his team into the cure and prevention of mesothelioma in people who have been in contact with asbestos. The research program money will run out this year. People are very eager to get onto the research treatment program. It is a sort of dreadful Russian roulette. Life is being prolonged to some extent for people who get onto the treatment research program, but only one person can be treated at a time. I ask the Minister to consider very carefully whether that could be done. </PARA>

I understand that there was something in this morning's press, which I have not yet had time to read. I have not seen that article. As Senator Puplick would be aware, we have, a couple of times, deferred decisions on the National Museum of Australia and look to having it completed by the year 2000. We have done so, obviously, as part of general cost-cutting measures across government. I have said before that I do not believe that the arts, or any other area, can consider itself immune from general government policy, particularly in difficult economic times. That being the case, we deferred a decision on the National Museum of Australia. We declined to fund it now. That decision was finally taken in the 1988-89 Budget context. At the moment the Minister for the Arts, Tourism and Territories, Mr Holding, is in the process of going to Government with a plan for the National Museum of Australia. I think I mentioned that fact when Senator Peter Baume asked me a question a couple of weeks ago. That is part of Budget discussions, which of course I am not at liberty to reveal now.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Ministerial Council is doing more than commissioning further studies. The Council, which met some weeks ago, and which is composed of representatives of New South Wales, Victoria, South Australia and the Commonwealth, is a shining example of interstate and national cooperation to attack a major environmental and economic issue-the Murray-Darling Basin salinity problems-across State borders with an integrated plan to resolve the difficulties. At the Murray-Darling Basin Ministerial Council meeting four weeks ago, the Council adopted a salinity and drainage strategy for the whole of the Murray-Darling Basin. This is the first time we have had such a strategy and we are now in the implementation phase of the strategy. The strategy provides a framework for joint government action and includes expenditure by the four governments over the next three years of $29.4m on several salt interception schemes, of which the Commonwealth will contribute $7.8m. The strategy will result in a reduction of 20 per cent in the average salinity of the River Murray as measured at Morgan in South Australia and will also provide the opportunity for protecting up to half a million hectares of high value land in the Basin area. The salinity and drainage strategy is one component of the broader natural resources management strategy being developed by the Council to address a range of natural resource problems facing the Basin. We expect there to be another Council meeting, somewhere along the River Murray but in South Australia, in October or November of this year. During that Council meeting the States and the Commonwealth are committed to resolving their differences and adopting a comprehensive natural resources management strategy for the whole of the Basin area. When that is done, it will be available for public comment and will then go into an implementation phase.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As I have said, a jointly funded program of cost effective salt interception schemes to reduce River Murray salinity by up to 80 EC at Morgan in South Australia will occur. The initial program includes schemes at Woolpunda and Mallee Cliffs and the upgrading of existing schemes at Mildura, Merbein and Buronga. The Woolpunda scheme has been approved; construction has commenced and is expected to finish in 1991. An environmental impact statement for Mallee Cliffs is to be released soon for public comment. Work at Mildura, Merbein and Buronga will be completed in 1989-91. Changed operating procedures for Menindee Lakes and Lake Victoria to provide further reduction in salinity in the River Murray will occur. A number of other programs are cast broadly to involve the community in the Murray-Darling Basin area in working with the governments to implement salt reduction schemes. I must say to Senator Maguire that I am disappointed that, despite this good example of cross-political and State and Commonwealth cooperation on the Murray-Darling Basin, the Leader of the Opposition in South Australia-I think his name is Mr Olsen; he probably plays Jimmy Olsen to John Bannon's Superman-criticised the work of the Murray-Darling Basin, in a press release that he made some three weeks after the last Murray-Darling Basin meeting, as though these developments had not occurred.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The International Energy Agency (IEA) is a sub-agency of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) and it recently completed a report which we regard as an audit of Australia's energy policies. It is a sort of peer group review to see how we line up with the rest of the developed world in terms of our energy policies. Before going into the detail of the honourable senator's question, I am pleased to say that we got a very positive report from the IEA. Senator Lewis and Senator Chaney might be interested to know that, for example, on a matter that they have been pursuing recently-excise-the IEA said of our excise regime on crude oil:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In the current circumstances, excise tax on crude oil production and other taxation arrangements seem appropriate to continue encouraging exploration and development of resources.</PARA>
<PARA>That is an external unsolicited comment, and I am pleased to see that it supports some of the comments I have made in answer to questions in this chamber.</PARA>
<PARA> Let me go to the question that has been asked of me. The OECD praised our deregulation steps in terms of liquefied petroleum gas and the domestic crude oil market. It noted that protection in other countries is adverse to Australia's energy trade. In all of this positive and, indeed, glowing commentary on our energy policies there was one sour note, which was a criticism of the States of New South Wales and Queensland. If one reads the real meaning of what is the polite and formal language of international public service, one can see that it is a quite substantial criticism of those two States.</PARA>
<PARA> Some weeks back I said to the Senate that Dr Brian Galligan, a political scientist from the Australian National University, in a paper entitled Queensland Railways and Export Coal, published in the Australian Journal of Public Administration in March 1987, estimated that the rail freight surcharge for Queensland coal in 1985-86 was $354m. That is a charge that goes to the mining operations, in addition to the cost of simply transporting the coal from mine to port. The IEA criticised New South Wales, which has a similar form of charge, and Queensland and said that that was an unfair charge against the development of those coal reserves. That lends support to the comments I have been making that this is a hidden tax which the State governments use to subsidise other activities. It enables those governments to pretend that they are low taxing States, which they are not. They do not open that tax for public scrutiny, and it is a tax on exports. At a time when we are trying to maximise our export trade, it is in that context a regressive tax.</PARA>

I believe those predictions are made on the basis that the mining work force at Wittenoom in Western Australia which worked there in the 1950s and early 1960s will be likely to be in the danger period in which the symptoms of mesothelioma manifest themselves in that time frame of 1989 to 2005 to which Senator Jenkins referred.

<PARA> We are aware of the research which the honourable senator has referred to into the prevention and cure of mesothelioma.

I am advised by the Minister for Community Services and Health, Dr Blewett, that he would be happy to approve further funding if the National Health and Medical Research Council recommends that continued research warrants further funding based on the criterion of scientific merit. I understand that at the present time the Council is submitting the application of Dr Robinson and his colleagues to a peer review process. The report of that process is due mid-year, and it will be before the Minister for his consideration in October or November of this year.

I will continue to do so in spite of frivolous and, at times, cheap interjections from people like Senator Alston. I was making the point that the fact that the national accounts figures indicate very high growth in the economy between January and March does not necessarily indicate a further tightening in interest rates, as the question implied. There have been a number of other economic indicators since. For example, the fall of 11 per cent in housing finance commitments in March, making housing finance commitments 30 per cent below their peak in June 1988, suggests that overheating in the housing sector may come to an end as dwellings presently on order books are completed. There have been other indicators relating to consumption spending, such as private sector surveys, which have shown declines in consumer confidence, and lower expectations of business growth in the coming months. These indicators suggest a slowing of the economy-a slowing of demand-since the period covered by the national accounts figures. For those reasons, I answer as I did at the beginning-those implications do not follow.</PARA></TALK.START>

I am at a loss, however, to understand why the Guild Executive rejected the Government's offer at the last moment.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not know Mr Pickering personally. The first time I encountered him was when I heard him give an explanation of why New South Wales police officers shot a man in bed and shot the wrong man. It was an extraordinary explanation from a police Minister. The second time I heard of him was when he was complaining, in an attempt to boost his own image, about narcotics, when he was trying to divert blame for anything that occurred to the Australian Customs Service. That is the source of the comments which are the substance of the honourable senator's question.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In its attempts to deal with the illicit narcotics trade, the Australian Customs Service has created contraband enforcement teams in the larger Australian ports. Those teams are in keeping with the ACS corporate plan to achieve more effective control through the use of risk management techniques. That is to say, instead of trying to man the Australian seaboard with a wall-to-wall collection of Customs officers, special units have been formed to deal with contraband, particularly in relation to narcotics. These teams are small, flexible and mobile, and analyse intelligence and information to identify targets representing high risk areas. They operate in all major ports and airports and can be redeployed rapidly, including to remote areas, as risks are identified. One element of the proposed restructuring at Newcastle and Port Kembla is the removal of the midnight shift. The Australian Customs Service proposes to service the Newcastle and Port Kembla areas fully between 7 a.m. and 11 p.m., but high risk activities at any time of the day or night will be handled by the contraband enforcement teams. There will be no reduction in staff at Port Kembla as a result of the formation of the contraband enforcement teams.</PARA>
<PARA> Mr Pickering, of course, as I suggested earlier, has been waging an active media campaign over recent months, trying to present himself as a hero in the narcotics fight and criticising the Australian Customs Service in the course of that process. Over the last 12 months the ACS has made many significant drug interceptions: in March 1989, January 1989, and the largest of all, I think, in June 1988. This month the contraband enforcement teams have aided the Australian Federal Police in the interception of large hauls of heroin in Sydney.</PARA>
<PARA> Whether the number of Customs successes in these activities is indicative of the amount of drugs coming into Australia is a question which I cannot answer. However, I can answer the allegations by Mr Pickering that there has been a reduction in barrier control staffing numbers. The 1987-88 ACS annual report suggests a slight reduction in that specific area, but that has to be seen in context. In round figures, there are 1,750 Customs officers performing barrier control and passenger processing functions. These are the front line officers. They are supported by 1,250 officers working in other Customs areas of direct relevance to enforcement-namely, investigations, coastwatch and import and export control. That amounts to approximately 60 per cent of total Australian Customs Service resources, excluding computer systems personnel and so on. The allegations by Mr Pickering, on which I believe the honourable senator's question is based, really are not valid.</PARA>

Among the things that he asserts originated from the Liberal Party is the shift to smaller government. I want to make two points about that. The first is that this Liberal Party, which was allegedly committed to smaller government, produced in its final year in coalition government, as Senator Stone reminded Mr Howard shortly after the event, a Budget with a 7 1/2 per cent real growth in outlays. Outlays in this year are already lower than they were in any year of the last coalition Government. While the Liberal Party might pay lip service to smaller government, it does not have a record of practising smaller government. In an area which is under its control even in opposition, the Liberal Party is clearly moving to bigger government, not smaller government. It has just expanded its front bench. We all know why that happened. Because Mr Peacock had too many promises on which to deliver, as Senator Michael Baume pointed out at the time, he promised more front bench positions than existed. He solved that problem in two ways: he expanded the front bench and then created four or five other mickey mouse positions to add on to it.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA> When in government the Liberal Party announced in March 1981 that it was going to sell off some assets. It did not even do that. `Strengthen the family unit' was very big in the Liberal Party rhetoric. But Liberal Party performance has never matched what this Government has done in the area of income support for families; in particular, effective income support for families with family allowance supplement which provides a level of support for low income families far in excess of anything that the Liberal Party ever did. The fourth one was the deregulation of the financial market. There was again a lot of talk in the Liberal Party about deregulation of the financial market. In government, it set up the Campbell Committee of Inquiry into the Australian Financial System. Absolutely nothing happened and Mr Fraser and Mr Howard have been running around ever since blaming each other for the fact that nothing happened.</PARA>
<PARA> I have already referred to government outlays. In the area of cutting, the most notable thing in the Liberal Party's record when it was last in government was that at the beginning of one Cabinet meeting it took a decision to increase massively outlays on export development incentives and reversed that decision at the end of the Cabinet meeting. That is the biggest bit of outlays cutting that the Liberal Party ever did, if it really counts as outlays cutting.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;But I am generous in spirit in terms of the Opposition spokesman. Senator Lewis put out a press release the other day which suggested that the passenger car market was recording major growth in demand. With respect, he ought to study the figures a little better. In fact, the increase in passenger vehicle demand is up less than 7 per cent-and that is hardly major.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Only the day before yesterday, the industry put out a statement which indicates that the 1989 market for cars is softening. That again goes back to an answer I gave to Senator Knowles and to Senator Watson. It is an indicator of slowing demand in the Australian economy since the March quarter, to which the national accounts are relevant. However, the commercial vehicle market is growing very rapidly and is forecast to be up 27 per cent over the year. The sales of four-wheel drive vehicles, which are all imported, have almost doubled in the first four months of this year. That is an indication of the problem which this country has in terms of large business investment on the supply side of the Australian economy. We do not make those vehicles in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA> Senator Lewis also suggested that the price of components for the passenger motor vehicle sector would go up because of the recent fall in the value of the Australian dollar as against the United States dollar. It is true that the Australian dollar has depreciated against the US dollar; but it has hardly moved against the yen. Ninety per cent of automotive components imported into Australia come from Japan. So the argument advanced in Senator Lewis's press release, if I might say so, is based on an ignorance of the facts and is simply wrong.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4E4">Senator RICHARDSON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The honourable senator would have to agree that the last few weeks have not been Premier Gray's finest moments, and he did not add to them in the statements that he made yesterday. First off, he claimed that these areas had been added to the National Estate without Tasmanian approval. I was never aware that Tasmanian approval was required. Under the Act quite obviously any individual and any organisation can nominate. It does not require State approval. What is worse is that Mr Gray claimed at the time that he had been advised only yesterday. I thought that was a bit rich, given that I had had complaints about the Australian Heritage Commission and the notice it had given, and given that I had discussed those complaints with the Commission the best part of 12 months ago and received assurances that plenty of notice would be given.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I inquired as to what notice Premier Gray had had of those nominations. In fact, there were five areas nominated, and those nominations were the subject of correspondence between the Heritage Commission and the Premier's office on three occasions: on 2 March, 5 April and 2 May. Three times, long before the 24th of this month, when Mr Gray claimed to have been notified, and in one case almost three months earlier, Premier Gray's office had been notified. What is more, not only was his office notified, but the Premier's Department was asked to comment on the nominations. It is little wonder that no comment has been received, given that the Premier has claimed that he had no notice at all. I suggest the Premier ought to ask his Department what went wrong. I think he has other things to do at the moment and may not get the time to do that, but that is certainly something he ought to start with.</PARA>
<PARA> The comments of, I think, Mr Satchwell, which were referred to, are even more strange, if that is possible. Apparently he is worried that, as soon as areas are nominated they are protected, which of course shows his fundamental misunderstanding of the process. The reality is that anyone can nominate, but that nomination gives no protection whatsoever. After nomination there has to be, there will be and there is on every occasion a thorough and rigorous examination of the nominated areas. Only if those areas pass the test are they included on the Register of the National Estate. These areas have not even got to the stage of interim listing. So Mr Satchwell was wrong and Mr Gray was wrong. Once again, Mr Gray, in being wrong, chose to play fast and loose with the truth. That is what is becoming more and more disturbing in the Liberal Party in Tasmania, especially judging by the performance of some of its members here last night.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I preface my question to the Minister representing the Treasurer by saying that the Australian Democrats are very pleased to note that at long last the Australian Government has moved to reinstate tax effective income equalisation deposits (IEDs) for primary producers, a move which we have been urging for some years now. Will the Government consider, in the interests of equity, making tax effective income equalisation deposits available also to small business people, including particularly artisans, artists and professional sporting people, as well as primary producers?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="2846" SPEAKER="Walsh Sen The Hon P.A." NAMEID="TJ4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="WA" MINISTERIAL="FINANCE" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="TJ4">Senator WALSH</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not know how artisans got into this group. As I understand it, `artisan' is fossilised English for `tradesman' and artisans seem to be a bit out of place with professional sporting people, artists and so on, who are normally subject to a highly variable level of income, depending on how successful they have been in one year or another or whether they are still active participants as highly paid sportsmen, for example, or whether they are retired. Of course, primary producers are also subject to substantial variations in income.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The question refers to income equalisation deposits. To the best of my knowledge there has been no serious consideration of extending income equalisation deposit provisions to artists or sporting people, although in 1986 a decision was made that such people would be allowed to take advantage of the income averaging provision, which is a similar and probably more important measure. For example, the last time income equalisation deposits existed, only about 5 per cent of primary producers had taken advantage of them at any one time. The provision was there; it was not widely used.</PARA>
<PARA> The Government has decided to re-introduce IEDs for primary producers. We will not be re-introducing the flawed and rorted scheme which we inherited from the coalition Government when we last came into office, under which there was a financial incentive to use equalisation deposits, not to stabilise taxable income but to destabilise it. That was one of the rorts which were thrust upon the coalition government of the day by the rorters of the National Party. For a brief period-the only period in its history-the Liberal Party actually had the courage to stand up to the rorters of the National Party-that was during the final months of John Howard's leadership; regrettably it probably helped bring him down. Now the rorters are right back there running the coalition in opposition as they will run the coalition in government should it ever be returned to government. We certainly will not be introducing that sort of income equalisation deposit for anybody. When Senator Stone was Secretary to the Treasury he addressed an Agricultural Outlook Conference in 1981 at which he publicly described IEDs in these terms: `Heads, farmers win; tails, all other taxpayers lose'. We will not be doing that sort of thing.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator GARETH EVANS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Australian Government has very much welcomed the strong and balanced improvement in East-West relations generally in recent years and the unprecedented opportunities that have emerged from this to decisively reduce military competition and to build in its place a constructive and cooperative set of relationships. We have been among the foremost of those who have recognised the enormous potential for positive change in the Soviet Union's program of internal reform and the supportive new thinking going with it on foreign and defence policy. We have taken the view that assessment of these changes should be based on deeds rather than words. Equally, the Government has long articulated the view that the West should take full advantage of the opportunities emerging from the process of change in the USSR.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As a result we have given full recognition to Soviet deeds, particularly to unilateral reductions in conventional forces that were announced by President Gorbachev last December. We consider the negotiations on conventional armed forces in Europe to be of central importance as they go to the heart of the whole postwar East-West conflict. The Government has been encouraged by the closeness of the opening of the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO) and Warsaw Pact positions in March this year even though the Pact position was more generally stated than that of NATO. The more detailed Warsaw Pact proposal that has been revealed this week confirms a very promising convergence of negotiating positions, particularly on tanks and armoured personnel carriers, two of the categories of special concern to NATO.</PARA>
<PARA> The latest Soviet proposal is quite complex but can be summarised in three sentences. Firstly, it has matched NATO reduction targets on tanks and armoured personnel carriers and has come close on artillery. Secondly, it proposes, in addition, radical reductions in troop numbers, combat aircraft and helicopters, whereas NATO has not proposed specific cuts in these categories. Thirdly, it has responded with counter-proposals on the proportion of total forces that can come from one country and the proportion of total forces that can be stationed in foreign countries. In the Australian Government's view the large and broad cuts that the USSR is now prepared to contemplate in its conventional posture in eastern Europe and European USSR is perhaps the most decisive indication that we have received to date that the new thinking is taking a firm root in the Soviet Union. We do not understate the difficulties remaining and the long course of negotiations that obviously still lie ahead.</PARA>
<PARA> Finally, as to the implications of all this for the Asia-Pacific region, we obviously attach importance to preserving and enhancing the security environment in this region. It is very different from and in many ways even more complicated than Europe from the standpoint of pursuing arms control arrangements. Security here has been enhanced by the varying degrees of progress that have been made towards the peaceful resolution of regional conflicts and points of tension-Afghanistan, Cambodia and the Korean Peninsula. Nearly two years ago this Government advocated greater transparency on force levels and doctrines in the North Pacific as well as United States-USSR military dialogue on security perceptions and concerns in this area. We will continue to advance proposals and suggestions of this kind if they are likely to prove helpful.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RF4">Senator COOK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 24 May Senator Watson asked me a question in my representational role of Minister representing the Minister for Community Services and Health. I am in a position to answer that question now. At the outset, it is necessary to make it clear that the drug Pantheline is not one affected by the Government's generic pricing policy. This drug is unavailable because the manufacturer has decided not to release further batches as it was unable to comply with revised standards for quality control set by the Department of Community Services and Health. Having given the manufacturer a reasonable period to overcome the problem, the Department has recently arranged for an alternative brand to be listed on the pharmaceutical benefits schedule (PBS). This alternative product will be available with the next reprinting of the PBS effective from 1 August 1989.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Calmazine was the alternative brand of trifluoperazine that remained as a pharmaceutical benefit following the delisting of the major brand Stelazine. Stelazine was delisted on 1 April as part of the Government's generic pricing policy. Protea, the supplier of Calmazine, has been contacted to ascertain the current supply position. Protea maintains that supplies are available and at no stage was Calmazine out of stock. Further, the company has advised that there is no wholesaler awaiting stock. In any event, the two-milligram strength Stelazine tablet is still a PBS item.</PARA>
<PARA> The Department of Community Services and Health has been monitoring the stockholding of this and other products which have remained listed following the delisting of a number of major brands on 1 April 1989. This monitoring confirms that stocks of Calmazine are available. In addition the Department has not received any complaints from wholesalers who undertook to advise the Department should supply difficulties arise.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Senate is debating a package of Bills dealing with the horticultural industry at a time when the Treasurer (Mr Keating) has left this country to visit the Soviet Union to examine the art and architecture of the First Empire and at a time when the Reserve Bank of Australia has signalled that it is tightening monetary policy. It is a time when the Government is likely to be forced to tighten monetary policy further and a time when home mortgage interest rates are reaching a record level of 16.5 per cent and will possibly go to 17 per cent. As Mr Geoff Kitney in the Australian Financial Review of today said in summing up the national accounts figures which were released:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In fact, the national accounts figures were virtually a mirror image of the economic picture the Government has been attempting to draw. All the rises are where the falls should be and the falls are where the rises should be. </PARA>
<PARA>During the debate in this chamber in the last couple of days, the Government has been endeavouring to present to the people of Australia the complete reverse of the state of this economy as revealed by yesterday's national accounts figures. Meanwhile the Senate presses on trying to deal with legislation while the economy collapses in ruins around us. </PARA>
<PARA> The debate on the Horticultural Legislation Amendment Bill 1989, the Horticultural Levy Amendment Bill 1989 and the Horticultural Export Charge Amendment Bill 1989 gives me the opportunity to demonstrate that free enterprise is alive and flourishing despite the Hawke Government, a government that has created a dangerously overheated economy, an economy bleeding from the jugular vein. It is so overheated that, as I said, the Government is tightening monetary policy further and forcing interest rates even higher while the Treasurer slips away overseas to look at some lovely art and architecture in Leningrad. Those interest rises will hurt the entrepreneurs in the horticultural industry because they need to borrow funds to further expand, especially to expand their export opportunities. </PARA>
<PARA> The horticultural industry is essentially a free enterprise industry which comprises largely many small business people. It has the capacity to be a major export earner for this country from a relatively nominal capital base. Between 1986 and 1988 the export of grapes has grown from $16m to $38m. The export of fruit and nuts has grown from $128m to $154m. The export of plant seeds, flowers and bulbs, and live plants, has grown by an additional $2m. The export of cut flowers has grown from $5.5m to nearly $11.5m-over double. The total value of horticultural products exported from Australia has gone from $199m to $262m in two years. That is a substantial growth of which this country can be proud. But the potential for growth in this industry is absolutely enormous, and we should be doing more to assist this industry to become the major export earner that it could be. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government believes that this package of Bills will provide an incentive to those organisations which remain outside the embrace of the Australian Horticultural Corporation which was established in 1987 to join that Corporation. In fact, only the Australian Apple and Pear Corporation and the citrus industries were the original participants. Other horticultural industries fought shy of joining, despite financial incentives from the Government in the form of dollar for dollar funding to those industries joining the Horticultural Research and Development Corporation. Some industries which might have joined recognised that the legislation made it uneconomical or impossible for them to join because of the way the levies and charges are paid. Others were wary of the bureaucratic constraints they could be exposed to. Their wariness was justified. The cost of collecting an estimated $600,000 in citrus levies per annum is about $122,000. This legislation proposes changes that will allow State bodies to collect the levies for the Commonwealth and that cost is estimated to be about $5,000 or, in the worst case, up to $20,000. The levy is to be increased from 2 per cent to a maximum rate of 5 per cent. With inflation running at somewhere between 8 and 10 per cent under the Hawke Government the trend is to impose the maximum levy to avoid the changes and amending legislation that would otherwise be necessary to keep up with inflation. </PARA>
<PARA> The nursery industry has already reached agreement with pot manufacturers to have the levy collected on the pots at the time of purchase, and these Bills will permit this. The Opposition applauds this as a sensible move. Other industries may prefer to pay their levy when they buy the trays they pack their fruit on. The horticultural industry now has the flexibility to allow economical collection of the levy to suit the producer, and levy collection costs should no longer be a barrier to organisations joining the corporations. The fact that more organisations have not displayed an interest in joining the corporations raises concerns about whether the levy difficulties were the sole barrier. </PARA>
<PARA> The growth of exports between 1986 and 1988 suggests that private enterprise flourishes best without bureaucratic oversight or constraints. I have previously drawn to the attention of this chamber and the Minister the bureaucratic difficulties experienced by horticulturalists in export inspection charges. That experience would be enough to keep many organisations away from any avoidable contact this bureaucracy. The Government should look to its bureaucratic practices and to its Business Regulation Review Unit, which we referred to during Question Time. </PARA>
<PARA> As I said before, next week the Government is to come up with a so-called micro-economic reform package. We can predict today what it will be. It will do away with the Industries Assistance Commission. It will do away with the Business Regulation Review Unit. It will combine them in a so-called Industry Reform Commission, which is like reorganising the chairs on the Titanic. Instead of addressing micro-economic reform measures, which the Government should be doing, it is reorganising the organisations which report to the Government about micro-economic reform. The Government should look to its bureaucratic practices for the reasons why in this industry organisations are staying away from these corporations. The Opposition does not oppose the legislation, but has reservations about the effectiveness of the corporations and the low number of organisations joining them. The corporations and their effectiveness will be reviewed as soon as we get into office. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On behalf of the Australian Democrats I express support for this package of horticultural legislation, the Democrats having supported the initial establishment of the horticultural corporations. I note that this package means that the nursery industry becomes the third product group to join the horticultural corporations after the apple and pear industry and the citrus industry, which came in when the corporations were formed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I rise to make a couple of comments specifically arising out of a concern which the Nursery Industry Association of Australia has conveyed to us. First, though, I acknowledge, as does the Nursery Industry Association, that it has had extensive participation in the development of this package of legislation. It has been closely involved in drafting the legislation and it supports its enactment. However, the Association's concern is that it believed that some funds would be made available for its use during the 1989-90 year while the levy funds established by this legislation were accumulating. The Association conveyed to me that it has now been made aware of a call for applications for funding. The industry is in the process of preparing a list of industry research priorities, having conducted an Australia-wide consultation. It is therefore not in a position during the first year to apply for specific project funding since its priorities are still in the process of being established. It had thought that funding would be available on a general basis in the first year of establishment. It is concerned about what it calls an oversight, and is disappointed in view of the fact that it has had extensive involvement in the development of the legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> It indicates, at least at this point, a breakdown in what appear to have been very useful and valuable communications and consultations. I simply put on record the Nursery Industry Association's concern and its disappointment and call on the Government to look again at what appears to be a call for funding for specific projects. Perhaps the Government will allow funding on a more general basis in the interim year while the levy funds established by the legislation are put in place. </PARA>
<PARA> I endorse those remarks of Senator Lewis which refer to the tremendous potential in the horticultural industry for development of exports to the benefit of our national economy. We have often made that point in debates relevant to this industry. I simply reiterate another point that we have made quite readily; that is, that within the horticulture industry perhaps the most exciting avenue open to us in terms of export development and growth is in clean horticultural products. The Northern Hemisphere, in particular, is crying out for chemical-free food produce. The concerns of consumers around the world about their health and the environmental degradation of which chemicals use is a part are now very prominent. Indeed, if Australia does not back moves which are very strongly afoot in this country to develop clean and sustainable agriculture, we will miss out on a very important export opportunity, especially since our New Zealand neighbours are very well advanced in the establishment of standards and in the assistance and support provided to industry for the export of clean food products. The demand is there. The Federal Government must do more than it has done so far. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Kerin) has made a commitment and some action has been taken. At the Australia-New Zealand Ecological Agriculture Conference in Brisbane in February, at which I was present, the Minister said that the Government recognised this market opportunity and urged the industry to take up the opportunities. The Australian Democrats say that the Government must support industry in doing this and, at the very least, some of the Government support for research and development of the industry which currently goes to conventional and in some cases very heavy chemically involved practices should be diverted to those areas which are currently trying to develop without very much government or established support. The Democrats support this legislation and look forward to further encouraging developments in the horticultural industry. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Senate has before it a Bill for an Act to amend the Air Navigation Act 1920. This is a simple Bill because it seeks to alter section 13 of the Air Navigation Act of 1920 by inserting the word `vary' after `may'. The Senate would be aware that there are reciprocal agreements in relation to traffic rights for international airlines operating into and out of Australia. Under the Air Navigation Act the only power that the Government has with one of its signatories to traffic rights within Australia is to cancel the licence. There is no flexibility in the arrangements that exist at present to allow the Minister to do anything other than that. If there is a dispute or disagreement with the airlines of another country coming to Australia, there is no facility for them to be censured in any way other than the cancellation of their licence. That is a very extreme step and it may well make the problem worse. The amendment to section 13 by adding the word `vary' after `may' allows the Minister a range of options. It allows the Minister to vary the number of flights, the type of aircraft being used and, therefore, the capacity, and even the routing system that is applied to those aircraft coming into Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Government's amendment has become necessary because other countries have taken action in reaction to Australia's positions or actions in the past or things that Australia's national carrier, Qantas Airways Ltd, has done. The Opposition will support the amendment to the Air Navigation Amendment Bill because we see it as necessary. Consequential on the passing of this legislation, changes will be required to air navigation regulations 106b and 106c. Air navigation regulation 106b relates to timetables and 106c relates to the suspension and cancellation of approvals. </PARA>
<PARA> Since this Bill deals with international air travel I wish to take about three minutes of the Senate's time to touch on a few points about international aviation and its importance to this country. Our national economy is increasingly dependent on the profits from tourism. We have only one national carrier in the international field, that is, Qantas. Mr Acting Deputy President, you would be aware that Qantas is in quite a lot of trouble at present and a large part of that stems from Qantas's mismanagement. I have referred in previous speeches in this chamber to the absolutely inexcusable politicisation of the Board of Qantas. One-third of the members of the Board are political hacks. Their only attribute is the fact that they are loyal members of the Australian Labor Party. We simply cannot run a business as cut throat as an international airline, where we are up against some of the best businessmen in the world, with one-third of the Board of management composed of people who simply have no commercial experience or ability whatsoever. That is an enormous liability for Qantas to carry. </PARA>
<PARA> As a consequence, we are seeing Qantas's inability to compete successfully in the expanded market that is now available in Australia. We are seeing the exportation of jobs which should be done in Australia, such as the maintenance of aircraft. Qantas has contracted tens of millions of dollars of maintenance work to a whole range of overseas airlines, from United Airlines in America through to Aer Lingus Airlines, KLM Royal Dutch Airlines and Air France in Europe, simply because of the short-sighted management practices of Qantas. It has not trained enough engineers and pilots. The Royal Australian Air Force has been denuded of over 300 pilots, a large number of whom have gone to Qantas. It is reasonable to criticise Qantas's management for not seeing that it has an essential interest in running its own training programs for pilots and engineers, without which the airline cannot survive. The airline is certainly large enough to do its own in-house training. </PARA>
<PARA> Another of Qantas's management problems is the way it has dithered about moving out of the Sydney maintenance area. As we all know, the Sydney airfield is now more or less fully expanded; there is simply not enough room to expand. Qantas is virtually doubling its airline fleet and it has a requirement for new overhaul facilities. Again, that has been apparent for years. I think it was in 1982 that I first put publicly the proposition that Qantas should move some of its maintenance facilities for the new aircraft coming in, such as the 767 fleet, to Brisbane, where there is plenty of land and, most importantly, labour is available. One of the great problems with Sydney is not only the shortage of land but also the difficulty of getting suitably qualified people to work there. Because of the very high cost of real estate and the huge distance that people have to travel if they are employed in Sydney, it is very difficult for any company in any field of activity to transfer people in from outside to work in the Sydney environment. There is no prospect of that easing in the future; it will just get worse. </PARA>
<PARA> I am reliably informed that, having dithered over this for nearly six or eight years, Qantas has now been directed by the Government, in another piece of pork barrelling, to create its new maintenance facilities in Melbourne. This present Labor Government imagines that there is some political advantage in seeing a Qantas facility developed there. It is the old story of looking after political interests instead of economic interests. In this case a national economic interest is being prostituted by people in this Government leaning on their mates on the Board of Qantas. </PARA>
<PARA> I have referred in previous speeches to the difficulty Qantas faces with its undercapitalisation and to numerous statements by the Chairman of Qantas, who is a very competent businessman, that the preferred debt to equity ratio of 70:30 simply cannot be maintained with the huge capital needs that the airline faces in the future. The only way the future of Qantas can be guaranteed is for the Government to accept the Liberal-National Party proposal and privatise it. The days are long past when this Government can go to the Australian taxpayer and raise the hundreds, if not billions, of dollars needed to shore up both Qantas and Australian Airlines. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the problems that this Government has manifested in relation to the whole of the airline industry is that it has seen the industry as a taxing base and has done nothing about the infrastructure and the maintenance of that infrastructure, which is so vital not only for our own airlines but also for overseas airlines coming in to the country. It is absolutely absurd for international airlines-and by definition that means that the crews have limited and sometimes no knowledge of local conditions-to operate into an airport such as the one at Cairns without the provision of terminal radar. Those are not even Third World standards. The climatic conditions in Cairns are often bad. It has a high rainfall and it is surrounded by hills and mountains which are in close proximity to the airfield. Yet this Government has fiddled and diddled around and done nothing for the six years it has been in office, and in that time Cairns has expanded into one of the busiest airports in Australia. In the next 12 months it will overtake the Gold Coast airport and probably move into fourth or fifth position in Australia in respect of traffic density. </PARA>
<PARA> We have heard all the arguments in this chamber about the inadequacy of Adelaide and Melbourne radar. Again, this Government has done nothing to support the infrastructure for the airways of the country. Although the radar system in Melbourne is a new system it is simply the wrong system for terminal radar. It is an en route radar. It is not a matter of tuning the software program, as various Labor Party Ministers have sought to convince the Australian community; it is a matter of throwing it out and buying something that is appropriate. Needless to say, the Government has gone ahead and bought the same sort of system for Adelaide and I believe that it proposes to install the same system in Perth. </PARA>
<PARA> The provision of the infrastructure required for safe operation just cannot be avoided. This is one of the obligations that this Government just has not picked up. It amuses me to hear Government speakers in this place and in the other place bleating about Australia's brilliant safety record in the air. They simply do not understand how safety in air operations is assured. They do not understand the fundamentals. They do not know how we got to the position of having safe operations in this country. More importantly, they do not understand the dramatic erosion in air safety that has taken place in the six years of this Government. </PARA>
<PARA> The incident we heard about on the news last night of an Australian Airlines Boeing 737 mistaking the Bruce Highway for the Mackay Airport in bad weather is proof of what I am saying. Nothing has been done to Mackay in the last six years, although it, along with Cairns and the Gold Coast, has expanded enormously with the increase in tourist traffic. Mackay is not an all-weather airport; like Cairns, it is subject to bad tropical low pressure systems. </PARA>
<PARA> There is not a word out of this Government about the need to address housekeeping issues that are fundamental to the maintenance of our safe air navigation record, which is now being very considerably eroded. I do not propose to take the time of the Senate any longer on this Bill, and on behalf of the Opposition I wish it a speedy passage. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1"> -For some time now I have been asking Senator Richardson questions about the validity of the assessment of future mining proposals for Christmas Island. During that time, I believe Senator Richardson has misled the Senate three if not four times. This is getting to a very serious stage. Even more serious is the fact that it belies the fact that a department is so contemptuous of ministerial authority that it is prepared to allow its Minister to mislead Parliament blatantly. I have given the Government every opportunity to acknowledge what the Opposition has been saying for two years, that is, that the external territories bureaucracy has been pursuing its own agenda for Christmas Island. I want Senator Richardson to acknowledge that his Department has been playing him off a break. So far he has apologised for only one point, which he has described as minor, although I acknowledge that he has frozen the signing of any contracts and has arranged a meeting to examine the claims of unsuccessful companies.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> However, Senator Richardson has so far failed to acknowledge his other misleadings of Parliament. More importantly, by failing to do so he has failed to acknowledge, let alone appreciate, the full extent of maladministration in his Department. I am therefore bound to pursue this issue. To understand these issues properly we must look at some recent history. On one hand we have the Chinese-Malay workers led by Gordon Bennett, the Secretary of the Union of Christmas Island Workers, and on the other hand we have the Australian bureaucracy, which is trying to run Christmas Island from Canberra. In the last two years the struggle between these two parties has seen the sacking of the Christmas Island Assembly, a democratically elected body; the shutdown of the phosphate mining operations; and moves to depopulate the island by such means as massive rent increases and the discouraging and retarding of development. On 3 November 1987 the Government dismissed the new and democratically elected Christmas Island Assembly for being unwilling or unable to balance the budget of the Christmas Island Service Corporation (CISC). I seek leave to table the relevant minute. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Assembly had projected a $2.6m deficit for 1987-88, which it tried to revise to a $41,000 surplus. This was following a $1.65m surplus for 1985-86 and a $336,000 deficit in 1986-87. Significantly, a minute to the new Minister for the Arts, Tourism and Territories, Mr Holding, from his Department in December 1988 contradicted the Government's excuse for sacking the Assembly. Incredibly it says:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>It would be unfair to blame the Assembly entirely for the financial malaise of the Christmas Island Services Corporation, and, indeed, they instigated a round of redundancies with UCIW support . . . </PARA>
<PARA>More significantly, this minute said that the Assembly `asked the Government for support and we provided them with accountancy support and management and a local government consultancy'. This totally contradicts the statement in the Government's media kit issued by Senator Richardson at the time of the Assembly's sacking which said that the Assembly did not seek the assistance of the Department in overcoming this problem. I have already tabled that minute. The minute also reveals that under Government control the projected CISC deficit for 1988-89 was revised from a deficit of $2.6m to a $41,000 surplus. Under the Government's control the deficit figure blew out to $7.245m. This is a shocking indictment on Senator Richardson and other external territory Ministers. In fact, one should ask why the Assembly got the chop for being on the verge of going broke when the record showed that they were far better financial managers than were Senator Richardson and his Department. It could be construed that the Assembly's sacking was nothing more than the means of silencing opposition to mine closure and to depopulation of the island, for it was only a week later, on 11 November 1987, that the Government announced a shut-down of mining-a black day for all Christmas Islanders. The Government cited industrial disputation by the Union of Christmas Island Workers as a major reason for the closure. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr John Brown, the then Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories, on his visit to the island in early September 1987, told the Union of Christmas Island Workers to lift its bans or the mine would close. On 16 September he issued a press release indicating that if the bans were lifted, there would be work for 300 miners for a further 2 1/2 years. In fact, these bans were lifted after Mr Brown's visit to the island and before the Minister issued his press release. Yet the Government dis- honoured its promise and went ahead with the close-down of mining on 11 November 1987. </PARA>
<PARA> When the Hawke Government came to power in 1983 there were 3,000 people on Christmas Island. Now, only 1,000 remain. For two years the Opposition has warned successive Territories Ministers that the Territory bureaucracy was running its own policy on Christmas Island. However, despite this warning, the Government and its Ministers have invariably refused to listen. Mr Brown was manipulated by his Department because of his own lack of interest; Mr Punch was manipulated because of his naivety. </PARA>
<PARA> In March of this year the Federal Court handed down a decision on a challenge by Century Metals and Mining to have the decision on a successor operator reviewed. The challenge failed on legal grounds, but pointedly, the court said its decision did not reflect any view it had on the correctness of the assessment. Indeed, the court took the extraordinary step of finding that successive Ministers and their advisers were `not above criticism'. It found the whole decision-making process on a successor operation to have been, `essentially political'. It also found the assessment's characterisation as independent `a tactic redolent of Sir Humphrey Appleby'. Let me tell Senator Richardson that that is scathing criticism of his Department, not by the Opposition but by a Federal court. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="YE4">Senator BOSWELL</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Incidentally, the minute this challenge failed, Senator Richardson's Department sent in the rent collectors and threatened to sue the islanders if they did not meet the back rents. What makes the Federal Court's criticism of Mr Punch even more damning is that, throughout his time as Minister, the Opposition had constantly told him where his Department had been misinforming him. A prime example of this was the appointment of Mr Yeomans, the liquidator of the Government's phosphate mining corporation, who was appointed to assess mining proposals. Prior to his appointment, the Opposition told Mr Punch that the assessment should be done by private consultants and it warned that there may be problems with Mr Yeomans's suitability. Significantly, the Federal Court found that, from the Department, Mr Yeomans had formed an unfavourable view of Mr Bennett and his union and that, contrary to his affidavit evidence, Mr Yeomans did criticise Century's involvement with the Union of Christmas Island Workers well before his assessment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I now wish to examine the process leading up to Mr Yeomans's assessment. Following the shutdown of mining, several private groups expressed interest in continuing mining on a smaller scale. As a result of pressure, Mr Punch decided to conduct the so-called `independent' assessment of these proposals. There were three major contenders-Century Metals and Mining; Elders Resources; and a consortium headed by Mr J. G. Booth. Mr Yeomans's assessment recommended Elders Resources, a company that originally did not propose any islander equity participation and a minimum of islander worker participation. Not only were the worker participation and equity aspects of other mining submissions superior but also one was superior in terms of higher royalties to the Commonwealth and its commitment to the environment. Let me make it quite clear: I am not alleging any impropriety by Elders. However, the assessor, Mr Yeomans chose its proposal over two others, one of which, on current market prices would have offered 30 to 100 per cent more in royalties. </PARA>
<PARA> I now come to where Senator Richardson has misled the Senate three, if not four, times over this assessment of mining proposals. In March this year I asked on notice whether the assessor had recommended the proposals which best maximised returns to the Commonwealth in terms of both net payments and royalties. In answer, Senator Richardson said that the liquidator had indeed done so. He stood by this in answering a question without notice in the Senate on 3 May. The facts are that both Booth and Elders offered a net payment of $500,000 for the assets of the Phosphate Mining Christmas Island Corporation. However, on the question of royalties, Mr Yeomans's assessment itself acknowledged that the Booth proposal offered slightly higher royalty payments.</PARA>
<PARA> In the Senate on 5 May, when I challenged Senator Richardson on these answers, he insisted that Elders' proposal did maximise returns to the Commonwealth because it also offered rehabilitation to the value of $1 per tonne, and that this offset Booth's superiority on royalties. The Minister was relying on a departmental brief and I believe that this brief was wrong. </PARA>
<PARA> On 8 May I asked Senator Richardson how he could say this when the assessor had made no comparison on the basis of rehabilitation and Booth had in any case assumed an open-ended responsibility to rehabilitate all mined areas. On 9 May, Senator Richardson begrudgingly apologised and admitted that rehabilitation was indeed not relevant to the assessment and should not have been used in commenting on the original proposal. He even conceded that the Booth proposal might be a few hundred thousand dollars better in terms of royalties over 18 years. But this was a very selective apology and, indeed, the Minister went on to compound this misleading. This time he asserted that it was Elders' superiority in financial resources and other matters going to capacity to pay which offset Booth's edge on royalties. </PARA>
<PARA> There are grave problems with his latest explanation. Firstly, the assessor himself acknowledged that Booth's price estimates were conservative, and that Booth's proposal was still slightly superior to Elders on royalties. Elders were offering a fixed $1.70 per tonne royalty whereas Booth was offering a 5 per cent indexed rate. Secondly, and more importantly, Mr Yeomans's assessment compared Booth's proposal on royalties with the better, rather than the worst, of basically two Elders' options. </PARA>
<PARA> Elders was proposing two possible options with two possible variations. One option was for stockpile removal only, while the other involved utilisation of cleared areas as well as stockpiles. The amount of phosphate shipped again depended on whether it was upgraded by washing `B' grade phosphate into `A' grade. Elders' proposal thus stated that it was going to ship anything from 300,000 to 450,000 tonnes of product a year. </PARA>
<PARA> Obviously, the option and variation ultimately used would have a profound effect on the amount of royalty the Government could expect to receive. While Elders' proposal would have returned no more than $11.5m, this may have been as little as $7m, depending on the option it used-a difference of nearly $5m. How could the assessor justify an uneven and arbitrary comparison of Booth's proposal with the best Elders' contingency when there was no assurance what option Elders would pursue?</PARA>
<PARA> The Booth proposal, as acknowledged by the assessor, conservatively yielded $11.7m in royalties. Even in terms of the assessment, the Booth proposal could yield up to $5m more in royalties and, on current market prices, up to $7.5m better. What makes this look worse is that at the recent Senate Estimates hearing I asked the Department of the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories whether Mr Yeomans ever tried to get Elders to change its flat rate royalty offer in an effort to negotiate a selling price figure. In other words-did Mr Yeomans ever try to get Elders to change its royalties offer to make it more like Booth's offer, which was indexed to selling price? The answer I received was yes, this was tried seven times. A number of meetings were called to try to get a change to the Booth proposal, not once, but seven times. </PARA>
<PARA> The third problem with Senator Richardson's latest justification of Mr Yeomans's assessment is that it overlooked Booth's open-ended offer to rehabilitate all mined areas, based on a negotiated rehabilitation program. This made it superior to Elders' rehabilitation proposal, which was limited to $1 per tonne. In the likely event that the rehabilitation costs exceeded $1 per tonne, Booth's proposal guaranteed a high standard of rehabilitation. On top of this, Booth has also complied with Mr Punch's advice to the assessor about employment preference for Christmas Islanders. </PARA>
<PARA> Thus in three areas-royalties, environment, and equity and employment for islanders-Booth was superior. Yet the Minister has been insisting that the Elders' proposal maximised potential returns. He has also been insisting that, in recommending Elders, Mr Yeomans acted in accord with the advice of the Attorney-General (Mr Lionel Bowen) that he could determine which proposal maximised returns to the Commonwealth, but could not be concerned with the viability of proposals, except where this might go to the capacity to pay. This is another aspect of Senator Richardson's repeated misleading. Every time he has claimed that Elders maximised returns to the Commonwealth, he has also claimed that the assessor acted in accord with the Attorney-General's advice. </PARA>
<PARA> I am at a loss. Surely, capacity to pay is a question of threshold rather than degree, otherwise every big company would win contracts on size rather than on capacity to perform the work or pay. The assessment itself acknowledged that the companies in the Booth consortium were experienced in mining and, viewed collectively, were companies of substance. Did not the Booth consortium therefore satisfy the capacity-to-pay criterion?</PARA>
<PARA> Senator Richardson will have to put down some type of statement; otherwise he will be judged as either complacent in his misleading of Parliament or incompetent and unable to run a department which administers territories. If he cannot explain his statements, he must investigate the reasons for the assessment's miscarriage, explain why he and his junior Ministers have allowed such a miscarriage to occur, and tell us what his Government will do to put its administration of external territories on a proper footing. </PARA>
<PARA> Over the last two years we have seen maladministration of Christmas Island. We have seen persecution of Christmas Islanders. We have seen jobs being shut out. We have seen their elected assemblies closed down. We have seen rents being hiked up beyond a capacity to pay-by 150 per cent on some occasions. We have seen everything done to depopulate those islands without care or concern for Christmas Islanders. If Senator Richardson wants to do this he should at least be open and honest by telling them that they have to get off the island. He should not keep using guerilla tactics against them. He should give them a chance to exist. It is their homeland. He would not allow a mining proposal to go to the Christmas Islanders because it contained islander equity and a proposal for the employment of 70 islanders. He gave it to another company that proposed to fly people in and out on a 14-day working shift, working 12 hours a day, and which did not propose to employ any islanders, or a minimum of islanders. Everything that the Minister's Department has done over the last two years has been to the detriment of Christmas Islanders. I now seek an explanation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;God forbid that Senator Boswell would ever be a streaker! Looking at Christmas Island today I would have to acknowledge immediately that it is an island that has faced, and will continue to face, some serious difficulties. It is not the first isolated mining community that, after a mine has come to the end of its life, has faced those difficulties. It is 2,600 kilometres from the nearest major city. It has, admittedly, spectacular flora and fauna and some magnificent rainforest but its soils are poor and the rainfall is very slight. In a couple of recent years rainfall has been below average. It has no beaches. So its attractions to those outside, especially as the ore deposit is diminished and depleted, are very small indeed. Christmas Island began its life as a phosphate mine near the end of the last century-1887 is a date that comes to mind. From that time until the mid-1970s it operated as a colonial outpost. Marg Neale, a former resident of Christmas Island, wrote a book, which was launched by Mr Holding, in which she said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>In Australia at the time the political cry was `It's time for a change' and the public issues of the day revolved around racial equality, wage justice, conservation and environmental protection. These sentiments echoed resoundingly at the polls with the election of the Labor Government in 1972. Meanwhile, in this part of Australia, guest labour was still imported from Asia on $1.20 per day, no unions existed, and mining went on relatively unchecked in the unique rainforest and nesting habitats of many rare and endangered species. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;If I had a month I would not be able to explain anything to Senator Boswell. As I said, Senator Boswell is very slow on the uptake. Australia assumed sovereignty for Christmas Island in 1958. (Quorum formed) As I was saying before the quorum was called, since Australia resumed responsibility for the island in 1958, a succession of Ministers managed to ignore totally the plight of the islanders. If one looks at the list of those Ministers who ignored the plight of the Islanders, it is not a bad little list. Mr MacKellar, Mr Peacock, Mr Wilson, Mr Ellicott and Mr McVeigh all failed to come to grips with what was going on in Christmas Island. But I will at least give Mr Ellicott the credit for setting up an inquiry into what was happening on Christmas Island; at least he was concerned enough to do that. We had the Sweetland Commission of Inquiry into the Viability of the Christmas Island Phosphate Industry. The difficulty was that, having set up the inquiry, the Fraser Government chose to ignore its findings and implemented none of its recommendations. As usual, it was left to a Labor government to clean up the mess. Since we came into office, that is exactly what we have attempted to do on Christmas Island.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In 1984, the then Minister for Territories and Local Government, Mr Tom Uren, announced a package of measures to bring Christmas Island into line with mainland Australia. That meant normal social security and health benefits to Christmas Islanders; wage rates were to be determined applying the same principles as applied generally to Australian wage earners; the Government owned mining company, the Phosphate Mining Co. of Christmas Island Ltd, would shed many of its non-mining functions; local government would be introduced and municipal charges would apply. </PARA>
<PARA> It is interesting to note that those in the Opposition who continually preach the doctrine of user pays being the only way for us to go in the future always seem to balk when any user has to pay. While the Union of Christmas Island Workers was formed and became very active in only comparatively recent times, it got the Christmas Island workers' conditions way in front of those on the mainland and they were enjoying subsidies available to no-one on the mainland. The Government simply sought to rationalise that situation. </PARA>
<PARA> There has never been a policy of the Government to depopulate the island. But it must be remembered that to close a mine which has operated on the scale that this mine had-quite obviously, it was the major employer and the only possible major employer on the island-and replace it with an operation that will employ fewer people-this operation, from memory, will employ less than 100 people when it recommences-obviously is not the answer. One cannot sustain all of the Islanders on such a reduced operation. There is no great secret about that. Obviously, when the phosphate runs out, there will be problems for the island. To try to deny that is just nonsense. </PARA>
<PARA> The question that follows is: What do we do about it? It should be mentioned here that a lease for the resort casino site was signed last week while my colleague, the Minister for the Arts, Tourism and Territories, Mr Holding, was visiting the island. The project is on schedule. It has a June-July this year commencement date so it will commence in the next few months, and we look forward confidently to the opening of the resort casino towards the end of next year. That casino will employ about 100 people during the construction phase. It will employ a couple of hundred people during its operating phase. The Minister for Employment and Education Services, Mr Duncan, has taken an active interest in the Christmas Islanders and their plight and is making sure that there are training programs available to ensure that they get the great bulk of those jobs. Again, that is the proper thing for this Government to do.</PARA>
<PARA> Currently about 10 organisations are interested in refurbishing the existing accommodation on the island and, hopefully, that will commence soon. In addition there will be associated resort activities which will employ more people, such as game fishing, scuba diving, and nature walks; and there will be more restaurants and shops, and so on. That is one of the options-not the only option-which the Government sees as being the right way to go for the future of Christmas Island. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Boswell and I have one other thing in common-neither of us has been to Christmas Island. I do not pretend, therefore, to be an expert on it. Nonetheless, I have read quite a bit about the place in recent years, especially in recent weeks. I am sure that Senator Boswell is aware, as I mentioned earlier, of the vast array of unique attractions in terms of the flora and fauna of the island and its rainforests. We would like to make sure that tourism exploits those features. Hopefully, that will play a large part in the island's economic future. </PARA>
<PARA> Recently I referred to the House of Representatives Standing Committee on the Environment, Recreation and the Arts and its reference to inquire into tourism in the Cocos and Christmas Islands. As well as those initiatives in the tourist field to make sure there is a future for Christmas Islanders, my colleague the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, John Kerin, has before him now a draft memorandum of understanding for the establishment of a commercial tuna fishing industry on Christmas Island. In addition, my Department is exploring other ventures in which we can involve ourselves on Christmas Island to make sure that there are even more local employment opportunities for Christmas Islanders. There are some problems on the question of fishing boundaries, which I am sure Senator Boswell will be aware of; nonetheless, we are proceeding down that track. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has also, through its recent customs and excise legislation, extended forum nation status to Christmas Island as well as the Cocos Islands and Norfolk Island. This provides for a preference to the islands under which goods manufactured on the islands which meet a 50 per cent local labour and materials requirement will receive duty-free entry to the Australian mainland. This Government has taken a whole series of steps to undo the decades of neglect that the islands suffered under successive conservative administrations. </PARA>

<PARA> I want to turn back to Senator Boswell and his continued allegations about misleading Parliament, the role of the liquidator, et cetera. I have done this repeatedly in here but I suppose I ought to do it again. Senator Boswell has as his main informant Mr Booth, who did not win the tender. That has upset Mr Booth. He saw the opportunity to make some money; he is not making it. That apparently has caused him some concern and he has found a ready mouthpiece in this place. The difficulty is that the liquidator rejects what Senator Boswell has had to say. The difficulty now is that, even when I set aside the procedures that are in train to make sure that Senator Boswell's concerns are taken into account, he has neither the grace nor the intelligence to accept what has been done. A meeting will be held next Thursday between Mr Holding, the liquidator and Mr Booth. No contract with Elders will be signed until Mr Holding and I have had an opportunity to discuss what comes out of that meeting. The liquidator is strongly of the opinion that the figures Mr Booth has given Senator Boswell, which he has used in this place to compare the two proposals, are wrong and relate to an earlier Elders proposal, not to the one that is now under consideration. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Boswell has attempted to whip up an enormous storm in a teacup which goes nowhere. Because he is a senator and a front bencher, he is entitled to consideration. I have made sure that no steps will be taken until his claims are investigated. But after next Thursday's meeting, when I get a report from the liquidator and from Mr Holding, I will come back into the chamber and one of two things will happen. Either I will apologise to Senator Boswell and say, `No, we got it wrong'; or alternatively, I will say something very different and he will be the one doing the apologising. In that case he will be the one standing up and saying, `I got it wrong; I am sorry'. Mind you, that is what he ought to say. Whether or not he has the grace and intelligence to do that after next Thursday remains to be seen. I, for one, anxiously await the results of that meeting. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Does Senator Boswell not want to learn about this island? Since 1981 all Christmas Islanders have been able to become Australian citizens, and this is a tribute to the Government. The Christmas Island Assembly Ordinance was passed in 1985, giving the island effective self-government. This is in marked contrast to what the Government did in the Australian Capital Territory, which is, of course, neither effective nor really self-government. Christmas Island is a sad story of democracy denied. The Christmas Island Assembly had nine members of very diverse racial and cultural backgrounds who were elected by the Hare-Clark system.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am. The Minister dissolved that Assembly, elected democratically by the Hare-Clark system, on 28 October 1987 when the Assembly bucked the Government and its bureaucrats here in Canberra. This left the people of Christmas Island with no voice in their own affairs, no self-government and entirely at the whim of an appointed administrator who carried out the wishes of the Canberra bureaucrats without consulting the local people. That is the point I want to make.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Assembly was not only the voice of the people; it was also very responsive to the environmental problems on the island. For example, the Assembly recommended the preservation of the forest habitat of the Christmas Island frigate bird. We have heard a lot about the Abbott's booby; what about the Christmas Island frigate bird? The Assembly took a strong stand against the Phosphate Mining Company of Christmas Island in relation to the extension of mining to the shores of Smithson Bight and considered, in the land use survey of 1985, that the conservation habitats there were of international concern with their outstanding coastal scenery, landscapes and wildlife. As a result of the recommendations which were passed by the Assembly, mining of the terraces did not proceed. Whatever the future of Christmas Island, the fragility of the environment must be taken into account. I note that the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories, Senator Richardson, pointed out in his contribution that the Government is aware of that fragility. I applaud him for that. Until the mid-1970s, as Senator Richardson also pointed out, the island was regarded as just a source for cheap phosphate with an expendable Asian work force. However, in the mid-1970s, the price of phosphates had declined and at the same time the work force had unionised. </PARA>
<PARA> The Prime Minister, Mr Hawke, felt moved to write a small contribution for the dust jacket of Les Waters's book entitled The Union of Christmas Island Workers. The Prime Minister said:</PARA>
<PARA> This is the story of how a small union in a remote and little known Australian Territory changed the status of its members from that of indentured labourer on Asian rates of pay to employees enjoying permanent residency and mainland pay and conditions. This revolution was not achieved easily. In the end, however, solidarity, resolution and intelligent campaigning over a long period and a tough, competent and committed leadership won through. The Union of Christmas Island Workers story deserves to be told. </PARA>
<PARA>The book was actually published in 1983. It tells the complex story of the mine, how it was closed by the Government, how the workers set up a fund to reopen it and how it was adopted as a speculative enterprise by one of our beer barons-not even a Western Australian beer baron but a Victorian and multinational, or even offshore, beer baron. The Assembly bucked the Government and protested long and loud, in the first place about Australian labour at Asian rates. They protested about the running of the island by the Phosphate Mining Company for the benefit of the company. They asserted their rights as Australians. They protested about the exploitation of particularly sensitive areas of rainforest on the island. It was for all this dangerously independent thinking that the Christmas Island Assembly was dissolved by the Minister. </PARA>
<PARA> This is by way of background to the present situation where the Government has accepted a tender from Elders Resources Ltd, according to the Minister, because Elders Resources Ltd offered a dollar a tonne of phosphate to be set aside for the environmental rehabilitation of the mined and devastated areas of the island. I suggest that one would need a very long spoon indeed to sup with Elders. Transnational environmental sensitivity is not famous for its abundance. Ask the people of Alaska about Exxon. Look at Elders itself. It has made a very good quid indeed by running around Australia with a front-end loader and picking up whatever is not bolted down. </PARA>
<PARA> The Federal Government, against the opposition of the Australian Democrats and many people in the wider community, last year imposed casinos on two communities which were then without elected representation, namely, the Australian Capital Territory and Christmas Island. At that time it reviewed the arguments against casinos and the acknowledged association of casinos with organised crime in other parts of the world. In the past five years the Federal Government has conducted a number of inquiries into the future of Christmas Island. All of these inquiries advocated tourism. At the same time the Government seems to have embarked on a deliberate policy of depopulating the island, or at least replacing the islanders of Asian origin with selected white Australians. A departmental memo dated June 1988 stated:</PARA>
<PARA> Former Minister Brown agreed to an extension of time to commence and complete construction of the hotel casino on the basis of: the upheaval on Christmas Island with the abolition of the Christmas Island assembly and the closure of the phosphate mine; and the Department's wish to slow down development to ensure that the existing population be persuaded to leave earlier rather than later. </PARA>
<PARA>I repeat, to persuade the population `to leave earlier rather than later'. I remind the Senate that these people are Australian citizens on Australian territory, yet they were urged to `leave' earlier rather than later. </PARA>
<PARA> So what is the solution? We have a mine with only about three years of phosphate left in it, a population needing both employment and representation and a degraded and damaged but unique environment. It is not our wish to force the people of the island to leave. It is their home. We regard the Government's attempt to depopulate the island as inhumane. Last year we received a letter from Christmas Island from a social worker who explained that the English language classes introduced as part of technical and further education to the island were being discontinued. She wrote:</PARA>
<PARA>Is this too part of the plan to depopulate the island, or at least remove the old employees of the phosphate mine with their troublesome union and independent-minded Assembly and replace them with a more biddable group of hotel or casino employees?</PARA>
<PARA>The matter raised by Senator Boswell seems, to the Australian Democrats, to be an argument about which way we would prefer to be raped. A number of mining companies are arguing for a tender, fighting over the rags and bones of an island which needs not more mining but rehabilitation. Prime Minister Hawke, Minister Punch, Minister Holding and Minister Richardson have all given undertakings at various times that no more rainforests will be cleared. This undertaking must be upheld. The Australian Democrats believe that there is an alternative solution to either the massive tourist complexes involving extended airfields, gold plated facilities and casinos, on the one hand, or to phosphate mining, on the other. </PARA>
<PARA> Australia wishes to maintain a presence on Christmas Island. The population is fewer than 2,000. We welcome the news that the national park area of the island is to be increased from 17 per cent to 65 per cent of the island, but we are very concerned-to get down to specifics-that a number of areas of environmental significance were not included in this extension. These include the South West Terraces, which the Assembly wanted to include--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am sorry; I will. The point is that the Minister for the environment, with his well-known environmental sensitivity, has stated publicly that he will review these issues, and I hope that in fact he will. We wish to see the entire island given national park status. Christmas Island is a beautiful tropical island. Geographically it is part of Asia. The people there are of Chinese and Malay origin. The Muslim Malays, incidentally, are most strongly opposed to gambling, for religious reasons. From a mainland Australian point of view, this is an exotic destination. The people have exotic customs and eat exotic food, but they are all Australians. There is no need for a passport to go there; there is no need for a visa. It is one more Australian territory. It would be a good tourist destination. The keenest proponent of a Christmas Island casino has been Mr Frank Woodmore of Perth. However, I quote the following from Mr Woodmore's own prospectus for the casino development:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>. . . even without a casino licence, Christmas Island Casino resort would be an attractive proposition. The potential for tourism is great. The visitor will discover many fascinating features on Christmas Island which cannot be found elsewhere. As a resort, the project is financially attractive. </PARA>
<PARA>This is from the man who wishes to develop the casino. Tourism can be both benign and financially attractive. Clearly, in the first instance, the islanders themselves must be consulted and their representative democracy returned to them. It is also no use having polls or elections if the electors are kept ignorant. </PARA>
<PARA> It is the view of the Australian Democrats that the first priority must be given to the preservation of the real original inhabitants of Christmas island-namely, the native bird and plant species which are presently in dire danger. I mention in particular the Christmas Island hawk owl, endemic to the island and classified as rare and endangered, and the Abbott's booby which only breeds on the island-nowhere else in the world. There are only some thousands of them left. There are even fewer of the Christmas Island frigate bird and fewer still of the golden bosun. Even the more populous species of boobies, bosuns and terns cannot withstand further incursions into their nesting areas. As well as birds there are, of course, the famous crabs as well as other species of small land animals. The crabs appear in their millions and form a tourist attraction in their own right. The recent Kew Gardens study of the botany of the island showed many rare and endangered plant species which have not even been noticed by the officers of the Australian National Parks and Wildlife Service, let alone the boardroom operators of Elders, Booths, or Century Metals. </PARA>
<PARA> In conclusion, the ecosystem of Christmas Island is unique and must be preserved. The island will depend in great part on tourism for its future. These two factors must be taken into account. It is urgent that all remaining areas of rainforest be immediately included in the National Park and ultimately the whole island. The island is part of Australia and the islanders are Australians. We owe it to them as well as to ourselves to preserve this special part of our country. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to speak on the appropriations for the Department of Community Services and Health, in particular, mainly because of my concern about the current changes to nursing home funding that have been undertaken by this Government and, particularly, because those changes affect Victoria, which has the largest number of small nursing homes and the highest level of dependency. It is appropriate that I speak on this matter today. However, I will not fall into the trap that Senator Robert Ray-I think wrongly-accused my colleagues of falling into. He pointed his finger over here yesterday or the day before and said, `You on the other side get up and ask for more and more money. Senator Puplick asks for more money for the environment. Senator Newman asks for more money for defence'. That is not necessarily the case. It is not the case in this instance. I am asking the responsible Minister and the Department to be more flexible in their funding arrangements for nursing homes, particularly for small nursing homes, of which Victoria has the highest proportion.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> One thing that has concerned me greatly is the state of nursing homes in Victoria. Just this week we saw 1,800 Hospital Employees Federation (HEF) workers march in the streets of Melbourne-not for higher salaries, not for more money for themselves, but to maintain and to ensure the standards of nursing home care for the elderly citizens of Victoria who are in residence. The Government did not fool the HEF workers by the advertisement it put in the Age newspaper entitled `Nursing homes don't be conned', in an attempt to put out the fire that was burning in Victoria. I am interested to know where the money came from for this advertisement. The advertisement states:</PARA>
<PARA>Current protests and fear campaigns about changes in nursing homes are not genuine complaints. </PARA>
<PARA>Eighteen hundred people do not take to the streets if they do not have a genuine complaint. To continue:</PARA>
<PARA>Sadly, many old people and their families are being unnecessarily worried by those running this campaign. </PARA>
<PARA>I hope that the Government has thought about the old people and their families who are worried about what will happen to them in their nursing homes as the care aggregate module (CAM), which is a disastrous system for funding nursing homes, takes full effect over the next two years. The advertisement goes on to state:</PARA>
<PARA>FACTS:</PARA>
<PARA> The Government has increased funding for nursing homes and hostels from $854 million in 1982-83 to $1437 million in 1987-88 with increases in every year. This represents a rise of 20% after allowing for inflation. </PARA>
<PARA>It seems that there is some disagreement between this statement in the advertisement and a statement which the Minister for Housing and Aged Care (Mr Staples) made in the House in answer to a question without notice from the honourable member for Bendigo (Mr Brumby). The Minister said:</PARA>
<PARA>The hostels, recurrent funding, which this union is particularly concerned about-</PARA>
<PARA>and he is talking about the HEF-</PARA>
<PARA>has gone up by 88 per cent in real terms. In nursing homes it has gone up by 20 per cent in real terms. </PARA>
<PARA>I do not know how those figures come together. Maybe the Minister can explain how those figures relate. The advertisement also states:</PARA>
<PARA>14,000 extra hostel and nursing home beds will be approved over the next three years-more than 5000 of these will be in Victoria. </PARA>
<PARA>Can the Minister provide a breakdown of the figures for the increases in total nursing home and hostel funding of 20 per cent over five years into separate increases for nursing homes and for hostels? Is it the case that most of the increase has been in hostel funding, not nursing home funding? The advertisement continues:</PARA>
<PARA>No nursing home will be forced to close. </PARA>
<PARA>Is the Minister able to assure the Senate that if any nursing homes are unable to enter into approved arrangements with the Government over amalgamation or expansion their future funding will be viable? The advertisement continues:</PARA>
<PARA>The Government is providing over $10 million extra to help some small homes to become more viable through expansion or amalgamation. </PARA>
<PARA>In the original document that small nursing homes received there was discussion about nursing homes being amalgamated if they were, say, 100 kilometres, or more than 250 kilometres, away from each other. That distance now seems to have come down to about 75 kilometres. If nursing homes are within 75 kilometres of each other, they may not have to be amalgamated. I ask the Minister how the Department came to this decision. I asked a question in Estimates Committee F about the level of consultation that the Department had with rural nursing homes in April of this year. The answer I received is interesting. I think Mr Staples should have asked this question of the Department himself. I asked what consultation had gone on, how many and which officers of the Department had visited which nursing homes. I think the Senate needs to hear the answer, which reads:</PARA>
<PARA>Dr Elizabeth Kelly, Ms Judy Dickon and Mr Andrejs Zamurs of the Victorian Health Department, and Mr Ian Lindenmayer, Dr Claudia Thame and Mr Ian Campbell of the Department of Community Services and Health visited the following facilities in Victoria in late 1988:</PARA>
<PARA> The hospital at Warracknabeal, the combined hospital and nursing home facilities at Jeparit, the hostel co-located with a range of services including selfcontained units, a day care centre and a range of other services at Queenscliff and the new State Government hostel at Ballarat. </PARA>
<PARA>My Queensland colleagues might like to know that they visited one or two in Queensland as well. That seems to be the sum consultation with rural nursing homes in Victoria, yet the Department has the gall to talk about how far apart such homes will be when they are amalgamated. Have officers of the Department spoken to an elderly person who visits her spouse in a small rural nursing home in a remote part of Victoria? Such a person goes every day to help to feed that patient or resident. If she has to visit that person 75 kilometres away and she cannot drive because her vision is not very good-a lot of elderly people do not drive-she will also end up in a nursing home because she will not have the motivation to travel that far to visit her spouse. Yet we have a Government that says it is a caring Government! Nevertheless, it imposes such conditions on people. </PARA>
<PARA> In addition, no choice is involved. If the community or individuals in these small nursing homes wish to make an additional contribution over and above 85 per cent of their pensions, their government subsidy will be taken away. They have no choice at all. As a community leader in a smaller rural area, I could encourage people to decide that it may not be as efficient and cost-effective to have a small nursing home in a rural area. However, the community may decide that that is what it wants. If it so decides, it is penalised for helping itself. I hope the Government will look more carefully at this and I hope that the Department will more thoroughly consult the industry, especially rural aspects of it, to ensure that a much more flexible approach is taken. </PARA>
<PARA> The Victorian Bush Nursing Hospital Association has been desperately trying to make contact with Mr Staples and asked me on its behalf to make an appointment. In his answer to Mr Brumby, the Minister said:</PARA>
<PARA>I will make an offer to those members of the Liberal Party and the National Party in Victoria that, if they cannot read what has been sent to them, they should come and talk to me. I will give them a full rundown this week of what is happening in their area. If they want that information, they should come and see me, not go around scaring old people in country areas. </PARA>
<PARA>I have not been going around scaring old people in country areas. I have been trying to arrange an appointment for representatives of the Victorian Bush Nursing Hospital Association to see the Minister. But what do I get? I wrote a letter to the Minister and his secretary answered in the following terms, although she did not even remember writing the letter:</PARA>
<PARA>Mr Staples has asked me to thank you for your letter dated 1 April and received in this office on 4 May. </PARA>
<PARA>That says something maybe about Australia Post. The letter continues:</PARA>
<PARA>He would be happy to meet with representatives of the Victorian Bush Nursing Hospital Association. Due to his busy work schedule for the next few weeks, I am unable to confirm a date for an appointment. However, I will contact you as soon as an appointment can be confirmed. </PARA>
<PARA>I rang up the other day to see whether I could facilitate that appointment because nothing had happened for the first half of this month. The Minister's secretary seemed quite amazed. She did not even remember having written the letter. We had to remind her of the date of the letter. I understand that she is very busy but the Minister is telling me that he will see me-maybe he is more able to see me than he is able to see my constituents-this week. Yet I cannot get an appointment for the Bush Nursing Hospital Association to see him. I hope that the Minister and his staff will be alerted to this issue. I hope that the Minister will make an appointment to see that Association as soon as possible. </PARA>
<PARA> I also asked at the Estimates Committee how many bush nursing hospitals had been visited. The answer was:</PARA>
<PARA>Officers of the Department visit bush nursing hospitals which operate nursing home facilities or hostels as part of the Department's ongoing outcome standards and financial monitoring responsibilities. </PARA>
<PARA>I was given no details of what hospitals were visited. In December last year I asked the Minister for Resources, Senator Cook, about bush nursing hospitals and the crisis that they were going through in not being able to look after long term older patients. He said:</PARA>
<PARA>Earlier this week senior officials of the Commonwealth Department of Community Services and Health had preliminary discussions with Victorian officials and visited a range of service facilities in rural Victoria-</PARA>
<PARA>I stress the words in words `a range'-</PARA>
<PARA>to examine the cost and feasibility of various approaches to providing good care for frail aged people in small population centres. </PARA>
<PARA>That range was about four institutions. When I contacted the Victorian Bush Nursing Hospital Association I discovered that not one bush nursing hospital had been visited, yet this Department will advise the Minister. I ask the Minister to revise what is happening. I also ask his Department to be more thorough in its consultation before it makes decisions. I also ask the Department to create a much more flexible approach and to give some choice to people in rural areas to maintain their elderly in nursing homes in facilities that are available and convenient. This is important to those elderly people. They deserve the very best care in the most appropriate position-not 75 kilometres away from their homes. Let me reiterate the questions I asked the Minister. I asked:</PARA>
<PARA> Can the Minister provide a breakdown on the figures for increases for total nursing home and hostel funding of 20 per cent (after allowing for inflation) over five years into separate increases for nursing homes and for hostels?</PARA>
<PARA> Is it the case that most of the increase has been in hostel funding, not nursing homes?</PARA>
<PARA> Of the five thousand extra nursing home and hostel places to be approved in Victoria over the next three years, how many are to be in nursing homes and how many in hostels?</PARA>
<PARA> Is the Minister able to assure the Senate that if any nursing homes are unable to enter into an approved arrangement with the Government over amalgamation or expansion, their future funding will be viable?</PARA>
<PARA> Can the Minister tell the Senate whether the six per cent increase in nursing and personal care staffing levels in Victoria since July 1988 reflects additional staff employed or simply the additional cost of existing staff?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I recognise and acknowledge that Senator Patterson has long had a keen interest in this subject. Where we are dealing with people in aged care or in nursing homes the Government is concerned about dealing with matters in the best possible way so that we do not unduly generate unwarranted controversy. The reason for that careful approach is that the worst possible anxiety that could be visited on people resident in this sort of care is the anxiety that something is happening that they do not understand and that will endanger their future security. At their time of life and often in their condition of health that is not an anxiety that any caring and responsible government would wish to encourage or in any way be a part of. It is because there is a campaign which we believe is based wrongly and on fear that the Government took out an advertisement, simply and carefully in an unvarnished form and, might I say, without any political rhetoric, to explain again the situation regarding this type of care. We did this in the hope that aged people and people in nursing homes would read the advertisement themselves, or that their friends and/or relations would read it, and that it would assuage any undue concern. I am not accusing Senator Patterson of being responsible for whipping up unreasonable emotionalism on this matter, but I am certainly saying that some have been responsible for that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Having said all of that, there is a series of matters that we need to reinforce constantly in the community so there is a clearer understanding of the Government's objectives and processes. Not only do we need to say what the objectives of our program are but also we need to show as we proceed that we are meeting those objectives. It is on that basis that I stress the five key facts about the future of country nursing homes. </PARA>
<PARA> The first fact is that no nursing home, bush nursing home or other facility is being forced to close by the new funding arrangements. Indeed, that was referred to in the advertisement. Senator Patterson has asked at least one question about that in terms of the provision of material. I will answer that question in a moment. Secondly, the few nursing homes which are talking publicly about closing are doing so for business reasons rather than because of the new arrangements. In making broad brush statements one has to be careful that one does not miscue as to the cause of closure. Advocates wanting to proselytise in objecting to a government program concerning which they have a vested interest must be careful that they do not brandish statistics which fail to differentiate between the sources and put down bulk statistics down rather than analyse the cause, thereby presenting a false public impression. We say that the few nursing homes which are publicly talking about closing are doing so for business reasons rather than because of the new arrangements. That is an important distinction. </PARA>
<PARA> Thirdly, many small homes will probably choose to expand or amalgamate, and the Commonwealth will assist them to do so. That will assist the expansion of the service, which will be a laudable outcome and be seen to be so by users of the service as well as by people associated with it. Fourthly, this action will improve the viability of nursing homes and the services they provide. That speaks for itself. Fifthly, there is no reason for homes to take hasty action. Special financial assistance will be provided until 1992. For those small homes which choose to redevelop their services 1992 is three years away-or 2 1/2 years, depending on which measure one chooses to apply. That is a degree of security which should over the transitional period assuage any of the concerns that have been mentioned. </PARA>
<PARA> The Commonwealth Government, after all, places a high priority on ensuring that country people receive fair access to health and other services, particularly for aged people. The new funding arrangements will not be forcing the closure of any facility, as I have said. Currently a few proprietors of small nursing homes, particularly in metropolitan Melbourne, are planning to close their facilities and sell off their approved nursing home beds to other proprietors. In the past some entrepreneurs have established small nursing homes in old buildings which were inadequate to provide good quality nursing home care on a viable scale. A few of these are now proposing to close anyway. They will either transfer their operations to another location or sell their beds to other nursing home proprietors. Despite assertions that have been made to the contrary, these closures are totally unrelated to the Government's new nursing home funding arrangements. They simply reflect business decisions taken by the entrepreneurs. </PARA>
<PARA> There will be no loss of nursing home beds in either metropolitan or rural areas. In fact there will be a continued expansion of total nursing home bed numbers, reflecting the Government's long term aged services plans. Previous governments have failed to plan properly for nursing homes and other aged services. As a result of that failure to plan properly, some services have developed in country areas and are operating on a scale which provides neither an efficient level of operation for the proprietor nor an adequate range of facilities and services for the residents of those homes. New Commonwealth funding arrangements will help to guarantee continued provision of services in rural areas while assisting some facilities to redevelop in order to provide both long term financial viability and an adequate range of services for their residents. This will be possible through government approval for expansion of nursing home bed numbers to obtain a viable size or approval of amalgamation or the purchase of approvals from other locations. The Commonwealth Government has already undertaken to provide at least $8m to assist the redevelopment process. </PARA>
<PARA> The claims that the new nursing home funding arrangements will force small rural homes to decide immediately whether to close or amalgamate immediately should be-I think rightly-deplored. This is arrant nonsense. Nursing homes which are planning to develop will be asked to submit their plans by the end of 1989 but will not have to implement them until 1992. Meanwhile, these homes will receive a substantial, guaranteed level of resourcing. Many small homes have already developed innovative proposals since the announcement of the Government's funding arrangements in April 1988. Officers of the Department of Community Services and Health will be visiting small nursing homes and bush hostels throughout Victoria in the next few months. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The honourable senator has asked specific questions. I am coming to those specific questions. Maybe this would be an appropriate time for me to say, since I have made that point and Senator Patterson has acknowledged it, that the purpose of those visits is to assist in the redevelopment arrangements wherever necessary. As I have taken them down, Senator Patterson has asked four questions. The first question concerns the viability of small nursing homes and whether we can give her a breakdown of total nursing home funding over the next three years for hostels and nursing homes. In the way in which Senator Patterson framed her question, I think there was a series of imputations that maybe nursing homes were not attracting the funding she believed they should. I have to say that that question is best taken on notice. I am not able now to provide her with a comprehensive breakdown. We would propose, if she would not mind, to take that question on notice and to provide her with a breakdown in an appropriate form. We will do so with all reasonable expedition.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The second question referred to the number of beds that will be available over the next three years. I cannot provide the honourable senator with the figures today but she will be provided with those figures in due course. Third, Senator Patterson asked about amalgamations, discussions about nursing homes and what consultations had been entered into. I would suspect that from this and her fourth question-how many visits have there been to bush nursing hospitals, when were the visits and by whom were they conducted?-that she is inviting us to establish a new industry, an industry of providing all sorts of information about who did what, where and when. At a time when we are engaging in transitional arrangements for new nursing homes we could divert ourselves from that endeavour and concentrate on developing all that information, but I fear it would be a terrible waste of resources. </PARA>

He still has not assured me that there will not be more problems with nursing homes in Victoria but I can assure him that I will keep watching this because I feel so strongly about it. The Minister did say he would give me an answer to these questions very quickly. On 13 April I asked in Estimates Committee F for details of the number of current nursing home residents in various categories-categories 1 to 5-broken down into numbers in particular types of nursing homes. On Tuesday 9 May I was provided with answers to this question. The information from the Department of Community Services and Health showed the numbers as at 31 January 1989. Honourable senators can imagine that I was quite surprised to learn that on 24 April the same type of information had been supplied to the industry, except that the Department was able to give figures as recent as 31 March 1989. I ask the Minister why the Department has given me figures for January when clearly figures for March were available? Why did the Department take until 9 May to provide any figures at all in answer to my question when more up to date figures were provided by the Department to other people on or before 24 April?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Cook, in his earlier reply to Senator Patterson, twice used the word `assuaged' in referring to the fear and concern which elderly people might have with respect to nursing homes. The Minister's concern would be taken somewhat more seriously had he not quoted Mr Russell Schneider, Chief Executive of the Voluntary Health Insurance Association of Australia, two days ago in reply to a question from Senator McMullan. He said that elderly people would face rises in health insurance of up to $35 per week if the legislation that was introduced in the Senate this morning was not passed. He then went on to draw the very clear inference that in the electorate of Kingston 11.25 per cent of the electors are over the age of 65 and would benefit from the Government's measure. I cannot take seriously what the Minister has said about not trying to stir a great deal of concern among the elderly and the chronically ill. It is true that there has been a rundown in the reinsurance pool of several of the insurance companies. Some of the funds are in some difficulty.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thank you, Madam Temporary Chairman. It was in the context of this debate that the Minister used those words `assuaging the concern of old people'. There is a considerable need to address the longer term problems in relation to health care in this country-both the matter of Medicare and the matter of those who are covered by the private insurance systems. The Government is proposing simply one matter-an aspect which goes to part of the insurance area. There are a number of other solutions to that problem and to the whole question of health care. The adequacy and funding of that care need to be looked at in more detail. This does not appear to be happening at present.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I draw the Committee's attention to a letter from Mr Bernie McKay, who has been head of both the Federal Health Department and the State departments of health in New South Wales and in South Australia, under Labor governments. He was a public servant under those governments for 20 years. Among other things, he complains that, in seeking a wide-ranging review of the Government's health program, he has been unable to get any feedback from the Minister. He said that proposals against the changes which he put up were not against the obvious political, economic and social advantages of the proposal, but against the likelihood of the Government taking any real action prior to an election. It seems to me that in this case we are seeing a government not willing to take on the wider question of review of the whole health care system because an election will be held within the next 12 months. </PARA>
<PARA> I ask the Minister the following questions. What effort is being made to identify and reduce the costs of sickness care-and I use the term `sickness care' rather than `health care' quite deliberately-and to shift those costs to health protection? Is it not the case that in recent years the Commonwealth contribution to public hospital costs has been relatively fixed so that overall cost increases have had to be met by State governments? Is this not one important factor which bears directly on the ability of the State public hospital service to provide adequate services to the elderly and to the chronically ill? Of course, one reflects there on the waiting lists and the industrial disruptions which are increasingly disturbing the State public hospital system. Perhaps the Minister would not wish to answer this question for the reasons that he gave earlier. In the area of insurance, what financial burden is the Government expected to assume when the effect of the reinsurance reshuffle runs out and the costs of private health insurance then start to escalate quite rapidly?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Coulter is absolutely right. I do not propose to take up his invitation to debate a Bill which is on the Notice Paper. I look forward to the opportunity to do so when it is called on for debate in this chamber. I realise that by dwelling on this point I run a slight risk of being pulled up by the Chair. But in that debate, if the actual context of the Government's proposal is listened to and understood, the honourable senator may wish to change his position. I hope that Senator Coulter, like some other senators in this place, is a person who, in the face of new information or better analysis, is prepared to alter a position that he has publicly taken to be consistent with principle. I will not proceed any further, other than to say that I hope that will be the outcome of a proper analytical debate on the subject of Senator Coulter's third question.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I am in a position to answer the other two questions that Senator Coulter has asked. The first question, as to what effort has been made by the Commonwealth to reduce the costs of sickness care and to shift those costs to health protection, is a fundamental question that should always be asked. I thank Senator Coulter for asking it now when the estimates for the Department of Community Services and Health are before this chamber. It is obviously sensible for governments to direct funding to remedial and preventative steps, to encourage a better health approach in the community, rather than meeting the cost of repairing the damage after bad health practices have been engaged in. </PARA>
<PARA> In 1988-89 the national better health program (NBHP) attracted $1m of Commonwealth funds which were originally appropriated under Appropriation Bill (No. 2), thus permitting payments only to the States. This was rectified by the reappropriation of additional estimates of $600,000 to allow direct Commonwealth expenditure. The Minister for Community Services and Health (Dr Blewett) has approved the following Budget: $600,000 to finance direct Commonwealth expenditure to support the program in general, that is, up to $250,000 to fund the operation of project planning teams established to devise strategies for each of the five priority areas under the program; $100,000 to the national injuries surveillance and prevention project; up to $150,000 to obtain base line data and advice on data requirements for program evaluation and analysis identified by the project planning teams; up to $60,000 to cover communications, marketing, and public relations activities aimed at providing information about and promoting support for the program; up to $40,000 to cover costs associated with the operation of the management committee; and $400,000 to supplement State and Territory funding for local administrative projects. </PARA>
<PARA> Those figures were for the 1988-89 period. For 1988-90 to 1991-92 the Commonwealth has committed $6.5m per annum to be matched by the States and to be split between direct Commonwealth expenditure and expenditure on local projects of States and Territories, to be determined after the project planning teams have reported in the middle of this year. The $41m national better health program will run until at least mid-1992. Half of the funds have been provided by the Commonwealth and half by the States and Territories. In March 1988 the health Ministers endorsed in principle the Better Health for All Australians report which recommended specific goals and targets in five priority areas. These are being addressed through the program. The five priority areas have been agreed for combined action by all governments. This is a good example of the Commonwealth and the States working together on a strategically identified national goal. The priority areas are nutrition, hypertension, preventable cancers, injury and the health of older people. </PARA>
<PARA> The five priority areas are chosen because they represent major health challenges. They are amenable to prevention. A broad range of health promotion strategies can be used and each State and Territory is undertaking activities in at least some of the areas. The development and implementation of the program are being oversighted by a management committee chaired by Ms Wendy McCarthy, an Australian of world repute. The committee includes Professor Stephen Leeder and senior health officials from each of the jurisdictions concerned. The project planning teams have been established for each of the five priority areas that I have described. </PARA>
<PARA> It is true that this Government, together with the States, has aimed to meet the priority espoused by Senator Coulter and, in my view, rightly identified as a priority for preventive medicine. I add, as a point of observation from a common Australian point of view, that it is interesting that at sporting venues we see advertising for the Quit campaign to discourage people from smoking cigarettes. When sporting teams run into the arena, we see them wearing the Quit roundel. When we watch television in some States, such as my State of Western Australia, we see advertisements about the dangers of excessive alcohol abuse. There is also an ever-burgeoning interest by ordinary Australians in better nutrition, better eating habits and better dietary arrangements. So there is evidence not only that this is a campaign to which the Commonwealth and the States have directed emphasis, but also that the campaign is having an effect. There is now a greater acceptance of those health goals. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Coulter also said that Commonwealth funds to hospitals have been fixed, transferring the major share of those costs to the States. He went on to make a series of subtext political points. Those political points ought to be identified and seen for what they are-simply political rhetoric. In answer to that question, I can say that funds from the Commonwealth to the States for public hospitals have increased, and that has enhanced the services of public hospitals. In the honourable senator's somewhat argumentative question-argumentative in the way in which it was couched, not in the way it was delivered-he made reference to Mr McKay as a figure of authority to be cited. I need to say what his contribution to the public debate has been. He really wants it both ways. He wants risk rating, which would force aged persons to pay substantially increased contributions, and also more than $100m into the reinsurance trust fund. On the other hand, he wants public contributions as well. Those remarks have to be seen in that context. </PARA>

<PARA> I do not think it is helpful for me to continue to read the remaining paragraphs. I have to say that I am generally unhappy at the responses given to my question on DESINE, and I find them somewhat evasive and confusing.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I know that this is not a popular time to take up the time of the Senate. I am sorry that the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories (Senator Richardson) has not arrived in the chamber because I wish to refer to an article in this morning's Canberra Times indicating that the Director of the National Museum of Australia, Dr Don McMichael, is leaving because of his frustrations over the Federal Government's handling of its commitment to the National Museum of Australia. Let me say that I recognise, as do others, that it has undoubtedly not been possible for this Government to meet its 1983 election campaign commitment to the museum in the way that it intended at that time. But I do not believe that it has made any effort at all to see that this very valuable resource for the nation has progressed in any way as it should have done between then and 1988, when the project was virtually put on hold in such a way that most people now doubt the Government's commitment to it at all.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Dr McMichael has been in the Public Service since 1973 and has been a distinguished public servant with a great deal to offer in this area. It is certainly regrettable that his frustration at the Government's attitude has led him to retire and leave the Public Service. I must say, though, that I cannot blame him for the course that he has taken. As I said, this Government made a commitment in 1983 that it would proceed with the construction of the museum. By the time of the 1987 policy statement of the Australian Labor Party there was no mention of it at all. The public galleries of the museum were to have been opened next year. Now we are told that they will have to wait until the year 2000. I would not mind if there was a commitment to this being the major project to recognise the centenary of Federation but we do not even have a commitment for that time at present. </PARA>
<PARA> I also feel that the Museum of Australia ought to be given the management and refurbishment of the provisional Parliament House, which has been locked now for 12 months and seems to be a matter of no interest to this Government. It is an important national resource. The staff of the museum in recent years have been existing on a shoestring budget with more dedication than funding. They have been given a number of items; they do not even have the ability to accept a number of things which have been offered to them. The failure of the Government to give more encouragement and some more funding-to have given them an opportunity even to have got involved perhaps with private sector development of some of the galleries there-has jeopardised exhibits which have been collected and which ought to be housed and preserved for future Australians. </PARA>
<PARA> This month we learnt of a move to have the museum's Aboriginal collection given away to South Australia. It is a collection that should belong to the national museum and should be displayed by it. One would not object to it being lent to South Australia to be put on display but the mere fact that it is being discussed in terms of being given to South Australia is a concern that I have that there is really no commitment whatever to a national museum. Certainly around Australia the impression is being formed that it may never be completed. One cannot blame the State institutions for looking at the national museum's collection with a view to trying to benefit from it. It was a great pity that much of the Bicentennial Touring Exhibition was dissipated by sale at public auction and not acquired for display by the national museum. That was also a very valuable resource. I am appalled at the Government's attitude in this area and I think my view is shared by many. </PARA>
<PARA> There was an open day at the museum site about three weeks ago. Ten thousand people visited to see as many items as could be displayed at that time. A Friends of the Museum group has now been established and Jack Thompson is the president of that group. He was present on that occasion. As I said, some 10,000 people visited and indicated their support. The group is anxious to raise funds and participate. There are lots of ways that the public and other groups could help if the Government indicated that there was a commitment to this museum being developed. Of course, it would be of benefit to Canberra but that is nothing compared with the benefit to future Australians of having their heritage displayed in a way that enables them to have a greater understanding of the background of this country. </PARA>
<PARA> My colleague Senator Puplick asked Senator Richardson today whether he could comment on whether, in addition to Dr McMichael's retirement, a further five museum staff positions were being cut and whether this was a decision taken by the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories or the Minister for Finance (Senator Walsh). I gather that Senator Richardson has not yet been able to reply to that question. I will be very interested to hear the reply, particularly in view of his answer to a question about the museum earlier this month. Senator Peter Baume asked a question and Senator Richardson said then that the proposals for the museum were before Cabinet. I think, with the matter before the Cabinet, it would be most unusual if any decision was taken unilaterally by the Department of Finance to cut back the museum's already very sparse staff allocation. If, on the other hand, the decision to cut staff has been taken by the Minister for arts, it stands in stark contrast to all the Minister's recent protestations that he is trying to get the project back on the rails. I await the Minister's answer with interest. </PARA>
<PARA> I express my sorrow that Dr McMichael is retiring as Director. As I have said, I understand his reasons for doing so. I hope the Government will accept its responsibilities to future Australians and make a commitment to the Museum of Australia in a way which enables the friends of the museum and others who support it to do something meaningful about the collection. </PARA>

There were some staff implications involved, but I will leave it to Senator Richardson to answer that. As for Mr Thompson's proposal, I think I can speak on behalf of the Government in saying that, if anybody wants to put up a proposal for a privately funded museum, the Government would have no objection to it. But as long as public funds are involved it must be considered in the context of all the other competing claims for funding that come before the Commonwealth Government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I think it is fair enough to put it on the record that Dr McMichael stated publicly last September that the cost of the referendum would have financed 50 per cent of the capital cost of the National Museum of Australia, implying that that should have been done. I do not think it was proper for a person occupying a senior Public Service position to make that sort of comment publicly. As a private citizen he is quite entitled to say what he likes, but as someone holding the rank of deputy secretary, as he did at the time, I do not believe that it was proper to say it then. There are a few other things I could say about Dr McMichael, but I will refrain from doing so, at least for now. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="3I4">Senator McLean</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1"> asked the Minister representing the Minister for Community Services and Health, upon notice, on 28 February 1989:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) Is the Minister aware of the differences between the average blood levels of certain pesticides and volatile hydrocarbons found in the blood of Australians with Chronic Fatigue Syndrome, and the levels found in the blood of United States of America (USA) citizens, both of which have been measured at Accu-Chem Laboratory in Dallas, Texas.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) Is the Minister aware that this laboratory is government-certified, is widely respected in the field of toxicology in the USA and is, in fact, used by the USA government and its agencies in the analysis of these chemicals.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) Is the Minister aware: (a) that hexachlorobenzene, DDT, DDE, dieldrin and chloroform have been recognised as carcinogens, and that these have been found in significantly higher amounts in the blood of the Australians so far tested, and (b) that the average levels in the blood so far taken are between two and ten times the average levels found in Americans at this laboratory.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) Can the Minister explain the extremely high average level of hexachlorobenzene in the blood of the Australians so far tested, given that this substance is said to be no longer in use.</PARA>
<PARA> (5) Will the Minister initiate similar studies of the normal population in Australia in order to establish whether the levels found so far are typical of the average Australian population or whether they indicate problems which are specific to this group of sick people.</PARA>
<PARA> (6) Would the Minister be willing to ensure that funding will be made available to those wishing to scientifically evaluate this matter.</PARA>
<PARA> (7) Is the Minister aware that the New South Wales (NSW) Minister for Health, the Hon. Peter Collins, MLA, has made statements on this matter in the NSW Parliament claiming that an unnamed spokesperson for the National Health and Medical Research Council has suggested that the measured blood levels were ``consistent with known exposure'' to these chemicals.</PARA>
<PARA> (8) Does this mean that Australians are knowingly being exposed to high levels of chemicals which are recognized as dangerous, mutagenic, immune suppressive and carcinogenic, and that Australia therefore has less stringent controls on safe exposure to dangerous chemicals than other countries such as the USA, which are currently legislating to lower the exposure of their citizens to such chemicals.</PARA>
<PARA> (9) Does the Minister agree that the levels of these chemicals seen in this study may adversely affect human health.</PARA>
<PARA> (10) Will the Government agree to take full responsibility for any ill-health caused by exposure to such chemicals, both in the general population and in the specific group of unwell people as have been investigated in the current study.</PARA>
<PARA> (11) Is the Minister aware that a small but rapidly growing proportion of the Australian population is exceptionally sensitive to the effects of these and other toxic chemicals, and that the problem of chemical hypersensitivity exists in certain individuals.</PARA>
<PARA> (12) What steps is the Minister taking to ensure that these people's health is not adversely affected by exposure to these chemicals.</PARA>
<PARA> (13) If the Minister is unaware of this condition, will he agree to investigate the matter further and consult with experts.</PARA>
<PARA> (14) Is the Minister aware that there is no Medicare reimbursement for these tests so far carried out on the blood of these sick people.</PARA>
<PARA> (15) Does the Minister agree that all Australians are entitled to expect that Medicare will cover the cost of medical expenses incurred in the management of their illness by their doctor.</PARA>
<PARA> (16) Does the Minister undertake to reimburse the 96 people so far tested in this manner, and to ensure Medicare payments for those who in future have the tests requested by registered medical practitioners.</PARA>
<PARA> (17) Will the Minister begin consultation with medical practitioners involved in this work to date, in order to gain a fuller understanding of the results so far to hand, and to work with them to formulate a strategy for testing of areas of exposure of the people already tested, and agreeing to the complete medical confidentiality of the results of the individual patients tested.</PARA>
<PARA> (18) Is the Minister aware of the functions of the Environmental Protection Agency in the USA.</PARA>
<PARA> (19) Will the Minister consider setting up an independent body of similar status in Australia to urgently investigate the exposure of Australians to toxic chemicals, and to create and enforce stricter standards for the future use of these chemicals, such a body to include at least one practitioner from the group who have carried out this work to date, and a member of the Toxic and Hazardous Chemicals Committee of the Total Environment Centre, among others.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RF4">Senator Cook</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Community Services and Health has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1)-(3) Senator McLean has provided me with a summarised table of blood levels of certain pesticides and volatile hydrocarbons which are said to have been obtained from Australians suffering from symptoms ascribed to be chronic fatigue syndrome. The tables provided indicate differences between the average blood levels of the substances in the Australian samples and US ``population averages''.</PARA>
<PARA> The tables give no data on the population from which the US average levels were derived, and no indication of age, sex, smoking history etc. of the individuals concerned. In addition, the analytical method is not given.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) The presence of hexachlorobenzene indicated in these samples is no doubt linked to the extreme persistence of that substance in the environment.</PARA>
<PARA> (5)-(6) If a research proposal were developed to pursue the hypothesis with regard to these chemicals and chronic fatigue syndrome, the National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC) would consider the application through its normal funding mechanisms.</PARA>
<PARA> The NHMRC is supporting research into chronic fatigue syndrome through a project being undertaken by Dr A. Lloyd at the Prince Henry/Prince of Wales Hospital, Sydney, testing the hypothesis that this syndrome is caused by persistent low grade, intracellular infections causing abnormal reaction in white blood cells in genetically susceptible persons.</PARA>
<PARA> (7) Yes.</PARA>
<PARA> (8)-(10) The level of chemicals quoted both in the US and Australian samples are minuscule, being in terms of parts per billion (ppb)-i.e. 0.000000001 gml of blood. At these levels, there is no indication that Australians are exposed to toxicologically significant amounts of the substances cited.</PARA>
<PARA> (11)-(13) I am aware that a small proportion of the population may have a special sensitivity to chemicals in their diet, along with certain food additives. The latter issue is dealt with through labelling of foodstuffs; in respect of chemicals, residue levels are kept to the minimum consistent with good agricultural practice.</PARA>
<PARA> (14)-(16) Medicare benefits are payable for chemical assays of certain pesticides and volatile hydrocarbons which are medically necessary for the management of a patient and which are rendered in accordance with the approved pathology practitioner scheme. I am advised however, that following consideration of the circumstances in each case, many of the pathology tests for which Medicare benefits have been claimed for patients with chronic fatigue syndrome, have been determined to be health screening services for which Medicare benefit is not payable.</PARA>
<PARA> In addition, where pathology services are referred by a doctor practitioner to a laboratory outside Australia, Medicare benefits are not payable.</PARA>
<PARA> (17) See answers (5)-(6) above.</PARA>
<PARA> (18) Yes.</PARA>
<PARA> (19) No. The process for registration of agricultural and chemical pesticides has recently been reviewed and refined through the passage of the Agricultural and Veterinary Chemicals Act 1988.</PARA>
<PARA> As stated in section 3 of that Act, an objective of the evaluation and clearance system for agricultural and veterinary chemical products established under that legislation is to minimise any undue hazard to:</PARA>
<PARA> (i) the general public:</PARA>
<PARA> (ii) the environment;</PARA>
<PARA> (iii) users of such products and other workers exposed to such products or to residues of such products; and</PARA>
<PARA> (iv) agricultural produce and livestock;</PARA>
<PARA>arising from the application of such products.</PARA>
<PARA> The NHMRC is represented on the Australian Agricultural and Veterinary Chemicals Council and has the prime responsibility for ensuring this objective is met.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="TJ4">Senator Walsh</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Treasurer has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As the administration of the Income Tax Assessment Act has been placed by the Parliament in the hands of the Commissioner of Taxation I asked him to consider the matter raised by the Honourable Senator.</PARA>
<PARA> The Commissioner of Taxation has advised me that the uniform maintenance allowance paid to members of the Australian Defence Force has always formed part of their assessable income.</PARA>
<PARA> He said that prior to the introduction of the substantiation provisions the longstanding practice of the Taxation Office was to allow a deduction to the extent of the allowance received. The effect was that no tax was payable on the uniform maintenance allowance. In those circumstances the Tax Office did not require the amount of the allowance to be shown on group certificates and the allowance could be paid without deduction of tax instalments.</PARA>
<PARA> However, it is no longer appropriate for the Taxation Office to adopt this practice of allowing deductions for unvouched expenditure because the substantiation provisions now provide that, where the total amount of employment related expenditure exceeds $300, the taxpayer must be able to substantiate both the full amount and the purpose of the claimed expenditure with receipts or other acceptable documentary evidence.</PARA>
<PARA> The Commissioner added that the allowance is now shown on group certificates and included in income tax returns. However, in recognition of the likelihood that expenditure of the allowance will be substantiated, and therefore deductable, the longstanding arrangement that tax instalment deductions need not be made from the allowance remains in place. The Department of Defence is aware of these arrangements.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Transport and Communications has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question based on advice from Australia Post:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) The NSCA (Vic) was founded in 1928 with the objective of promoting safety and preventing accidents. As a major employer concerned for the well-being of its employees, the former Postmaster-General's Department became a member. It was one of 41 organisations with the power to appoint a representative to the State Council. Australia Post inherited this membership when it was established in 1975. It has been represented on the Council for most of the time since 1975 by its state safety officers, or occupational health and safety officer. Australia Post's involvement has been related to its role as a large employer of labour, and its desire to improve safety in the workplace and the occupational health of its workers.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) Australia Post's involvement with the NSCA (Vic) has been related to its role as a large employer of labour and its desire to take all actions possible to improve safety in the workplace and the occupational health of its employees. It seemed appropriate, therefore, for Australia Post to be a member of the NSCA (Vic).</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Defence has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) The question of whether Australia might wish to be invited to nominate for the post of Commander MFO, Sinai, was raised informally late last year. This question coincided with preparations to meet our impending commitment of a 300-strong contingent to the peacekeeping force in Namibia, as well as Australia's commitment of personnel to the UN Iran/Iraq Military Observer Group and consideration of other possible peacekeeping commitments. The Government decided in view of Australia's heavy commitments to peacekeeping and monitoring forces around the world, and prospective commitments which may arise regionally, that the resumption of a contribution to the MFO Sinai was not warranted at that time.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) No. The Prime Minister was neither involved in this issue nor did he express any view on it to me.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) The position has been filled by the outgoing New Zealand Chief of the General Staff; in view of the above, further comment is redundant.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) No. I would like to draw the Senator's attention to the fact that the Government is committed to the promotion of peace, internationally, as most recently demonstrated by the provision of the Army contingent to the United Nations Transition Assistance Group Namibia, by far Australia's biggest peacekeeping effort to date. Australia provided 106 personnel and helicopters to the MFO from 1982 to 1986, and currently has 28 observers serving with the UN in the Middle East. The Australian Defence Force contribution in this respect is internationally recognised and appreciated as evidenced by their sharing in the Nobel Peace Prize awarded last year to peacekeepers the world over.</PARA>
