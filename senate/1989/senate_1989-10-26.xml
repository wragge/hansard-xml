<TITLE>Privacy Legislation</TITLE>
<PARA>To the Honourable the President and members of the Senate in Parliament assembled; the humble petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth:</PARA>
<PARA> The Hawke Labor Government's Privacy Amendment Bill concerning Credit Reference Reporting will:</PARA>
<PARA> (1) prohibit many legitimate uses of credit information by organisations such as real estate agents, mortgage underwriters, insurance companies, businesses selling goods on credit, and companies renting or leasing goods and equipment.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) add to the cost of business and increase interest rates and insurance charges and lead to over commitment by borrowers.</PARA>
<PARA> Your petitioners therefore humbly pray that the Senate in Parliament assembled should:</PARA>

<TITLE>Medicare: Abortions</TITLE>
<PARA>To the Honourable the President of the Senate and the senators in Parliament assembled: The humble petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth:</PARA>
<PARA> That every abortion kills an unborn human baby.</PARA>
<PARA> That the right to life of all humans is the most fundamental and essential of all human rights.</PARA>
<PARA> That the Government's first duty is to protect this right to life.</PARA>
<PARA> That the most defenceless and threatened lives are those of unborn babies for whom the Government is duty bound to take extra steps to protect.</PARA>
<PARA> That in 1987/88 taxpayers funds through Medicare provided Medical Benefits for 61,879 abortions totalling $6.4 million.</PARA>
<PARA> That in the same year Commonwealth grants to the States indirectly financed the deliberate killing of thousands of other unborn babies in State Public Hospitals.</PARA>
<PARA> Your Petitioners therefore humbly pray that the Australian Parliament will carry out its duty to protect the right to life of Australian babies by ceasing to fund abortions through Medicare, restricting grants to the States and by all other means at its disposal.</PARA>

<PARA>The Honourable President and members of the Senate assembled in Parliament. This petition of the below citizens of Australia draws to the attention of the Senate that we support the continued cover for all abortions on the Medicare schedule. We oppose any attempt to restrict access to the rebate under Medicare.</PARA>
<PARA> Medicare cannot pretend to be a universal health care system without providing a rebate for a termination of pregnancy. Those who will be hardest hit by proposals to restrict access to items 6469, 274 and 275 on the Medicare schedule are poorer and disadvantaged women who will not be able to meet the cost of a non-subsidised abortion.</PARA>

<TITLE>Company Tax Collection System</TITLE>
<PARA>To the Honourable the President and members of the Senate in the Parliament assembled. The petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth that:</PARA>
<PARA> The Government's Budget decision to change the company tax collection system will be a crippling blow to many small businesses, already suffering as a direct result of the Hawke Labor Government's high interest rate policy.</PARA>
<PARA> The earlier remittance of company tax payments to the Government will substantially reduce the cash-flow position of thousands of small businesses.</PARA>
<PARA> Many small businesses will be driven under as a result of the Government's decision-unable to find funds for both tax commitments and new stock, only able to borrow at record high interest rates and unable to claim any tax relief on such borrowings to meet their tax commitment.</PARA>
<PARA> The Government's proposed changes to the company tax collection system has only been introduced as a greedy grab for more tax revenue.</PARA>
<PARA> The small business community would prefer the Government to completely abandon the proposal rather than make only minor alterations to the original Budget decision, which are not likely to alleviate the situation to any significant extent.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances at its meeting this morning considered correspondence from the Minister for Justice (Senator Tate) in regard to the Committee's concerns about the Australian Federal Police (Amendment) Regulations. These concerns were the apparent lack of safeguards and criteria for a legislative scheme under which the Australian Federal Police (AFP) supplied what appeared to be sensitive personal information upon payment of a fee. In addition, the fee could be waived by the AFP Commissioner with no objective criteria for the exercise of this power and with no internal or external review of the merits of an adverse decision.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Committee also considered a letter from the Minister for Telecommunications and Aviation Support (Mrs Kelly) in relation to the Australian Telecommunication Corporation Regulations, which in certain circumstances permitted Telecom to release personal information about subscribers. In both cases the Committee accepted the Minister's explanation subject to further documents being provided. The Committee thanks the Ministers for their co-operation. I seek leave to incorporate in Hansard a brief description of the Committee's scrutiny and its correspondence, for the information of honourable senators and others. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The documents read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA>AUSTRALIAN TELECOMMUNICATIONS CORPORATION REGULATIONS AS CONTAINED IN STATUTORY RULES 1989 NO. 150 AND MADE UNDER THE AUSTRALIAN TELECOMMUNICATIONS CORPORATION ACT 1989</PARA>
<PARA> These Regulations prescribed the circumstances where the duty imposed by the parent Act on Telecom employees not to disclose certain information gained in the course of their employment, does not apply. Most of these circumstances appear reason- able to the Committee, including for example disclosure to a member of the police force, ambulance or fire service as a result of an emergency call, or where there is a serious and imminent threat to life or health. One provision, however, concerned the Committee. This provided for disclosure of ``the affairs or personal particulars'' of a person, including any unlisted phone number or any address, where the person is reasonably likely to be aware that information of that kind is usually disclosed in the circumstances. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee was concerned at the implications for the privacy of individuals affected by this provision. Telecom has a vast data base of information relating to its millions of personal and business subscribers and the Committee was particularly anxious to assure itself that the rights of those subscribers were safeguarded. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister advised the Committee that she agreed that the privacy implications here were extremely important. The Regulations had been drafted to conform to the Information Privacy Principles contained in the Privacy Act. The Minister then gave examples of the type of situation where the provisions of concern to the Committee might apply, and advised that Telecom had given firm assurances that personal details would not be provided as part of a circulation list. Finally the Minister advised that Telecom's policies and procedures for release of personal information were under review, which included consultation with all interested parties, including the Privacy Commissioner. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee replied that it was grateful for the advice that the Regulations were in accordance with the Privacy Act, although the Committee's Principles are broader than that Act and a mere statement that instruments complied with the Information Privacy Principles is not sufficient, by itself, to meet the concerns of the Committee. The Committee accepted the Minister's advice, however, in the light of the Telecom review, pointing out that it may raise this issue again when the review is completed. </PARA>

<PARA>Dear Minister,</PARA>
<PARA>I refer to Australian Telecommunications Corporation Regulations, Statutory Rules 1989 No. 150, considered by the Committee at its meeting of 17 August 1989. </PARA>
<PARA>The Committee notes that the Regulations provide for circumstances under which facts or documents may be disclosed. Most of these circumstances appear to be reasonable. The Committee is concerned, however, that r.3 (c)(i) provides for disclosure-</PARA>
<PARA> (c) where the fact or document relates to the affairs or personal particulars (including any unlisted telephone number or any address) of a person and:</PARA>
<PARA> (i) the person is reasonably likely to be aware that information of that kind is usually disclosed in the circumstances . . . </PARA>
<PARA>The Committee acknowledges that there may be need for a general clause to cover the unexpected, but this provision appears unnecessarily open-ended, relating as it does to the `affairs or personal particulars . . . of a person'. Your advice would be appreciated as to the circumstances in which this provision would be used. The Committee would be concerned if personal details could be sold as part of a circulation list. There appears no explanation in the Explanatory Statement of the kind of use envisaged. </PARA>
<PARA>The Committee would appreciate your advice. </PARA>

<PARA> and Ordinances</PARA>
<PARA>Parliament House</PARA>
<PARA>CANBERRA ACT 2600</PARA>
<PARA>Dear Senator Collins</PARA>
<PARA>Than you for your letter of 29 August 1989 conveying the concerns which the Committee has with regard to the Australian Telecommunications Corporation Regulations (Statutory Rules 1989 No. 150). </PARA>
<PARA>I agree that the privacy considerations involved in regulations such as these are extremely important, particularly when a large organisation such as Telecom, with its significant holdings of personal information, is involved. Accordingly, the Government was concerned that the drafting of the regulations be consistent with the Information Privacy Principles contained in section 14 of the Privacy Act 1988. The wording of regulation 3 (c)(i) derives from Principle 11 (1)(a). </PARA>
<PARA>Telecom have advised that regulations 3 (c)(i) and (ii) are considered necessary to facilitate publication of routine information such as telephone directories; and to provide personal information to the Minister or bodies such as the Ombudsman or the Australian Telecommunications Authority (AUSTEL) where this is required as part of investigating a complaint. This is clearly consistent with the intention of the Information Privacy Principles in enabling individuals to permit, explicitly or implicitly, the release of information about themselves to third parties. </PARA>
<PARA>You expressed concern at the possibility of personal details being sold as part of a circulation list. Telecom have provided firm assurances that it has no intention of selling personal details for circulation list purposes. </PARA>
<PARA>Telecom's policies and procedures for release of personal information are currently under review in light of the new legislative regime. This will involve full consultation with all interested parties, including the Privacy Commissioner. </PARA>
<PARA>I trust that this clarifies the situation for the Committee. </PARA>
<PARA>Yours sincerely</PARA>

<PARA>Minister for Telecommunications and</PARA>
<PARA> Aviation Support</PARA>
<PARA>Parliament House</PARA>
<PARA>CANBERRA ACT 2600</PARA>
<PARA>Dear Minister,</PARA>
<PARA>I refer to your letter of 20 October 1989 concerning aspects raised by the Committee of the Australian Telecommunications Corporation Regulations, Statutory Rules 1989 No 150. </PARA>
<PARA>The Committee noted that you share its concerns about the extremely important privacy considerations in the Regulations, involving as they do the large holdings of personal information by Telecom, and is grateful for this advice. In this context the Committee appreciates your assurance that the Regulations are consistent with the Information Privacy Principles contained in section 14 of the Privacy Act 1988. </PARA>
<PARA>The Committee points out, however, that the mere fact that an instrument of delegated legislation may conform to the Information Privacy Principles is not, by itself, sufficient to meet the concerns of the Committee. The Principles under which the Committee operates are broader than those associated with the Privacy Act and the Committee may require information additional to an assurance that the requirements of that Act have been met. </PARA>
<PARA>In this case you have provided extra advice about the situations where Telecom regards the provisions of r.3 (c) (i) and (ii) as necessary. In particular, the Committee welcomed your advice that Telecom is firm that it does not intend personal details to be provided for circulation list purposes. The Committee's concerns have not been completely satisfied, especially in relation to the circumstances set out in your letter where personal information is supplied to the Minister. Nevertheless, the Committee decided to accept your advice in view of the current review of Telecom's policies and procedures for release of personal information, a review which you advise will involve full consultation with all interested parties, including the Privacy Commissioner. </PARA>
<PARA>The Committee would welcome a copy of the review when it is completed, at which time the Committee may raise these matters with you again. The Committee is, of course, concerned with any possible breach of its Principles even in regard to relatively small numbers of people. Telecom, however, has many millions of personal and business subscribers and you would appreciate that the Committee wishes to be as widely informed as possible on this important question. </PARA>
<PARA>In the meantime, perhaps you could advise the Committee when it is expected that the review will be completed. </PARA>
<PARA>The Committee is grateful for your co-operation. </PARA>
<PARA>Yours sincerely,</PARA>
<PARA>Bob Collins</PARA>

<PARA></PARA>
<PARA>AUSTRALIAN FEDERAL POLICE REGULATIONS (AMENDMENT), AS CONTAINED IN STATUTORY RULES 1989 NO. 139 AND MADE UNDER THE AUSTRALIAN FEDERAL POLICE ACT 1979</PARA>
<PARA>These Regulations provide for the Australian Federal Police to introduce statutory fee charging procedures for services to be provided to individual members of the public, to corporations and to prescribed Commonwealth authorities. Some of these services were, at first glance, quite startling. They included express provision for reports on convictions, on a check of fingerprints, on violence or threats of violence, on road accidents involving death and of death reports. There was no indication in the instrument itself or in the Explanatory Statement of any criteria or safeguards to guide the provision of these services. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee, as one of its terms of reference, scrutinises instruments of delegated legislation to ensure they do not trespass unduly on personal rights and liberties. The right to privacy is one of the most important of these rights. The Committee was extremely concerned at the implications for personal rights of the AFP providing this kind of sensitive information in a fee for service basis. </PARA>
<PARA> In addition, the fees prescribed for these service could be waived at the discretion of the AFP Commissioner. The provision of police services for charities were expressly exempt from the payment of fees, but the Commissioner was granted a discretion in all other cases to waive payment where it would cause financial hardship ``or for any other reason'' that the Commissioner considers appropriate. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee was concerned that this discretion did not appear to be subject to an independent external review of the merits, or even to criteria to guide its exercise. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee wrote to the Minister in these terms. The Minister then advised that the Regulations did not confer a statutory right to these services, or to any documents or information in the possession of the AFP. The Commissioner was, in any event, bound by the provisions of the Privacy Act 1988 when exercising a discretion to provide a particular service. The Minister then explained that a right of review of a decision not to waive a fee was not considered appropriate as a successful appeal could affect the allocation of other police resources or reduce the availability of police for core duties. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee considered the Minister's reply and sought further advice and assurances. These related to additional information on the effect of the Privacy Principles under the Privacy Act 1988 and the power of the Minister to require reports from, or give directions to, the Commissioner in respect of the scheme. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister then advised that the AFP had approached the Privacy Commissioner for advice and that a draft AFP Administrative Circular was under consideration by the Privacy Commissioner. The Minister also confirmed that directions could be given to the Commissioner, and report required, in relation to the scheme. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee accepted this advice, but asked that it receive a copy of the AFP Administrative Circular when it was completed. </PARA>

<PARA>Attorney-General</PARA>

<PARA>CANBERRA ACT 2600</PARA>
<PARA>Dear Minister,</PARA>
<PARA>I refer to the Australian Federal Police Regulations (Amendment), Statutory Rules 1989 No. 139, considered by the Committee at its meeting of 17 August 1989. </PARA>
<PARA>The Committee noted that the Regulations provide for services that may be rendered by the Australian Federal Police at the request of, or under an agreement with, a member of the public, a body corporate or other organisation; or rendered in relation to a prescribed authority of the Commonwealth. </PARA>
<PARA>The Committee is concerned at the implications raised for personal rights and freedoms, particularly privacy, by the provisions of these Regulations. The services prescribed in the Schedules, for example, include reporting on convictions; reporting on `check of fingerprints'; reporting on harassment, violence or threats of violence; providing copies of colour and black and white photographs; providing copies of a road accident report involving injury or death; `providing a copy of a medical report'; providing a copy of a death report and providing a copy of an industrial accident report. </PARA>
<PARA>The Committee recognises there may be circumstances where members of the public, corporations and Commonwealth authorities have legitimate requirements for such information. As they stand, however, there is no indication in the Regulations themselves or in the Explanatory Statement of any criteria, safeguards or review in the rendering of these services. The Committee assumes that these must exist elsewhere in the legislation. The Committee emphasises that it is not sufficient merely for these safeguards to exist elsewhere; they must be fully explained in the Explanatory Statement. At present, the individual Parliamentarian or member of the public is confronted with the instrument and Explanatory Statement which, on their face, are quite open-ended with respect to the furnishing by the AFP of very sensitive information. </PARA>
<PARA>The Committee also noted that regulation 48 gives the Commissioner of Police discretion to waive payment of fees payable under regulations 46 and 47. There appears to be no provision for independent review of the merits of an unfavourable decision by the Commissioner. </PARA>
<PARA>Your urgent advice would be appreciated. </PARA>

<PARA>I refer to your letter of 29 August 1989 to the Attorney-General raising the concerns of the Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances in relation to the Australian Federal Police Regulations (Amendment), Statutory Rules 1989 No. 139 which amends the Australian Federal Police Regulations. </PARA>
<PARA>In essence the Committee's concerns are:</PARA>
<PARA> the implications of the amending regulations and the provision by the Australian Federal Police of the prescribed services listed in the Schedule 6 to the Australian Federal Police Regulations; and</PARA>
<PARA> the absence of independent review of an unfavourable decision by the Commissioner not to waive payment of fees for services rendered by the Australian Federal Police. </PARA>
<PARA>Paragraph 70 (c) of the Australian Federal Police Act 1979 (`the Act') provides that the Governor-General may make regulations making provision for and in relation to the police services that may be rendered by the Australian Federal Police at the request of, or under an agreement with, a member of the public or a body corporate or other organisation (other than an authority of the Commonwealth), and the payment and recovery of such fees as are prescribed in relation to rendering those services. </PARA>
<PARA>Paragraph 70 (d) provides that the Governor-General may make regulations making provision for and in relation to the payment of such fees as are prescribed in relation to policy services rendered by the Australian Federal Police in relation to a prescribed authority of the Commonwealth, where rendering those services is a function of the Australian Federal Police. </PARA>
<PARA>The most significant feature of paragraph 70 (c) of the Act is that it does not allow regulations to be made which confer a right to a police service. The provision of the police service, like all police services, is purely a discretionary matter for the Commissioner (see s.13 of the Act), subject to any written directions by the Minister to the Commissioner with respect to the general policy to be pursued in relation to the performance of the functions of the Australian Federal Police under subsection 13 (2) of the Act. </PARA>
<PARA>Thus, Statutory Rules 1989 No. 139 do not, and cannot, provide persons, organisations or corporations with a statutory right of access to documents or information. In addition, the police services listed in Schedule 6 that may be rendered by the Australian Federal Police, are police services which are additional to the core police functions of the Australian Federal Police. As such it is both necessary and appropriate that the provision of these police services rest solely within the discretion of the Commissioner who must take into account the priorities of the Australian Federal Police and its limited police and financial resources. </PARA>
<PARA>In relation to the Committee's concerns for personal rights and freedoms, particularly privacy, the Commissioner is, when determining whether to provide a particular police service, bound by the Privacy Act 1988. For example, many of the police services listed in Schedule 6 relate to the provision of information to insurance companies with the consent of the person to whom the information relates or to employers with the consent of the person to whom the search of the police records relates or to solicitors for use in civil proceedings. </PARA>
<PARA>The reason why the Explanatory Statement did not make reference to the limitations on the provision of personal information is that Statutory Rules 1989 No. 139 does not create a right to information where such a right does not already exist. The amending regulations merely provide for the payment where a person can be provided with the information within the existing legislative framework. </PARA>
<PARA>I can assure you that where the Commissioner is required to consider whether to exercise his discretion to render a particular service listed in Schedule 6, where the request concerns access to documents or information, he is bound by the Information Privacy Principles (and in particular Principle 11) contained in the Privacy Act 1988. </PARA>
<PARA>With regard to the Committee's concerns about the absence of provision for independent review of the merits of an unfavourable decision by the Commissioner in relation to the waiver of fees payable under regulations 46 and 47, it will have been noted that subregulation 48 (2) provides that a fee is not payable under regulation 46 or 47 where it relates to an activity conducted for a charitable purpose. </PARA>
<PARA>Therefore, where a pop concert with all proceeds to charity is held at Bruce Stadium and the Commissioner agrees to supply members of the Australian Federal Police for security within the Stadium, no fee is payable. </PARA>
<PARA>Subregulation 48 (1) gives the Commissioner the power to waive payment of a fee payable under regulation 46 or 47 where:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) payment of the fee would cause financial hardship; or</PARA>
<PARA> (b) for any other reason, the Commissioner considers it appropriate to waive the fee. </PARA>
<PARA>There is no provision for independent review of the merits of the unfavourable decision by the Commissioner because it is not considered appropriate to place limitations on the Commissioner's sole responsibility to administer and control the Australian Federal Police set out in section 13 of the Act. On the merits review is therefore not appropriate because the Commissioner has a discretion as to whether or not the Australian Federal Police will provide the police service, as is the case with all police services. For example, the Commissioner may only be able to provide police resources to a major sporting event or concert if the fee is to be paid. A subsequent successful appeal could mean that the service would not be provided or alternatively that police resources would not be available for core police duties such as patrolling the suburbs of Canberra at night. </PARA>
<PARA>I do not believe it is either proper or appropriate that the Commissioner's ability to determine how police resources are allocated (taking into account all the circumstances of the Australian Federal Police and the person, body corporate, other organisation or Commonwealth authority) should be circumscribed by an independent review process in relation to what are, in any case, additional police functions for the Australian Federal Police which are performed as a community service. </PARA>
<PARA>It should also be mentioned that where the request relates to information or documents the requested information may be available under the Freedom of Information Act 1982 where independent review of the merits to decisions in relation to release and fees is available. It will be noted that the FOI Act creates rights. This is not the case in relation to the police services to which regulations 46, 47 and 48 apply. </PARA>

<PARA>Dear Minister,</PARA>
<PARA>I refer to your letter of 4 October 1989 on aspects raised by the Committee of the Australian Federal Police Regulations (Amendment), Statutory Rules 1989 No. 139. The Committee considered your letter at its Meeting of 5 October 1989. </PARA>
<PARA>The Committee noted your detailed explanation, but would appreciate additional advice and assurances before coming to a decision on this matter. </PARA>
<PARA>Your letter advised that many of the police services in Schedule 6 relate to requests by insurance companies, employers and solicitors and are made with the consent of the individual to whom the information relates. The Committee would welcome further details of cases where information may be sought where the consent of the individual concerned has not been obtained. In particular, could you advise the Committee of the effect of the Privacy Act 1988 and the Privacy Principles, including Principle 11, in such cases. </PARA>
<PARA>Your letter also dealt with the wide discretion of the Commissioner to waive fees for services, and the lack of a right of review of a decision not to waive. The Committee accepted your advice but seeks your confirmation that the Minister would be able to give written directions to the Commissioner under subsection 13 (2) of the Australian Federal Police Act, and would be able to require the Commissioner to furnish a report under subsection 13 (6) of the Act, in respect of this matter. </PARA>
<PARA>Your co-operation would be appreciated. </PARA>

<PARA>23 October 1989</PARA>
<PARA>Dear Bob</PARA>
<PARA>I refer to your letter of 5 October 1989 seeking my further advice and assurances on aspects of the Australian Federal Police Regulations (Amendment), Statutory Rules 1989 No. 139. </PARA>
<PARA>The Committee has sought further details of instances where information may be sought from the Australian Federal Police (`AFP') and released by the AFP without the consent of the individual concerned being previously obtained. In these circumstances you were also concerned to know the effect of the Privacy Act 1988 and Privacy Principles, including Principle 11. </PARA>
<PARA>I am advised that the AFP has released information in some instances without having first obtained the consent of the information provider. Following the introduction of the Privacy Act, the AFP approached the Privacy Commissioner for advice as to how such matters should be handled henceforth. It is intended that future releases should be the subject of an AFP Administrative Circular-which is binding on all members and staff members of the AFP. I am advised that the terms of a draft circular are at present under consideration by the Privacy Commissioner. </PARA>
<PARA>The Committee has also sought my confirmation that the Minister has power to issue written directions to the AFP Commissioner under subsection 13 (2) of the Australian Federal Police Act 1979 (`the Act') and that the Minister is able to require the Commissioner of the AFP to furnish a report under subsection 13 (6) of the Act in respect of a decision not to waive fees applicable under the Regulations. </PARA>
<PARA>To take the latter issue first, I confirm that subsection 13 (6) of the Act gives the Minister a clear power to require the AFP Commissioner to furnish to the Minister reports relating to the administration of the fee for police services regime contemplated by these regulations. Furthermore, I can confirm for the benefit of the Committee that the Minister has power under section 13 (2) of the Act to give the AFP Commissioner written directions in relation to the fee for police services regime, in so far as such written directions would relate to the general policy to be pursued by the AFP in relation to the performance of its functions. The Minister's power in these circumstances would not extend to giving written directions in relation to individual cases.</PARA>

<PARA>Dear Minister,</PARA>
<PARA>I refer to your letter of 23 October 1989 concerning aspects raised by the Committee of the Australian Federal Police Regulations (Amendment), Statutory Rules 1989 No. 139. The Committee considered your reply at its Meeting of 26 October 1989. </PARA>
<PARA>The Committee noted that future releases of information would be the subject of an AFP Administrative Circular which will be binding on all members and staff members of the AFP and, in particular, that the terms of a draft circular are at present under consideration by the Privacy Commissioner. The Committee is grateful for your advice on this aspect and believes that the involvement of the Privacy Commissioner is a helpful development in meeting the concerns of the Committee about the treatment by the AFP of this very sensitive matter. It would be appreciated if you could send a copy of the circular to the Committee when its terms are finalised. </PARA>
<PARA>The Committee also considered your advice concerning the power of the Minister to require information from, and to give directions to, the AFP Commissioner, in respect of this matter. The Committee particularly noted your advice that the Minister had a clear power to require reports from the Commissioner on the administration of the fees provided for in the Regulations and to give to the Commissioner written directions on the general policy to be pursued by the AFP in relation to the fees for police services. The Committee believes that the existence of such powers, to be exercised by a Minister who is subject to personal scrutiny in the Parliament, also helps to meet the concerns of the Committee. </PARA>
<PARA>The Committee is grateful for your advice, which meets its concerns. By way of observation, however, the Committee points out that the Regulations were made on 28 June 1989 and were gazetted on 30 June 1989. The AFP Administrative Circular, on the other hand, is apparently not yet complete at the end of October 1989, some four months later. In the meantime the general scheme of operation as provided for in the Regulations has been commented on in the popular press. The Committee believes that when schemes of this nature are introduced, involving as they do the discretionary provision of sensitive information or services to the general public, for fees which may be waived at the discretionary decision, not limited by objective criteria or subject to internal or external review, of a public official, that administrative documents such as AFP Circulars should be prepared before the introduction of the scheme. </PARA>
<PARA>The Committee appreciates your co-operation in this matter. </PARA>
<PARA>Yours sincerely,</PARA>

<PARA> The speeches read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA>INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT AMENDMENT BILL 1989</PARA>
<PARA> This Bill introduces measures to give effect to some of the Treasurer's 1989-90 Budget announcements. </PARA>
<PARA> The income tax law will be amended to require major employers to remit pay-as-you-earn tax deductions, withheld from the salary or wages of their employees, to the Commissioner of Taxation on a twice-monthly basis. </PARA>
<PARA> Other Budget announcements to be given effect will vary the operation of the quarterly provisional tax system and provide for the method of calculating 1989-90 provisional tax. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Chairman, I will now outline in more detail these measures. </PARA>
<PARA>Twice-monthly Remittance of Tax Instalment Deductions</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> The Bill will require some employers registered under the group employer scheme to pay to the Commissioner of Taxation on a twice-monthly basis, the PAYE tax instalment deductions they make from the salary or wages of their employees on or after 1 December 1989. </PARA>
<PARA> Employers affected by this change will be those who deducted more than $5 million in tax instalments in the financial year ended 30 June 1989, or who do so in a later financial year. </PARA>
<PARA> Employers who are members of a wholly-owned company group may also be required to remit their tax instalment deductions to the Commissioner on a twice-monthly basis. </PARA>
<PARA> This rule will apply where the total amount of the deductions made by all the employers in the company group during the financial year ended 30 June 1989, or in a later year, exceed $5 million. </PARA>
<PARA> Employers who are subject to the new rules will be required to pay all deductions made in the first 14 days of a month by the twenty-first day of that month. </PARA>
<PARA> Deductions made in the balance of the month are to be paid over by no later than the seventh day of the next month. </PARA>
<PARA> Once employers start to remit tax instalment deductions on a twice-monthly basis they must continue to do so unless the Commissioner determines otherwise because of a significant change in their circumstances. </PARA>
<PARA> This measure is the first step towards revised PAYE remittance arrangements that would require larger employers to remit twice-monthly but with less frequent remittances than at present by smaller employers, which could obviate the need for the tax stamps system. </PARA>
<PARA> The amendment will produce a one-off revenue gain of $550 million in 1989-90.</PARA>
<PARA> Additionally, outlays on public debt interest will reduce by $20 million in 1989-90 and $70 million in subsequent years. </PARA>
<PARA>Quarterly Provisional Tax</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> The Bill will give effect to two Budget proposals adjusting the operation of the quarterly instalment system of paying provisional tax. </PARA>
<PARA> The threshold for general exemption from the instalment system will be increased from $5,000 to $8,000. </PARA>
<PARA> As a consequence, a taxpayer whose provisional tax payable in a year of income is $8,000 or less will not be required to pay instalments of provisional tax in the following year. </PARA>
<PARA> This change will apply to provisional tax payable in the current and subsequent income years. </PARA>
<PARA> Some 130,000 of the existing 320,000 instalment payers will now be required to pay provisional tax only on an annual basis. Of this large number who will benefit from the change, some 45,000 are over 60 years of age. </PARA>
<PARA> This proposal is estimated to increase outlays on public debt interest by $20 million in 1989-90 and $70 million in subsequent years. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill will also give effect to another proposal to preclude a too early offset of provisional tax credit in a year of income against provisional tax charged for the succeeding year. </PARA>
<PARA> Credit arises where income tax assessed as payable for an income year is less than the credit for provisional tax previously paid for that year. </PARA>
<PARA> Under the change, any excess provisional tax credit will no longer be offset against a quarterly instalment of provisional tax for the succeeding year which has been notified but is not yet due for payment. </PARA>
<PARA> This change will apply from the date of Royal Assent to the Bill. </PARA>
<PARA>Provisional Tax for 1989-90</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> Provisional tax is that part of the pay-as-you-earn system designed to collect tax on non salary or wage income within the year in which the income is derived. </PARA>
<PARA> It follows that the amount of provisional tax charged should approximate as closely as practicable the amount of tax actually imposed for the year. </PARA>
<PARA> This Bill provides for 1989-90 provisional tax to be calculated on the basis of 1988-89 taxable income increased by 10 per cent, and by applying the 1989-90 rates of tax, Medicare levy and the increased low income thresholds for Medicare levy that are to apply in that year. </PARA>
<PARA> Subject to the exceptions I will announce, rebates and credits will be allowed in the provisional tax calculation at the levels allowed in 1988-89 assessments. </PARA>
<PARA> Any rebate of tax allowed on franked dividends will be adjusted, before being increased by 10 per cent, to account for the reduction in the company tax rate from 49 per cent to 39 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> In addition, credits for foreign tax paid will be uplifted by 10 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> Concessional rebates claimed in 1988-89 for a dependent spouse, daughter-housekeeper, invalid relative, parent or parent-in-law or for a housekeeper and the sole parent rebate will be adjusted to reflect the new higher 1989-90 levels. </PARA>
<PARA> Changes will also be made to some claims for zone rebates and the rebates for Defence Force members serving overseas or civilians serving with the United Nations. The 1989-90 provisional tax will be calculated after increasing any such rebate by 20 per cent of the adjustment made to the taxpayer's 1988-89 concessional rebate claim. </PARA>
<PARA> Taxpayers who estimate that their taxable income for 1988-89 will increase by less than 10 per cent, or who consider that their rebates or credits will be at a higher level in 1989-90, will continue to have the right to `self assess' and have the provisional tax for 1989-90 recalculated on the basis of their own estimates. </PARA>
<PARA> The reduction in the uplift factor from the 12 per cent that was applied in calculating 1988-90 provisional tax to 10 per cent for 1989-90 provisional tax is estimated to cost $160 million in 1989-90. </PARA>
<PARA> I commend the Bill to the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA>INCOME TAX AMENDMENT BILL (No. 2) 1989</PARA>
<PARA> This Bill will amend the Income Tax Act 1986 to formally impose the rates of income tax payable by individuals and trustees generally for the 1989-90 financial year and, until the Parliament otherwise provides, for the 1990-91 financial year. </PARA>
<PARA> It will also impose for the same period the rates of tax payable by companies, registered organisations and unit trusts that are treated as companies. </PARA>
<PARA> In addition, it will impose the rates of tax on superannuation funds, approved deposit funds and pooled superannuation trusts. </PARA>
<PARA> The rates to be imposed by the measures in this Bill are those declared in the Income Tax Rates Act 1986. </PARA>
<PARA> New personal rates of tax apply for 1989-90 following the changes announced in the April 1989 Economic Statement. </PARA>
<PARA> A five step tax scale applies. </PARA>
<PARA> At the lower end of the scale for resident taxpayers, no tax is payable on taxable incomes up to $5,100. On taxable incomes in the range $5,101 to $17,650 the rate is 21 per cent. In the range $17,651 to $20,600 the rate is 29 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> For income in the range $20,601 to $35,000 the rate is 39 per cent and a rate of 47 per cent applies for income in the range $35,000 to $50,000. Income over $50,000 is taxed at a composite rate of 48 per cent, reflecting the reduction in the top rate of personal tax from 49 per cent to 47 per cent from 1 January 1990. </PARA>
<PARA> These general rates also apply to non-residents who receive Australian social security and repatriation pensions that are taxable in Australia, or who were residents at any time during the income year. </PARA>
<PARA> For other non-resident taxpayers, the rate of 29 per cent applies to incomes up to $20,600 and the higher general rates apply to incomes above that level. </PARA>
<PARA> For 1989-90 the rate for all unearned income of resident minors, subject to shading-in arrangements for such income just over $416, is 48 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> That rate also applies to trustees assessed under section 99a of the Income Tax Assessment Act, and on other categories of income that are subject to anti-avoidance provisions of that Act. </PARA>
<PARA> The general company tax rate payable in respect of 1988-89 income, which applies also for unit trusts that are treated as companies, is 39 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> Specified tax rates apply in respect of the various components of taxable income of life assurance companies and registered organisations. </PARA>
<PARA> For any component of 1988-89 income referable to policies held by complying funds or in respect of rollover annuities the rate is 15 per cent. A rate of 49 per cent applies for any component referable to policies held by non-complying funds. </PARA>
<PARA> The rate for the component of income for 1988-89 referable to other life assurance and accident and disability insurance is 39 per cent where the insurer is a life assurance office, and 30 per cent where the insurer is a registered organization. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, the rate of tax generally applying for complying superannuation funds, approved deposit funds and pooled superannuation trusts is 15 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA> The provisions of the Bill are explained in detail in the Explanatory Memorandum that accompanied the Income Tax Assessment Amendment Bill 1989 I have just introduced. </PARA>
<PARA> I commend the Bill to the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA>MEDICARE LEVY AMENDMENT BILL 1989</PARA>
<PARA> The Medicare Levy Amendment Bill 1989 will amend the Medicare Levy Act 1986 to impose the basic rate of Medicare levy for 1989-90 and, until the Parliament otherwise provides, for 1990-91. </PARA>
<PARA> The basic rate of the levy will remain at 1.25 per cent of taxable income, the level that has applied since 1 December 1986. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill also contains increases in the income threshold levels below which people with low incomes will not be called on to pay any levy. </PARA>
<PARA> For 1989-90, individuals with taxable incomes of up to $10,330 and married couples and sole parents with family incomes of up to $17,400 will not be required to pay the levy. </PARA>
<PARA> The income threshold for married couples and sole parents will continue to be increased by a further $2,100 for each dependent child or student. </PARA>
<PARA> For example, a married couple with three dependent children will pay no levy until their combined taxable incomes exceed $23,700. </PARA>

<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The speeches read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA>GOAT FIBRE LEVY BILL 1989</PARA>
<PARA> The purpose of this Bill is to introduce new legislation to enable a levy to be collected on the sale of goat fibre. Funds from this levy are to be directed specifically into research for the betterment of the goat fibre industry. </PARA>
<PARA> Associated with this Bill is the Goat Fibre Levy Collection Bill 1989 which allows the levy moneys to be collected and provides for their forwarding to the Australian Special Rural Research Fund. The funds will form a sub-account within the Australian Special Rural Research Fund which is dedicated to goat fibre research. The participation within the Australian Special Rural Research Fund ensures a Commonwealth contribution to goat fibre research while avoiding the expense of a separate statutory authority which would not be justified for an industry of this size. </PARA>
<PARA> The goat fibre industry comprises mohair, cashmere and, more recently, cashgora sectors. These industries have made an increasing contribution to Australian export earnings, and export earnings are expected to approach $10 million this year. In addition, there are the associated products of meat and hides from goat slaughter and the export of live goats. </PARA>
<PARA> These goat industries have been expanding and frequently complement the traditional pastoral industries of sheep and cattle production as they use resources which would not otherwise be fully utilised. This is particularly the case with some weeds such as thistles and blackberries which could require chemical control if goats were not used. A small expanding industry such as goat fibre production offers many promising opportunities for research in the area of animal production, fibre harvesting, marketing, economics and processing. However, the industry has limited capacity to organise and fund the required research. Despite this, the goat industry has made considerable effort to support research projects. This has been undertaken by a number of independent voluntary funds and some Commonwealth funds from the Australian Special Rural Research Fund. While the industry has identified research priorities, programs have rested on a precarious funding base with limited capacity to expand to meet the needs of an emerging industry. </PARA>
<PARA> A more substantive, ongoing and co-ordinated research program is required if the needs of this industry are to be met. This is particularly the case as this industry is export oriented and so must meet the vagaries of international markets and compete with producers in a range of countries, some with a long history of fibre production and others with newly emerging industries. </PARA>
<PARA> In December 1988 the National Goat Fibre Workshop was convened. This workshop comprised representatives of the various goat fibre industry groups who were supported by brokers, buyers, the fibre testing sector and research groups. At this workshop, the grower organisations recognised the benefits of a co-ordinated research program encompassing all goat fibre organisations. </PARA>
<PARA> The degree of support for such a unified research effort was reflected in the subsequent request received from the four goat industry grower organisations. They requested that the Commonwealth enact legislation to collect a statutory levy of 1.5% on the gross value of sales of goat fibre. This rate of expenditure on research will be amongst the highest of any Australian agricultural industry. In addition, the industry contribution will be substantially greater than the Commonwealth's maximum contribution of 0.5% of the gross value of production in the industry. </PARA>
<PARA> The willingness of the various sectors of this industry to work together and make a significant contribution to sponsoring change and improvement is reflected in the fact that they have suggested that an appropriate maximum rate for this research levy should be 5% of the value of fibre sales. </PARA>
<PARA> The legislation provides for the initial levy rate of 1.5% and the maximum rate of 5% as requested by the industry. Provision is also made for any recommendations from the goat industry organisations to be taken into account prior to altering the operative rate of the levy. </PARA>
<PARA> Initiating the levy on 1 January 1990 will allow the accumulation of some funds before the beginning of the 1990-91 financial year. This should allow research objectives to be assessed and individual research projects to be funded from the commencement of the 1990-91 financial year. </PARA>
<PARA> The goat fibre industry will benefit from an industry wide research program which is administered by a professional research administration organisation, namely the Australian Special Rural Research Council which was established by the Rural Industries Research Act 1985. In addition the industry will have the benefit of a guaranteed Commonwealth contribution to the research effort. Initially the industry levy is expected to raise around $150,000 with an additional Commonwealth contribution of around $50,000. The Special Research Council will, therefore, be able to implement a goat fibre research program of around $200,000 annually. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe this industry desires to make a substantial commitment to research and that the potential benefits for both the industry and Australia would justify the research effort. Because of this I believe the Commonwealth should provide the supportive mechanism as well as a financial commitment to this research. </PARA>
<PARA> Honourable Senators, I commend the Bill to the House and present the Explanatory Memorandum to the Bill. </PARA>
<PARA>GOAT FIBRE LEVY COLLECTION BILL 1989</PARA>
<PARA> The purpose of this Bill is to provide the machinery necessary for collecting the levy imposed by the Goat Fibre Levy Bill 1989. </PARA>
<PARA> This Bill should be read as one with the Goat Fibre Levy Bill 1989 and is to also come into operation on 1 January 1990 the same day that the Levy Bill becomes operative. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill specifies the liability of purchasers and receivers under the scheme, outlines penalties for non-compliance and provides appropriate powers of enforcement. </PARA>
<PARA> There are no financial implications other than those covered in the Second Reading Speech for the Goat Fibre Levy Bill 1989. </PARA>
<PARA> Honourable Senators, I commend the Bill to the House and present the Explanatory Memorandum to the Bill. </PARA>

<PARA> That intervening Government Business be postponed till after consideration of Message No. 515 of the House of Representatives relating to the National Health Amendment Bill 1989. </PARA>
<PARA>Yesterday the Senate considered that this was a particularly important matter which would be dealt with. Yesterday we had a lengthy debate which was not concluded and it seems to the Australian Democrats that the reasons that issue was an important one have not diminished in any way. It is still an important issue and it is appropriate to conclude that debate as expeditiously as possible. Moreover, I note that the debate is almost completed. It seems to me that the outcome will be fairly readily determined. Therefore, the debate could probably be quickly completed and a result determined. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government appears still to be in negotiation with pharmacists on this matter. In view of the continuing uncertainty in the community as to the position of the Parliament in relation to this matter, it would seem desirable that this debate be completed as rapidly as possible so that the Government is negotiating with the pharmacists from a position in which the position of the Parliament is well known. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, in speaking to this motion it would seem to me that the reasons which were brought forward yesterday as to why this matter should be dealt with expeditiously have in no way diminished in their force. It is therefore appropriate that we continue and complete this debate forthwith. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1"> -The debate yesterday had a number of factors in it. I want to ask the Minister whether the Department, in terms of the destruction of so many pharmacists, has actually had information as to who the pharmacists were who were going out of business. I will give an example which I did not use yesterday but which was reinforced yesterday by a number of the people who were here. I made the point that many of the pharmacists who will be destroyed will be the old pharmacists, the ones who are not in modern locations, in other words, who are not in shopping centres where there are drive-in facilities. Pharmacists who have been in the business over a reasonably long period have small fronted shops and depend very much on prescription income.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Yesterday one of our Democrat senators, Senator Coulter, was speaking to such a person. The difficulty that these people face is that they have their entire superannuation tied up in those pharmacies, that is, their entire retirement income. Currently they are not able to sell those pharmacies. In fact, the bottom has dropped out of the pharmacy retail business because of the mere announcement of the determination. Honourable senators would realise that there are three components to incomes for pharmacies: the shopfront, the pharmaceutical area and the subsidiary areas that go with that. </PARA>
<PARA> When one is selling there are also three elements involved: stock, lease and goodwill. The stock is still able to be sold. The lease cannot be sold, because it is often attached to the business itself, and the goodwill has disappeared. So those pharmacies which prior to this announcement were worth while, ongoing retail businesses are now not able to be moved at all and yet they tend to be-this is what I have been able to discover and I want to know what the Government has been able to discover-run by older pharmacists nearing retirement who have their entire retirement package tied up in those pharmacies. If the Government has come to the same conclusion that that is the case, I would be interested to know what specifically is going to be provided for them. </PARA>
<PARA> My second question relates to amalgamation support. Has the Government given any consideration to the problem that amalgamating pharmacies which are not owned-and most pharmacies are leased-will have different operating leases? It is fairly obvious that two pharmacies operating on different lease arrangements cannot be amalgamated. What does the Government propose to do in respect of pharmacies which have different leases? A case was brought to my attention yesterday of one pharmacy which had a lease for 18 months and another a lease for six years. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will make my final contribution by indicating the Opposition's position in regard to the motion that is before the Committee. The first question that will be put is that the Senate does not insist on amendment No. 1 and agrees to the amendment made in place thereof. The Opposition will be supporting that question which simply establishes a new commencement date for the imposition of the higher maximum patient contribution. The Senate originally proposed a substitute date. The House of Representatives has rejected that and has proposed a new date, namely 1 January 1990, for the commencement. We will support that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The second question that will be put to the Committee is that the Senate does not insist on amendment No. 2. We, of course, will be opposing that question. Amendment No. 2 seeks to strike down the Pharmaceutical Benefits Remuneration Tribunal determination of 28 August last. We believe that that determination should be struck down and, therefore, we will be insisting on the Senate amendment. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to take two minutes to refer to a constitutional question-namely, whether this Bill in any sense falls within the ambit of potential double dissolution legislation. I want to make it clear that it is our view that at this stage this Bill does not. Because of the change of date which has been made by the House of Representatives, we are now dealing with the Bill, as it were, on the first occasion for the purposes of section 57 of the Constitution, rather than dealing with the Bill on the second occasion. Before this Bill starts to come within the ambit of being considered double dissolution legislation, the statutory three-month waiting period would have to apply and it would have to be reintroduced into the Senate for debate and dealt with in a particular fashion. In fact, it would have to be reintroduced in precisely the same form as it is currently being dealt with today-namely, with a 1 January 1990 commencement date even if the matter were dealt with after 1 January. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="TI4">Senator PUPLICK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes. The precedent for this is that the sales tax Bills, which were passed by the House of Representatives for a second time in February 1982 and which were the basis for the double dissolution of 1983, still contained the commencement date of 1 January 1982. In the debate in the House of Representatives the responsible Minister stated that constitutional considerations required that the date not be altered. We accept that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As Senator Macklin said by way of interjection, the double dissolution question was raised yesterday by the distinguished and electorally learned Senator Cook. I simply want to place on record our understanding that because the House of Representatives has made an amendment to this Bill, it is a different Bill from the one which we last dealt with on, I think, 27 September. As a result, this constitutes the first approach to a Bill for the purposes of the operation of section 57 of the Constitution. It will be in the hands of the Government to determine within the three-month and six-month parameters which are set out in the Constitution how it wishes to proceed. </PARA>
<PARA> I have simply taken the opportunity to place on record what we will do in relation to the two questions which will be put to the Committee. I have put our view in relation to the question of constitutional requirements for the purposes of section 57 of the Constitution. I believe that in all other respects the views of the Opposition have been well canvassed in this matter and I have nothing further to add to the debate. </PARA>

<PARA> Senator Macklin asked a couple of specific questions. I thought that most of those matters were still under negotiation. One has to get to base one before one can determine the sorts of questions that Senator Macklin is raising. I do not think that the negotiations have got to base one. Many views have been put forward on the negotiation. Unfortunately, the grounds have changed several times, not the least of which when members of the Pharmacy Guild of Australia came to see the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) and others. Certain preconditions were laid down for negotiations and the Guild broke them within a few minutes. That makes it very hard to negotiate. I understand that negotiations are still continuing. The matters that Senator Macklin has raised are always difficult; good will is always difficult. But we have the same problem with taxi plates in the Australian Capital Territory. Do we say that we will not issue any more and therefore increase the value of those plates? At the moment they are up to $250,000. What is the monopoly on goodwill? I do not know. All these questions are difficult, as Senator Macklin has indicated, when we want to rationalise an industry. But hard things have to be done when we want to rationalise an industry. We just cannot continue to have inefficient industries in this country. Some sacrifices have to be made. Hopefully, though, those sacrifices should always be made evenly and should not fall on just one specific section. That is the guts of Senator Macklin's question. I cannot answer it because I still think it is a negotiable matter in the context of discussion. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Today we are debating the Electoral and Referendum Amendment Bill 1988. I find this quite amazing because the Hawke Labor Government has shown a rather strange reluctance to submit this Bill to any systematic debate. It was introduced last year, shelved and then debated in a rather piecemeal and disjointed fashion in the previous session of the Senate. Now we suddenly see it re-emerge today. Of course, we would have seen it re-emerge yesterday if the Government had had its way in trying to put off debate on the National Health Amendment Bill because of its reluctance to debate the pharmacy issue. We can only speculate as to whether the delay in debating this Bill is some indication of the Government's lack of concern for the electoral system or whether, in rather characteristic fashion, this Government has something to hide or wants to add something to its last minute advantage.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Bill covers many issues related to changing the way in which people can vote and the entitlement of those who can vote. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="TH4">Senator KNOWLES</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will come to that point soon because it is of great concern to the Opposition that prisoners will be given the vote. What we have really seen from this Government over a period is a range of measures to ensure its electoral success at the polls. It has the hide to rabbit on about gerrymanders and the like, yet in this Bill we find some rather amazing changes. Examples of what we have seen from Government members in just very recent times include a Minister, Ros Kelly, using a statutory authority, Telecom Australia, to push herself and the Government. There have been attempted increases in the postal allowance for members of the House of Representatives, quite clearly overturning a decision of the Remuneration Tribunal despite its being an independent remuneration tribunal. But the Government will not overturn an independent remuneration tribunal's decision on pharmacists' income. Nonetheless, that was another ploy to try to increase its electoral advantage. We have seen the ever-increasing use of taxpayers' money to fund an unashamedly biased National Media Liaison Service. We have had the proposal to abolish paid party advertising in the electronic media. The Government wants all donations to be declared because it feels that that is one way to intimidate many of the conservative donors. Of course, it will not intimidate the unions. The list goes on.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This Bill also seeks to provide for the printing and distribution of electoral rolls to senators, members and political parties no later than the end of the second year of each parliament. One could probably say, `About time'. I threw my last lot of electoral rolls out the other day. They were dated 1984 and are now about as useful as an ashtray on a motorbike. So it is about time that the printing of such rolls was brought up to date. It has been a thing of the past since this Government came to office and as a result we have witnessed multiple voting and rorting generally. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister knows full well. He does not need to play innocent with me. Another restriction the Government is attempting to place on candidates for election is in the entering of hospitals, special hospitals, nursing homes and similar institutions after the writs for an election have been issued. Why should people in institutions be prevented from meeting candidates and learning what they have to offer just because they are in those institutions? Maybe the Government does not want individuals to make value judgments prior to an election but prefers them to accept everything it says as gospel and put out through the biased National Media Liaison Service. How dare any government deny people access to information simply because they are in hospital or similar institutions? We will therefore be seeking in the committee stage to omit this clause.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> A further amendment was moved by my colleague Senator Puplick in the debate that took place on this matter some months ago which dealt with the process of redistribution, and specifically where a party obtains a majority of votes on a two party preferred basis but actually loses seats. If one needs further examples of how hypocritical this Labor Government is when it bleats on about the gerrymanders and the States one has only to look to Government members. They are masters of it. At the last Federal election the coalition parties actually obtained more votes than the Labor Party. However, the coalition lost seats while the Labor Party gained seats. </PARA>
<PARA> An even more recent example can be found in my own State of Western Australia. In February this year the Liberal and National parties actually obtained 4.4 per cent more votes that the Labor Party on a two party preferred vote. When the Liberal and National parties actually achieved that 4.4 per cent higher number of votes than the Labor Party one would have naturally expected them to have won, but, no, the Labor Party won more seats yet again. The question should also be asked as to who introduced the gerrymander in Queensland. For those who may not know, it was the Australian Labor Party. For these very reasons we are moving an amendment to attempt to ensure that the Commonwealth has legislation to ensure that any party that wins more than 50 per cent of the votes achieves more than 50 per cent of the seats. </PARA>
<PARA> I also wish to address the issue raised in clause 35 of the Bill, which provides for a new section 96a to be placed in the Electoral Act, allowing all prisoners other than those convicted of treason to retain their enrolment or to enrol to vote in Federal elections. The coalition opposes this out of hand. It is the second time that the Government is changing the procedures for prisoners to vote. It broadened the criteria once before. Now it is saying that anyone other than those who have been charged with and convicted of treason will be entitled to vote. I could be wrong, but I do not recall anyone in this country actually being imprisoned for treason. It is really only a bit of tokenism. The Labor Party has already broadened the entitlement since coming to office. It is now just treating prisoners as though they have committed no crime against society at all and should be entitled to all the privileges of law abiding citizens. The Opposition simply does not subscribe to that belief. It could well be argued that it is anomalous for people to retain their right to vote when members of parliament are disqualified if they are convicted of an offence with a penalty of more than 12 months imprisonment. </PARA>
<PARA> One may well ask why people can vote for a parliamentary representative and yet cannot be a member of parliament. I submit that to propose such a legislative change displays a real contempt for the Parliament and, perhaps more so, a contempt for the victims of the crimes. While I am in favour of rehabilitation of criminals I do not believe that a psychopathic killer should have equal rights with responsible and law abiding citizens. I cannot understand why this Government believes he should. When people choose to commit a crime they choose not to participate in the end in valuable parts of society. Why should they then have extended to them by this Government all the rights that everybody else has?</PARA>
<PARA> Is the Government telling the victims of criminals that these evildoers have as much right to participate in the democratic process as the victims have? Yes, it is. I do not believe that the victims of criminals want that sort of right extended to criminals. It is wrong in principle to allow people to choose the government of our society when they have shown, by their own actions, that they are, for a time at least, unfit to participate in society. There is much concern in the community today that the penalties imposed in the courts are too light, that people get out of prison too soon and that the parole system is a joke, yet this Government is saying, `Well, it does not really matter about any of those things because we are going to give them all the rights and entitlements of an ordinary member of society anyway'. </PARA>
<PARA> The authorities in Western Australia are all too aware that their prisons contain a couple who murdered four women in very depraved and sadistic circumstances. They contain several other men who committed murder for sexual gratification, and they contain a man who callously shot two young people because the colour of their skin was different from his. Should those prisoners be entitled to choose a government? I hardly think so, but obviously the Government thinks otherwise. </PARA>
<PARA> The public outrage when this measure was first introduced-it goes back to last year-was quite evident, and maybe that is part of the reason why the Government has sought to dilly-dally about bringing it back into the Parliament. There is an awareness out there that the Government has broadened the entitlement already. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to make only a few remarks in this debate. In particular, I want to express concern about the manner in which the present electoral arrangements allow organisations which are in fact financially funded by this Government to advertise at election time without revealing at any stage, as I understand it, the extent to which those organisations are themselves receiving funds from the Federal Labor Government. This is not something new and I acknowledge that, but it is of major concern, particularly when those organisations are being used as a vehicle for the washing, through community groups, of electoral contributions which are in fact a clear benefit to a particular party, such a contribution in one instance having gone directly to the Australian Labor Party's electoral campaign.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The reasons for my concern emerge from what happened before the 1987 election. I refer the Senate to the Australian newspaper, which in 1987 reported that on the last day of Federal Parliament before the 1987 election the Prime Minister, Mr Hawke, made an announcement which Australian conservationists were waiting to hear. He announced that he would seek World Heritage listing for most of north Queensland's rainforests. The Australian reported that Mr Hawke did not make this important announcement in Parliament but from the Lodge and in the presence of most of Australia's influential environmental lobbyists. The report said:</PARA>
<PARA> Two most influential groups, the Australian Conservation Foundation and the Wilderness Society . . . have apparently convinced government they can influence a sizable percentage of the electorate, particularly in targeted marginal seats . . . The Labor Party can now rely on the support of Australia's leading conservation groups in its election campaign. </PARA>
<PARA>During that election campaign there was no requirement and, as I understand it, there has been no requirement subsequently for those bodies to reveal the extent to which they have been funded by the Federal Government. I wonder to what extent taxpayers' money went through those organisations and was spent on advertisements, public relations or press releases attacking the coalition parties. It seems to me that there is a clear moral requirement that, where bodies funded by this Government support the Government and attack the Opposition, their vested interest in that matter should be revealed. I note that subsequently in the article to which I was referring the Australian reported:</PARA>
<PARA> Australia's main conservation organizations are planning their largest political campaigns-including radio, television and press advertisements to tell voters in marginal seats not to vote Liberal. </PARA>
<PARA>By the way, as I mentioned, no press report at that time nor any subsequent report mentioned that both the Australian Conservation Foundation and the Wilderness Society are patronised by the Government through taxpayers' funding and in other important ways. It did not mention-and I mention it in passing-that many genuine conservationists, many people genuinely concerned with the environment, do not support either of these organisations. Again I say in passing that I find it moderately offensive that so many people list statements by these organisations as representing all the environmentalists or all conservationists when in fact that is patently not so. But that is just by the way. </PARA>
<PARA> It strikes me as remarkable that those bodies which had received substantial Government funding were looked on and continue to be looked on favourably by this Government after their political involvement in the 1987 election whereas, as we all remember, the Tasmanian Aboriginal Centre was brought down to earth with something of a bang by the Federal Government's Department of Aboriginal Affairs when it announced that it intended to campaign against the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs and the Australian Labor Party in the 1987 election. The head of the Department of Aboriginal Affairs immediately told the Secretary of the Tasmanian Aboriginal Centre that if he:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . wanted to pursue the campaign against Mr Holding, he could do so without the benefit of federal funding, as from the next day. </PARA>
<PARA>There is an interesting double standard involved here. One can keep getting Federal funding provided one uses some of it in election campaigning against the Liberal Party within the framework of the electoral laws but if one wants to use any of one's Federal funding to campaign against the Labor Party one will lose that funding immediately. So there is a clear democratic, open-handed, responsible approach-the approach being that taxpayers' money can be used by these bodies--</PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Senator Robert Ray" NAMEID="UI4">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="UI4">Senator Robert Ray</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Was it used?</PARA></TALK.START>
</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="LE4">Senator MICHAEL BAUME</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will come to that. The approach is that that money can be used in both direct advertising and substantial publicity campaigning, at some cost. Printing brochures, at some cost, is okay-it is totally acceptable and morally defensible-but if a similar organisation uses similar funds to oppose the Labor Party that is a disgrace and will be stopped forthwith. This Government surely has a high moral position-high in the sense that it stinks to high heaven. At the time I was intrigued by the fact that the Government's threat to the Tasmanian Aboriginal Centre, which threatened to oppose Mr Holding, seemed much more vigorous and enthusiastic than its response to the same organisation when Mr Mansell indicated he had some links with Libya, but that is a matter for the Government's own moral position.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There is no doubt that the Federal Government has been using millions of dollars of taxpayers' money to support community groups, many of which have a direct and clear political involvement yet are not required by the electoral laws to reveal the extent to which they are heavily influenced-that is the polite expression-by this Labor Government, although some are its puppets. The Government creates mechanisms like the Consumers Health Forum-which it heavily supports-which, as we have discussed at some length in this chamber, are certainly not representative of the people at large and appear to be taking very strong political positions. These Government-funded bodies which get involved in political activity cover a very wide range. They have a clearly disproportionate impact, because of their capacity to influence the Government and, by using taxpayers' money, to participate at election time. </PARA>
<PARA> A book was written last year-I cannot remember the author-which dealt at some length with this general issue. It stated:</PARA>
<PARA>Officially-patronised community groups tend to become agencies of government, or, at times, tools of factions within the government party. Patronage helps harness these groups to the government's electoral wagon, at taxpayers' expense. Their campaigns to ``raise public consciousness'', are often attempts to pre-market unpopular party or factional policies, or to make radical changes to be introduced by government appear merely as responses to popular demand. Community group campaigns can be used by party factions to pressure resisting government ministers into supporting certain policies. </PARA>
<PARA> Once organisations become addicted to the government-taxpayer dollar, they can generally be quickly brought into line. Tightening, or even threatening to tighten, the strings on the public purse is generally sufficient. Whether co-incidentally or not, recent changes in the senior officials of several Leading ``community'' peak councils (The Australian Conservation Foundation, the Australian Council of Social Service, and the Australian Federation of Consumer Unions) have followed deterioration in their relationships with Government or particular Ministers. </PARA>
<PARA> Five of the organisations taking a leading part in Government-sponsored community participation which appear to bob their heads up at election times are the Australian Consumers Association-and Senator Short has dealt at great length with its involvement, along with that of the Australian Federation of Consumer Organisations, which is approximately 90 per cent funded by the Federal Government-the Australian Council of Social Service Health Issues Centre and the Australian Conservation Foundation. The latter manages to be something of a post-box for tax deductable contributions to various other bodies, many of which appear to take positions at political times. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the problems that concern me is that many of these groups are, or have been, totally genuine and made up of decent people who have a commitment to important issues like conservation. One of the real things that bother me is that in taking these bodies over for political and, one often thinks, electoral purposes this Government patronage has the effect of bureaucratising and politicising these genuine groups in a way that damages their capacity to be effective. The point has been made that organisations which begin well, like Community Aid Abroad, the Australian Consumers Association and the Australian Conservation Foundation, have at times-I do not say at all times-been taken over or severely influenced by groups which appear to be heavily political and have a special access to and relationship with this Government which enables them to play strong, political roles at election times without disclosure of their links. That is the key point-the public disclosure of their links with government funding. I have a general objection to any such body which depends on government funding taking a hidden role-hidden, in the sense that its funding is hidden-in electoral matters. It is totally improper that citizens of Australia should be taxed to fund a political organisation posing as a community group. Some people feel it is bad enough that they have to fund political parties' election campaigns anyway, but to fund such groups in a hidden way is even more dreadful. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us not pretend there are no political links. For example, a few years ago the director of the Wilderness Society was paid $10,000 a year by the Federal Government as a consultant. Until recently, for 18 months he was the assistant private secretary to Mr Cohen, on a salary of more than $50,000 a year. I do not say that that necessarily means there is a disgraceful link between that body and the Government, but it underlines the fact that the Government seems to have the capacity to influence or control bodies by granting them money. At election times, these bodies put out press releases or advertise in a way that is clearly, deliberately and determinedly damaging to the Liberal and National parties. They can do this without being obliged by any element of the electoral law to reveal the extent of that funding. </PARA>
<PARA> This brings me to the apparent washing at the last election of a donation-I think Senator Puplick has raised this in this chamber-of $70,000 by Richard Farmer and Associates to the Labor Party through the Wilderness Society. The Wilderness Society is one of those bodies which appear to the coalition to be fairly politically oriented in approach at election times. I did not see at the last election any suggestion that the Wilderness Society had been involved in such a matter. I think it was raised in 1988 in The Eye magazine which reprinted a copy of a receipt dated 5 November 1987 from Richard Farmer and Associates Pty Ltd for a `donation with thanks'. I do not know where Richard Farmer and Associates got the $70,000. I was under the impression that the company had not been trading very successfully at that time. An extract from The Eye magazine states:</PARA>
<PARA> According to copies of the correspondence available to The Eye the secretary of The Wilderness Society, Grant Dixon, wrote to Richard Farmer on November 26 last year expressing `our sincere thanks for your recent generous donation. It has been most useful in terms of expenses incurred earlier in the year.' He attached a receipt for $70,000. </PARA>
<PARA> Dixon did not spell out what expenses had been incurred earlier in the year but The Wilderness Society gained a lot of publicity for its support for Labor candidates in the July 1987 Federal election and later in the 1988 New South Wales State election. </PARA>
<PARA>Senator Robert Ray regrettably has left the chamber. He asked me whether I could outline what support had been given. I think Senator Robert Ray must have been either blind or overseas or doing something else at the time had he not been able to recognise the volume of very public and expensive support for Labor candidates in both the Federal election and the subsequent State election. The article continues:</PARA>
<PARA> The donation is all the more generous in the light of the losses of well over $1 million that Richard Farmer and Associates chalked up over the last three years for which reports have been lodged with corporate authorities in Canberra. </PARA>
<PARA>I ask: Where did the $70,000 come from? The article continues:</PARA>
<PARA> The magnitude of the losses may well prompt the Liberal party to ask whether Richard Farmer was really passing on the $70,000 from another source rather than drawing on his own company's funds. </PARA>
<PARA>I wonder who that other source was, particularly when we recognise that Richard Farmer was one of the key advisers to the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) on electoral matters and on how to run his 1987 election campaign. Here we have, magically, Richard Farmer, a key element in the 1987 election campaign, paying $70,000 out of his company, which had just lost $1m, to the Wilderness Society, which coincidentally happened to run an anti-Liberal-anti-National Party campaign and a pro-Labor campaign in the 1987 election. This requires explanation. The current electoral Act, as I understand it, does not force that kind of revelation at the time or even subsequently. I understand that because the actual donation was given in November-whether it had been undertaken to be given or not-it will be required to be reported after the next election to be held, presumably in May or March in 1990. </PARA>
<PARA> In the first place it seems to me to be essential for a proper election environment for this sort of stunt to be revealed concurrently with the activity so that voters at the next election can judge the extent to which they should put weight-or not put weight-on the political statements at election time by organisations like the Wilderness Society that have participated in an election campaign and have been funded by someone for whom Mr Farmer was acting. Clearly this money could not have come from Mr Farmer's own company's funds. It had just lost $1m. Who was that someone? Mr Farmer has not told this place. Mr Farmer has not told anyone. But we know that Mr Farmer was a key adviser to the Government on its election strategy, on its election campaign, and that Mr Farmer's donation went to repay the expenses of the Wilderness Society. Those expenses were heaviest and clearly made at the time of both the Federal and State elections. </PARA>
<PARA> One wonders whether this is just a one-off donation or whether any other groups were recipients of similar largess. As well as using public money to influence and support those bodies that are favourably disposed towards it at election time and that continually attack us, one wonders whether there are not other opportunities and instances of the Labor Party, out of its campaign funding or some other source of money, directing money for this specific purpose to supportive bodies to encourage them to participate in election campaigning. </PARA>
<PARA> All I understand of the Richard Farmer situation is that other shareholders in his company apparently knew nothing about this donation. One of them told me that he was astonished at the thought of giving any donation of this kind and was unaware as a director that it had taken place. He assured me that the money was definitely not shareholders' money from Richard Farmer and Associates Pty Ltd. So, Richard Farmer was using his company, of which he was not the sole shareholder, not the sole director, as a front for shovelling some money into another body which appears to have acted as if it were at the time a front for the Labor Party in election campaigning. </PARA>
<PARA> It seems to me that the electoral laws have to be able to cope with this sort of thing speedily and effectively. As I have said, unless this matter was published by The Eye magazine, unless it was raised in this place, unless the Opposition asked continual questions-as it did-the matter would not have had a public airing before the next election. I hope the voters will be aware of the position when they see the Wilderness Society taking an aggressive anti-coalition position at the next election-which I hope it will not. I hope that the positive and sound environmental policies that Senator Puplick has presented to the Australian people will discourage any body from taking that sort of aggressive position. If those bodies do take such an aggressive position I hope that the Australian voters will recognise their standing, their status, their reputation in terms of the apparent source of their funds. It has been said in a response by Senator Robert Ray:</PARA>
<PARA> If the Australian Electoral Commission was minded to believe that that donation was not a direct donation but one in which money was being channelled via intermediaries it has the necessary powers to investigate that. </PARA>
<PARA>As I understand it, until the return has been made indicating this, which would not be until the next election, I do not think there is a matter on which the Electoral Commission can investigate because it has not been informed properly of the facts. If that is not so, I hope that if the Australian Electoral Commission has those powers it will investigate before the next election, before the return-in which this matter will be revealed to it officially-is required to be made, that is, after the next election. It is important that any such investigation and any such conclusions the Australian Electoral Commission makes be available to the Australian voters before the next election. As Senator Ray said, if there is any impropriety in this matter it is up to the Electoral Commission to pursue it. </PARA>

Obviously one could underwrite an election donation to a body like the Australian Wilderness Society, for example, as appears to have been done. A donation could be underwritten rather than given before an election. On the basis of that letter of commitment, money could be borrowed in normal, proper commercial terms from a bank of something like that. Because the funding to pay out that loan was not received until after the election the report would not be made to the Electoral Commission until three years later, and the opportunity of doing anything about it would be missed.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Electoral and Referendum Amendment Bill 1988 before the Senate will continue the implementation of recommendations made by the Joint Select Committee on Electoral Reform. This is the third piece of legislation to be introduced as a result of the two reports of the Joint Committee. The first report was in 1985 and the second report was in 1986. There is a long list of proposed changes to the Commonwealth Electoral Act in this piece of legislation. I will deal with what I consider to be the main changes proposed. Firstly, the Bill provides for the printing and distribution of extra electoral rolls to senators and members within two years of each parliament, and the provision is made to supply microfiche and disks of the rolls. This is a very welcome provision in that it enables members of parliament to maintain a standard of reputation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The second provision which I believe is of importance is the one that enables mobile voting facilities in hospitals and confirms the rights of patients to a postal vote. The coalition will be moving an amendment to delete the provision that now prevents a candidate from visiting and canvassing votes once the writs of an election have been issued. We believe that some reasonable restrictions should be placed on candidates canvassing votes in hospitals. But an open and democratic election should allow the people in the hospital access to the candidate and access to the material of the candidate. They should not be utterly denied that. </PARA>
<PARA> We will be moving amendments to proposed changes to the requirement for polling officers to ask set questions before issuing the voter with ballot papers. The coalition believes that provision should be maintained, that set questions should be asked by the polling officers before issuing the ballot papers, such questions as, `Have you voted in this election before?'. Given the historic Richmond Council election events and the accusations that have been made after so many State and Federal elections about double and multiple voting, I think that is a fair and just requirement. </PARA>
<PARA> The next point I wish to make probably concerns the most serious provision of this legislation, that is, the voting rights of prisoners. At present, a person who has been convicted and sentenced to imprisonment for five years or longer is not entitled to vote. The coalition will move that the existing standard remains, the reason being that those who are committed to prison for a crime that carries a sentence of over five years-this duration places the crime in the category of a major crime-have forgone their democratic rights. They should forgo the right to vote. While they are paying their debt to society they should not participate in the normal activities that are carried out in society. That is why they are in prison. They have forgone some of those rights. </PARA>
<PARA> There are many other changes within this legislation that I will not go into because they will be adequately handled in the committee stage. But I would like to deal with the activities of the Joint Select Committee on Electoral Matters, from which the Government takes a great deal of advice. In particular, I would like to deal with its last report which looked into the activities of the 1987 election. It is very important that a committee of this nature should be able to report to this Parliament and uphold a certain standard. After all, it is looking into the cornerstone of our democracy, that is, the electoral system. However, this Committee has failed to uphold any decent standard. </PARA>
<PARA> The majority report of this Committee, supposedly dealing with electoral matters arising from the 1987 election, is the most party-political and biased report yet presented to this Parliament on such matters. It is now a committee totally without credibility. The recommendations in its last report were nothing short of the taking up of every Labor Party submission to it. For example, the banning of all paid political advertisements on radio and television during election campaigns and the recommendation that all radio and television stations be forced to carry election advertisements--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The single point I was trying to make was that this Government will go to any extent, it seems, to stretch the electoral laws in its favour. The report of this Committee was a prime example, in recommending that television stations take up the payment for advertisements at election time. At this stage, they are in no financial position to take up such a recommendation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Mr Acting Deputy President, in light of your warning to stay within the bounds of this Bill, I will raise only one other point. I wish to refer to a serious matter relating to the Government's abuse of section 282 of the Commonwealth Electoral Act. As Senator Ray, who is now in the chamber, knows only too well, there was a great deal of debate in the old Parliament House on the method of determining long term and short term senators. Section 13 of the Constitution provides that the Senate shall decide who will serve the long term and who will serve the short term Senate positions. It sets out that this chamber makes that decision. </PARA>
<PARA> Until the election of 1987, the method used to select long term and short term senators in the case of a double dissolution was in order of being elected. Those who finished in the first six were the long term senators and those who finished in the second six were the short term senators. However, for reasons that I will not go into, the Joint Select Committee on Electoral Reform found that a number of unfair anomalies were thrown up by this method. Suffice to say, the Committee highlighted that this method was open to political manoeuvring and, in fact, encouraged double dissolutions. It also found that this method did not fairly reflect the proportion of primary votes received by a candidate. </PARA>
<PARA> The Select Committee recommended that following a double dissolution the Electoral Commission conduct a second count of Senate votes using the half-Senate quota to determine the long term and short term senators. This recommendation was taken up by the Parliament and written into section 282 of the Electoral Act. The recommendation received unanimous support in debates in the Parliament. Yet, when put to the test for the first time after the 1987 election, both the Australian Democrats and the Government moved as one blatantly to break section 282 of the Electoral Act to favour their own parties' position. They chose to ignore section 282 and return to the unfair and rejected system of choosing long term and short term senators. Senator Ray, who is seeking to interject, was the architect of that deal with the Democrats. He was the architect of breaking an arrangement and an agreement with this side of the House on that section of the Act. Yet he so pompously stood up here yesterday and spoke about the conviction that he had in the propriety and traditions of this Senate. That was just a load of rubbish. </PARA>
<PARA> The Australian public should be aware of the extent to which the Australian Labor Party and this Government will go to maintain their power. Obviously they have no bounds. It is a case of `hang democracy'. This Government threw out the rule book, the traditions and the understandings that keep this Parliament operative the day it threw out section 282 of the Electoral Act. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;in reply-I thank all honourable senators who have spoken for their contribution to the debate. I would like to respond to them in reverse order-and also reverse order of intellect, I suspect. Senator McGauran came in here and said that there has been a great breach of section 282 of the Commonwealth Electoral Act. Let me educate Senator McGauran for a moment. The political party of which he is a member did not give this matter even one iota of thought before the Joint Select Committee on Electoral Reform looked at it. All that section 282 does is insist that the Australian Electoral Commission provide this chamber with alternatives. It does nothing more. The Constitution is paramount. The Electoral Act cannot override the power of this chamber to determine long and short term senators.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator McGauran has some idea that a deal was made before the last elections. I will tell him what the deal was. I said consistently prior to 1987 that the Senate itself should determine in advance of a double dissolution who would be the long and short term senators-not put the fix in afterwards, but determine it beforehand. I could never get agreement from honourable senators on Senator McGauran's side to go along with new section 282 because they said that they wanted to see what the result would be before they made a decision. So Senator McGauran should not come into this chamber and say that I broke my word, because I did not. I acted with propriety. We put a different method of approach in the Electoral Act. This Senate should have adopted that prior to 1987. It should adopt it now, well before the next double dissolution, so that everyone knows in advance what the counting system will be for long and short term senators. </PARA>
<PARA> The old system goes back to the 1900s when we did not have proportional representation, when we did not have an expanded Senate and when we did not have a quota under which Senator Dunn and Co. can get 1 1/2 per cent of the primary vote and be elected. But if they had walked in with, I think, 6.8 per cent of the primary vote, they would have had a long term. Meanwhile, the third senator on a ticket led by a senator who gets 50 per cent has to take a short term. That is why section 282 was put in the Act. That system should have been approved by this chamber-it would have had only strong moral sanction-in advance of a double dissolution. </PARA>

<PARA> Senator McGauran gave a quick summary of what his objections were to the Bill. He then went on to attack the credibility of the Joint Select Committee on Electoral Reform. I will let Senator McGauran into a secret: the party of which he is a member and the coalition never supported the setting up of this Committee. They opposed it. They never wanted any electoral reform. They wanted the old rotten borough Electoral Act because it suited their purposes. They never wanted any change. Senator McGauran has made an attack on the members of that Committee and plenty of those members in this chamber will at some stage respond. But some of those members put in an enormous amount of work. The first Select Committee, of which Senator Macklin was a member, met right through the winter of 1983. I think it met solidly for something like six to eight weeks. I do not want Senator McGauran to come in here and tell me that this Committee has no credibility. </PARA>
<PARA> While we are on the subject of credibility and self-interest, because that is obviously what has motivated Senator McGauran on section 282, the honourable senator spent 180 grand to get in at the last election and now he is out because apparently I have dudded him on section 282. Well, I am sorry about that. But Senator McGauran is going to come back, I hope. Senator McGauran should apply this test in respect of the Liberal Party: he trusts his colleagues in this place so much that he would not even take their word that they would re-endorse him the next time around. There had to be a meeting in Melbourne at which eight Liberal officials and six National Party officials all signed a leather bound agreement so that Senator McGauran can return here, not after the next election but after the one after that. That is how much he trusts the word of the Liberal Party. That is how much the National Party trusts the Liberal Party. It was like one of those peace treaty negotiations held in Iceland when everybody lines up and the pens are sold afterwards. What a joke! But that is enough on Senator McGauran. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me move to one whom I find a far more obnoxious individual-Senator Michael Baume. I found his speech today terribly obnoxious. Earlier on he said, `I wonder whether any taxpayers' money was used, basically by the Australian Conservation Foundation, in the election campaign'. From that one premise a whole series of allegations flows. Let me make my position clear. Organisations such as the Australian Conservation Foundation are entitled to campaign in elections; they are not entitled to use any taxpayers' money to do so. Quite often they have other fund raising, but they must be able to do that in such an accounting way as to prove that no taxpayers' money is ever used. That was the missing link with Senator Baume today: he never went on to prove once, in a 15-minute diatribe--</PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Senator Macklin" NAMEID="2I4">

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="UI4">Senator ROBERT RAY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;No, because then he went on to the Farmer matter; I am coming to that in a moment. He went on for 15 minutes attacking the Australian Conservation Foundation, et cetera, but he never made the great causal linkage that was necessary. I would oppose the Australian Conservation Foundation using any taxpayers' money to campaign. That would be a disgrace. The Foundation should not do that, and I do not think that it has done it. I have a lot to do with a similar organisation, the Federation of Ethnic Communities Councils of Australia, which receives a core grant from the Federal Government. A couple of times it has been reported that it will campaign on this or that in the next election-I think once for us and once against us. Both times I drew that to its attention and it said, `No, that is a misinterpretation. All we are saying to our affiliates who receive no money is that these are crucial issues on which you can campaign'. That is the way it should be. Senator Baume today, based on this one half-premise that he never proved, then goes and builds this enormous straw house, as he often does. This is muckraking in its purest form. It lacks the energy of an Upton Sinclair or a good muckraker; it is just poor muckraking.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Let me move to the Farmer matter, as this has been raised before. Senator Michael Baume again raised only the initial allegations. None of the stuff that appeared in the press later to qualify any of that was mentioned-that the company that donated the money had not had a $1m loss the year before because it was mixed up with another company. None of these matters were brought to bear by Senator Baume. Senator Macklin will recognise this: the thing that almost moved me to tears was when he described the modus operandi of a company borrowing money and then spending it on the election campaign so that we cannot track it back any further. Has he never heard of Carpentaria Exploration Co. Pty Ltd, a $2 company in the Northern Territory that funded Senator Tambling's return to this place? It borrowed $390,000 and not one cent was ever traced. Senator Baume's own coalition went to court to prevent the Australian Electoral Commission tracking down the source of funds, and he has the hypocrisy to come in here today and say that he wants to know where the Farmer donation originally came from and whether it was Farmer or someone else washing the money through. What hypocrisy to argue that when his own Party does exactly the opposite-absolute hypocrisy! So much for Senator Baume's half-hour contribution. </PARA>
<PARA> Prior to that we heard Senator Knowles. The first point she made was that this legislation had been around forever and we had been frightened to bring it on. Everyone knows what the pressure on the program has been like. Everyone knows that Budget Bills must take priority and that we had this legislation listed on many occasions and never got to it because of long drawn out debates on other matters, and that it could not have priority over urgent business. That is the reason why it has been delayed from time to time. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Knowles then went on to make the classic statement that it shows a lack of concern by this Government about electoral laws. Well, by golly, gosh, the Liberals were in office from 1949 to 1972 and from 1975 to 1983 and hardly touched the electoral laws. They had a major constitutional inquiry in 1958 that recommended total revision of the Electoral Act, but did not touch it. In 1983 we were left with one of the most anachronistic electoral systems; the Electoral Commission was down in morale and down in funding; we had a re-distribution system that was becoming a joke-all these things. We have spent a lot of time, money and effort to lift that. It has not always been done in a bipartisan way. On the minor stuff it has, but on a couple of the big issues we have had to disagree. Public funding is a classic example of it. The Joint Select Committee on Electoral Reform, which Senator McGauran so disparages, often went out of its way to find a middle course to suit all political parties, because electoral laws cannot be drawn up on the basis of partisanship. If they are, it will eventually backfire on those who draw them up. </PARA>
<PARA> Then Senator Knowles threw out the big line that we have heard often in this debate about rorts and multiple voting. I challenged her by way of interjection and said, `Name them'. She said, `Oh well, Senator Ray knows what I am talking about'. Well, I do not. I want to hear about it. There were 11,000 possible multiple voters in the last New South Wales Federal election on first view. I think it came down to about 15 unexplained cases after investigation-something like that-out of three million people voting. There is always potential for abuse in a user friendly system, but at least provide some proof that there has been abuse because, if there has been, then we will have to tighten it up. It would have to be tightened up probably by way of computer, by way of terminals in the polling places to prevent any multiple voting. But just to make the accusation that there are rorts and multiple voting and not adduce one example is a very pathetic approach. </PARA>
<PARA> Then we are accused of being masters of gerrymandering because in the last Federal election-this was not made quite clear by Senator Knowles-there was a swing to the Liberal Party but it lost more seats. Well, golly, gosh, can we have government back for 1954, 1961 and 1969-thanks very much? These things happen, but at least there has to be some electoral analysis as to why they happened, where the differential swings occurred. I think I am right in saying that the 1987 election was fought entirely on boundaries that had been fought on before, so it was not as though the boundaries had just been changed. There are such things as growth that lead to differential swings. Most people know, if there is any analysis at all, that the real gain for the Australian Labor Party came in Queensland, where in 1984 we missed out narrowly on four or five seats. This time we just tipped over the line in those four or five seats. That is why, with a slight swing against us, we were able to improve our position. Those things occur. It is also to do with the demography of cities. The old demography of cities very must hampered Labor, but as more middle class people are moving into inner city areas and the working class get forced out simply because they cannot afford to stay there any more-they have to go to where transport is more expensive-they are caught midstream in a great gentrification. At either end it will help the Liberal Party, but in the middle transitional process it will be of assistance to the Labor Party. </PARA>
<PARA> If Senator Knowles is to be listened to, why not go back and look at the 1966 election in Melbourne where Labor won eight seats with 40-odd per cent of the vote, all concentrated in the western and northern suburbs? These things occur. It is not a gerrymander; it is just the way the cookie crumbles. If Senator Knowles wants to take that a bit further and say that the current boundaries are gerrymandered, she should walk outside this chamber and say, `Look, Professor Hughes, Justice Morling and the rest of you have been involved in a grubby exercise to rig the boundaries for the Labor Party'. Those opposite are not willing to do that; they are just willing to make the general, smearing accusation and then retreat. </PARA>
<PARA> I thought the daddy of them all was to introduce Western Australia. It is actually the first time that it has been raised in this chamber. I put on the record that Labor won a majority of the seats without a majority of the votes. That is the first time it has been raised here since the State election. Why? Because straight after the State election members of the Liberal Party had a caucus meeting in Western Australia where they all broke down and cried and said, `If only we had let the Labor Party electoral reform Bill through, we would now be in government'. Five times we were defeated in the upper House when we put the proposition to reform the Western Australian electoral laws. The sixth time we got a compromise; we got part change. We lost a Minister out of it-Mr Tonkin, who was still a purist. He said, `No, that is not good enough. You should never compromise'. But that very compromise, which still led to malapportioned electorates, grievously cost the Liberal Party at the start of 1989. If any party has been hoist with its own petard and deserved it, it would be the Western Australian Liberal Party. It has to cop it in the neck because it refused. If we had had one vote one value, the Western Australian Liberal Party would have had a much better chance-it would have been almost inevit- able-of winning power in Western Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> Two consistent issues were raised by Senator McGauran and Senator Knowles on the question of prisoners. I have always had an open mind on that. I have always worried about double jeopardy and, as Senator Macklin would know, I have always been one of the floating voters on this matter. Why should we put two penalties on a prisoner? I have always worried about where we draw the line; I have always had a problem in that regard. Ultimately, we should perhaps have left it, by way of amendment, to judges to determine, when they convict someone, as to whether they think their voting rights should be taken away. </PARA>
<PARA> So much for the speakers today. I will not refight the battle of Castlereagh, which was refought in the chamber in the debate on this Bill. I simply put my views on Castlereagh on the record, and I do not wish to say any more than this. I repeat my invitation to Senator Bishop to come into the chamber and apologise about that and clear the stain off what I regard as a very promising political future. Senator Puplick made a number of points that he will pursue in the committee stage, so I will not go over those now. From my reading of Senator Puplick's speech this morning, he covered a whole variety of different rounds, and I do not particularly want to respond to any of that. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, I want only to say that, in many ways, I think it is a pity that this Bill appeared in the way it did. But for an early election it would have appeared as a complete Bill in 1987. At that stage part of those reforms were enacted because we needed to get the Senate voting system in for a new election. We already had the redistribution stuff drafted, so it was shoved through then; and this Bill has been introduced while we are still awaiting a committee report recommending further amendments which just cannot be drafted in time before the next election. I think that is a matter of regret. But this Bill, on the whole-we have to remember that at least 95 per cent of it, in terms of its technical amendments, is agreed-will improve the running of the next Federal election, whenever it is. As such, it is welcome. No doubt we will have some vigorous discussion on three of four of the amendments proposed to this Bill. I wish the Bill a relatively speedy passage. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to raise a matter in relation to clause 14, and to ask the Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs (Senator Robert Ray) for some clarification. I quote from page 2137 of the Hansard of 29 April 1988-some considerable time back-when the Minister, in making his second reading speech, said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This Bill provides fixed formulae for the representation of Territories and new States in the Federal Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA>Honourable senators will recall that there has from time to time been considerable discussion about the provision for the representation of new States in the Commonwealth Parliament. People will recall that this matter was the subject of a specific inquiry by the Joint Select Committee on Electoral Reform, largely on the initiative of the honourable member for Sturt, Mr Ian Wilson, who sought to provide in electoral law a fixed formula in advance for the way in which the representation should be accorded to new States. Clause 14 provides for an advance formula for the way in which future representation of the Territories is to be handled in the Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> I simply raise the issue and ask the Minister to indicate why, although the second reading speech indicated that a formula would be inserted for the representation of new States, it is not reflected in the Bill. I think I am correct in saying that this may derive from the provisions of section 121 of the Constitution, which states:</PARA>
<PARA>The Parliament may admit to the Commonwealth or establish new States, and may upon such admission or establishment make or impose such terms and conditions, including the extent of representation in either House of the Parliament, as it thinks fit. </PARA>
<PARA>I presume, therefore, that the argument is that this is not a matter than can be settled in advance; in fact, it can be settled only after the new State has been admitted. I just want to clarify that as an explanation of why something which is referred to in the second reading speech does not occur in the Bill. I take this opportunity to put it on the record that it is the view of the coalition parties that, in what I guess is the unlikely event of new States being admitted to the Federation, their formula should be fixed, in terms of representation, in much the same way as is currently provided in the proposed amendment to section 40 of the principal Act by clause 14 of this Bill, which sets out the formula which will in the future govern the provision for representation of Territories in the Commonwealth Parliament. I just want to clarify the reasons why questions of the States are not referred to in the legislation itself. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am not sure I have the answer right in front of me at the moment. The general philosophy of this, as Senator Puplick correctly asserts, came from an initiative from Mr Wilson, who pursued it at the constitutional conventions but could not bring it to any form of fruition. What we have endeavoured to do here is to lay down a formula which is not binding if statehood occurs. Again-this is the second time I have had to use this word today-moral sanction was the intention of it. There was a fear, if you like, that without having something in legislation there was the potential for rorts. There would be nothing to stop a Federal government so minded, if it had a majority in both Houses, to declare the Australian Capital Territory a State, give it 40 senators and flood this place. There is still nothing to stop that except that at least we now have some impediment in the legislation that will make that a little harder.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As for new States coming in, it was the original intention of the report of the Joint Select Committee on Electoral Reform to have the same sort of formula apply. But again that cannot be enforced because it is a matter for negotiation at the time they come in. I make one other observation: I know that some people are very keen on giving 12 senators to the Northern Territory on its accession to statehood. All I can say is that insistence on that will probably prevent statehood. I really do think people would see that as the major impediment to statehood. A different formula is needed. I do not suggest a miserly formula but I really think that with 12 more Collinses or Tamblings there would be no room for any of us in the debates. They have made a big contribution down here-I have to say that; they can both use that on their pamphlets-in terms of time taken up. I do not know whether that has thoroughly answered Senator Puplick's question. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Clause 14 deals only with Territories. Senator Puplick and Senator Ray both referred to the report of the Joint Select Committee on Electoral Reform. I put in a dissenting report from the majority on that Committee. I was the only person on the Committee who felt that new States should be treated in exactly the same way as existing States. I argued at some length in that report that to do otherwise would set up two classes of State-the old and the new-which, further down the track, would lead to the most enormous constitutional difficulties. It seems to me that the federal system that we should follow in this country is the federal system of the United States of America which, regardless of territory, regardless of numbers, elects identical numbers of senators from each of its States.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I am not sure what Senator Tambling, the only Northern Territory senator in the chamber at the moment, thinks about this. I do not want to misrepresent Senator Collins, but when Senator Collins was the Leader of the Opposition in the Northern Territory he was the Northern Territory delegate to the Constitutional Convention which met in Brisbane. He and I argued on the same platform-I must admit we were not joined by many others-that, if the Northern Territory became a State, it should become a State on exactly the same basis as the other States of the Commonwealth. The population number is irrelevant when it comes to working out how many senators there should be. It is a very relevant item when it comes to working out how many members of the House of Representatives there should be. The method of choosing senators is to choose them by State. The method of choosing members of the House of Representatives is by population number. I do not resile from that position. I think, ultimately, that that position will be adopted, not the position of having two senators from a territory. </PARA>
<PARA> The other item Senator Ray raised by way of comment is still an enormous problem in the Constitution and that is that it is up to the Commonwealth Parliament to determine how many senators those new States will get, or even how many senators a Territory will get. That is an absolutely extraordinary time-bomb probably waiting to go off, and undoubtedly that will go off at some stage in the future. I am quite sure that neither this Government nor the incoming government will use it but I am sure a government will try to use it at some stage if there is overwhelming support in a particular territory for one party or the other. At the moment the general circumstances are such that the major parties in this country have about even support in the Territories and hence it would be an unlikely occurrence. </PARA>
<PARA> I too read the Minister's second reading speech and I could not find anything in the Bill on new States, so I welcome this information. The argument about new States will have to be fought at a later stage when the Parliament decides upon what basis the Northern Territory will be admitted as a State. I think probably at that time the view that I have, which was the lone one on the Committee, may become a slightly more popular view. It needs to be argued on the basis of the merits of the case rather than on who will get people elected and who will not. A new State to be admitted should be admitted on terms identical with the current States. Anything else would lopside our Federation for the ensuing future. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I respond only very briefly but I want to put on record the view of the Opposition on that issue. Of course, Senator Macklin is correct in referring to the report of the Joint Select Committee on Electoral Reform of November 1985 entitled Determining the Entitlement of Federal Territories and New States to Representation in the Commonwealth Parliament. Its recommendation is in the following terms:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>. . . no new State should be admitted to the Federation on terms and conditions as to its representation in the Parliament more favourable than those that the Committee recommends for representation of Commonwealth Territories. </PARA>
<PARA>That is the position which the Opposition parties endorse. The fundamental difficulty with Senator Macklin's position and with the analogy that Senator Macklin draws with the United States of America is that the United States Congress is not blessed with the nexus provisions in its Constitution. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Despite the worthy attempts of the Parliament to persuade the people of Australia to break the nexus, they decided in their wisdom not to do so. Therefore, the question of representation in the Senate is not a matter without consequence for the size of the House of Representatives whereas the question of the size of the House of Representatives of the United States has absolutely nothing to do with the representation of the States in the United States Senate. So the addition of new States in the United States certainly increases the size of its Senate but its House of Representatives is determined purely on a national population basis regardless of the composition of numbers in the Senate. That is the fundamental difference in the analogy that Senator Macklin drew between Australia and the United States.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA>This amendment relates to casual vacancies for places of senators for Territories.

Section 44 of the Commonwealth Electoral Act has been recently amended by the ACT Self-Government (Consequential Provisions) Act 1988 to provide that casual vacancies for Australian Capital Territory senators shall be dealt with by the Australian Capital Territory Legislative Assembly. I wish all ACT senators good health. The amendment of clause 15 inserts a new clause which provides that casual vacancies for places in a territory other than senators for the Northern Territory or the Australian Capital Territory shall be filled by a joint sitting of the Houses of Parliament or, if the Parliament is not in session, by the Governor-General until the expiration of 14 days from the beginning of the next session or the expiration of the term, whichever first happens. </PARA>

<PARA>. . . the extent to which the representation in the House of Representatives, of the people of the State or Territory reflected the views of the electors as evidenced by a majority of the formal votes counted towards the election of candidates in the State or Territory at the last general election or in the general elections that occurred since the last redistribution of the State or Territory. </PARA>
<PARA>This matter has been quite extensively canvassed in the second reading debate. I do not propose to canvass it very much further. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Ray is right in referring to the fact that in 1954, 1961 and 1969 the Australian Labor Party obtained a majority of the votes cast but did not secure a majority of the seats in Parliament. In 1954 the Labor Party polled 50.7 against the coalition's 49.3. In 1961 the Labor Party polled 50.5 against the coalition's 49.5. In 1969 it polled 50.2 against the coalition's 49.8. Of those perhaps 1961 was obviously the example where there was the closest conjunction in terms of seats and votes with the Government in the House of Representatives ending up with a majority of one. We have drawn attention to the fact that in the 1987 Federal election the Australian Labor Party polled 45.8 per cent of first preference votes, which was down from the 47.5 it had polled on the previous occasion, but its representation rose from 82 seats to 86. The Liberal Party polled 34.6 per cent, having increased from 34.4 per cent in the previous election, but its representation fell from 45 to 43. The National Party polled 11.5 per cent, up from the 10.6 per cent which it had polled on the previous occasion, and its representation fell from 21 to 19 seats. In other words, there was a swing to the coalition parties of something in the order of one per cent. As a result of that swing the coalition parties actually lost four seats. </PARA>
<PARA> Complaints have been made that a party which polls an increase in its vote should not be penalised with a decrease in its representation and a party that has its votes cut should have its representation increased. Senator Ray has quite rightly drawn attention to the difficulties that a political party faces when the swing which is obtained is concentrated in the seats which are not the most marginal of seats. Quite clearly, where there is a major swing to a political party we find situations where we need a one per cent swing to win a seat and we get half a per cent or we need an 18 per cent swing to win a seat and we actually get 15 per cent. Overall, those distortions do occur. They are inevitable in any system which has a single member electorate and they occur where the system does not provide for a precise reflection across the whole State of the representation of the political parties. We have seen in Europe and elsewhere the use of the list system in order to overcome this. </PARA>
<PARA> Nobody argues for the moving away at the Federal or State level, other than in Tasmania, from a system where we have single member constituencies. Certainly those advocates of proportional representation and of other systems have attacked this system. They make a legitimate point in that regard. We, however, believe that we should retain single member constituencies. In order to have both the single member constituencies and the result in those constituencies most accurately reflect the overall position, we have moved this amendment, which in fact casts in legal form something which we suspect is not entirely absent from the minds of the electoral commissioners when they go about their work anyway. They are not required to have regard to this particular matter. Section 66 of the principal Act does not enjoin them to bear this question in mind. They bear all sorts of questions in mind with the best will in the world and I say to them that they should undoubtedly bear in mind, when doing the redistribution in Victoria, that Wills and Kooyong should always look pretty good. It would be a very bold Electoral Commission that decided to turn Wills or Kooyong into a marginal seat. </PARA>

<PARA> Clearly, the redistribution commissioners bear those sorts of things in mind. After all, they want to be in a position where the electoral redistribution is protected as far as possible from attack. Of course, we now have a situation in which the Parliament itself does not play the same role in electoral redistributions as it did some years ago when whole redistributions were quite frequently rejected, and everybody knows the basis on which that occurred. </PARA>
<PARA> What the Opposition amendment is simply saying is that this matter shall be taken into account, that it shall in fact be given, as the introductory words in section 66 (3) (b) say, `due consideration'. We believe that simply drawing to the attention of the Electoral Commission the fundamental principle that, as far as possible, the outcome of the election overall ought to reflect the views of the electorate overall is a fair and proper thing to be said. </PARA>
<PARA> We have therefore cast this amendment as one of the factors, the sixth factor, to which the Redistribution Committee shall give due consideration when it is in the process of actually determining the electoral boundaries. Because we believe that it is a fair principle, it should in fact be written as a fair principle into the legislation. As I say, in other parts of the debate this argument has been adequately canvassed and I do not propose to take it any further at this stage. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I take this opportunity to put the record straight in respect of a matter raised earlier by the Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs (Senator Robert Ray). It touches upon this amendment. It is the nexus between the number of seats and the quantity of votes. As the Minister quite properly commented, the last election in Western Australia was the first election in the history of Western Australian elections at which a party won government with less than 50 per cent of the votes. It is interesting, if my memory serves me correctly, and I am not nearly as close to these things as I used to be--</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="XF4">Senator CRICHTON-BROWNE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I was referring to the machinations that take place in Western Australia generally. It is interesting that in State elections in Western Australia the nexus between the number of votes and the number of seats won has inevitably been closer than is the case in Federal elections. If I recall, it was in 1980 or perhaps 1977 that the Liberal Party held 90 per cent of the seats with slightly less than 60 per cent of the vote. The present Labor Government holds 77 per cent of the seats with marginally more than 50 per cent of the votes. The nexus between those two things is decidedly more removed than has traditionally been the case in State elections where they do not have the tolerance and are further removed from the argument of one vote one value.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> With respect to that issue in Western Australia and again to the extent it impinges upon the amendment, the Minister in charge of electoral reform in the Western Australian State Labor Government, to wit, one Arthur Tonkin, resigned from his ministry in writing. He attended a Government Cabinet meeting in Geraldton at which it was determined that a proposition would be put up that was so outrageous, so preposterous, that it would fail in the upper House. Mr Tonkin was so disgusted with the Labor Government, because of its determination to ensure that there would be no electoral reform and no legislation that would be acceptable to the Opposition so that the Government would not be stuck with the fundamental principle of one vote one value, that he resigned. He resigned because of the shonky tricks the Labor Government was getting up to in terms of its purported attempts at electoral reform. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Liberals had some bad luck at the last Federal election and now want to change the system. I find this a very strange proposition. Having spent most of my life writing submissions to redistribution commissioners on the very basis of what Senator Puplick wants to take into account now and having to disguise that matter, I find that Senator Puplick, having done the same thing for the last 20 years, now wants to bring it out into the open. Obviously, each political party puts a submission to a redistribution commission on the basis of what is to its own advantage. If any honourable senator can find an example of where a party has not done so, I would like to know.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Asking the commissioners to take into account voting patterns to achieve some sort of equality between outcome of votes and number of seats is just impossible. They would have to anticipate what would happen next time. They would have to assume that voting patterns and swings are even right throughout. Then they would have to juggle that with growth figures. Really, I think that this particular proposition just comes out of one defeat. </PARA>
<PARA> We must be careful about figures, too. I deliberately threw in 1954 to see whether I would get a bite. The reality of the 1954 figures is that they look dreadful but are explainable. For a start, Labor failed to contest six conservative seats which the conservatives would have easily won by 20,000 votes per seat. Those 120,000 votes were never counted. Three other seats were contested by communists versus Labor. All of the Liberals voted for the Labor candidate, so again a primary vote was artificially bolstered. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not complain on behalf of the Labor Party about winning in 1954. It was not that the Party rigged the boundaries in 1949, but its submission to the Electoral Commission could have been identical to the smarter Liberal Party submission, which concentrated on marginal seats whereas Labor concentrated on safe seats. The misfortune of 1954 was of Labor's own doing in part and was also a statistical aberration. </PARA>
<PARA> The other problem with Senator Puplick's amendment is that it goes only to the first stage of redistribution. What happens at the augmented Commission? Under the Opposition's amendment it will not be entitled to take these things into account, so the whole thing will break down. The augmented Commission has different powers and responsibilities from the original Commission. Also-this is no reflection on the Opposition as I know how difficult it is to draft clauses-the Electoral Commission itself cannot work out now what is meant by this draft clause and to put it in legislation would be a great weakness. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Puplick was right in one part of his remarks, when he said that generally electoral commissioners do not abolish the seat of the Prime Minister or the Leader of the Opposition-at least, we do not think they do. They certainly did not mind abolishing the seat of Henty, where I have lived for the last 25 years. I thought I had given the Electoral Commission a bit of help over the years, but it did not mind knocking off the seat where I live. It went bang-straight out the back door. I do not know whether I will ever forgive the commissioners for that. We had a very good campaign operation in that seat, which was looked to by other sections of the Labor Party as a model for their own performance. So I am not sure how far the commissioners would go. I think that is the only exception, although a few victims hit the fence in the latest redistribution, such as Tony Lamb. </PARA>
<PARA> Things have changed. In 1971, in a casual conversation, as Laurie Brereton passed Askin, Askin said, `Goodbye, son'. Brereton said, `What do you mean?'. Askin said, `I am about to have a redistribution'. Brereton said, `What do you mean?'. Askin said, `Last on, son, first off. See ya'. Sure enough, when the new boundaries came out six months later Brereton's seat did not exist. I do not think we are in quite that situation any more, where the commissioners take such things into account, mostly because of the growth provisions. The overriding growth provisions have really dominated redistributions, and the rest of the factors have to trail in after them. I would very much like to see an electoral system under which it is always the case that if a party wins an increase in votes it gets an increase in seats. Senator Crichton-Browne has obviously never looked at the cube rule of politics, and he should. It is sometimes known as the bogus majority. He should look at it to get an understanding of single member constituencies. I recommend that he do some reading in that regard. </PARA>
<PARA> It should be acknowledged that, in the last election, overall Labor got a majority of preferred votes-not a big majority, but an overall one. There was a slight swing against the Party, but that occurred in certain areas. Some people would say that we campaigned better than the Opposition in marginal seats. I do not know whether that is true but, certainly, having sitting members working hard in those seats helped the Labor Party, as it probably helped the Liberal Party in its marginal seats. I do not recall Labor making many gains in seats such as Deakin, in spite of an enormous effort. We could now be recognising the old truism that marginal seats swing the largest. Maybe now they swing the smallest-who knows?</PARA>
<PARA> I cannot accept this amendment, drafted as it is. I do not think it will achieve the ends. It binds only the Redistribution Committee and not the augmented Commission, which I think is a problem. The amendment is drafted in such a way as to not give really clear instructions. Does it refer to the previous election or to all previous elections prior to the previous redistribution? If there is a half-Senate election, should past voting patterns be taken into account? All these problems are associated with the amendment. In the end, it would open the Commission to an enormous challenge on the grounds that it has rigged political boundaries. I can say with a fair degree of honesty that the Federal electoral boundaries have been remarkably free of interference over the years. We would like to say the same about every State, but we cannot. We know that. We know that each political party at different times has been guilty to an extent of altering boundaries to its own advantage. I think the situation is getting better right across Australia at a State level, but I am certain that at a Federal level the system is basically clean. </PARA>
<PARA> I have to say to Senator Puplick that every now and then one has some bad luck. All I can say is that I am glad it is the Opposition's bad luck and not ours, but I am sure we will be in exactly in the same position in two, three or five years time. In an election there will be a swing towards a party but that party will not pick up the commensurate number of seats. I do not know how a commissioner can guarantee what the Opposition wants guaranteed. Commissioners are not that sophisticated and I doubt there is a political operator in Australia who is. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1"> -The amendment moved by Senator Puplick on behalf of the Opposition seeks to do what most of us recognise is probably done in some vague way, although I remember in a hearing of the Joint Select Committee on Electoral Reform, as it then was, asking the Electoral Commissioner whether the Electoral Commission took the political complexion of seats into account in redistributions and being told that it did not. Looking around the table, I did not think many people took much notice of that reply. Obviously, some account is taken in the redistribution exercise of the political complexion of the seat. Indeed, if I had been drafting this amendment I would have sought to amend clause (3) (b) (i), which states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> . . . community of interests within the proposed Electoral Division, including economic, social and regional interests;</PARA>
<PARA>I would have inserted the world `political'. I have no idea what it would have done, because the difficulty in assessing economic, social and regional interests is already massive. The difficulty in assessing political interests is even greater, particularly under a system which is supposed to be secret. How would one know, other than by taking a particular polling booth, what a particular area is likely to do? We live in a mobile society. I have never voted in the polling booth nearest to my home, and the same can possibly be said for other people. </PARA>

The road system in Brisbane being what it is, it is often a lot easier to get to somewhere further away than to somewhere close. The difficulty this would load on the Electoral Commission would be immense.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There is a more important reason why we should not tamper with this clause. This clause was discussed at enormous length in the Committee originally. We sought to do something which was not previously in the Act, to give a paramount position to one item-population. We sought, by inserting a range of items such as the three-six year exercise, to give paramount weight to the number of people in an electorate. As the Act is now set up that is done, because the rest of those items are subject to that overwhelming interest. I am not at all sure how much the other items are taken into account in particular urban areas, because it is excessively difficult to do that and still maintain the first item. </PARA>
<PARA> The last point I want to make is that when I first read this amendment, I must admit, I was probably in the same situation as the Electoral Commission. I could not quite work out what it would do in practice. It is drafted in a very interesting way. I found a number of difficulties with the drafting exercise. Having sat on that Committee for a number of years, I tend to err on the conservative side with regard to inserting additional items in the area of the redistribution commission. It is working very well at the moment and reflects the overall philosophy of the Act. </PARA>
<PARA> The insertion of this item will not improve by one iota the major issue that Senator Puplick raised-that is, the disparity between representation in the House of Representatives for any particular political party and the number of seats it gets. As Senator Puplick himself acknowledged, that is an inherent part of a single member electorate system. It is just one of the defects in that system which cannot be overcome. To overcome it one would need to adopt a proportional representation system or some variant of that. I have argued in the past that that is precisely what we ought to be doing in the House of Representatives. It is a minority view and one which I am sure neither the Government nor the Opposition will embrace at this point, although on various occasions they have come close to it. </PARA>
<PARA> If the Opposition proposes to stick with a single member electorate system in the House of Representatives it will have to wear the defects. The transferable vote through the preferential system improves it vastly over some other methods, such as the first past the post method. Even with that preferential system we will still get some of the anomalies operating. Theoretically, in a single member electorate system all we really need to win under the preferential system is a little over 25 per cent and that will give 50 per cent of the seats. It has never happened but it is possible. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, winning anywhere between 25 per cent and 50 per cent, but the closer a party gets to 50 per cent the better the system is working. At the moment as a single member electorate system, I think it is probably operating at its optimum. That system will always have the inherent defect that it can turn up lesser percentages for majorities of seats. It did in Western Australia. Undoubtedly it will do it again.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We will have an election in Queensland on 2 December. If honourable senators want to look at an odd system operating, they will see one operating on 2 December. Some extraordinary things will occur in that particular election not because of gerrymanders as such-they are relatively minor in Queensland-but because of the massive malapportionment that operates in that State. That is the major difficulty. If we are staying with the single member electorate system the current pressure on the equality of votes is where it should remain and the introduction of this amendment will not do anything in the areas that Senator Puplick wants to do something about. </PARA>
<PARA> There are other methods. We can go to some type of top up or whatever else we want attached to a House of Representatives system. It is perfectly feasible, even without going to a proportional representation system, to actually have a top up system on the House of Representatives to overcome that defect. If we are willing to stay with this system at the moment I think that this amendment will not improve it; hence, we will not be supporting it. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I speak very briefly in opposition to this amendment. I agree with all the remarks that Senator Robert Ray made. I want to bring one particular point to the attention of the Senate. As I understand it in 1976 South Australia was the first State to adopt one vote one value in its electoral system and also to establish an independent electoral commission that had the absolute right to determine boundaries. It was one of the great achievements of the then Dunstan Labor Government. The Australian Labor Party as we all know fought for that process for about 30 years.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As a party official I was involved in the preparation of the party submission to that very first electoral commission in South Australia chaired by Justice Bright. Representatives from the Liberal Party of Australia turned up at the hearings, after 30 years of rigging boundaries, and malapportionment particularly in South Australia, and suddenly started arguing before the commission the exact intent of this amendment-that the commission should draw electoral boundaries according to the voting political preference of people to ensure that the expressed wish of 50 per cent plus one of the voters was reflected in seats. This debate in the commission went on for days. I do not wish to attempt to bring in the whole transcript and seek to have it incorporated or tabled but if Senator Puplick is interested in this debate I draw his attention to the transcript of that debate before the electoral commission in 1976. In the end the electoral commission comprehensively rejected this proposal. It rejected it in principle. The commission hit it right out of the ground in a practical way trying to point out how it could possibly draw boundaries taking into account the way people should vote. </PARA>
<PARA> As Senator Ray said, votes change from election to election. Polling booths do not reflect the same vote every election. We can draw boundaries based on the previous election and still get a result at the next election which means that 50 per cent of the vote plus one would not automatically be guaranteed to win a majority of seats. I think that process in South Australia was very thorough. It rejected this notion that has been put forward in Senator Puplick's amendment. Like Senator Robert Ray I also note that people in the Opposition-as seemed apparent from Senator Crichton-Browne's remarks-do not understand that in a single constituency system there is a proportionate amount, or what we call a bonus to the winning side, involved. If the boundaries are fair, winning 51 per cent of the vote does not mean winning 51 per cent of seats. It probably means the party wins close to 60 per cent of the seats. The definition of fairness is that, if at the next election the other side gets 51 per cent or 52 per cent of the seats, it will actually get into government. </PARA>
<PARA> Charges and accusations have quite rightly been made that proportionately sometimes the cube rule, in its pure sense, has shown that some governments have been elected in a change of government and they have been underrepresented. The majority actually should have been bigger. I accept that that is a valid criticism. The real point is that the government changed when we had one vote one value and fairly drawn boundaries by an independent electoral commission. </PARA>
<PARA> I find the situation in Western Australia deliciously ironic. The Labor Party wanted one vote one value. The Liberal Party rejected it in the upper House and stuck with a malapportionment system. Because the Labor Party through good campaigning, good management and the good attitude of the voters in the outback areas of Western Australia won seats that the Liberal Party did not presume it would win the Labor Party was able to win government. Had a one vote one value system been introduced it is probable that the Liberal Party would be in government in Western Australia today. It is the first time of which I am aware that a party has been hoist with its own petard-a classic phrase-by not supporting one vote one value. I trust that the Western Australian Liberal Party is now willing to support one vote one value in that State because it may well mean that it has a better chance of winning government. </PARA>
<PARA> In a practical sense as well as in a principle sense, I think this amendment should be rejected. As in Senator Robert Ray's anecdote about politicians drawing boundaries, there is also a classic case in South Australia. In 1953 Don Dunstan won a seat off the Liberal Party in a major swing to the Labor Party-a seat that had been held by the Liberal Party for many years. There was a redistribution under the Playford Government between 1953 and 1956. The boundaries were redrawn. Dunstan lost the best Labor voting area of his electorate and picked up a very strong Liberal voting area. When the Parliament was dissolved and the speeches made on the last night of the Parliament, Tom Playford took great delight in pointing the finger at Don Dunstan across the chamber saying, `One thing is for certain: the honourable member for Norwood will not be back here after the next election'. </PARA>
<PARA> Dunstan was back after the next election with an increased majority which proves that even the best laid plans of Premiers like Tom Playford could not get it absolutely correct in rigging boundaries against someone such as Don Dunstan. I think we all have anecdotes on this situation. I want to conclude by saying that this amendment should be rejected because it is impractical and it will not achieve the result that Senator Puplick would like it to achieve. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Today's Age newspaper states that yesterday the Australia Council notified the Melbourne Theatre Co., Anthill, that its grant for operating costs for 1990 would not be renewed. That represents a cut in funding to Anthill of between $130,000 and $140,000 and will almost certainly mean the demise of the theatre company known as Anthill-the Australian Nouveau Theatre. That decision was leaked. It was forecast in the press a week ago that the Australia Council intended doing this. I find that extraordinary and unconscionable in itself but it is nothing compared with the actual decision that has been taken. No explanation has been given to Anthill or anyone-certainly not to the public-as to why this decision has been taken. It appears to have been taken to meet the whim of the Victorian Minister for the Arts who has asked for a cut in funding to theatres and art in Victoria so that money can be redirected towards so-called initiatives-not one of which has surfaced as yet and been made publicly known.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The decision has been greeted with dismay by virtually everyone who has had anything to do with Anthill and has any knowledge of the major contribution that it has made to theatre not only in Melbourne but right throughout Australia, for many years. It is the theatre which has, in the words of Patrick White, for example, kept the banner of innovative theatre flying. The company commands the respect of Richard Wherrett of the Sydney Theatre Co.; Neil Armfield of Belvoir St Theatre; Ray Lawler-all the greats of Australian theatre-and virtually all the general managers or executives of theatres and art groups in Australia. For example, Ken MacKenzie-Forbes, the General Manager of the Victorian State Opera and a member of the arts delegation, has said that the Victorian Minister, Mr Walker, who appears to have had a very important part to play in this decision, was being poorly advised if he believed that initiatives that his ministry has funded, such as a pancake race at a cost of $20,000, could take precedence over the continued existence of companies such as Anthill. An outraged Ray Lawler is quoted in the Australian of 19 October as saying this about the then proposal, now the actuality, to abandon funding:</PARA>
<PARA> During my years with the Melbourne Theatre Company as a director and literary adviser I was strongly conscious that Anthill's program offered a genuine alternative to the flagship offerings of the MTC, both in style and choice of material. I was particularly aware of the Anthill treatment of European classics, which were staged with a flair and insight that I had not seen elsewhere in the country. </PARA>
<PARA> Later as a playwright I watched John-Pierre Mignon-</PARA>
<PARA>he is the director of Anthill-</PARA>
<PARA>bring the same flair and insight to two productions of Summer of the Seventeenth Doll-</PARA>
<PARA>giving both audiences and me a Lawler's own-</PARA>
<PARA>fresh and stimulating slant on seemingly hidebound Australian subject matter. </PARA>
<PARA>Lawler goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA> It is this ability to break the parochial mould that enables Anthill to make a unique contribution to our theatre scene, and I believe that the company and its artistic director fully deserve government support. </PARA>
<PARA>It is John-Pierre Mignon who has made Anthill famous. Earlier this year he was awarded the Order of Australia for his work as artistic director of Anthill. He enabled Anthill, through his brilliance and work, to be voted one of the best three offerings at the Hamburg Drama Festival. The list of people speaking in support of Anthill and the continuation of its funding is very long indeed. I have read the names of some and there are many others. For example, the Melbourne Theatre Co. General Manager, Andrew Kay, said that the closure of Anthill-and that is virtually inevitable-would savage the city's exciting and vibrant theatre scene. That is just one of a range of very typical statements about this quite extraordinary and shameful decision. It is taking place at a time when Arts Council of Australia funding is going to a whole myriad of other projects which quite obviously are being funded because they are the playthings of the mates of the Australian Labor Party. </PARA>
<PARA> The funding to which many of us in this chamber have drawn attention from time to time is for trade union arts activities and projects, such as the women in the arts: a gender bias study, at a cost of millions of dollars. The trade unions have received funding through the Arts Council and they have received other forms of government funding. The list is endless. If the Hawke and Cain governments believe that the decision to cease funding Anthill is in accord with the priorities of the development of innovative theatre in Australia, which is important to the development of a culture that will make Australia a country of theatrical and artistic excellence, their sense of priorities is drastically wrong. It is in the public interest that theatres such as Anthill be encouraged to flourish and, as I have said, anyone who has witnessed an Anthill production recognises that the priorities of these governments are to be absolutely condemned. </PARA>
<PARA> I have had an opportunity to speak about this matter with my friend and colleague the shadow Minister, Senator Puplick. I know Senator Puplick agrees with me that Anthill is the sort of theatre that the Liberal and National parties in government would fully support. The Liberal and National parties arts policy, which was released some time ago, says this about the Commonwealth's role in the arts:</PARA>
<PARA> Adequate direct federal support will be provided for our major arts institutions, and for what will be designated Companies of Excellence. These companies which may already be established with a national focus or may be more regionally based will be those which act as pacesetters in contributing to the improvement of standards throughout Australia. They will be encouraged to further develop a sense of true national responsibility and international outlook. They will be funded through our Major Organizations Unit and with appropriate support from the States. </PARA>
<PARA>Later the arts policy document, under the heading `Major organizations', states:</PARA>
<PARA>Within the Department there will be a separate Major Organizations Unit to advise the Minister (in conjunction with the Department of Finance) on the appropriate level of direct funding for the major performing arts bodies and the major national cultural institutions. These will be expanded to include not only the major companies such as The Australian Opera, The Australian Ballet and the various State Theatre Companies but also the major arts education institutions, in particular the National Institute of Dramatic Art, the Australian Ballet School and the Film, Television and Radio School. These organizations will be funded directly by the Commonwealth and will be guaranteed funding on a triennial basis, subject to their continuing to meet standards of excellence. </PARA>
<PARA>As I understand it, companies such as Anthill would be eligible to be considered, depending on their merit, as companies of excellence and, therefore, would be eligible for funding and support through the major organisations unit. I repeat that I believe, as I think most Victorians do, that the decision announced yesterday to cut to nil Australia Council funding of the operating costs of Anthill is a disgrace. It is illogical and it is a major blow to theatre in not only Victoria but Australia. I urge, in the strongest possible terms, the Australia Council and the Victorian Government to look at this shameful decision. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The purpose of the Exotic Animal Disease Control Bill 1989 and six related industry amendment Bills is to establish an Exotic Disease Preparedness Consultative Council, to raise levies and to provide financial assistance for purposes related to the control and eradication of exotic animal diseases. The coalition parties support the Bills. Their importance is not reflected, I might say, in the Government's decision that they be brought before the chamber during the lunchtime debate on non-controversial matters.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Any outbreak of exotic disease in Australia would be enormously costly for the nation and primary producers. It would be disastrous for Australian primary producers. But it goes further than that. Given Australia's current economic situation, with our overseas debt in excess of $110 billion and our current account debt running at a rate of approximately $20 billion per annum, if we had an outbreak of exotic disease in this country it would threaten our very economic survival. Such an outbreak would place virtually all exports of livestock products at risk at an estimated cost of about $8 billion a year. As I say, under this Government the nation simply cannot afford to lose the revenue. The result not only would be disastrous for primary producers but also could threaten the very economic survival of the nation. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has agreed to fund the industry on a dollar for dollar basis up to $750,000 a year for an Exotic Disease Preparedness Consultative Council which will assess the adequacy of exotic disease control procedures and the human and capital resources associated with those procedures. The Council will also inquire into the social and economic implications of exotic disease and the compensation principles and advise on how to monitor the efficiency of veterinary emergency plans. </PARA>
<PARA> The National Farmers Federation agreed to take up the Government's offer because it saw the need for an independent body to look at these matters rather than an interdepartmental committee being bogged down with them. Honourable senators who have had the pleasure of watching the Yes Minister program know that referring a matter to an interdepartmental committee is often just a means of deferring action for the foreseeable future. The National Farmers Federation decided that it would rather go the other way. </PARA>
<PARA> The Council will consist of eight part time members, two of whom will be from the National Farmers Federation. There will be a representative from the Australian Agricultural Council, an officer from the Department of Primary Industries and Energy and three people with special and appropriate qualifications. I am delighted to say that a sunset clause provides for the termination of the Council on 30 June 1995. However, I hope that it will be able to complete its important work in a much shorter period. </PARA>
<PARA> There is some concern about duplication, as the Australian Agricultural Council has a committee developing a plan associated with exotic disease preparedness and related matters, and some States have been funding their own preparedness plans. The Council will need to liaise closely with those other bodies to ensure that duplication of effort and wastage is avoided. </PARA>
<PARA> The Senate Standing Committee for the Scrutiny of Bills raised some concerns in respect of the Live-stock Slaughter Levy Amendment Bill 1989 because the Bill provides for amounts of levy to be set by regulations, with no provision to limit the amount of the levy. The Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Kerin) has agreed that industry contributions to the trust account will be subject to a maximum limit of $750,000, thereby setting a final limit to the annual contributions made by the red meat industry. </PARA>
<PARA> There is also some concern that the Council may be used as a backdoor means of transferring more of the total cost of the quarantine program to protect our livestock to a group of agricultural industries, when other beneficiaries including, for example, the general public are not and non-agricultural quarantine costs continue to be borne by the Government. The operations of the Council will need to be monitored carefully to ensure that the levies raised are used for the purposes stated in the principal Bill and are not used to pay for work currently undertaken by the Department of Primary Industries and Energy or some other government body. We wish the Bills a speedy passage. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The principal Act imposes an annual levy on all borrowings by Commonwealth semi-governmental authorities other than those which are engaged primarily in the business of financial intermediation. The Commonwealth Borrowing Levy Amendment Bill is largely a housekeeping exercise designed to include in the relevant schedule of the Bill two new authorities-the Civil Aviation Authority and Aerospace Technologies of Australia-in order to render them subject to the borrowing levy arrangements. At the same time, the amending Bill will delete from the present schedule the ACT Electricity and Water Authority. That is a proposal which is pursuant to the recent provision of self-government to the Australian Capital Territory and will have the consequence that in future the Authority will be treated on all fours with authorities of the States and the Northern Territory; in other words, not subject to the Commonwealth borrowing levy. The Bill also incorporates some definitional changes which will allow this levy to be applied to any relevant authorities which may be created in the future and also, of course, to the subsidiaries of Commonwealth authorities and companies. The Opposition does not oppose the Bill.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Commonwealth Borrowing Levy Collection Amendment Bill is a purely machinery measure to give effect to the proposals which I have already outlined.

Under that Act the Commission comprises the Chief Justice, the Secretary to the Treasury, the Secretary to the Attorney-General's Department, the Governor of the Reserve Bank of Australia and a representative of the States. In 1971 I was Secretary to the National Debt Commission and later on, between 1979 and 1984, in my capacity as Secretary to the Treasury, I was a member of the Commission. The Bill arises from a request by the Chief Justice that the position of Chief Justice be deleted from the membership of the Commission. I understand that the Chief Justice put forward this view on the grounds that the activities of the Commission have no relationship to the responsibilities of the Chief Justice and that ordinarily a Chief Justice is unable to contribute any economic expertise to the Commission's deliberations. As to legal expertise, because the Secretary to the Attorney-General's Department is already an ex officio member of the Commission, there is no particular need for additional legal expertise of that kind.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories.

Were the Prime Minister and Cabinet advised by the Minister of the existence and contents of the report from the Minister's Department entitled Assessment of Potential Environmental Impact of Mining in Rockhole-El Sherana-Palette Area, Kakadu Conservation Zone which, in fact, did assess future mining development in the region and which flatly contradicts many of the Minister's assertions? If so, was this report simply ignored by Cabinet?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have seen the story by Peter Gill in this morning's Australian Financial Review upon which Senator Puplick appears to have based his question. I think he could have done better in looking for a source. The real story is very different to the one told by Mr Gill this morning. In January last year I visited the area. I had a look not only at Coronation Hill but also at El Sherana and other sites in the region including Rockhole. BHP made it clear to me that the environmental impact study (EIS) for Coronation Hill would be quite some time off and that it wanted to drill El Sherana to determine the extent of the oil body there. As a result, my primary concern was to get some impression of what would happen at El Sherana and in its immediate vicinity if exploration or mining were to go ahead. I knew that I would be asked to give advice on that matter, on whether or not we should have some environmental assessment of the drilling, and I knew that that advice would be asked for fairly soon.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The resulting report, which was dated July 1988 and to which Senator Puplick has referred, was not on Coronation Hill. It was a preliminary examination by two officers in the Department of potential problems associated with mining in the Rockhole-El Sherana-Palette area. They are all prospects which are immediately adjacent to the South Alligator River. It was not and could not have been a scientific assessment. I still do not consider that I have any advice before me, any proper assessment before me, upon which I could base any advice either to Stewart West for the specific purpose of drilling or to the Cabinet at the time of the Coronation Hill conservation zone debate.</PARA>
<PARA> The report which we are speaking about and about which Senator Puplick has asked me is based on the information, the very small amount of information, which was available 18 months ago. It has since been drowned in a flood of scientific and technical work on Coronation Hill and the region that has become available in that period. It includes the Coronation Hill EIS, which has some examination in it of the Dames and Moore report on the area's natural and cultural values, the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation report on the area's biological values and the public environmental report (PER) on exploration at El Sherana.</PARA>
<PARA> While Mr Gill acknowledges in the article that some government departments were sent copies of the report, he failed to acknowledge all of the information that he had and that my office had made available to him and just how widely it was distributed. I tried so hard to keep this report secret that I sent it to the Broken Hill Proprietary Co. Ltd (BHP), the Department of Primary Industries and Energy, the Department of Aboriginal Affairs, the Office of the Supervising Scientist and the Australian National Parks and Wildlife Service. The report was also made available to the Northern Territory Government. That is how secret it was.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The others got it in July last year, the Northern Territory Government in March of this year. So all the main players in the game-every single one of them-had this report well before the Cabinet debate. The fact that none of them used it in the lead-up to the Cabinet decision or in its immediate aftermath suggests just how really significant it was. It had no significance and no relevance and was used by no-one. But, of course, those who do not like the Government's decision-in particular, that means Broken Hill Proprietary Co. Ltd-have been searching their records, combing their files till late into the night, to try to find some way of discrediting the decision. They are going to have to do a lot better than this. Mr Gill claims that after the Cabinet decision I said `We've got no assessment at all' of other mining activity. In fact, I had said that we had no assessment at all of the impact of processing ore from other mines and El Sherana at Coronation Hill. Mr Gill quotes the report as saying:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The proposed Coronation Hill mine plant, tailings dam and associated infrastructure seem to have the capacity to cater for other moderate-sized mines in the valley.</PARA>
<PARA>That was an accurate quotation, but when one selectively quotes one always gives the wrong impression. The very next sentence is worth reading in conjunction with the first. It says:</PARA>
<PARA> The location of mine workings, waste rock dumps and access roads will need to take into account the results of detailed cultural and natural studies of the area.</PARA>
<PARA>BHP made it clear that its final EIS only assessed the processing of Coronation Hill ore. That EIS says:</PARA>
<PARA> It is inappropriate to discuss other future developments that are not known or defined at this time.</PARA>
<PARA>The conclusions of the report on which I have been questioned by Senator Puplick make it quite clear that there was insufficient information to make a decision about mining impacts. It also points out the many potential detrimental effects of mining. I will read just two of those five conclusions. They are very short. I am quite happy to table the conclusions. The second of the conclusions states:</PARA>
<PARA> The lack of project definition at this stage means that it is not possible to determine whether mining could proceed on the current prospects in the upper South Alligator valley without causing significant environmental impact.</PARA>
<PARA>It is interesting that Mr Gill could not get that into his report. The fifth conclusion states:</PARA>
<PARA>The major environmental risks associated with mines in the valley, including Coronation Hill, arise from run-off and leachate from waste rock dumps, leakage or spillage from the tailings dam and spillage of cyanide, diesel or other chemicals resulting from vehicle accidents. All these events have the potential to affect detrimentally the water quality of the South Alligator River and the World Heritage wetlands downstream.</PARA>
<PARA>So even that report, had it been produced and had it been appended to the Cabinet material, would have done me much more good than harm. But, of course, when it comes to the kind of newspaper report we got today, what can one rely on? Mr Gill has a great flurry in conclusion. He suggests that it is terrible that the Cabinet would refer this strip from Coronation Hill through to El Sherana and Rockhole to the Resource Assessment Commission when the report had made it clear that these areas should be subjected to existing processes. That was quite reasonable at the time. The difficulty was that the Resource Assessment Commission did not exist then. How could Cabinet recommend that it go there when it did not exist and Cabinet had never heard of it? Really, in view of all of those inaccuracies, this piece this morning is no more than a scandalous piece of yellow journalism. I would have thought that a newspaper of the supposed quality of the Australian Financial Review could have and should have done very much better.</PARA>

I first of all ask whether the Minister will table not just the recommendations but the text of the report from which he quoted-that is to say, the entire report, not just the conclusions. Secondly, I thank him for his answer in which he dumped on his officers and ask him by way of supplementary question: Since he has conceded that the document was not made available to Cabinet as part of its deliberations when he said `had it been appended', does he stand, therefore, by the statement that he made on 17 October `when you have a long debate in Cabinet it's not possible to believe everything wasn't taken into account'? Finally, since the Minister has conceded that there is now, to use his words, `an absolute flood of information about this subject', can he possibly explain why in the name of reason the matter now has to go to the Resource Assessment Commission for further evaluation?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;First off, I reject absolutely any suggestion that I have dumped on any officer in my Department. The two officers concerned who visited the site for a few days are both valued officers in my Department. They are people whose opinions I respect very much. I am only suggesting-and there is certainly no attempt from the Department to deny it-that this was a very quick preliminary assessment which was done before a great deal more information was made available. That is in no way dumping on them. Officers can report only on the information that they can get at. That is the first point that I want to make.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Secondly, I was asked whether I stand by the statement that, after a Cabinet debate of this length, everything was taken into account. Of course everything was taken into account. The statements that are put in this report were all argued. They were argued out at very considerable length-not just a little bit but a great deal. Since that time there have been, as I said, an EIS on Coronation Hill, which included some assessment of biological values in the area from Dames and Moore; a PER at El Sherana on drilling, not on a full scale mining operation; and, as I have already said, a CSIRO report was made available as well.</PARA>
<PARA> All of those reports helped. They take us further down the path to making the right decision. But Cabinet decided, in my view rightly, that that was not enough, that there are more studies to be done to determine just what effect these mines are going to have on the South Alligator River.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr President, I give this answer with some caution in the light of the presence in your gallery of a delegation from the Pakistani Senate who know this subject much better than I. But on 23 October, three days ago, Opposition members in the Pakistan National Assembly did move a motion of no confidence in the Government of Ms Benazir Bhutto. The Pakistan People's Party (PPP) Government of Ms Bhutto holds power in the National Assembly in coalition with several smaller parties, including the Mohajir Qaumi Movement (MQM). The MQM has, however, announced its decision to end its coalition with the PPP and some members of the MQM are believed to support the no confidence motion. The vote is not expected to be taken for some days-possibly not until early November.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> All I can really say about the Australian Government's attitude to this matter is that we did, of course, very much welcome the return to democracy in Pakistan with the election of the new National Assembly in November 1988 and Ms Bhutto's appointment as Prime Minister in December last year. We hope that the outcome of the debate on the vote of no confidence will not jeopardise the progress that has been so obviously, manifestly and attractively achieved in returning Pakistan to stable democratic government.</PARA>

In the light of the September balance of payments deficit of over $2 billion, in seasonally adjusted terms, announced yesterday and the September quarter consumer price index (CPI) figure of 2.3 per cent announced today, does the Government itself fully realise how serious our situation is?

That was the government that was going to put value back into the pound. I do not know whether Senator Lewis wants any more discourses on the history of inflation in Australia.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do remember the question and I do not doubt that he quoted me correctly in that part of the answer. But I do not remember all that clearly the rest of the context of it. The reference that he made to a current account deficit in excess of $2 billion for the month of September, seasonally adjusted, may be correct. But I am aware of no accepted seasonal adjustment for monthly current account deficits. The actual figure was $1.776 billion which, again, as with an inflation rate of 8 per cent-or some might argue, a bit above 8 per cent-is, of course, higher than any sensible person would like to see. This is with the possible exception of a number of members of the Opposition, I suppose, who, for quite cynical political reasons, would probably like to see both even higher because they think it would enhance their chances of getting into government. Of course, that always takes precedence in the Opposition's scale of moral values over the good of the nation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> On the last point, the consumer price index and the current account deficit are both higher than the Government would like them to be, but neither of those-the three-month accumulated current account deficit for the month of September or the consumer price index for the quarter ending September-are incompatible with the Budget forecasts which forecast a CPI increase of just over 7 per cent for the 12 months ending June and a current account deficit of the order of $18 1/2m billion, with the proviso that we expected the rate of both to be higher in the first half of this financial year. Therefore, it is true that the cumulative current account deficit is just above $6 billion for the first three months. The September quarter CPI is running at a quarterly rate which, if annualised, would be higher than the Budget forecasts. Because it was explicitly spelt out at the time of the Budget that we anticipated both of these figures would be higher in the first part of the financial year, they are not incompatible with the Budget forecast.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr President. I ask a supplementary question. First, I ask the Minister to explain his comment that he was unaware of any acceptable basis for a monthly seasonally adjusted balance of payments figure? Is the Minister unaware that the Australian Statistician now publishes month by month seasonally adjusted figures for the current account of the balance of payments? If he, as I would have assumed, was aware of that fact, is he therefore saying that the Statistician does not know what he is doing and that these figures are not worth the paper that they are written on? Is that what the Minister is saying? Secondly, in view of the Minister's disquisition upon the budgetary presentation of the balance of payments forecasts-the $18.5 billion figure in the Budget Papers-and as he himself acknowledged the over $6 billion of deficit in the first three months of this year, is he saying that in the second half of this year we will be down to a balance of payments deficit of something like $1 billion a month, or maybe just a shade over $1 billion a month? If so, what will bring that about?

I did not explicitly spell this out in responding to the first question, but it is true that there is a seasonal pattern in the monthly current account figures, but there is also superimposed on that in this year in the Government's judgment-and this was spelt out in the Budget Papers-a cyclical pattern; that is, we expect the economy to slow down in the second half of this year, total demand to fall, and probably demand for imports to fall more than proportionately to the decline in total demand.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This is a matter in which a number of senators and members have taken an interest. Maybe my answer will relieve some of the pressure on my office as a result. The current session of the United Nations General Assembly in New York will consider the adoption of a draft convention on the rights of the child. The current text is the result of 10 years of protected negotiations by a United Nations working group in which Australia was an active participant. Earlier this year the United Nations Commission on Human Rights endorsed that draft convention and passed it to the General Assembly for possible adoption.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Australian Government strongly supports the adoption by the United Nations of the draft convention which will set new, internationally agreed standards for the protection of children and will provide a framework for advocacy on behalf of children and families. However, the draft convention does contain a number of issues which could be regarded as controversial and which remain subject to divergent views. In particular, the text contains a definition which recognises that every child has the inherent right to life. Although a reference to the rights of the child `before as well as after birth', taken from the 1959 United Nations Declaration on the Rights of the Child does appear in the preamble of the draft convention, at the same time a statement in the travaux preparatoires-the preparatory materials-makes it clear that the contentious issue of the child's rights before birth is a question to be determined by individual states parties.</PARA>
<PARA> The other matter of controversy is an article in the draft which sets the minimum age for military service at 15. A number of countries, including Australia, strongly oppose this, arguing that the age of 18 should be the minimum. However, the convention will set minimum standards only and individual states parties will be able to determine an age beyond 15 for military service should they so wish.</PARA>
<PARA> Australia recognises in these circumstances that the current draft does not entirely meet all our objectives, nor those of some other like-minded countries. However, we are conscious of the risks to the adoption of the convention should these issues be re-opened for general debate at the General Assembly. Australia will therefore resist attempts at the General Assembly to re-open contentious issues which could jeopardise the early adoption of the convention.</PARA>
<PARA> No decisions on Australia's ratification of the text can be made in advance of the emergence of an agreed final text, although preliminary consultations between Federal and State governments have commenced. Might I suggest that any further questions, concerning in particular the right to life issue, or on communications between Federal and State governments on the processes of Australian ratification of the rights of the child convention, be directed to the Attorney-General.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Leader of the Government in the Senate. Given Australia's current trade deficit which I understand is running at somewhere between $4 billion and $5 billion and the consequent need for consumers in Australia to buy fewer imported goods and more locally made products-that is if they are going to buy goods at all-can the Minister say why one of the biggest purchasing organisations in the country, namely the Federal Government, does not follow this principle?

For the benefit of others, if not the Minister, I point out that those sections of that Act relate to the preferential buying of Australian goods by Commonwealth authorities. Is it correct that these sections were not proclaimed in 1981 and have not been proclaimed since then despite having the approval of the Parliament, because some Ministers and some bureaucrats objected?

<PARA> The question of government purchasing in this country has been a difficult one for various governments at various times. Numerous inquiries into it have been commissioned by governments, as far as I can remember, since the early 1970s, and different points of view have been advanced on the whole question of government purchasing. Earlier this year the Commonwealth introduced an entirely new system of Commonwealth government purchasing which gets rid of the traditional tendering system and provides for functional specifications by departments or government instrumentalities. The former tenderer now puts in a bid on the basis of answering the functional requirement of a department; not on the basis of bits and pieces of equipment and so on. That system has just been introduced. I believe that it will work much better once it is fully in operation, particularly in the interests of Australian suppliers. Specifications for tenders traditionally, for reasons which Senator Haines has identified in her question, tended to be written to suit overseas suppliers. If I might say so-seeing Senator Newman nodding her heard, I assume in agreement rather than nodding off-that has been particularly so in the area of defence purchasing. I do not have the figures in front of me but, if we look at the pattern of government defence purchasing under previous governments and at the pattern of defence purchasing and manufacture in Australia now, we see that there has been an enormous change in that area. I will have a look at the particular sections of that Act. I suspect that they might be subsumed by the new purchasing policies announced by the Government.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Honourable senators opposite may not want to join in the search for original information, but I am sure that Senator Devereux does and he is entitled to an answer. I am aware of a survey conducted by the reputable polling organisation, Roy Morgan and Associates. It provided data to members of a consumer panel for Australia and conducted an Australia-wide survey looking at the records and details of purchasing of a wide range of consumer items. During August 1989 panel members were asked to record details of all prescriptions collected from pharmacists by households around Australia. The findings of the survey showed that in New South Wales 89.1 per cent of prescriptions issued were overcharged by an average amount of $1.46; that in Victoria 88.8 per cent of prescriptions issued by pharmacists were overcharged by $1.10; that in Queensland 76.7 per cent of prescriptions issued were overcharged by 76c; that in South Australia, the lowest return, 55 per cent of prescriptions issued were overcharged by 25c; and that in Western Australia, the highest level, 93.1 per cent of prescriptions issued were overcharged by $1.93. Of all prescriptions issued, 83.7 per cent were overcharged, on average by $1.15.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The amount of overcharging, if aggregated across pharmacies, amounts to a windfall to pharmacists of $29m per annum. Fifty-seven per cent of overcharged items recorded on the prescription form account for the 25 prescribing net; therefore, it is a clear breach of the National Health Act. Drugs priced below the general patient contribution level of $11 attract no government subsidy when supplied to patients without entitlement or with free or concessional benefits. On the basis of that I advise the Senate that the Government will now, having identified a clear breach of the law, look at what legislation needs to be introduced in order to protect the consumers of Australia and ensure that they are paying the right amount of money--</PARA>

There is nothing in the report that argues against what I said in the Senate the other day. It is possible to believe now, on the information available to us, if the proposed dams at Coronation Hill were increased in size, they could have the capacity to accommodate other moderate-sized mines. Of course, it would depend on what one meant by moderate and whether one considered El Sherana moderate. It would appear that El Sherana will be at least as big as Coronation Hill, if not bigger. But we would not have known very much about that at the time because the PER was specifically about permitting a drilling operation to find out what was there.

I must say that when we get asked as many questions as we seem to be asked in each question these days, it is difficult, unless one is accustomed to taking quick shorthand, to get it all down. But I will do my best. I was asked about the EIS at Coronation Hill and the PER at El Sherana and whether they specifically weakened my Department's advice. I quoted earlier from the EIS on Coronation Hill in which BHP specifically refused to address the processing from other mines in the region of Coronation Hill. So no information was available 18 months ago and still is not available on that issue. Of course, that is one of the things that the Resource Assessment Commission will take into account. Senator Tambling also claimed that I had not addressed the sentence that he read out about practical solutions being developed on a number of aspects. I can only go back to the conclusions of the report. He cannot pluck bits out of a report, one sentence here or there, and base his judgment on that. His judgment presumably must be based on the conclusion of the report. I quote again the conclusion of the report because he apparently did not pick it up the first time. It said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The major environmental risks associated with mines in the valley, including Coronation Hill, arise from run-off and leachate from waste rock dumps, leakage or spillage from the tailings dam and spillage of cyanide, diesel or other chemicals resulting from vehicle accidents. All these events have the potential to affect detrimentally the water quality of the South Alligator River and the World Heritage wetlands downstream.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I did receive a letter from Mr Pickering on these matters. My immediate comment to my staff was, `I wonder whether I will read this in the Sydney Morning Herald tomorrow'. I did not; it was two days later when I read a reference to this issue. That is obviously the way Mr Pickering does business. When he writes to Federal Ministers it always gets leaked well in advance. That is a pity because every fact he put in his letter to me was basically wrong. It was our Department that was approached by the New South Wales police to assist in these matters and it was the New South Wales police who agreed to provide the accommodation as we pointed out that our detention centres at that stage were totally full. No persons were detained for 21 days in police cells; I think the maximum time was 10 days. Mr Pickering has all his facts absolutely wrong. I know he is not having a good spell at the moment. He has a few other issues to worry him, with the Blackburn case and a few other matters on which he is not travelling very well.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> These differences between Federal and State governments could be avoided if just some element of courtesy were put back in. When State Ministers from New South Wales write to a Federal Minister, they should wait for a response occasionally rather than going public or leaking the issue or getting a dorothy dix question asked to get it all on the record. If they do that they will not be embarrassed by the fact that all the facts that they put in a letter to a Federal Minister happen to be wrong. That is not the first time this has happened to Mr Pickering. No doubt he has worries of his own. If he does not lift his game and if this is not the issue that sinks him, there are plenty of others around that might.</PARA>

It is quite clear from the absolute confusion that has taken place this week with regard to the Opposition's child care rebate that Mr Peacock, Dr Hewson and Mr Braithwaite know nothing about child care or child care policy. If they had taken the time to sit down and talk with those who are familiar with and responsible for community-based child care they could not have made the mistakes that they have made this week. We need go no further than a letter that appeared yesterday in the Melbourne Herald from the Women's Action Alliance. Yesterday Senator Hill criticised the Country Women's Association because it had expressed views against the coalition's family package. Today we have something from the Women's Action Alliance which I would like to take the time of the Senate to summarise. The letter is headed `Lip service no use for child care'.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I should not respond to Senator Puplick's interjection but I hope he was not suggesting that the Women's Action Alliance is made up of hairy legged feminists. The letter continues:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Howard package had tax rebates for child care, balanced by a carer's allowance of $800 a year, paid to families who provided their own child care, thereby forgoing one income.</PARA>
<PARA> The period during which a family exists on one income is a financially vulnerable one, and during that time families deserve financial support.</PARA>
<PARA>In this instance the Hawke Government agrees totally with the Women's Action Alliance. That is why the family allowance supplement was introduced to assist families in that position. The letter continues:</PARA>
<PARA> Under the Peacock package, a two-income family of two adults and two children, aged 11 and 4 years, will get $2010 a year extra assistance, but a single-income family will get only $450 a year.</PARA>
<PARA>That is what the Women's Action Alliance thinks of the Peacock family policy. It is most unfortunate that in this place the Government keeps getting this kind of criticism without any acknowledgment of the fact that it was the Hawke Government which introduced the indexation of the family allowance and family allowance supplements. Yet this afternoon we hear from Senator Chaney that Mr Peacock will include indexation but he has not said so. The Opposition spokesperson for the status of women has not mentioned it. I think it is up to Mr Peacock to indicate quite clearly. It has been raised again and again in the other place. Mr Peacock has not been intervening to make that point clear.

I remind the Senate that public servants are members of the community and their child-care needs are taken into account in this process.

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the paper. </PARA>
<PARA>I should like to take note of a couple of points raised in the report of the Dairy Research Council. All pastoral industries, whether it be the dairy industry or farming generally, are subject at the moment to fantastically high input cost increases. This is something that many people do not comprehend. The consumer price index is running at 7 or 8 per cent and it may be higher by the end of the year. Farm input costs are running in excess of 10 per cent per annum. This is highlighted in the dairy industry as much as in any other industry. The dairy industry has been subject to some changes by this Government. It is a resilient industry. However, I fear the competition that will come from across the Tasman in years to come. </PARA>
<PARA> The report makes a point about research into aspects of pasture and other matters. Research is one area in which the Government stands condemned because it has cut back the research funds for the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation, which has been a great help in all areas of Australian industry and, in particular, to the dairy industry and the other pastoral industries. The report notes the spread of exotic dung beetles throughout the dairying districts. Even though in my area in north-western New South Wales we are not involved in the dairying industry, the dung beetles there are doing an outstanding job in dissipating the cattle dung so that it can go back into the soil for the betterment of the pasture. I commend to the Senate the fourth annual report of the Dairy Research Council. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the paper. </PARA>
<PARA>The first point I would like to make in my brief discourse on the annual report of the Federal Airports Corporation (FAC) is that on the very first page the report says, `The corporation is a public authority with a private enterprise philosophy'. With the greatest of kindness to the FAC, if this is the practical application of a private enterprise philosophy, we had better find a new system by which to run our private enterprises because, if one statement can be made of the FAC, it is that it is simply not a commercially successful operation. One of its great problems stems from the fact that it simply does not understand how the aviation industry in Australia works. </PARA>
<PARA> It is interesting that the FAC reports a profit of $43.7m this year. As the report was distributed only this morning, I have not had time to go through it in detail, but I will do so and find out how the Corporation claims to have made its money. I must draw attention to the fact that it has charged the users of its airports $242.7m this year in fees and other levies. </PARA>
<PARA> The basic problem with the Federal Airports Corporation is that it does not understand how the aviation industry works and, as a consequence, taxes every user in every way for every service that it can possibly conceive. In so doing, it is driving business away from the airports that it owns. I am well aware that, for the two years for which we have had annual reports and from the times we have had the FAC before parliamentary committees, it has maintained that the users of its fields are increasing. That is simply not true of all of the fields of which I have had experience. There are some that have shown increases but the use of the great majority of fields, the secondary airports, is not what it was four or five years ago. </PARA>
<PARA> The FAC is labouring under the unrealistic belief that it can make every airport it owns profitable. The report before us today shows that the load of generating profit is being carried purely by Sydney and Melbourne, and the losses being generated by some of the secondary airports, shown by the FAC's accounting system, are quite staggering. For example, Essendon is estimated to be losing $3.7m a year; Bankstown, $4m a year; Moorabbin, $2 1/2m and Archerfield, $1.3m. They are quite big losses, but I have to qualify that by saying that the accounting systems used by the FAC are often quite strange and may bear no relevance to the true costs involved. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the difficulties under which the FAC is labouring is that the Government transferred the airfields to it at grossly inflated prices. All those airfields have been paid for by the Australian taxpayers. Once again, there was a bit of creative accounting by flash Harry, the Treasurer, Mr Keating, in an attempt to get the airfields off budget and, at the same time, make a profit, so the Civil Aviation Authority and the FAC were created. The creation of two authorities where one existed before has led to gross duplication of management and resources associated with it, such as buildings at the airfields, and all these costs have been borne by a very small taxation base in Australia, because the aviation industry is quite small. </PARA>
<PARA> The thing that is really wrong with the FAC is that the Government, in getting it off budget, set it up as a statutory authority, legally answerable to no-one. In actual fact, it is at the end of a phone for the Minister of the day to ring up and propose things to it if he does not agree with what it is doing. But there is no-one to whom the FAC or, for that matter, the CAA is answerable. They are certainly not answerable to this Parliament. What is wrong with that is that the Government has created a monopoly and said to it, `You go and live off the aviation community for your income'. That is quite a different matter to setting up Qantas Airways Ltd, for example, where alternative air carriers are available. But if we want to use the primary airport for Brisbane, Melbourne or Sydney we have no-one to go to but the FAC, and if we do not like the way in which it is doing business we certainly cannot get Parliament to intervene on our behalf. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Federal Airports Corporation (FAC) was covered by Estimates Committee B of which I am a member. I hold similar views to those which Senator Panizza expressed the other night at the Estimates hearings on the subject of the FAC. He remarked during those hearings that there seems to be a general dissatisfaction within the general aviation sector with the Federal Airports Corporation. Certainly, the early impression one had about the new Corporation was that it seemed to be engaged in a flurry of activity, erecting rather large and fancy signs at various airports. At the time those signs were going up I hoped the Corporation would be as efficient and enthusiastic in other areas of its responsibilities as it was in putting up its new logos.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I appreciate that there have been some difficulties in its stated objectives of making Sydney (Kingsford-Smith) Airport runways as passenger efficient as possible. That is a matter I have spoken on quite often in this place, and on which I have presented many petitions. The FAC has had to contend with air traffic controllers disputes, the pilots dispute, increased air traffic generally and a shortage of runways at many airports. I know, from the Estimates hearing that one area in which the FAC has been pretty efficient is in charges imposed on airline operators, even to the extent of charging operators for hangar space when the plane in question was in a stripped-down condition and could not fly anyway. It seems that operators will be charged for planes whether they are in the air, on the runways or parked in the hangars. The FAC seems to have a public relations problem. There is a criticism that the FAC does not talk to the users of its facilities and, instead of operating in a commercial and professional manner, at times gives the same indications as an inefficient bureaucracy. </PARA>
<PARA> Turning specifically to the annual report which, incidentally, relates only to the year 1 April 1988 to 31 March 1989, I suggest that next year's report will tell an entirely different story because of events that are going on at the moment. I note that the year in question traded with an operating profit of $43.7m and declared a dividend of $12.8m. The Chairman, Mr Sullivan, claims that 1988 was an exceptional year. I would say that that is an understatement for what is going on at the moment. I wonder what words he will use to describe this year. </PARA>
<PARA> Only four airports were profitable last year: Melbourne, Sydney, Brisbane and Coolangatta. I would be interested to learn what proposals there are for increasing profitability at other FAC-owned airports and what contingency plans there are for improving profitability this year, given the difficulty of the operating conditions which are now in place. I note that Bankstown Airport lost the most money last year, despite the fact that it had a record year of activity with nearly 400,000 movements. It is not clear whether this is the result of expenditure on the airport or other reasons. Again, it would have been very useful for us to know the reasons for that. </PARA>
<PARA> The Corporation has supported the Federal Government's announcement to proceed with the development of a third runway at Kingsford-Smith Airport. I say three cheers for that! Let us hope it eventuates. I wish I could be as confident in and as believing of the Government as the FAC is. It seems to me that while the Federal Government has been stalling and fiddling with the third runway, and flying all sorts of kites in the meantime, the FAC has been going hell for leather acquiring land at Badgerys Creek and surprise, surprise, will announce that the second airport could be built quicker than a third runway. All this will be done to protect the marginal seats around Kingsford-Smith Airport. It will be a totally wasted exercise because we will win the next election and build the third runway at Kingsford-Smith Airport. The FAC has had a stormy short history and I do not predict it will improve in the short term. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In speaking on the annual report of the Federal Airports Corporation (FAC), I draw the attention of the Senate to that section of it which deals with security, particularly that at Sydney (Kingsford-Smith) Airport. The Federal Airports Corporation has many questions to answer on this score. I hope it is frank and fulsome in its explanations which are due to this chamber because of the disgracefully misleading and deceptive press report put out by the Corporation following the release last month of an Auditor-General's report on the security at Sydney Airport. The annual report states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>The Corporation has worked closely with the Department of Transport and Communications, the airlines and other organisations to ensure the security of its airports. </PARA>
<PARA> A review was undertaken at each airport and security has been improved with the establishment and training of some 200 security staff. </PARA>
<PARA> The Corporation engaged a full-time security consultant to establish procedures, prepare security manuals, train staff and monitor security performance. </PARA>
<PARA> The Corporation is represented on the Aviation Safety Advisory Committee which provides policy advice to the Minister. </PARA>
<PARA>However, the Auditor-General demonstrated the appalling lack of security at Sydney Airport-during which members of the Auditor-General's staff were able to gain access to the tarmac area without any identification or authorisation-and that report, which came out last month, was responded to by the FAC-with a press statement which said, `Yes, we were aware of some security problems but we fixed them up back in April'. If, in fact, the FAC was aware of some security matters which were fixed up back in April, how quaint that this report does not dwell on the seriousness of those matters which were allegedly fixed. Let us recognise that that press statement was false, and deliberately false, which no doubt amuses the Leader of the Government in the Senate (Senator Button). </PARA>

The matters referred to in the Auditor-General's report, despite the claim by the Federal Airports Corporation, were not matters that had been dealt with in April. They were matters that were brought forward in June and July by the Australian Customs Service at various meetings and are to be the subject of discussions this week because the Australian Customs Service has advised us that it is very concerned about these elements and this lack of security that the Australian Customs Service pointed out to the Auditor-General. Meetings will be held this week with the Department of Transport and Communications. I hope those meetings deal fully and properly with a matter that the Federal Airports Corporation has sought to sweep under the carpet. I believe the FAC should be required to withdraw and correct its misleading press release. The matters have not been resolved.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Anyone reading the report who is concerned about the prospect or the possibility of terrorism at Sydney (Kingsford-Smith) Airport, who recognises that we are a major international air travelling area vulnerable to the potential of terrorist activity, would have every right to be deeply concerned about the lack of action, the lack of competence and the lack of honesty by the Federal Airports Corporation in dealing with this matter. I hope that the FAC, perhaps as a result of this speech dealing with its annual report, will at last come clean on how bad security is at Sydney Airport and will respond properly to the concerns of the Auditor-General. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the papers. </PARA>
<PARA>I have not brought these reports with me but I have scanned them. The reports give honourable senators a wonderful tour de force of the enormous range of activities undertaken by the National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC). I noted in the reports that there has been a change in policy direction for the use of funds in that research has been directed away from basic research into applied research and the funds spent on research are to be immediately and measurably productive. In other words, the research has to have some economic application forthwith. In itself that is not all bad as a policy change particularly when we have a Government that has run itself and the country out of money and the NHMRC wants money as quickly as it can get it. But it is a very short-sighted policy. </PARA>
<PARA> I noted particularly that the research funds for AIDS have been doubled and yet the research funds for our eight centres of excellence have come to the end of their time and their funds are to be cut and they are to be brought to a dead stop. Mr Acting Deputy President, you might remember that those eight centres were created nine years ago under the Fraser Government. They were funded under three triennia and they have been world leaders in their fields. Curiously, not only have the centres been able to come up with products that are saleable in several instances but they have also been able to provide teaching and demonstrations for the world scientific community. It will be a pity to see them go because they are so specialised in their fields that if they are to be thrown into the open market and have to apply for funding with the ordinary everyday run of scientific organisations, they are competing in the wrong race. They will have to find fields in which they can operate. It seems to me to be very unfair to be doubling the funding for research for a disease like AIDS when the funding is being cut out altogether for these centres of excellence. </PARA>
<PARA> Another thing I noted was that we have an enormous number of diseases that are now covered by immunisation and vaccination: measles, mumps, whooping cough, diphtheria, tetanus, et cetera. The Council has recommended that Australians carry an immunisation card with them. Not only do very few people have the card but the take-up of people who have been immunised has been very small. I was quite surprised by the number of people who are not immunised in Australia today. That is not a good thing because as the population's immunity falls we become liable to suffer from an epidemic-even a pandemic-of these diseases which were so devastating in the past and indeed at times have had the Angel of Death's wings flapping in the country. I hope people take note of that. </PARA>
<PARA> I am sure that honourable senators will not be able to read all three of these reports but if they pick the eyes out of them there are enormous areas of interest, one of which deals with the ethics of gene therapy. The Opposition has taken a big interest in that matter. A Senate committee has inquired into human embryo experimentation. This is really an extension of what has gone on since then. I recommend that honourable senators pick the eyes out of these reports and read the matters of interest to them. I particularly draw attention to the lack of immunity status of our nation and our inability to get immunity cards for ourselves. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the paper. </PARA>
<PARA>The report from the Senate Standing Committee on Industry, Science and Technology on manufacturing industry revitalisation was a unanimous report. It was submitted to the Senate earlier this year. I note with some degree of satisfaction that the Government response to the recommendations in the report, contained in the paper I am speaking to at the moment, have received general acceptance from Government. It would have been hoped that the report would have received general acceptance from the chamber and from all political parties in Australia. Unfortunately, that does not seem to be the case. For example, in the Australian Financial Review yesterday I noted in a column by Peter Roberts that one of the Opposition spokesman accused the Government that its drive to plough resources into speculative high-tech areas has proved a disaster. </PARA>
<PARA> Some of the major features which our Committee submitted to the Parliament put a very high degree of emphasis on the development of high technology and getting the work force and management of Australian industry to accept that there is a need to get into high technology if the manufacturing industry in Australia is to be revitalised or is to survive. Unfortunately, it would seem that the Opposition parties collectively are hell-bent on turning things around and destroying the manufacturing industry in Australia. I support the contention I have just made by referring to the economic policies which were announced by the present Leader of the Liberal Party, Mr Peacock, some two weeks ago, the Economic Action Plan. Page 17 of the economic and tax policy plan states:</PARA>
<PARA> Decades of protection have discouraged firms from investing in new technologies, and fostering non-market competition, leaving Australia lagging behind comparable overseas countries in terms of technology use and research and development. </PARA>
<PARA> On the one hand, the Opposition wants us to get into high technology but on the other hand individual Opposition spokespersons say that really we should get back to the mines and the farms. One does not know who to believe. In regard to the `decades of protection', the Opposition parties were in government for 30 out of the last 40 years. So the comment is a condemnation by its own hand of what the Opposition sought to do to Australia's industry over that time. It is only because of the good work of the present Government, under the leadership of the Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce, Senator Button, that our manufacturing industry is now venturing on to the world stage in terms. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us examine further the Opposition's plans announced two weeks ago. A major facet of the Government's action plan to bring Australian industry on to the world stage has been the very useful facility of Austrade. The Opposition parties would slash funding to that body by some $20m. They would slash research and development funding under the grants for industry research and development scheme and the National Industry Extension Service (NIES) by an estimated $50m if they should come to office. I do not think the NIES scheme is perfect. One of the problems with it is that it is fractured through the States. Each State competes with the others. This would be further exacerbated by the Opposition parties should they ever come to government as they would hand NIES over to the States and ask the States to fund it. Whilst NIES may not be perfect at the moment, one can be sure that, if its total control were ever handed over directly to the States, what achievements have been made to date would rapidly move backwards. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Honourable senators will be aware that I presented a minority report to the report of the Senate Standing Committee on Industry Science and Technology entitled Manufacturing Industry Revitalisation: Making it Together, which the Government does not seem to have commented upon. That is a pity, because I pointed out that there was a need to hold up an alternative economic model to what the Government was doing. As an example of that, I drew attention to the so-called Button car plan. I note that the most fuel efficient car which Mitsubishi currently makes, the Mitsubishi Colt, will probably go out of production because an insufficient number of cars of that model are sold, whereas the large gas guzzlers will continue to be manufactured at a time when the Government seems to be committed to cutting fuel consumption, CO2 and other greenhouse emissions by 20 to 40 per cent.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The other comment I make relates to the Government's non-acceptance of the Committee's principal recommendation of imposing strict monitoring on foreign investment to ensure that it complies with stringent conditions relating to research and development skill levels and export. The Government says that this would be counterproductive and that the benefits of foreign investment may be indirect, that there may be a benefit in terms of the balance of payments and so on. It is quite clear that the Government has no idea whatsoever of exactly where foreign investment is going in this country. Against a specific recommendation it has come up with a lot of airy fairy hogwash. It is a great pity that the Government, in the absence of any clear evidence to the contrary, has seen fit not to accept this very sensible recommendation of the Committee. We desperately need to know what foreign investment is coming into Australia and precisely where that foreign investment is going so we can attempt to direct it into those areas which are going to be most productive and most useful. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-On behalf of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade, I present the report of the Committee entitled, Report on a visit by the Foreign Affairs and Defence Committee of the New Zealand House of Representatives, together with the minutes of proceedings. I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That the Senate take note of the report. </PARA>
<PARA>Australian and New Zealand parliamentarians have participated in annual official delegations during the past 10 years, under the Fraser-Talboys Agreement. The purpose of the delegations was general fact-finding, aimed at increasing the general knowledge of parliamentarians about a near neighbour. In 1988 the then New Zealand Prime Minister, Mr Lange, held discussions with the Presiding Officers in Australia on the possibility of joint meetings between Australian and New Zealand parliamentary committees. After further discussions it was decided to institute joint meetings in place of the regular delegations, for a two-year experimental period. The first meetings under the new system were to be between the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade and the Foreign Affairs and Defence Committee of the New Zealand House of Representatives. </PARA>
<PARA> The visit which is the subject of this report was to Canberra in August 1989. It was an exchange for one made by members of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade to New Zealand in April of this year. It completed the first round of visits under the two-year experiment. The central activity under the experimental system is the joint meeting between committees of the New Zealand and Australian Parliaments which share similar interests and responsibilities. It was fortunate that the first series of visits was between committees which have so many common preoccupations. Discussion ranged across issues which are relevant to this Parliament and Government, as well as to the two committees involved: issues such as the South Pacific; defence; immigration and the environment. Two of the recommendations made by the joint meeting addressed the protection of Antarctica and protection from drift-net fishing. </PARA>
<PARA> The New Zealand and Australian Committees involved in this first series of joint meetings agreed that the new system is a great improvement on the exchange of general delegations. It may be that the subject matter which concerns our two committees had a great part to play in the success of the two visits. Indeed the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade recommended that joint meetings with its New Zealand counterpart be held on a regular basis. If this were to happen it would have to be in addition to the current two-year experiment of replacing general parliamentary delegations with committee exchanges. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like to make a few personal comments about some of the major matters dealt with in the report. As my introductory remarks say, we were fortunate that both the joint foreign affairs and defence committees were dealing with issues that there was considerable preoccupation with in both countries, no doubt the major one being the defence arrangements between both countries and, in particular, the standing of the Anzac frigate project. In our meeting in April this year in New Zealand and again in August there was considerable discussion of a controversial nature between both countries and between the members of both committees of each country about the nature of that project. </PARA>
<PARA> Since the Committee had its meeting in August, the New Zealand Government has decided to proceed with participation in the Anzac frigate program. I am delighted with that decision. I believe that whatever the controversial nature of the program, particularly in New Zealand, in the long run it will mean that the defence arrangements between our countries will become closer. It will in no way affect the sovereignty of either country. It will mean that we can have a more cooperative, more efficient and more common interest in regard to defence arrangements in the region of immediate concern to both countries, that is, the South Pacific. </PARA>
<PARA> Though there was considerable criticism in New Zealand about participating in the Anzac frigate program, I think even the critics in New Zealand, in particular, agreed that both Australia and New Zealand have a responsibility in terms of our relations with countries in the South Pacific. The other day the Deputy Prime Minister of the Cook Islands made it quite clear informally at a meeting of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade that he was quite supportive of the Anzac frigate program. He saw this joint venture between Australia and New Zealand as being in the interests of the Cook Islands and indicated that he had made his views known in New Zealand. I am aware that these comments were made at a private meeting of the Committee. But it was quite clear that he had made his views known publicly, so I do not think I am breaking any confidences in mentioning what he said. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee's report also deals with the question of the Antarctic Treaty and the protection of Antarctica. I think all members from both committees took the unanimous view that we want to protect the fragile environment of Antarctica. There is, of course, a difference of opinion between the two countries. The Australian Government has made it clear that we will not sign the so-called mining convention of Antarctica whereas, at a meeting in August, New Zealand was quite supportive of that convention being signed. However, there have been developments since then and I detect that we may be moving towards a position where both countries will be closer to reaching an agreement about the establishment of a world wilderness park in Antarctica. I think Australia and New Zealand have a special responsibility in leading the world debate on that issue. </PARA>
<PARA> Drift netting is an issue which, I suspect, is not of great interest to many Australians. But it is of extraordinary interest in the South Pacific. The Committee supported all moves by both countries in the South Pacific Forum to oppose drift netting because of the enormous impact it is having on fish stocks and the long term commercial viability of the fishing industries of the South Pacific countries. Hopefully, over the next year or so, Australia, in combination with New Zealand, can convince countries such as Japan and Taiwan to desist from using drift netting in the South Pacific. Although the report does not make a recommendation on the so-called Hawke initiative for the development of an economic forum for the Asia-Pacific region, the report does mention it. Despite our various partisan differences on other issues, there seemed to be general agreement that this initiative was worth while and should be further explored. </PARA>
<PARA> The final point I wish to comment on is the question of future meetings. Although the report says that the visit was an experiment in holding joint meetings across the Tasman, I think all of us who participated, and particularly those who participated in New Zealand and Australia, found the meetings extremely valuable. Therefore, we recommend that irrespective of any other joint meetings between parliamentary committees, because of the particular and special nature of the expertise in the joint foreign affairs committees of both parliaments, we should have a regular exchange at least once every two years. I certainly would encourage the governments and the Presiding Officers of both countries to accept that recommendation and to make sure that funds are made available. </PARA>
<PARA> I am reminded of one of the discussions we had in New Zealand with Russell Marshall, the Foreign Minister of New Zealand, who said that when he became a Minister the first time he visited Great Britain three times before he made his first visit to Australia. That is an extraordinary commentary on how often in the past relations between both countries have been on the back-burner, so to speak. Though we have been the closest of neighbours, we have seen our interests as being elsewhere and have acted accordingly. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that the meetings of the foreign affairs committees of both parliaments are an excellent step. I would also encourage the appropriate committees in both parliaments which deal with other matters to arrange joint meetings from time to time. Rather than the parliaments sending general delegations, I think the members of both parliaments who have a particular interest by being involved in particular committees will get a lot more out of these visits if they can meet on that basis. So I certainly support very strongly the recommendation that the Australian Joint Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade Committee continue to meet with the Joint Foreign Affairs and Defence Committee of the New Zealand Parliament at least once every two years. I commend the report to the Senate. Obviously my colleagues will address some of the substantive issues in the report. I also commend the notion of joint meetings between Australian and New Zealand parliamentary committees. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I, too, endorse the concept of regular meetings being held between the two joint foreign affairs committees of Australia and New Zealand. I think it is very important to establish and maintain very close links with our nearest neighbour across the Tasman. I certainly support the statement that we should work towards a joint position on Antarctica, to conserve it as a wilderness area free from the threat of mining. I think it is very important that Australia and New Zealand work on that together. I also endorse the joint activities to ban drift net fishing. I endorse the remarks of Senator Schacht on both those points.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I want to make some rather critical comments about the nature of the discussions that took place between the two committees. It was my observation in participating in these discussions that we treat the New Zealanders somewhat like cousins and, of course, many of us are literally cousins. We have a very close cultural identity with our neighbours across the Tasman. There were often elements of teasing, cajoling and even denigration in the discussions. I felt on many occasions that the New Zealand delegation was not really taken seriously. Although we want relations to be friendly between the two countries, I do not think the Australian members of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade, particularly in cases where differences emerged, were prepared to take the differing views of their New Zealand colleagues seriously. This was especially so in respect of the New Zealanders' attitude towards the frigates which, as Senator Schacht said, have dominated the two meetings which have taken place between the two committees. </PARA>
<PARA> Members of the Australian Committee found it almost impossible to understand that New Zealanders think differently about their peacekeeping role in the region. Members of the Australian Committee found it almost impossible to accept that the New Zealand peace movement ran a very effective anti-frigate campaign. Over 70 per cent of New Zealanders opposed the purchase of these frigates on economic and social grounds, and they had very good reasons for doing so. Members of our Committee found it almost impossible to accept the New Zealand perception that Australia was bullying it into buying the frigates. This was very clear from the attitudes of some members of the New Zealand delegation. </PARA>
<PARA> When the views of the peace movement were put in formal discussions as well as before the Australian Committee, it was very obvious that members of the Australian Committee could hardly believe that this perception of bullying was really serious. But it was very serious. Minister after Minister in the New Zealand Government changed his mind-and they were all men-on this issue. A year ago the frigates deal was unanimously opposed at the Labour Party Conference in New Zealand. Within six months, people who had not protested at that conference had all changed their minds. They had been regularly visited by their Australian counterparts. So that perception of bullying was very lively in the New Zealand community. But the Australians found it very difficult to accept that that was the case. Probably since the visit, members of the Australian Committee would find it impossible to understand the New Zealand Labour Party's policy review committee's finding that Australia's regional policing role in the South East Asia and south-west Pacific regions is seen as being destabilising and worrying to our trans-Tasman neighbours. Of course, our Minister for Defence (Mr Beazley) has had to come in and defend his position. The report to which I am referring was written by Chris Tremewan, who co-chaired this Labour Party review committee with Miss Katie Boanas; and they had a lot of support within the New Zealand Labour Party for the views that they put to the recent Labour Party Conference. It was as though our Committee just did not want to hear all that. </PARA>
<PARA> The messages from the New Zealand Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence were not taken seriously. As I said earlier, the New Zealand Committee was not actually unanimous. I believe that we need to respect the differences that exist between the two countries rather than denigrating our Tasman neighbours because they do not happen to agree with us. It is very important that we see New Zealanders as our close neighbours. When there are fellow Labor parties, it strikes me as being very odd that Australia chooses to side with a very conservative administration on the other side of the world rather than with a fellow Labor government across the Tasman. I refer here particularly to the debate on the differences that have emerged between the United States and New Zealand on the question of nuclear warship visits. Far from just staying out of the argument, which would have been the proper thing to do, Australia went in to bat on behalf of the Americans against our New Zealand neighbours. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is not wrong. There was a letter written by our Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) to the then Prime Minister of New Zealand, David Lange, and it was very clear that the Australian Government went in to bat for the Americans and made it more difficult, I believe, for the New Zealanders.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I want to refer to some of the paragraphs in the report. Paragraph 2.16 states:</PARA>
<PARA> It was suggested that New Zealand had an obligation to share the defence task of securing the Pacific area as part of the Western strategic alliance. </PARA>
<PARA>I do not think that the New Zealanders have shied from that responsibility. New Zealand has always done its share. We have fought in many battles with New Zealanders on foreign soils to protect the Western alliance. They are now seeing things a little differently perhaps in terms of the nuclear question, and I applaud them for that. The Australian view seems to be that, if New Zealand did not buy into the Anzac frigate projects, it was not pulling its weight. Pulling its weight, in terms of the Western alliance in the Pacific, should not have been equated with purchasing these particular frigates. That was a real red herring in the issue and I really resent the fact that New Zealand people and politicians and members of this Committee felt that New Zealand was criticised for not pulling its weight because there was some question at that stage about whether it would buy these frigates or not. We need to question the Western strategic alliance, which we are meant to be upholding. I do not support the view that we should be hosting any nuclear facilities in support of the Western strategic alliance. </PARA>
<PARA> The New Zealanders have often said that they were not trying to get out of ANZUS, that it was the Americans who pulled the rug from underneath them, and that the Americans refused to meet with them after they refused to host the visits of nuclear warships to their ports. It was quite within their democratic right to make that decision. The ANZUS Treaty does not commit countries, even Australia, to hosting the visits of such ships. So New Zealand was quite within its rights to refuse. Paragraph 2.21 states:</PARA>
<PARA>A Government member of the Australian Committee gave it as his opinion that a majority of people in Australia appreciated New Zealand's stance on defence issues, but this was hotly disputed. </PARA>
<PARA>I want it on record that I am one of those people who support New Zealand's stance on defence issues, particularly in relation to the nuclear question, which I have already mentioned. Paragraph 2.32 states:</PARA>
<PARA>There were misconceptions about the connection between anti-nuclear sentiments and anti-Americanism. Most New Zealand members felt that there was not a widespread anti-American sentiment in their country; on the contrary, New Zealanders felt warmly towards America. </PARA>
<PARA>I would go so far as to say that the same could be applied to the Australian situation. The peace movement in Australia is opposed to things nuclear, not any particular country. The anti-nuclear movement in this country has lobbied very strongly against French testing, Soviet testing and United States testing of nuclear weapons in the Pacific. I think that that misconception should also have been included. We are saying that we are opposed to the nuclear machinery which threatens us all and not that we are opposed to a particular country which is a proponent of that model. Unfortunately, from the Australian point of view, it is the American presence that we see here more often than any other and American bases are on Australian soil, and we must oppose them because they drag us into the nuclear network. It is also very important to notice that public opinion in Australia is very firmly becoming more anti-nuclear. Another point referred to in the report was the strength of the New Zealand peace movement, which I think was generally regarded as being stronger than the peace movement in Australia. That is referred to in paragraph 2.20. </PARA>
<PARA> I remind the Senate that only 30 per cent of Australians support visits by nuclear-powered warships and only 26 per cent support visits by nuclear-armed warships. They are very small percentages of support. So much for the critics who keep trying to paint the anti-nuclear group as a minority: we are in the vast majority on that question. Support for the ANZUS alliance has dropped to 65 per cent, while support for the United States bases is only 39 per cent; so we are hardly a minority. I am quoting from the September polling of Frank Small and Associates. I seek leave to table five pages of the documents from Frank Small and Associates giving those figures. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the Senate. Paragraph 2.34 states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>As the international political environment continued to improve the unfortunate nexus between the US alliance and nuclear issues might decrease. </PARA>
<PARA>It is unfortunate that there is such a connection, but it is a very real connection. I think it is rather amazing that it was put into the report in quite those terms, because we can hardly deny the connection. The nexus between the United States alliance and nuclear issues is absolute because of the bases in Australia and because of the visits by American nuclear-armed and nuclear-powered warships. But that is not the only nuclear connection that we would rather see the Pacific area free from. </PARA>
<PARA> In conclusion, I emphasise the need for a close relationship with our nearest neighbours which needs to be based on mutual respect. I hope to see more of that mutual respect in evidence in future meetings of the joint committees. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I also wish to say a few words on the report on a visit by the Foreign Affairs and Defence Committee of the New Zealand House of Representatives. There is a temptation to let it pass because it refers to a relationship that is perhaps too often taken for granted, that between Australia and New Zealand, which temptation arises out of the proximity and familiarity of that relationship. Events of recent times would demonstrate to us that it should not be taken for granted; in fact, it is a relationship that needs to be worked upon and to be improved to ensure that there is better and more effective communication between us. That really seems to me to be the effect of the report of the visit of this delegation, which of course was preceded by a parliamentary delegation from Australia to New Zealand.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I commend the continuation of parliamentary delegations not only of this nature, dealing with foreign affairs and trade issues by virtue of our foreign affairs and trade committees, but also of other specialist committees of the Parliament. I am sure that with a continuing and ongoing program of delegation visits, rather than the ad hoc visits that have taken place in the past, there can be better understanding between our two nations. </PARA>
<PARA> There are really three heads under which I wish to make a few comments about the relationship. The first is defence, on which there has just been some debate. The second is the economic relationship, which is critically important to Australia and perhaps even more critically important to New Zealand. The third is the regional responsibility which we both share and ways in which we can both contribute to regional stability and prosperity. </PARA>
<PARA> The defence relationship, I guess, has been that most stressed in recent times, particularly because of New Zealand's decision to depart from what we see as a critical part of the ANZUS pact; that is, preparedness to accommodate visiting naval vessels. The point I specifically wanted to make was that, despite that difference of policy, there has remained a particularly good and cooperative relationship at what I might describe as the officials level. We see it in many ways-in our defence forces-in reciprocal exercises, training commitments, and common standard operation procedures. We see it at regular meetings at high levels within our defence forces-annual meetings of the Australia-New Zealand Defence Consultative Committee, the Australia-New Zealand Defence Policy Group, the Defence Supply Working Group, and others. </PARA>
<PARA> Only yesterday I had one further demonstration of just how special that relationship is in contemporary terms, perhaps adopting something of historical significance. I learnt that New Zealand Defence Force members are operating within the Australian observer force in Namibia, wearing New Zealand uniforms, and that special exemptions had to be obtained through United Nations mechanisms for this to occur. I think it demonstrates the depth and historical importance of the relationship and brings home to us the importance of our not allowing it to be taken for granted but playing our small part in working on it and overcoming any contemporary difficulties. Certainly, upon coming to government we will urge a change of defence policy by New Zealand. We trust that we would be more successful than this Government has been; nevertheless, the underlying relationship will remain important to us and be recognised as such. </PARA>
<PARA> The second area I said I would mention is that of economic relations and, in particular, the closer economic relations (CER). In that area we can see an incredible achievement in a relatively short period. Mr Acting Deputy President, I remind you that that process started with a coalition government. I take you back to March 1978 to the declaration known as the Nareen declaration, which followed a meeting between former Prime Minister Malcolm Fraser and the then Deputy Prime Minister of New Zealand, Brian Talboys. That was the start of the CER process and it has proceeded at a pace that I think would have surprised those who were involved in its original conception. It is fair to say that CER is now a reality and free trade nearly a reality. That is good to note, and I think it is related in some way to the fact that trade has significantly and substantially increased between Australia and New Zealand during the period of CER. In 1985-86 the total trade figure was just under $3 billion and it is now nearly $4.2 billion-a very significant increase. The benefits are obviously financial, but they go further as we look to the harmonisation of labour markets, business laws and regulations. All of this will bring our two countries closer together psychologically and reinforce this long and important relationship. </PARA>
<PARA> The third area I said I would mention is our mutual responsibility-or what we on this side of the chamber certainly see as a mutual responsibility-to work to overcome difficulties which are apparent within the South Pacific region at the moment and difficulties which may well occur in the future. One need only briefly think of the problems of Fiji, the problems Papua New Guinea is experiencing, the problems of Vanuatu and the problems New Caledonia has been through and which, I assure the Senate, it still faces. One sees a particular responsibility for Australia and New Zealand, as the two developed industrial nations of the region, to help these small Pacific states, often very economically dependent, through their problems. That will be not only for their benefit but also for our mutual benefit. </PARA>
<PARA> I commend the Committee on its work. I commend to the Senate its recommendation that these visits should continue on a regular basis in order that our communications and understanding of each other can improve. I take this opportunity to recognise those in the chamber-on my side, Senator Chaney and Senator Archer, who has just come into the chamber-who have taken a particular interest in the Australia-New Zealand relationship and have been prepared to work on that relationship for the benefit of all within this country. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I, too, would like to commend the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade on its report entitled Report on a Visit by the Foreign Affairs and Defence Committee of the New Zealand House of Representatives. As Senator Hill has said, I have had a long involvement and interest in the New Zealand question. Fundamentally, it comes down to the fact that what we have is a fact: it is there and it is working. What we need to do now is to make sure that it works as well as it can. Visits such as this make that even more possible.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Last year, when I was on a visit to New Zealand, we were discussing the defence question and, of course, we were asked about the frigates and whether we thought New Zealand ought to participate. My response then has not changed in the last 12 months. I said, `Yes, I do, if you want them'. I do not think there has been any pressure or any imposition on New Zealand, as has been implied by certain people subsequently. I would not want to think that New Zealand had bought the frigates out of any question of obligation or duty. My view is that, if New Zealand wants them, it should buy them; if it does not want them, it should not. I believe that that is a decision that the Government should make in its own quiet time, considering all the elements that are involved. </PARA>
<PARA> We do have a regional responsibility. It was only when I was talking to delegates from the various island states at the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association conference over the last week or two that I realised how much they depend on us for a whole variety of things. Australia and New Zealand together have to look at matters of education, training, police, quarantine and a whole lot of things that they need us to provide the people of those states to look after in their own way. </PARA>
<PARA> We must go forward with this. We have to eliminate the little problems that may appear from time to time and we have to work out a program on how to share the future. I immediately come back to things such as research. I think it is quite useless for us to be researching the same things the New Zealanders are researching. I believe that we should cooperate far more in these areas and find ways in which we can get the best value for our dollar. I am looking for much greater education and business interchange. I do not think we are doing nearly enough about those areas yet. We have already started looking at the question of business and how to go about getting business legislation on a similar basis so that we can do business more easily with one another. </PARA>
<PARA> There is no doubt that to date New Zealand has played its part in this agreement better than we have, and I give it great credit for that. I could see right from the start that it was likely to, and the further it has gone the more that has become apparent. New Zealand has also used this agreement to bring about the considerable economic restructuring and change that has gone on there in the last year or two. It has learnt this and, as a result, has gone way past Australia. It does not have an 8 per cent inflation rate at the moment, it is not paying 19 or 20 per cent bank housing interest rates, and it is not tied to the same economic constrictions that we are because it has been through the situation. It saw it coming and made the changes. We have to learn from New Zealand just as it has to learn from us. We can learn from one another in various ways, but we have to get greater cooperation in manufacturing and in commerce generally. We have to decide who will do various things and which one of us can do things better than the other. We have to cooperate so that we do not duplicate things and fight with one another on the markets. Cooperation in marketing, particularly with our primary produce, is changing. There have been times when we have gone out and competed with one another and beaten the price down to the absolute minimum to the advantage of the purchasers, not the producers. We have to look at those things as we proceed. </PARA>
<PARA> As Senator Hill was saying, the increase in trade to $4.2 billion is very significant and we need to build on that even more. We have to be one another's best customers in so many areas. When we are not one another's customers, we have to go out and do the best we can to cooperate in the field. I commend the report. I would like to see these parliamentary tours increased. I would like to see the relationship between us and members of the New Zealand Parliament improve and I believe that if we all work on it we can do that. Nothing is more important in this zone than for us to get on with New Zealand to the best possible extent. I thank the Committee for the work it has done. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the paper. </PARA>
<PARA>In May this year the Parliamentary Joint Committee on the National Crime Authority presented to the Parliament a report entitled Drugs, Crime and Society. The report dealt with the trade in illegal drugs in Australia and the strategies used by law enforcement agencies to combat that trade. It outlined the social costs of the present policy of prohibition and examined alternative ways to reduce the harm caused by the abuse of illegal drugs. The Committee found that there was ample evidence that the policy of prohibition was failing to achieve its objectives. It was failing to prevent the supplies of illegal drugs from reaching those who wished to use them. Illegal drugs were available throughout Australia for anyone who wanted them. Prohibition simply made the price of the drugs higher than it would otherwise be. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee noted that for many years governments had attempted to use the criminal law as a means of reducing supply to the market-place. The report clearly demonstrated that such an approach had limitations. To the extent that its stated aim was to prevent illicit drugs from reaching the market-place, it had demonstrably failed. The Committee argued that, if the present policy was not working, it was time to give serious consideration to alternative policies however radical they may seem. Although the present policy of prohibition gave the appearance of tough controls on illegal drugs, in reality there was an absence of government control over the chemistry of the drugs being sold, the outlets where drugs were being sold and the persons to whom the drugs might be sold. This may not have mattered so much if the policy had been succeeding in its original aim; in other words, if none of the illegal drugs were being sold or if there was even a realistic possibility that the trade was being brought to a halt. This was not the case and the Committee argued that it was time to consider alternatives to the present policy. It recommended that the Federal and State governments and the community at large should give earnest consideration to the options by which government might impose more control on the sale and marketing of the presently illegal drugs. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee expressed the hope that its report would be a vehicle for public education. However, it recognised that its call for a debate within the community on drug policy would be mere empty rhetoric if it did not take some more steps to facilitate that debate. To that end it has prepared this summary of its report under the title Rethinking drug policy which I have tabled for the information of honourable senators today. Besides tabling it in the Federal Parliament, the Committee intends to send copies of the summary to members of the State and Territory parliaments. It also intends to send a copy to every secondary school in Australia and to persons running relevant courses at tertiary institutions. The summary has been prepared in a format that will enable it to be copied for study purposes and the Committee hopes that this will occur. The Committee also hopes that by disseminating the summary it will stimulate further interest in its original report. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee recognised in its report that, before any change was made to the present policy of prohibition, there was a need for the Australian community to gain a better understanding of the properties of the prohibited drugs and of the costs imposed on the community by the present policy. It is hoped that the information contained in this summary and in the Committee's main report will assist in this process. The summary attempts to set out some of the facts about drug use and examines the strategies adopted by law enforcement agencies in attacking the illegal drug trade and explains why the Committee believes that those agencies cannot stop the trade. The summary outlines the social costs of the present policy of prohibition, including the cost of drug related crime and the threat that acquired immune deficiency syndrome might spread through the intravenous drug-using population. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, the summary attempts to provide a concise account of some of the alternatives to the present policy of prohibition. Although most countries are signatories to international conventions which require them to prohibit the trade in cannabis, cocaine, heroin and amphetamines except for medical or scientific purposes, there are significant variations in their approaches. With accurate information it is therefore possible to make sensible comparisons between different policies based on the experience of those countries which have tried them. Unfortunately, such information is not always readily available. The Committee's summary will assist in making some of this information more widely available and its report provides more detail and appropriate references. </PARA>
<PARA> For example, a number of countries impose the death penalty for trafficking offences but it is quite clear that this policy has proved ineffective in stamping out the drug trade in those countries. The Netherlands permits the sale of limited quantities of cannabis in cafes and youth centres while retaining heavy penalties for trafficking. Cannabis use in that country has been low and has remained so. Until 1968 the United Kingdom allowed doctors to make available on prescription heroin and cocaine to addicts. The system broke down once addicts began to seek drugs for recreational use. They were receiving massive doses for their own use and were reselling part of what they received, thus feeding a growing black market. The British Government therefore acted in 1968 to restrict the power of doctors to prescribe. Rather than prescribing addicts with the maintenance doses of heroin the British clinics now generally provide only methadone, as in this country. </PARA>
<PARA> The provision of methadone is seen as one form of treatment to assist addicts to stop using heroin. It is no longer considered possible to undercut the black market for heroin by competitive prescribing. A policy of prohibition has applied to heroin, cocaine and cannabis in Australia since the 1920s. For over 40 years it must seem that this policy was a resounding success. The single convention on narcotic drugs signed in 1961 and ratified by Australia in 1967 was meant to set the seal on this success. Instead it ushered in an area in which the consumption of prohibited drugs has increased beyond the most alarmist predictions. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee's point is simple: if the policy is so obviously failing, it is time to consider alternatives. There are no easy solutions in this area. The Committee hopes that by bringing down its report, and now this summary, it will enable a more informed debate to take place in this community on drug policy. I seek leave to continue my remarks later. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That the Senate take note of the paper. </PARA>
<PARA>I wish to refer briefly to the annual report of the Superannuation Fund Investment Trust Property Fund because I have been concerned about the manner in which Superannuation Fund Investment Trust (SFIT) has operated in the past in terms of its reporting to the Parliament. I am now concerned about the creation of the Superannuation Fund Investment Trust Property Fund, which is aimed at broadening the potential scope for investment in this Trust beyond Public Service superannuation funding. This is now only 97.75 per cent owned by the Superannuation Fund Investment Trust and there is a 2 1/2 per cent external interest which, it is intended, should be broadened by the selling of units to the private sector. </PARA>
<PARA> The annual report shows that in its six months of operation the new Fund has returned 7.63 per cent before tax, which the report describes as `pleasing when assessed against a background of recent high interest rates and tapering property values following three years of exceptional growth prior to 1989'. If it has been faced with tapering property values, I wonder why on earth and for what purpose the property values have been revalued up in this annual report by $94m within six months of this Fund acquiring the properties from the Superannuation Fund Investment Trust. I find this a most extraordinary document, unless the purpose of some of the curious transactions that seem to have taken place has been to try to engineer a good earnings record to make it easier to sell units in this Property Fund by undervaluing the sale of the properties from SFIT to the Fund and then revaluing them and making appropriate sales by transferring the benefits from the SFIT to the Fund. To the extent that there is a slight loss of value to members of the SFIT, that is, the public servants whose superannuation is being used, and to the extent that there is a slight difference between the ownership of the SFIT and this Property Fund, then of course there are some problems involved. </PARA>
<PARA> I am also concerned about the fact that the one major transaction that involved a profit was apparently needed to take place in order to offset some sales that took place at a loss or the writing down of some debenture loans. I do not know why there should be such a loss on debenture loans in Kern Property Trust (KPT). That this loss of something like $12m on debenture loans should have taken place, offset by various other actions but apparently requiring the sale of Northern Securities House at a profit of $6m in order to break even, quite frankly bemuses me. Why was Northern Securities House sold? Was it simply to avoid the appearance of a loss from other investments which apparently have not done brilliantly well? Partly offsetting the debenture loan loss of $12m on KPT was a $6m profit on Kern Corporation Ltd property trust sales. </PARA>
<PARA> The most intriguing thing is how so many of these properties managed to get revalued up within six months, because the Fund was constituted on 19 December 1988 and began operations on only 1 January 1989. This report is for the six months to June 1989, yet we have had these huge revaluations, including one, the Wintergarden, in one day. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is certainly another interesting change. That would be a polite way of describing it. It is a change brought about in the method of assessing inflation despite the advice of the Australian Statistics Advisory Council. The annual report of that Council outlines its concerns. There is no doubt that the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) was worried that:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>. . . the credibility of the CPI as a measure of inflation could well be called into question if it departed by too wide a margin from other ABS measures of the inflation rate when it was using an approach for the treatment of mortgage interest which was conceptually less thorough than an available alternative. </PARA>
<PARA>The Council, however, had a lengthy look at this matter and its:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . members expressed concern at the prospect of changing the measurement method of mortgage interest charges between the major five to six yearly reviews. While accepting the technical arguments for making the change, they pointed out that to do so in mid-stream, so soon after public criticism by Government leaders-</PARA>
<PARA>particularly Mr Keating, I interpose, who bullied the Australian Bureau of Statistics into changing the method of calculating the inflation rate-</PARA>
<PARA>could be widely interpreted as succumbing to political pressure. It was felt that such a perception could seriously damage the credibility of the ABS as an independent provider of impartial and reliable official statistics. </PARA>
<PARA>It is interesting to note that the concerns of the ABS were that the consumer price index (CPI), as a measure of inflation, could well be called into question if it departed by too wide a margin. Let us see what the facts are. Compared to the gross domestic product (GDP) deflator as a measure of inflation, the CPI has lagged well behind even though, in the latest figures which were released today, the inflation rate is 8 per cent. In fact, the implicit price deflator for GDP is showing an inflation rate at the June quarter of 9.6 per cent, well above the CPI figure. The same applied in the past. In March, when the inflation rate according to the CPI was 7.2, the deflator was 9.8. The figure for the CPI, I think for the June quarter, was 2.4 and it has now come out at 2.3; certainly in the same ballpark. </PARA>
<PARA> This shows that inflation is a disaster for Australia. It shows it at a rate approximately double that of the great bulk of our trading partners and worsening and it shows that the deal done by the Treasurer (Mr Keating) with the unions-with Simon Crean in particular and the Australian Council of Trade Unions-about the accord must now be at some risk because members of the rank and file clearly have been duped. </PARA>
<PARA> As Dr Hewson said in the other place, in negotiating the current version of the accord they have agreed to hold earnings growth to 6 1/2 per cent on the expectation that inflation would fall to 3 to 4 per cent in 1990, as the Treasurer predicted. But it has continually increased since then and the bottom line for all Australians is not only that the Government has locked itself into an inflation rate of 8 to 9 per cent but also that interest rates will stay higher even longer than the Government has been prepared to admit. </PARA>
<PARA> There is no doubt that sustained upward pressure on interest rates was evidenced again today with another jump in the Reserve Bank of Australia's rediscount rate to 18 per cent. There is no doubt that inflation is on the way up, so what will happen now to the deal that the Treasurer did with the big four banks on interest rates to try to hold them down? This latest inflation rise will clearly put added pressure on interest rates and the deal that the Government did at public expense will clearly soon be broken. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In speaking to the annual report of the Official Establishments Trust, I remind the Senate that consistent comment has come from me, going back to my time as Chairman of the Waste Watch Committee, about the enormous amount of money being spent on Kirribilli House and other residences occupied by the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke). The justification for the enormous expense on the massive renovations at Kirribilli House, which had allegedly been urgent for many years, was that the fabric of the building was at risk and that the delay in fixing the problem could no longer be allowed to continue.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That may well be so, but it certainly managed to be deferred during the time of the previous Prime Minister, Mr Fraser. The annual report of the Official Establishments Trust then kept pointing out-I think it was first pointed out in 1977-that money could or should be spent. It is remarkable that it was only under Mr Hawke that hundreds of thousands of dollars were spent doing up Kirribilli House, allegedly because it was to be used by distinguished visitors to Australia, particularly in the bicentennial year. Of course, we all know that that was absolute nonsense. It was hardly used by any official visitor during the bicentennial year largely because the work was not finished. The main reason for this expense was that the Prime Minister of Australia decided that, apart from having the Lodge at public expense, he should also have Kirribilli House as his Sydney residence. He happens to represent a Melbourne constituency but he wanted a Sydney residence. </PARA>
<PARA> This property, which has been refurbished and structurally fixed up at immense cost to the Australian taxpayer, was used, we found out from a Senate Estimates Committee hearing of 23 October, only on approximately eight nights in the latest 12 months by any official visitor. The reason this Parliament was given, when the money was appropriated here, that it was for the purpose of refurbishing the place so that official visitors to Australia could be accommodated, was total bunkum. It was done to make it a nice place for Hawkie to live in when he is in Sydney. It is fascinating that he has decided to spend the great bulk of his time in Sydney. In response to a question which I asked, the Committee was told:</PARA>
<PARA>From October 1988 to September 1989 the Prime Minister stayed at Kirribilli House on 20 occasions-</PARA>
<PARA>that is not just 20 nights, but 20 occasions-</PARA>
<PARA>on 17 of which he was accompanied by Mrs Hawke or other members of the family. That involved a total of 102 days including overnight stays. In addition, Mrs Hawke stayed at Kirribilli on seven occasions involving 10 days in total. </PARA>
<PARA>One can see clearly that the reason the foreign dignitaries did not use Kirribilli House is that it was continually being occupied by the absentee landlord of the Melbourne seat of Wills, Mr Hawke, who spent one-third of the year living in Sydney, at public expense, in Kirribilli House, which is supposed to be for the purpose of foreign visitors. That is absolutely disgraceful. The place is simply not being used for the purpose for which it was intended, and is not being used in the way it was used when the previous Prime Minister was in office. If the Prime Minister really does not like Melbourne, does not want to live there and prefers to live elsewhere, why does he not stay at the Lodge where his accommodation is paid for by the taxpayers whether he is there or not? Why does he have to live in Sydney? I can assure the Senate that we do not want him there. We particularly do not want the taxpayers of Australia to have to pay for these huge renovations and the cost of looking after the Prime Minister for one-third of the year in Sydney, so far from his electorate. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Senate-</PARA>
<PARA> (a) is of the opinion that, as the pilots' dispute remains unresolved, Ansett and Australian Airlines and the Government have failed to apply the terms of the Two Airlines Agreement and the Airlines Agreement Act 1981; and</PARA>
<PARA> (b) calls on the Government to terminate that agreement to enable other carriers to fly scheduled services no longer provided on the Australian trunk route system. </PARA>
<PARA>The background to this motion is that under the Airlines Agreement Act 1981 certain routes in Australia-roughly, the routes between the capital cities-are defined as the trunk routes and section (6) (1) (d) provides a contractual obligation on the two major carriers, Ansett Airlines of Australia and Australian Airlines, to provide scheduled services on those routes. If they fail to do that the Minister has the power to allow another operator to come in and operate those services. The fact that another operator comes in does not in any sense deny the present two major airlines the right to continue to have access to those routes even though they are not using them in the way in which the Act requires them to. In one sense, Ansett and Australian Airlines have absolutely nothing to lose by this motion. </PARA>
<PARA> It is very clear that the airlines are not meeting their contractual obligations under the Act. There is not now an effective air service in Australia on the trunk routes as is required under the Act. This is causing a huge cost to the Australian community. We argue that there is a legal remedy available under the Act to resolve this situation. I would like to take a few moments of the time of the Senate to reflect on the history of how we got into the present position. I have a very strong belief that neither the Australian Federation of Air Pilots (AFAP) nor the management of Ansett and Australian Airlines is the principal reason why we are in the trouble we are in today. I would argue that the principal reason we are in the mess we are in is the Airlines Agreement Act of 1981. It did not provide the commercial competition between the two major airlines that would have guaranteed both of them some economic efficiency. It allowed both managements to indulge in soft practices and to give in to pressure groups, whether they were the pilots, the baggage handlers, the flight attendants, the fuellers or the Transport Workers Union of Australia. Management conceded to any group that put pressure on it over the eight years since this agreement came in, as it had in previous times-since the early 1950s when the first two-airline agreement came in. There was not the commercial pressure on the management to perform and, therefore, the management conceded without cognisance of the long term economic effects of the concessions it was granting. The consequence is that today there are very high numbers of employees in both airlines and, as a further consequence, high fares. </PARA>
<PARA> It is not only in manning that there are bad practices. There is the absolutely absurd position of very large numbers of aircraft types, relatively speaking, in the fleets that the companies are operating. I think Ansett has 30 or 40-odd aircraft, and six different types. There are the F50s, which it has got rid of recently because of the strike, the 727s, the 737s, the 767s, the BAe146 and the new A320. An airline cannot make money with such a huge range of aircraft types and a small fleet of the size the airlines have. The pilots cannot be blamed for that. One can only go back to the non-competitive airline environment under the existing Airlines Agreement Act. </PARA>
<PARA> I go back to the history about how it all came about. Like most things, the problem did not arise de novo and it is worth reflecting on how we got into this position. In 1945 the Labor Government of the day decided it would set up an airline, called the Australian National Airlines Commission, which traded under the name of Trans-Australia Airlines (TAA), to run a monopoly air service in Australia. The major airline operating at the time was the second Australian National Airways, which succeeded the first ANA started by Kingsford-Smith and Charles Ulm, which failed at the time of the Great Depression. </PARA>
<PARA> The second ANA was the dominant airline in Australia from the late 1930s through to the end of the 1940s. The Labor Government, being imbued with a socialist philosophy, sought to destroy the private enterprise airline, as it was then, the second ANA, and created TAA and legislated to give it monopoly powers. That legislation was thrown out by the High Court and a rather uneasy situation existed for some years in which an airline backed by the resources of Government was competing in the marketplace with what was a genuinely private enterprise airline which had to raise its own capital, without any help from the Government, and satisfy its shareholders. </PARA>
<PARA> Adding to the burdens of the old ANA was the fact that it made a bad decision with respect to equipment. It recognised the economic superiority of aircraft such as the DC3 and the DC4, and both the economic and mechanical efficiency of the Douglas designs, and in an age which saw new aircraft types coming on it stuck with the old manufacturer and bought DC6s, both A and B models. TAA, which was then very well-managed and very aggressively managed, with a bunch of ex-Royal Australian Air Force pilots running the company, was buying the latest equipment and running an excellent service, and it got the major part of airline traffic. ANA was in a great deal of difficulty, coupled with its bad equipment choices and, what must be admitted, its bad management. It started to correct things and it was on the way back-from a management point of view-when Ivan Holyman died in Honolulu and Reginald Ansett agreed to take over and operate the then ANA. He was in a position where he could not compete against an airline that was funded from a public purse the way in which TAA was. It had virtually unlimited call on the financial resources of the Government and, most importantly, had an influence on the regulatory and licensing procedures of the government of the day, particularly if it was a Labor government. </PARA>
<PARA> The proposition was advanced that the two airlines be combined and that we have one carrier in Australia. That was rejected by the Menzies Government which was then in power because it certainly did not want a monopoly in Australia, whether it was a privately owned monopoly or a government owned monopoly. That led to the creation of the first two-airline Bill to provide ground rules under which the two major airlines competed so that one did not get an advantage over the other. While it was necessary at the time the airlines agreement kept on being renewed. It was made initially in 1952 but there were successive agreements in 1957, 1961, 1972 and 1973. The whole of the economic and travelling climate in Australia changed dramatically from 1952 to 1981. The 1981 Act at present governs the trunk operation of the Australian air routes. It was a great improvement on the Bills that went before it. </PARA>
<PARA> It did three quite dramatic things. First of all it recognised and set up procedures by which TAA could be sold. While this is now 1989 and the two-airline Act was set in place in 1981-which is some reflection of the glacial pace of parliamentary progress-it will be about the middle of next year before TAA, or Australian Airlines Ltd, as it trades now, is sold to private enterprise. The second thing the Act provided was a separation of freight traffic from passenger traffic whereas before the two were linked together. It recognised that there were special attributes in both classes: the passenger trade was one thing and freight needed different skills, different attitudes. It made provision for freight airlines to start up. Most importantly, it set up a deregulation inquiry. As a consequence of those moves today we know that deregulation of the airline system will take place in 1990. While I was not in favour of the Bill at the time, I recognised, as I said in my speeches, that it was a signal advance on the legislation in this field that had preceded it. I was not in favour of the Bill at the time because I foresaw that it provided no commercial competition and that the events that face us today would occur. It is not very often that I can stand up in this Parliament and say, even though it gives me absolutely no satisfaction to say so now, that the events that I foresaw in 1981 have now come to pass. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to turn to the Act itself. The Act provides in the schedule, in paragraph 6.1 (d):</PARA>
<PARA> Without derogating from the objectives of sub-clause 1 (a), the parties acknowledge that nothing in this agreement shall preclude the Commonwealth, the Minister or the Secretary from permitting a passenger operator to develop specialised scheduled passenger air services over trunk routes of a nature which in the opinion of the Minister are not adequately provided for either by the Commission-</PARA>
<PARA>in the words of the Act, the Commission equates with the current Australian Airlines-</PARA>
<PARA>or the Company-</PARA>
<PARA>which is currently Ansett-</PARA>
<PARA>and for which after receiving a request in writing from the Minister neither the Commission nor the company has, within a reasonable time, provided a service to the satisfaction of the Minister. </PARA>
<PARA>Paragraph 6.1 (a) of the Schedule to that Act provides:</PARA>
<PARA>The parties shall take all reasonable action within their powers to ensure that the Commission and the Company are the only two operators which provide scheduled domestic passenger air services over trunk routes within Australia. </PARA>
<PARA>The first subparagraph of paragraph 6 provides that the only two companies that can operate are Australian Airlines and Ansett. The relevant section that is the subject of the motion before the Chair at the moment is paragraph 6.1 (d) which gives the Minister the power, where the two major airlines are not delivering the service that they have a contractual obligation to provide, to allow a third or other operators in. </PARA>
<PARA> If Australian and Ansett do not operate services the Government has every legal right to allow someone else to come in. We believe that there are great benefits in that being done. I propose to put before the Senate evidence which shows beyond dispute that the airlines are not meeting their contractual obligations. I would like to go off on a tangent for a moment and read another paragraph of the Schedule to the Act. Paragraph 15 (4) states:</PARA>
<PARA>The Commonwealth agrees that, during the currency of this agreement, it will not enter into air service arrangements or agreements with other countries which will permit any foreign airline to operate scheduled domestic services, provided that a foreign airline may, if authorised by the Commonwealth, carry international passengers and international freight on domestic sectors as part of its international services. </PARA>
<PARA>Paraphrasing that, it means that the Commonwealth has no right to allow an international operator interlining rights in Australia. Yet, this is precisely the action the Commonwealth, or the Government, has taken in the present instance where it allows international operators to pick up domestic passengers on the routes on which the international operators are flying and to transport them around Australia. There is absolutely no way the Commonwealth can argue that it has any right to breach paragraph 15 (4). But that is not the subject of the motion that is before us. </PARA>
<PARA> I said that there was abundant evidence that the airlines are not meeting their contractual obligations. The very first point I make refers to the evidence on the public record of the airlines. The airlines-both Ansett and Australian-are telling the Australian public, groups of tourist industry operators and anyone else who is interested that it will be Easter 1990 before normal services are returned. The degree to which services are provided is a matter of dispute. The airlines say they are doing one thing: the Pilots Federation, the tourist operators and anyone else who is trying to travel around Australia say something quite different to what the airlines are saying. But that is irrelevant in one sense. The important point is that the airlines are saying that by Easter next year they hope to get back to a normal service. That is a prima facie case, a frank admission, that they are not meeting their contractual obligations. </PARA>
<PARA> I stress the point that whether the airlines claim they are providing 60 per cent of services today or whether the truth is that they are providing 40 per cent is utterly irrelevant. In my judgment probably less than 50 per cent of the predispute services are available to the travelling public today. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is true. I am coming to what the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) said, as I have on so many occasions, a little later in my speech. We have had evidence given to a Senate Estimates committee on the actual number of seats that are being provided. I do not wish to get down to the fine detail of that but the evidence provided to the Senate Estimates committee within the last few weeks on actual passenger seats occupied is at great variance with what the airlines have claimed and are still claiming. Of course, throughout the last eight to 11 weeks all of us have had personal experiences of having tickets issued, seats confirmed and not being able to get on those services.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Dealing with the shortcomings in the service, the first point that is beyond dispute is that there are some ports in Australia between which no services are operating. Some of those are the Adelaide-Brisbane route, the Perth-Alice Springs-Cairns route and reverse, and the Cairns-Darwin route. A whole host of places in Australia are getting very poor services. The classic case is Tasmania. One simply cannot fly to Launceston other than via a Royal Australian Air Force aircraft. There are no commercial services operated by Ansett or Australian Airlines which are flying or which have flown to Launceston, one of the most bustling commercial centres not only in Tasmania but in Australia. One cannot fly there by Ansett or Australian. </PARA>

On the figures I have for the last week, if we look at the services operated by Ansett and Australian, on a Monday to Friday basis last week by my estimation less than 30 per cent of the predispute figures were operated. I estimate, too, that of that 30 per cent of the services operated, the actual component provided by Australian and Ansett with their own aircraft and their own crews is probably about 10 per cent of the services they were offering before the dispute.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In my own State on Tuesday of this week, only two days ago, there were 15 movements of aircraft operating for Ansett or Australian. That means charter operators or these fly-by-night people the airlines have brought in to bolster the service. There were 15 movements out of the port of Brisbane on Tuesday of this week against the normal figures of 48. I do not wish to go into further detail about the figures because I recognise that it is a very contentious point. It is hard to get proof. But having taken an interest in this, I believe that the figures I have cited conform to the pattern of traffic available today. </PARA>
<PARA> I briefly touch on a personal experience I had last week. I had two boarding passes issued in Canberra for a flight from Canberra to Sydney and from Sydney on to another port. When I got to Sydney, although my boarding pass for the next sector had been issued only three-quarters of an hour beforehand I was told by one of the major airlines, `Your flight has been cancelled'. I said, `What are you going to do for me?'. They said, `Nothing'. I said, `Why won't you put me on the next flight?'. They said, `Because the next flight is full'. The best I could get, having departed from here on the first flight in the morning was a promise of a hold-over and a waitlisting for the last flight of that day. Fortunately, something turned up and I got away earlier. We have all had experiences where the scheduled services that are promulgated are simply cancelled, often without any reason being given at all. This, I believe, is one of the reasons why the airlines no longer publish in the daily newspapers the services they claim to operate. They are not publishing them because there is an acute morale problem with their staff at the office counters. The staff selling the tickets look at their visual display units. They see those flights advertised. They sell tickets for them and they know as they are selling those tickets that at the end of the day a very high proportion of those flights will have been cancelled and they will have had to cope with justifiably angry fare-paying passengers. </PARA>
<PARA> The situation with respect to scheduled services has been further bedevilled by the flood of propaganda. A great deal of misinformation has been fed to the community. Senator Messner reminded us of the many occasions when the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) told us that the strike would be over in a day or two, that normal services would be resumed. He has been saying that for nearly 12 weeks now and the gloom of the strike is as heavy upon us as it ever was. Sir Peter Abeles is not blameless in this. I go back to 14 September, to a transcript from the Parliamentary Library of an interview he did on A Current Affair with Jana Wendt, and note that this is 14 September:</PARA>
<PARA> SIR PETER ABELES: By Sunday or Monday, you'll see about four or five of our group planes flying, and I'm not talking of chartered planes or the American planes that are here. </PARA>
<PARA> JANA WENDT: All right. </PARA>
<PARA> SIR PETER ABELES: Next week, you won't see just six or seven planes. You will see very rapidly us, whichever way it goes, to have half our fleet flying again, much faster than I would have dared to say a week ago. </PARA>
<PARA>Sadly, that has not come to pass. We have had all these stories in the newspapers saying `PM puts job on the line'. I wish he would. If he had any honour, if he had any integrity, if he could find the shoe box that he once used to keep his integrity in, the one that the cartoonists used to draw him with, he would call an election and go to the people of Australia now on the way he has mismanaged this strike, for the grievous injury it has done to the Australian economy. While we are talking about the economy, he ought to let the Australian public pass judgment on the huge foreign debt that he and his incompetent Treasurer (Mr Keating) have built up. We get into emotional fields here because there has been so much misinformation fed out by the parties in this dispute. But that is all irrelevant. Clearly, the actual percentage of services being operated is about half of what we need. Therefore, Australian Airlines and Ansett are not fulfilling their legal obligations. </PARA>
<PARA> If one reads the Airlines Agreement Act one will find that there is no let-out for the major airlines. There is no force majeure clause. There is no special circumstance. There is nothing which allows Ansett or Australian to plead a special circumstance and to be excused from the consequences of section 6 (1) (d). I might say, inferentially, that since the airlines have not shown the slightest inclination to negotiate with the Australian Federation of Air Pilots they thereby have contributed to breaching the Airlines Agreement Act. I know very well the absolute disfavour in which the AFAP is in, in the eyes of the management, but if the airlines have an intention to honour the Act they have to overcome their displeasure in dealing with the pilots and enter into meaningful negotiations with them. </PARA>
<PARA> In summary, the two-airline agreement has clearly been breached by the inability of Ansett and Australian Airlines to provide the scheduled services which they contracted with the Commonwealth to supply. In that case, the Act provides the Minister with the opportunity to let in a third party or a fourth party. The Minister must act in that way because it is in the national interest that he so does. The airlines are certainly suffering. The pilots are certainly suffering. But the people who are really suffering are the members of the Australian community. We have had damage done to us-which is going to cost us, in the fullness of time, billions of dollars-by this unnecessary strike. </PARA>
<PARA> Tourism, the biggest single export earner of this country, is suffering grievously. The tourism industry is saying that it will have at least a 40 per cent reduction in this year's income as a consequence of the strike-and this is the biggest export income earner of a country which is destitute because of the financial policies of this Government. Only yesterday we had another record balance of payments deficit. We have high inflation. We are in very bad shape economically. Yet our principal economic export industry is being destroyed by this strike. </PARA>
<PARA> By way of example of the effect on the tourism industry, I am advised that the hotels at Ayers Rock and Alice Springs have less than 10 per cent occupancy. In the tourist areas of our State of Queensland, Mr Acting Deputy President, the occupancy of the big hotels is under 30 per cent. In aggregate, it is estimated that the losses to the tourist industry are in excess of $550m so far. More than 16,000 staff have lost their jobs or been stood down. That number, sadly, is going to increase in the months ahead because there is no resolution in sight. </PARA>
<PARA> Many small businesses not only are in difficulty but will go to the wall and will never recover. Not only the small families will suffer. The big tourist operators, as we can see from reading the financial pages, are in great difficulties because their occupancy rates have been cut back so significantly. </PARA>
<PARA> There are only two alternatives. The first is to get the airline management of both companies to meet with the pilots and thrash out some agreement. I believe that that must be done. It certainly cannot be done by refusing to negotiate, as the airline management does with the pilots, because the dispute now is about not money but personalities. Both sides have to compromise, concede and get together. If we do not do that, the only other recourse is for the Minister to follow the direction given by the Senate this afternoon, exercise the legal powers that he has under the two-airline agreement legislation and allow a third or a fourth competitor in on the trunk routes. If that happened we would find that the blocks to negotiations between the airline managements of Australian Airlines and Ansett and the Pilots Federation would disappear overnight. </PARA>
<PARA> While I am not so concerned about the welfare of the airlines or the airline pilots, my primary concern is the national interest and the interests of the people of Australia. It is time that this strike was finished and resolved. It could have been resolved about 10 or 12 weeks ago but for the pig-headed actions of the Prime Minister. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This debate and Senator MacGibbon's opening contribution to it are very fine examples of the hypocrisy and superficiality which have become such hallmarks of this Opposition in the seven years that it has been blundering around the Australian scene, always irrelevant and seldom very far from self-immolation. I think the hypocrisy of it all was very well exposed yesterday in the House of Representatives by my colleague the Minister for Defence, Mr Beazley. He described this resolution, as moved yesterday in the other place, very accurately as a manifestation of the axis that the Opposition has formed with the Australian Federation of Air Pilots (AFAP) in order to deprive Australian citizens of air services. While crying national interest or public interest crocodile tears of the kind that we have heard again here today from Senator MacGibbon, the Opposition, in its own twisted way, does, of course, see an opportunity to make some cheap political mileage out of extending the dispute at the expense of the Australian travelling public.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Let there be no doubt that holding out grains of hope, setting up straw men of the kind that are involved in this motion, suggesting that there is some fast and easy way through the dispute, is a way of guaranteeing its extension. The only way this matter can now be resolved is not through a resumption of negotiations between the airlines and the Federation of Air Pilots. The time for that has come and has gone. It came and it went weeks ago. It was rejected by the Federation when it had the opportunity to sit down around a table and do the thing properly within reasonable parameters. It had the opportunity again a few days ago before the Australian Industrial Relations Commission. </PARA>
<PARA> That opportunity has gone. It has gone, of course, because the airlines have had no alternative but to go out and hire pilots elsewhere around the system. A situation has now been created where it is simply impossible for the airlines to re-employ all those who have left their service. That is why the only way to resolve this dispute is through the pilots recognising the reality of the situation and coming back individually and signing the contracts that will get them back on board. Every grain of hope, every straw man that is erected by the Opposition or anybody else suggesting that there is some quick and easy way of going back to the pre-existing situation, will have no other result than to extend that dispute and, of course, its extension is exactly what the Opposition wants. Despite the claims of public interest, despite the claims of national interest, it wants nothing of the kind. </PARA>
<PARA> The other dimension of the hypocrisy of all this is that members of the Opposition are now calling for the termination of the two-airline agreement which they themselves created and perpetuated-most recently in 1981 over the opposition of those of us on the Labor benches at the time. It was the Hawke Government which had the courage, the foresight and the stamina to appreciate the extent to which the two-airline agreement was creating the sorts of featherbedding arrangements that have contributed to the whole background and underlying cause of this dispute. It was the Hawke Government that took the issue on after years of wimping and avoiding the issue-years of ideological commitment but practical incapacity and the absence of any kind of will on the part of the Opposition to turn its alleged ideological commitment into deregulation, into a genuinely competitive environment and into any kind of reality. It was the Hawke Government that picked up the issue and actually put into train the course of events which is now operating to terminate the two-airline agreement properly within the terms of the present legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> A decision was made in October 1987 when I was the Minister following a motion of relevance in the two Houses to achieve the termination. This was followed by executive notice being given on 30 October creating a situation for the airline agreement to be terminated on 30 October 1990. It is not an agreement which is capable of being terminated any sooner than that. </PARA>
<PARA> So much for the hypocrisy of what honourable senators on the other side are saying. The superficiality of their approach is also spectacularly apparent. The motion before us and the reasoning behind it simply do not stand up to any kind of scrutiny. Let me very briskly demonstrate why. Four questions are raised by this motion. They are: first, have the airlines breached their obligations under the Act; secondly, even if they have breached them, is the Commonwealth obliged to terminate the agreement; thirdly, if the Commonwealth were to seek to terminate the agreement, would the airlines have a good legal defence or, moreover, a case for damages; and, fourthly, even if the agreement could be terminated without a massive cost penalty to the Commonwealth, would there be any advantage to the travelling public? They are the relevant questions and I am glad to have an acknowledgment of their relevance from the Opposition bench. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me now address the answers. The first question is: have the airlines breached their obligation under the Act? Of course, under the Act-and the relevant provision is section 12-the airlines are obliged to maintain certain trunk services. But neither that nor any other provision of this particular agreement would be interpreted by a court with the kind of mindless, absolutist literalism that is being claimed by Senator MacGibbon and the Opposition. Obviously, attention would be paid to the intention of the airlines to maintain the services in question. Obviously, attention would be paid to the capacity of the airlines, in the real world that we are presently operating in, to maintain the services in question. </PARA>
<PARA> To adopt any other view is to be caught in a situation of manifest absurdity. Is one to say, for example, that if weather conditions are such that it is impossible for the two airline companies, or one of them, to maintain a trunk service for a significant period, that could immediately trigger a notice of termination? Are members of the Opposition saying that if services cannot be maintained because of some sustained industrial dispute, that is itself enough? Are they saying that if it is a dispute of three months, yes, but of two days, no? What are they saying? What they would have to say is exactly what a court would say-that is, we have to look at all the circumstances of the particular situation in order to determine whether or not there is a breach of the relevant clause. It matters not that there is no explicit force majeure provision any more than it matters not that there is no such provision if one is trying to work out what the situation would be if the agreement could be terminated in the context of a simple two-day strike or a one-day weather interruption. </PARA>
<PARA> The question in issue in terms of maintaining services is: in all the circumstances of the case, is there the intention to maintain and the capacity to maintain? What is in issue in this situation is that there is the intention, but there is not the capacity for reasons which are quite beyond the capacity of the airlines to influence. They are continuing to provide to the best of their capability services over the trunk route network, including by the use of leased aircraft as well as their own aircraft. It is simply nonsensical to say that there is any kind of case, even a prima facie case, for saying that the airlines are in breach. </PARA>
<PARA> Nonetheless, let us go on and ask the rest of the questions: Even if we assume that there is a breach, is there any obligation on the Commonwealth to terminate the agreement? Does it follow automatically if there happens to be a literal breach of the legislation that the agreement would be terminated? Of course it is a normal principle of law that a party to a contract can forgive a breach when it believes, as we do, that the circumstances are such that there is benefit from maintaining the contract and certainly no advantage from cancelling it. It is the case, I repeat, for exactly the same reasons as I mentioned before, that the airlines are continuing to provide to the best of their capability services over that trunk route network and there is simply no foundation, no conceivable justification-I will reinforce this point a little later on-for doing otherwise than maintaining that agreement in existence to run its full and normal course. </PARA>
<PARA> The third question is: if we are to assume a technical breach and if the Commonwealth were to seek to terminate the agreement, what would be the situation in terms of the capacity of the airlines to defend any such action by the Commonwealth and, indeed, what would be the possibility of the Commonwealth finding itself liable for significant damages? The same points are very much relevant again. The airlines could very easily demonstrate to any court obliged to deal with this matter that they stand ready and indeed are making strenuous efforts to perform under the agreement, that they are providing substantial services meeting up to 60 per cent of the demand now and expecting to meet up to 80 per cent of that demand by November. They can obviously make the point that to the extent that they are unable to perform in full it is because they are being frustrated by events beyond their reasonable control, not least the resignation of their entire staff of pilots. That is the situation we are confronting-they simply do not have the employees on board; they are scrambling actively to obtain some, but do not have them. All of that means, when it is added up, that the Commonwealth could well be legally stopped from pursuing the course of action that is being urged upon it by the Opposition or, worse, that if it did seek to terminate the agreement in this way it could be liable for massive damages not just of the order of magnitude that the Commonwealth is presently paying out, the relatively small sums to keep the maximum number of services going, but it is very easy to contemplate in the event of the Commonwealth acting unilaterally to terminate the agreement in the way that is here proposed that the Government would be liable for literally hundreds of millions of dollars of damages for the loss of profitability the airlines could credibly claim for not being able to see out the terms of the agreement until October 1990. </PARA>
<PARA> This is what the Opposition-I have assumed that it is not a totally mindless exercise; I will give it the benefit of the doubt in assuming that it is a cynical exercise-whatever the motivation, is urging us to do and that is some of the down side that is associated with it. Most importantly of all-I am giving this motion far more serious and reasoned attention than it deserves-let me address the final leg of the argument. The question that has to be addressed here is: in terminating the two-airline agreement, would the travelling public be advantaged in any conceivable way? The point here is that there is simply no evidence at all that this would result in any improved service to the Australian people on conditions that would be economically or socially acceptable. The two airlines have already scoured the world for lease aircraft which meet our rigorous safety and operational standards and, to the extent that they have been able to find them, they are either in operation now or will be very shortly. </PARA>
<PARA> Again, if we are talking about opening up to potential new entrants, as Senator MacGibbon seems to want us to do, the reality is that none of the potential new entrants is yet in a position to introduce new capacity in any kind of time frame which is remotely relevant to the settlement of this particular dispute. The truth of the matter is that there are no airlines operating in Australia which are capable of immediately providing the service anything like that which is presently operated by the major carriers. Nor could any such airline or any new airline immediately established start up any such new services for literally months ahead. Is it the case that the international carriers could make any difference were they to be entitled to come in and operate in a totally deregulated environment of the kind that the Opposition is urging upon us? The international carriers have been offered the option of extending services and carrying domestic passengers, but due to operational commitments of those airlines and the existing, ever growing demands which are upon them all round the rest of the world, the reality of the matter is that within any kind of reasonable time frame they are simply not capable either of putting new capacity onto Australian routes. I do not know what the Opposition really expects, if it has any degree of credibility of seriousness about the proposition that it is putting to us, could possibly flow from such an immediate termination exercise. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, if the Opposition is suggesting that some new entrant could do a back door deal with the AFAP outside the wage guidelines as a basis for providing alternative services-if that is the sub-text of what is being suggested-all I can say is that that would be totally unacceptable not only to the Government, but also to the Australian public. We have not gone through all the pain and stress of the last few weeks, and the Australian public has not stood by and endured that knowing and understanding the reason for it in terms of the wage break-out potential of capitulating to the dispute, in order simply to hand a bomb to the AFAP to blow up the Government's wages policy which is obviously such a critical factor in maintaining economic activity and employment in this country. </PARA>
<PARA> I repeat-I have probably devoted more serious attention to this motion certainly than it deserves and I suspect rather more than the Opposition expected me to-firmly and precisely for the record that this motion has no legal basis, it has no practical basis. It can do absolutely nothing to help resolve the dispute or assist the travelling public and, like most of the things which occupy the Opposition's time these days, it has been I think yet again a spectacularly evident waste of the Senate's time; and the Government rejects the motion accordingly. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is a refreshing occurrence to have the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade (Senator Gareth Evans) participating in debates once more. I listened with great attention to his presentation. Firstly, I indicate that the Australian Democrats will support the motion for the reason that we have always opposed the two-airline system, parallel scheduling and all the evils it has brought upon this country and, to be consistent, we will support this motion.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I did take on board the Minister's analysis of the situation. I do agree to a certain extent that there is a lack of instant availability of aircraft. However, if this strike continues, as apparently it will for many months, if we could start immediately to send signals to Compass Airlines, Southern Cross Airways and Capital Airlines, the three proposed entrants into the airline system after deregulation-in fact, they might have a place in the scheme sooner than they thought-perhaps they could get their leasing arrangements in order quicker. If efforts were made to speed up the procedures for introducing these aircraft, I wonder whether the Opposition would actually approve of such procedures. It has been very critical about any operations in the past which would facilitate the bringing into Australia of aircraft. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;`That was yesterday' said Senator Collins. I hope that, if the airlines are capable of bringing in new equipment, the Opposition will see it in a different light and support wholeheartedly the efforts of the Civil Aviation Authority to streamline its procedures in order to get the aircraft flying on Australian routes.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator Evans launched a rather petulant attack on the Opposition but he failed to note that, to a great extent, the Government is responsible for the situation which exists in Australia today. If the Government had not agreed to compensate the airlines to the extent that it did, the dispute would probably be over. This is not just my view; it is the view of Tony Harrington, one of the aviation writers for the Australian Financial Review, who said on Wednesday, 25 October 1989:</PARA>
<PARA> The Federal Government's decision to compensate carriers for wages bills incurred during the dispute simply prolonged the issue, enabling the airlines to last indefinitely against recalcitrant pilots. </PARA>
<PARA> The result? A substantial erosion of public confidence in the airline system, and a vastly reduced market for air travel. </PARA>
<PARA>So I think that, if the Minister were being completely honest, he would have taken some responsibility for the present situation. </PARA>
<PARA> In passing, Senator Evans talked about international carriers. I asked a question about this and I got a kind of half-answer. I have been informed that there are many empty seats on international carriers' aircraft flying around the country simply because of difficulties in booking them. Bookings are presently made through Ansett Airlines of Australia and Australian Airlines and apparently they often simply do not bother to assess the availability of seats on international carriers. I think the situation should be looked into and every available seat should be utilised by the travelling public. </PARA>
<PARA> Deregulation, in general terms, has always been something which I have favoured. We saw the situation in the United States of America where deregulation was debated hotly and finally came about. There was much rhetoric in the United States before deregulation that aircraft safety would be endangered by deregulation but, after deregulation, the United States aircraft safety record is still as good as it ever was-which is quite good in the United States actually for the number of aeroplanes flying and the number of passenger miles operated. In fact, aviation in general is quite safe; it is about 400 times safer than riding in a car on the roads in Australia. If we look at the jet travel safety statistics in Australia we find that it is infinitely safer to travel in a jet because there has never been a jet airliner crash in Australia. I wonder how many of those 22 people who were killed in the bus near Grafton would have actually taken an aircraft if one had been available. It is ironic that the doctor who actually treated some of those bus passengers was killed in a road accident on his way back to his home. He was a pilot, yet he was killed in a road accident after treating those road victims. The skies are a lot safer than the roads. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me get back to the two airlines concept. It is a bizarre concept. It was a bizarre concept to me when, as a pilot, I came to Australia; I could not understand it. I found that it certainly limited competition and it forced the consumers, the users of the aircraft, to do exactly what the airlines wanted. It meant that profits were being guaranteed for the airlines but that the consumers were being herded like cattle into certain timeslots and given only certain features because both airlines basically provided the same services under the two-airline arrangement. It is interesting to note also that the major control exerted by the Federal Government, because of the peculiar way Australia is set up, was not over the airline routes themselves but over the ability to import aircraft. Of course, this is what kept East-West Airlines Ltd from expanding for so long. </PARA>
<PARA> The two-airline system and the regulation which it incurred did not really protect the consumer and the industry. Instead of needing protection, the private firm, Ansett, has now become the major operator in the industry and the Government firm, Australian Airlines, is the loser. Some 80 per cent of intrastate traffic is now controlled either by Ansett or by its subsidiaries. Of course, Australian and Ansett have a virtual monopoly over 18 designated trunk route sectors. Furthermore-and this will be more significant in the future when we get deregulation-Ansett and Australian have almost complete control over airport facilities through their leasing system. Even when we get deregulation the new airlines will have to deal with the existing big two. </PARA>
<PARA> Thomas Nationwide Transport Ltd (TNT), which controls Ansett, is the biggest transport conglomerate in the world. It operates in some 80 countries and has earnings of well over $2 billion a year. Of course, it is backing Ansett, and Ansett is doing very well indeed out of the pilots dispute at the moment. The pilots dispute has come along at a time when both Ansett and Australian were worrying mightily about competition with the new airlines emerging in this country after deregulation. They knew that they had to streamline their services and that they had to meet the competition head-on but, with their old structures, they were fearful. The airlines dispute has given them the opportunity actually to streamline their operations. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course, this is taking a long time. As Senator MacGibbon has said, the industry itself is saying that it will not really have full services going until well into next year. If it were really interested in solving the dispute it could solve it quite quickly. It is obvious that it is not interested. The aviation writers in the newspapers are writing about the pilots dispute in the past tense. They are saying `The pilots dispute was an effort by the pilots to gain a 29.4 per cent pay rise', and that sort of thing. The aviation writers have accepted that we have a depleted airline service in the country and that the strike itself is no longer an issue. The strike will drag on now for months and months while the airlines restructure, to the detriment of the travelling public. </PARA>
<PARA> There is a danger with or without deregulation. Even with deregulation we will see a monopoly by Ansett. It has already taken over East-West; it has taken over Kendall Airlines; and it looks like Ansett will be in a good position to take over Australian Airlines. Australian Airlines is not capable of meeting the economic drain of a prolonged strike. It has already suffered because of the loss of its business class edge over Ansett. It was doing well with business class and Ansett was wondering how to make up the difference. It does not have to wonder any more because the business class advantage that went to Australian Airlines has now gone. </PARA>
<PARA> If there were enough movement by the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) and he could generate enough clout to sell off Australian Airlines it would probably end up belonging to TNT and News Ltd-in other words, Ansett. The new airlines which are coming on are full of hope. Some of them are having trouble getting equipment. We will have Southern Cross Airlines, Compass Airlines-a no-frills airline-and Capital Airlines which intends to be at the top of the range. But they will be fighting for a dwindling passenger market which has been affected even more by the strike. </PARA>
<PARA> Australians fly about half as much per capita as Americans and about as much as Canadians. Between 1950 and 1975 the airline industry went through a lot of growth; it increased its passenger carrying capacity by about 8 per cent per annum. But since then it has only been rising at about 1.5 per cent per annum and aviation industry officials expect that demand will climb to about 80 per cent of pre-dispute levels some time in the new year. So we will see a number of new airlines entering into business at a time when consumer confidence is really quite low. </PARA>
<PARA> What about the future? What is the future of the airline system? I wish to quote from the report of the May Independent Review of Economic Regulation of Domestic Aviation which I think says as much as needs to be said about who will dominate the industry. The May report stated:</PARA>
<PARA>Ansett Airlines is well-established and has very substantial financial mass. It is unlikely that Australian Airlines would pose a risk to its viability. </PARA>
<PARA> It may, in fact, be more reasonable to assume that in a completely deregulated environment Ansett Airlines' position would become such that only a government-owned competitor could be assured of survival. </PARA>
<PARA>Therefore, after deregulation, we could have only one airline anyway. The irony of the deregulation is that we may have to have a government-owned airline to ensure competition at least on the main routes. Deregulation in the freight area came in 1982 and some licences were given for pure freight operation. But there is only one major freight operator left, IPEC. It looks as though this deregulation may result in the same fate. </PARA>
<PARA> Much has been written and said about smaller centres and whether they will benefit or otherwise from deregulation. I believe that they will benefit. In the United States of America there was much hue and cry that the smaller centres would be abandoned when the larger carriers such as United Airlines and American Airlines Inc. could no longer serve them. But, in fact, a number of commuter airlines have sprung up, which give a more frequent service on smaller aircraft, which operate at the request of the commuter rather than the airline, which has turned out to be a healthy thing. So the smaller centres in Australia will probably benefit. In the short term consumers will probably also benefit as the industry shakes itself up. In the long run, however, given the structure that we have, it looks as though Ansett will probably control everything. </PARA>
<PARA> We need open skies. It is a good thing to work for. I do not see any way that we can keep Ansett from controlling everything. We certainly should open it up to competition. It may be that the competitors will be more able to compete than I have said; I hope so. But we certainly need to create a better climate for aviation in Australia, with both a streamlined Civil Aviation Authority structure and frequent, fast, efficient airline services. The combination of these two things will, of course, lure more people into the skies, which are far safer than the roads. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to speak on a matter of great importance to my State of Tasmania. As a Tasmanian senator, of course I feel the imposition of this airline dispute more than most. I would, firstly, like to skim over the matters which were raised by Senator Evans. I found it quite extraordinary that Senator Evans could so quickly dismiss the legitimate concerns of the Opposition as a cynical exercise. The questions which we properly raised concerning the implementation of any termination of the two-airline agreement-reasonable questions though they were-were answered quite inadequately by the Minister. I have to say that, while he may have had a good try on behalf of his Government in defending its stance on terminating the two-airline agreement, it was certainly not a successful try.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is quite clear that the two-airline agreement has been breached. There is no doubt that the airlines are not providing, as they are required to do under the agreement, scheduled domestic air services over the trunk routes within Australia. It is clear that the Government can permit other operators to provide services on trunk routes which are not adequately provided for. The Government is not doing that. The airlines are in breach of the agreement. The Minister can, and should, be terminating the agreement. The Minister does have the power to terminate the agreement. Whether he wishes to, of course, is another matter. He is unduly concerned about liability for damages. In my view, if a party to an agreement is in breach of it, and in such substantial breach as in this case, there is no excuse under the two-airline agreement for events beyond the control of the airlines. The airlines are in breach of the agreement and the Minister needs to take better legal advice. Perhaps Senator Tate, as a lawyer and a Tasmanian, can have a quiet word with Senator Evans. But in my view there will not be liability for damages against the Commonwealth when there is such a clear breach of the two-airline agreement. If the Commonwealth were to terminate the agreement it would be on firm ground. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Evans also talked about whether the travelling public would be advantaged by terminating the two-airline agreement. He says there is no evidence of that. I have to say to him that perhaps the question should have been, `Would they be disadvantaged any more than they are today?'. There is no doubt at all that the travelling public and Australia's industries are seriously disadvantaged by the lack of action by the Government and by the breach by the airlines of the agreement. That was one question which perhaps could be said to be a bit of a red herring. In my view, the public interest clearly demands that the Government exercise its right and its duty to terminate this agreement. </PARA>
<PARA> It was quite revealing that Senator Evans wound up his speech by talking about the Government's refusal to accept a new entrant into the airline industry who would, presumably, be making deals outside the wage guidelines. Therein lies the nub of the problem. He said, `We would not want to hand a bomb to the Australian Federation of Air Pilots'. The Government has such a fixation and paranoia about the Federation that it will not take any action which will be to the benefit of the public in case it also has any spin-off benefit for the Federation. I have to say, as one must always do in this place because of the Government's fixation with the Federation, that I hold no brief for the Federation nor for the airlines. But I certainly hold a brief for the travelling public, and particularly for Tasmanians. Any mechanism that can be used properly and legally either to end this dispute or to bring more services into the air would have my support. I would have expected the Australian Government to take action regardless of whether it might give any advantage to the Australian Federation of Air Pilots if it meant that the travelling public and Australian industries would benefit. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Acting Deputy President, if you were a Tasmanian, you would understand, as I do, that 83 per cent of visitors to our State come by air. That compares with only 38 per cent of people travelling by air to other States. Therefore, this is a disaster for Tasmania. The implications of this dispute for us are just enormous and go down the years in front of us. The year 1990 was to have been, according to the tourist industry in our State, one of the best years yet for tourism. It is our second biggest industry. It accounts for 10 per cent of our gross domestic product and compares with only 5 per cent as the national average. Yet now we are told that this dispute may go on until Easter. </PARA>
<PARA> As the Tasmanian winter season does not attract many tourists, our tourist operators and the people associated with the industry must make their money during the summer months to carry them through the difficult days of winter. This summer season bodes so desperately badly for Tasmanian industries. The Tasmanian State Government, recognising these concerns and the huge impact on the State's economy, is talking about the possibility of investing $75m in a three-plane State airline. That is how much it recognises the effects on our State, yet the Federal Government seems to sit and wring its hands like Pontius Pilate. The extra blows we have received recently include the cancellation of discount flights, which are such an important mechanism for increasing the tourist industry. Now the extra flight by Qantas Airways Ltd has been cut out, which adds to our problems. </PARA>
<PARA> Only yesterday the head of the Tasmanian Department of Tourism, Sport and Recreation, Mr Annells, said he hoped that airline deregulation could be brought forward to encourage competition and he called for Federal Government assistance and for special measures for remote locations. So it is not just the industry but also State Government officials who recognise just what problems we face. Yet the Federal Government does not seem to. </PARA>
<PARA> Another sideline of the problems that have been faced as a result of the pilots dispute and the necessary airlift by the defence forces is that we had Air Marshal Funnell recently talking about the distortion to operations that it was causing to the Royal Australian Air Force and, therefore, to the training of the Force. The Tasmanian Government is now so concerned that it is talking of sending a delegation to Canberra to put its point of view. Mr Field says that he has already written twice to Mr Hawke. He has commissioned an Australian Bureau of Statistics report so that Canberra will get a better idea of what is happening. We are so worried in our State. But this Government will simply not take action, except to fund the airlines. It is interesting that when one of my constituents in a small business in Tasmania wrote to one of my colleagues in Tasmania about the problems he was facing in his industry the letter he got back stated:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . I am not sure why you look to me and my political colleagues for an immediate resolution, nor what you think such a resolution might entail. </PARA>
<PARA>He went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . it is a matter of judgment whether the only quick resolution possible would be more or less damaging to the economy in the longer term than the current impasse. </PARA>
<PARA>That was my Labor colleague Senator Coates. He seems to think that people should not be looking to him for any kind of resolution nor to his political colleagues. He was expressing a view that a quick resolution might be more damaging to the economy in the longer term than the current impasse. I just wonder what he can possibly expect to take his money for if he does not expect to have people writing to him in their distress looking to him as a member of the Government to try to get some resolution of their problems. Yet clearly he thinks that we should be in for a long haul of pain. It is just not good enough and yet it is typical of this Government that it has not been prepared to recognise the problems people are facing and to do something about them. There have been no negotiations. There has been no concern for Australian industries. There has been no concern for travellers. The airlines have breached the agreement. It is due to end in 12 months. The Government should terminate the agreement now and let others provide the service that the Government's friends cannot and will not provide and are not providing. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As a lawyer Senator MacGibbon would make a great dentist. I have some little experience with matters relating to airlines that have ended up in litigation in Northern Territory courts. It would be a very brave person indeed who would safely, in the way Senator Newman just did, predict as a lay down misere the outcome of the inevitable court action that would ensue should the Government be so foolish as to adopt the course that has been placed before it by the Opposition. The Opposition is not serious about the Government's adopting this course at all. This latest piece of sophistry that it has put before the Parliament is just one more political stunt in a long line of political stunts that have been run during this dispute in the last 10 weeks.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator Gareth Evans canvassed four huge holes in the Opposition's arguments. I just want to touch on two of them, one in particular which was canvassed by Senator Sanders. I have no doubt at all as to why Senator Sanders touched on this point. It was Senator Sanders who sat with me through 13 very painful hours of Estimates committees listening to Opposition members, and principally the two speakers that we have just heard in this debate, bucketing the daylights out of the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) for alleged breaches of regulations in expediting the arrival of a handful of new aircraft from overseas on Australian routes. One thing we would have to hand the Opposition in this debate is yet another award for sheer cheek. There is no question at all, as Senator Evans said, that should the Government move so precipitately as to simply terminate at this point the two-airline agreement outside of the correct method for terminating it, which the Government is currently following as laid down in the legislation, it would certainly end up in court. There is not a court in this country that would not have to take into consideration the extraordinary controversy and complications that are related to this dispute and to the obvious and unarguable inability, rather than failure, of the airlines to provide a proper service on Australian routes. </PARA>
<PARA> The second point that I want to raise is the one that Senator Sanders so succinctly canvassed, as did Senator Evans-that is, where do we instantly get the aircraft to provide yet another instant solution to this appalling dispute? The two major airlines in Australia are currently, and have been for the last 10 weeks, scouring the world for aircraft of the appropriately high standard demanded by the CAA in this country to fly over their routes. I do not have the slightest doubt that if there were another 20 or 30 aircraft from overseas operators that could instantly be put into the Australian airline system they would be put there tomorrow. But it is really the height of cant and hypocrisy, as Senator Sanders and Senator Evans have both already said, that we now have a solution being proposed by the Opposition, with fleets of expensive aircraft owned by Ansett Airlines of Australia and Australian Airlines sitting on the ground at airport terminals all over Australia, that will simply open the doors instantly for some unknown overseas operator to come into Australia and fly on Australian routes, when the Opposition has just completed 10 weeks of non-stop white anting and bagging on behalf of their allies in the Australian Federation of Air Pilots (AFAP) of the CAA for alleged breaches and watering down of regulations for getting the handful of overseas aircraft operating on Australian routes that are currently operating. It really deserves a good prize for cheek to run that sort of an argument in the Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> It is a fact that this dispute has ceased to be a dispute in traditional industrial relations terms. That is a great tragedy for this country. It has become a jihad, a holy war, for the Federation of Air Pilots. </PARA>

In support of what I am saying, Senator Chaney issued a press release only last weekend taking the Federation of Air Pilots to task for what it has failed to do in the past 10 weeks. I commend this press release-it did not get much of a run-of Senator Reid's leader. She might do well to read it. Apart from the obligatory criticism of the Government that it contains in a couple of paragraphs, I totally agree with 95 per cent of the press release. It is directed precisely where it needs to be in terms of resolving this dispute-that is, to the Federation of Air Pilots.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator MacGibbon took my breath away somewhat when he opened his contribution to this debate by saying that the AFAP was not in any way responsible for this dispute. I might also add for Senator MacGibbon's benefit that I was interested in his comments. I love people who claim the gift of prescience eight years down the track. Senator MacGibbon also told us during his speech that when he spoke in support of the Airlines Agreement Bill in 1981 he predicted that this dispute would occur as a result of the restrictions placed by the two airlines agreement. I would like to advise the Senate, having just read Senator MacGibbon's speech on the Airlines Agreement Bill of 1981, that he did nothing of the sort. I do not suggest that that is a matter of any great import but I think it is probably important to correct the record. The reason that I read his speech, having been told that he predicted this dispute in 1981 when he made it, is that I have come to appreciate over the last 10 weeks that we can accept on face value nothing that Senator MacGibbon says about airline operations in Australia. Everything he has floated in this Parliament so far in terms of alleged breaches of safety and the terms and conditions of contracts offered by airlines to their employees has been demonstrated to be total nonsense. </PARA>
<PARA> Mention was made also of the opportunities that the Australian Federation of Air Pilots has had of resolving this dispute in a proper way by putting its money where its mouth is, negotiating and making the concessions that it constantly says it is prepared to make. The reason that this dispute has continued to the ridiculous extremes that it has is that the Air Pilots Federation is false in its assertions that it is prepared to negotiate. That is precisely what the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate (Senator Chaney) said in the press release to which I referred. </PARA>
<PARA> I shall quote from the opening paragraph of Senator Chaney's press release, which was directed to the Federation. It carries the headline, `Pilots' Federation must say where it stands on key issues'. Hear, hear to that. The press release reads:</PARA>
<PARA> The best way for the Australian Federation of Air Pilots to contribute to breaking the present absurd impasse is to spell out, in a totally unequivocal way, the circumstances under which it would recommend its members accept re-employment by the domestic airlines. </PARA>
<PARA>I might also point out that Senator Chaney, when he issued this press release only last weekend, was pleading in vain, as we all have been pleading in vain with this Federation, for some sense. Of course, the AFAP has not responded to Senator Chaney's totally reasonable demand. Senator Chaney, in this press release, goes on to say what the Federation should clarify. He says that it should clarify:</PARA>
<PARA> (1) how a return to work could be effected, on what terms and conditions pending negotiations and involving what number of pilots</PARA>
<PARA> (2) whether it accepts there will be big reductions in the number of its members who can be re- employed under more productive arrangements. (Any suggestion that it would enter negotiations only on the basis of a re-employment of the full, pre-dispute complement of pilots is unrealistic.)</PARA>
<PARA> (3) whether it accepts the need to do away with restrictive work practices which have held back productivity in the airline industry. (It's no longer good enough for the AFAP to maintain a generalised opposition to the new contracts on offer by claiming they would set conditions back many years.)</PARA>
<PARA> (4) whether it will guarantee that it will neither encourage nor tolerate any direct or indirect intimidation of pilots who have already signed up. (The Federation has previously denied it is bringing pressure to dissuade pilots from taking up the new contracts but this needs to be extended to the day-to-day post-dispute operations.)</PARA>
<PARA>I do not disagree with a single one of those points that Senator Chaney has made. It is unfortunate that members of his own Party have not paid the slightest attention to the statement that he has issued. One thing that is also painfully obvious is that neither has the Australian Federation of Air Pilots, because it has ignored it in the same way that it has ignored every other reasonable request for some reasonable behaviour on its part over the last 10 weeks. </PARA>
<PARA> In terms of unreasonable behaviour and unreasonable positions and in terms of its interpretation of negotiation and industrial relations, one could hardly go past its performance before the Industrial Relations Commission when a number of operators in the airline industry sought the setting aside of the awards that cover its members who do not work for the major airlines in Australia. A perusal of that transcript indicates how totally unreal and totally hypocritical the Federation's position is, because 40 per cent of its members do not work for the major airlines; they work for a whole host of smaller charter general aviation operators and operators that operate regular passenger transport services across Australia. They are all covered by awards, all of which function well-which was argued for hours before the Commission by the Federation-and all of which work to the benefit of the members of that Federation. </PARA>
<PARA> The absolutely absurd position that the Federation put to the Commission was that it wanted 40 per cent of its membership to stay inside the system, because that benefited those members, and 60 per cent of its members to go outside the system. I do not think that I have heard of a more absurd, unrealistic or unreasonable stand for a union representing its members to take. I have not heard of one to top that. </PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Federation of Air Pilots has in fact succeeded in forming an alliance with the Federal Opposition. That alliance has been more painfully obvious with every day in this Parliament-both in this chamber and in the House of Representatives-and a Federation member has told me that the leadership of the Federation is quite happy to stay out on strike until the Federal election, whenever that may occur, and campaign for the election of the Opposition into government. I hope that that is precisely what it does if the dispute should last that long, and I hope to God that it does not. It will campaign for the election of the Opposition into government because it knows, from the `wink wink nudge nudge' attitude that the Opposition has adopted towards the Federation's outrageous pay claims, that it will get what it wants should the Opposition be elected. </PARA>
<PARA> That is the only inference that can be drawn from the continued attack by the Opposition on the Government's support of the airlines in maintaining the non-flying staff of those airlines. The Opposition has been continually asserting that, by providing this support, the Government has simply prolonged the dispute. The only inference that can be drawn from that statement is that it wants to see that support withdrawn so that the airlines will be forced to accede to the unreasonable demands of the pilots and give in. It is no good putting meaningless, qualifying statements in press releases or in debates here that the Opposition does not support the pilots, when everything else it says clearly indicates that it does. </PARA>
<PARA> Some of the nonsense run in this Parliament, particularly by Senator MacGibbon during this dispute, to give aid and comfort to the Federation has been outrageous and irresponsible. It has been canvassed in this chamber before: press statements predicting mid-air collisions over Sydney based on incidents which in fact never occurred; allegations of direct political interference by the Minister for Transport and Communications (Mr Willis) in pressuring the Civil Aviation Authority to water down its safety regulations. Senator MacGibbon directly accused Mr Willis of being involved in political interference in the reduction of the standards applied by the CAA. Senator MacGibbon made a number of outrageous statements about the lowering of standards in the CAA, political interference by the Minister, and contracts being offered by airlines to the Federation's members, providing for a 40 per cent increase in their current working conditions-all of which proved to be nonsense. </PARA>
<PARA> All of this has been canvassed in Parliament before. Honourable senators might not unreasonably ask why I am canvassing it again. The reason is very simple: today I got hold of a couple of very interesting documents. One of them is a piece of correspondence from the International Federation of Air Line Pilots Associations sent from London to the Chief Executive of the Civil Aviation Authority and relating to this dispute. The letter, which has been written by an organisation that I would imagine would like people to think it is responsible, rational, reasonable and careful in its canvassing of matters related to airline operations, is based on total rubbish and nonsense. It is very badly drafted. It gives the appearance of having been thrown together in 10 minutes, which I am sure it was, and it is, as a result of a second piece of correspondence that I have received, revealed as a totally put-up job between the International Federation of Air Line Pilots Associations and the AFAP to once again try to run this appalling scare-mongering campaign of alleged breaches of safety regulations in Australia, a campaign whose principal agents have become not the AFAP but the Federal Opposition. The letter, addressed to Mr Freeland and dated 24 October 1989, states:</PARA>
<PARA>Dear Mr Freeland,</PARA>
<PARA> For many decades Civil Aviation in Australia has enjoyed an exceptionally high standard and an unsurpassed safety record, due to highly skilled professional pilots and technicians, supported and safeguarded by high CAA operational standards. </PARA>
<PARA> The International Federation of Air Line Pilots Associations (IFALPA) is proud to have those Australian pilots amongst its members and has often used Australian Civil Aviation, its CAA and its track record on safety as an example when discussing civil aviation matters with other authorities and organisations around the world. </PARA>
<PARA> It is, therefore, with shock and disbelief, that I learned of the abrogation of its duties and responsibilities by the Australian CAA, in deviating from its own high standards under commercial and political pressure in the recent airline dispute. </PARA>
<PARA> In order to allow airlines to restore some of their commercial operations, the Civil Aviation Authority has relaxed and reinterpreted its own rules to issue certificates of validation, facilitating foreign aircrews to operate indiscriminately on the Australian domestic routes. </PARA>
<PARA>I pause to point out to the chamber that that is precisely what the motion we are debating this afternoon, moved by the Opposition, is calling upon us to do. Of course, the Government will not do it. The letter goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA> In Western democracies, like Australia, bodies like the CAA have always performed independently, free from commercial and/or political interference or pressure in order to set fair and high safety standards for the aviation industry. </PARA>
<PARA> Either the new lowered and relaxed safety standards concerning licensing, training and operational standards are intended to be the new valid regulations, or they are ``only'' meant to serve as a tool to break a dispute.</PARA>
<PARA> In both instances the Federation is extremely concerned at the implications and effects on the level of safety. Should the end result of this unprecedented relaxation be an increase in aviation incidents or, even worse, an accident, the passengers involved and the Australian travelling public will want to know why the previously applied standards were lowered. The Federation hopes the Australian CAA will restore its independence and dignity by re-introducing the standards that have made them the envy of the world and accept that they should not bow to the pressures of political expediency. </PARA>
<PARA> The Federation's aims and goals are to assist in developing and maintaining a safe and orderly system of air transportation, and to stem efforts which endanger the level of safety. </PARA>
<PARA> As president of IFALPA I would urge you to restore your operational standards and requirements in order to maintain the high level of safety in Australia and restore faith in the CAA. </PARA>
<PARA>Yours sincerely,</PARA>
<PARA>Captain L. H. D. Bakker</PARA>
<PARA>President</PARA>
<PARA>The difficulty with that letter, apart from its very obviously flowery and over the top language and bad drafting and the fact it was clearly thrown together in 10 minutes, is that it is based on the nonsense and totally unsubstantiated rubbish that has been run by the combination of the Australian Federation of Air Pilots and the Federal Opposition, all of which was destroyed and revealed as rubbish in the 13 hours of Estimates Committee hearings. </PARA>
<PARA> The CAA has not lowered its safety standards at all. No political pressure has been placed on the CAA. Mr Freeland stated categorically, on the record, at that Estimates Committee that the only communication he had had on the question of safety from Minister Willis was the stern instruction that, while expediting to the fullest degree possible under the regulations the entry of new aircraft to routes in Australia to assist the travelling public, air safety was not to be prejudiced at all. That is the only instruction that this Government has ever given to the CAA. </PARA>
<PARA> What is this claim of the International Federation based on? It is based on a piece of nonsense run in this Parliament by Senator MacGibbon that political interference was involved in the CAA on the basis of a telephone call to a staffer in Minister Willis's office requesting a telephone number so that Ansett technical personnel could urgently contact, late at night, a senior officer of the CAA who was in constant contact with Mr Willis's office. Of course, these technical people knew there was a possibility that the Minister's office would have a late night home telephone number for him. That was it. It is on the basis of this nonsense that this International Federation has written this letter to the Civil Aviation Authority. Why has it written the letter? Is it a genuine attempt by the International Federation to canvass serious, real and substantiated issues on air safety? No, it is a put up job between the International Federation and the Australian Federation to run a bit more baseless scaremongering, to frighten the daylights out of the Australian public and to try to persuade them not to fly in Australia. I saw a recent interview with Mr McCarthy in which he said, `I don't want to be alarmist, but I wouldn't fly in Australia at the moment on Australian Airlines'. Obviously Mr McCarthy's interpretation of being alarmist and that of everyone else who speaks the English language are very different things. </PARA>
<PARA> I referred earlier to a second piece of paper that came into my possession today along with this letter. It is a facsimile sent from Mr Terry Middleton, who is the executive officer of the International Federation of Air Line Pilots Associations in London, to the office of the Airline Pilots Federation in Brisbane. Addressed to Captain Tony Fitzsimmons of the AFAP in its Brisbane office, it states:</PARA>
<PARA>Hereunder the letter to Collin Freeland, which we have mailed. Do you have a fax number for him, so that AFAP can make use of this letter? Otherwise you might have to wait a few days . . . </PARA>
<PARA>The AFAP has got on to its colleagues in the International Federation of Air Line Pilots Associations in London and given them 10 minutes of garbage over the telephone about alleged political interference and alleged abrogation of safety standards-none of which is true-and the International Federation has obligingly drafted this piece of scaremongering nonsense, sent it to Freeland and then realised that it takes four or five days for a letter from London to reach its destination and has faxed the AFAP office in Brisbane saying, `Hang on, before you use this letter you had better make sure that you wait a few days until Freeland actually gets it'. That is a disgraceful effort on the part of the International Federation of Air Line Pilots Associations. I look forward, as I am sure Senator Schacht looks forward, to canvassing point by point once again the allegations contained in the letter sent at the request of the AFAP in Australia from the Federation in London and seeing, once again, the nonsense that is contained in that letter exposed. </PARA>
<PARA> The reason I have raised this letter and the associated fax, copies of which I am perfectly happy to provide to Opposition members should they require them-although they probably have their own advance copies ready to run when the Federation launches its copy of the letter in three or four days time after the mail has arrived in Australia-is that we have got to the point where reasonable people have to insist that this stops. Why is it happening? It is happening because the Australian Federation of Air Pilots is losing the support of its members. It is hanging onto that support at the moment-and I know this personally-by a very thin thread indeed, by the skin of its teeth. It is losing the support of the 40 per cent of its membership that it is quite happy to argue should stay inside the industrial relations system under awards while the Federation brings the country to its knees on behalf of the 60 per cent of its membership which it wants to take outside the system. It is losing the support particularly of the younger pilots, who want to get back and fly planes and who think that this dispute has now reached the point of madness and stupidity on the part of its leadership and that it is about time it stopped. Unfortunately, the Federation has decided once again-and it is traditional to do so-to use threats of breaches of safety as a weapon in the dispute to keep everyone on side. It has not just happened in Australia. It has happened in similar disputes in the United States. It was a key issue in the airline pilots disputes in New Zealand. It is usual for pilots to use scaremongering tactics that somehow or other people will be killed or injured as a result of abrogations of air safety standards. </PARA>
<PARA> As I said before, it is fair enough for any member of the Federation, any member of the CAA or any member of this Parliament to raise issues such as that if they are based on fact. It is irresponsible to frighten the daylights out of the travelling public based on nonsense and fiction. It has been revealed once again that that is what the Federation is engaged in, in put up jobs and nonsense in conjunction with its colleagues in the Federal Opposition. I am happy to supply Senator MacGibbon, if he does not have them, with copies of this letter and copies of the fax. I have pleaded with Senator MacGibbon on previous occasions that he does not simply accept the nonsense and the rubbish that is handed to him on a regular basis by the Federation and run it in here but that he take some little effort on his own account to check out whether there is any foundation at all in these continual white-anting tactics and scaremongering tactics on the current safety regime that applies in respect of operations of Australian airlines. </PARA>
<PARA> The one thing that the Opposition, the Government and the entire country agree on completely is that we all wish that some sanity and common sense will be introduced into this dispute. Senator Chaney obviously appreciates the fact, which Senator MacGibbon is happy to ignore, that the Airline Pilots Federation is playing a key role both in initiating this dispute and continuing it. I simply conclude my contribution to this debate by saying that I would like to add my pleas to those of the Leader of the Opposition in this chamber, Senator Chaney-I look forward to it happening-in having the Australian Federation of Air Pilots answer point by point the requests that Senator Chaney has made in his press release, which the Federation has so far failed to do. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Near the end of Senator Collins's speech we heard something from him that was of value in the debate. He made the point that the dispute has reached madness and stupidity. It is not helpful, I believe, in trying to get a resolution to this matter for him to behave as he has by constantly attacking the pilots and the Opposition with no recognition whatever of the very valuable role that the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) played very early in the dispute and escalating it to the state of-using his own words-the holy war that it now seems to be.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator Chaney has called upon the airline pilots, and rightly so, to do certain things. But the dispute cannot be resolved by one party only when the Government for week after week after week has been behaving in a way which had indicated that the parties were not to come together to try to work out a solution. It is not a question of one party only. Anybody can read through the schedule to the Act which sets out the Airlines Agreement of 1981. There can be no doubt or dispute that it is not operating at present, that the scheduled flights are not being provided and that a different solution is necessary as quickly as possible to get airline services operating in this country. </PARA>
<PARA> We had Senator Evans's contribution earlier. We can always tell when Senator Evans knows that he is a bit thin on the law and that the argument is not the way that he is obliged to put it. He gets abusive and he raises his voice. That is exactly what we had during his fairly short contribution to the debate earlier this afternoon-accusing us of extending the debate, the most twisted logic I have yet heard. I think that surpassed Senator Collins's contribution in which he said that there could be no resumption of negotiations now. How on earth will we ever be able to resolve anything when that is the Government's position? It is beyond me to contemplate how the dispute can be resolved if the Government takes the attitude that there can be no resumption of negotiations. If the time for that has gone it is because of the actions of this Government. </PARA>
<PARA> We have had the situation of questions being put to the relevant Minister in this chamber about the services presently being provided and the suggestion that they are at 60 per cent. Well, if they are, I do not know where they are because it is certainly not in relation to the flights in and out of the national capital. I checked the figures on Tuesday of last week which indicate that there have been 150 seats in and out of Canberra. On a normal Tuesday there would have been 1,500 seats. If the planes are flying they are flying somewhere other than here. </PARA>
<PARA> Tonight I particularly want to refer, without taking up too much time, to the impact which this dispute is having on so many people. I refer specifically to my own electorate. Today I have had a telephone open line running to my office to enable people to ring in regarding aspects of the dispute. We all know the figures for the big hotels and the major tourist operators. They are absolutely devastating. But the same thing applies for many other small businesses. It is necessary for the Government to understand what it is doing to so many Australians. I just refer to the small operations of the airport kiosk and bar at Canberra airport. Those businesses have had to put off all staff but one who keeps the services going. They are required to remain open under the franchise that they have. No other staff members are working but the manager. Three university students who, it was put to me, really needed the money have had to be put off. They are not able to continue with the work that they had. The bar, apart from one employee working from time to time, has been closed for virtually eight weeks. </PARA>
<PARA> It is not just those people who are dependent on these jobs who are affected by what has occurred. There are in addition to all the other businesses that have been affected, others such as butchers, cake shops, green- grocers and milk deliverers. The business at the Canberra Airport which I referred to normally had $5,000 to $6,000 worth of newspapers and magazines delivered each week. It is now down to $150. A newsagent in Fyshwick is suffering the loss of business as a consequence of his now providing to this shop $150 worth of newspapers and magazines a week whereas his normal turnover to that client was $5,000 to $6,000 a week. These are the real issues of what is happening to people just in Canberra. Look at the rest of the country. The taxi drivers here have had their incomes slashed by 40 per cent; the hire car operators are virtually out of business altogether. At least two operators here who deal with the more expensive end of the market for international tourists are just not operating. If we try to get a plane in to or out of Canberra-well, just try to get a plane in to or out of Canberra!</PARA>
<PARA> Advertisements are published in the newspapers of what flights are available. If people ring up they will find that they are not available. As one constituent of mine had said to her, `If you believe that, you will believe anything'. She now does not of course. There are business people who have had to go to Sydney or Melbourne for meetings and other activities. They now have the additional cost of travelling and staying overnight in those cities. A meeting in Melbourne may now take two to three days when we take into account the travelling, not to mention the consequence of increased use of the roads, which will only be exacerbated as the holiday season and Christmas comes upon us. </PARA>
<PARA> Talking of holidays and the Christmas season, the number of families who will have their arrangements disrupted is enormous. Honourable senators might think that that does not matter. It is not commerce and is of no consequence if a family whose parents are in Cairns or north Queensland are not able to spend Christmas with their family as they would normally do or if those in Darwin now cannot afford to come south for Christmas because the apex fares that normally operate and that they can manage to pay for will not be operating. Let it be known that from Darwin it is much cheaper to go to Singapore for a holiday than to go anywhere in Australia, and likewise to New Zealand. </PARA>
<PARA> These are the facts and the human consequences of what has occurred. I mention one girl who rang my office today who has had to change her wedding plans for November because the flight arrangements that previously were in place will no longer be possible. There are difficulties in visiting and getting to Western Australia. The consequences for some are that they have had to travel by bus to get back. Others, being in ill health, should not have had to travel in that fashion. The one thing that became clear from those who rang my office today was their dismay at the fact that this issue is no longer a front page issue. </PARA>

<PARA></PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VI4">Senator REID</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I was speaking on this matter before the suspension of the sitting for dinner. I think it is appropriate to reiterate what the Senate is discussing. It is discussing a motion put by Senator MacGibbon:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That the Senate-</PARA>
<PARA> (a) is of the opinion that, as the pilots' dispute remains unresolved, Ansett and Australian Airlines and the Government have failed to apply the terms of the Two Airline Agreement and the Airlines Agreement Act 1981; and</PARA>
<PARA> (b) calls on the Government to terminate that agreement to enable other carriers to fly scheduled services no longer provided on the Australian trunk route system. </PARA>
<PARA>There can be no doubt that the carriers are no longer flying the scheduled services on the trunk route system. Other speakers before me have referred to those matters and to the lack of services. I referred briefly to the situation in the Australian Capital Territory where there can be no doubt that normal services are no longer being provided. I carried out a survey on Tuesday of last week to ascertain the truth of the comment of the Leader of the Government in the Senate, Senator Button, that 50 or 60 per cent of normal airline capacity was being provided. On Tuesday that was not the case. Only 150 seats into and out of Canberra were provided on that Tuesday compared with the normal scheduled number of seats-1,500. </PARA>
<PARA> The airlines have been publishing in newspapers, virtually on a daily basis, the flights that are alleged to be available into and out of various cities. Many of the flights do not take place. Reliable sources have told me that flights from Darwin to Adelaide, Darwin to Melbourne, and Darwin to Sydney are published. If one is lucky, there may be one flight that goes Darwin-Adelaide-Melbourne-Sydney, or perhaps in the reverse order. </PARA>
<PARA> Having spoken to other senators who have done similar checks in their cities, there can be not much doubt that the Government is including in these figures the few flights that are actually being undertaken by the airlines, the flights that are being undertaken by the Royal Australian Air Force and the seats which appear to be available on the flights by international carriers, which includes Qantas Airways Ltd. Qantas is taking only those who are scheduled as international travellers and those whom they regard as travelling on compassionate or other such grounds. Many of the seats on Qantas flights across this country are not occupied or available to passengers who would otherwise wish to fly. By distorting the statistics in that way, the Government has said that some 50 to 60 per cent of seats are available. But those in this country who have wanted to use the airlines know that is not the case. </PARA>
<PARA> A woman rang me the other morning, a woman who lives in Canberra whom I know quite well. Her husband had to go to Sydney to a meeting. Several years ago this family's daughter was killed in a motor vehicle accident on the Hume Highway and from then till now they have not, for understandable reasons, used the Hume Highway. Her husband had a meeting in Sydney. He would normally have travelled by plane. She undertook the necessary phone calls to get him booked onto a plane. She looked up the schedule of the flights available that was published in the Canberra Times and proceeded to ring both major domestic airlines and East West, only to find that there was no possibility of getting on a plane to travel from Sydney to Canberra. </PARA>
<PARA> She had heard the Prime Minister's remark that some 50 to 60 per cent of seats were available, so she said to the airline representative, which she thought was quite reasonable, `Well, if 50 per cent of the seats are available, if we cannot fly on this day surely we can fly on the next'. Eventually somebody said to her `If you believe what is published you would believe anything'. She rang me, as she was very taken back to find that there were no seats available between Canberra and Sydney, and that it was somewhat of a joke to suggest that there were seats available between Canberra and Sydney. The end result of the whole exercise was that her husband had no choice but to drive from Canberra to Sydney. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not know quite where the planes are flying that the Government has referred to when it has talked about 50 to 60 per cent of the seats being available. We have certainly heard Senator Button refer to this in the chamber. Not long ago we all heard the Prime Minister's pledge that he had put his job on the line in relation to the availability of flights. On 14 September 1989, the Sydney Morning Herald ran an article headed `Pilots: PM puts job on the line'. Many people in this country perhaps believed the Prime Minister when he was reported in that article as guaranteeing that `50 per cent of air services would be restored by the end of the month' and saying that if he `did not protect this country against the pilots he would not deserve to be Prime Minister'. I have no choice but to say tonight that, given what has occurred since that time, the Prime Minister does not deserve to be Prime Minister, given that he laid down the gauntlet and issued the statement that he would not deserve to be Prime Minister if by the end of September the planes were not flying. The article went on:</PARA>
<PARA> The Prime Minister said that services would return to normal even if the Australian Federation of Air Pilots stood firm. </PARA>
<PARA>The Federation of Air Pilots has stood firm. The press release of the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate, Senator Chaney, as to the matters that the pilots ought to answer has been read out in this chamber. Up to this time they have not done so. There is no question of the airline pilots being right in this issue. There is no question of the airlines being right in this issue. </PARA>
<PARA> What makes this dispute different from any normal dispute between employer and employee is the fact that the Government bought into the dispute at a very early stage, at a stage when any normal person might have expected the Government to act as an honest broker and try to get together the two groups, the airline pilots and the airlines, to work out a solution to the problems facing the country as a result of the dispute. For some reason that I think most Australians regard as totally beyond comprehension, the Government decided to join the airlines and not attempt to bring the parties together and resolve the dispute. Everybody will remember that the Prime Minister very early in the proceedings said that it was war-all out war-against the pilots and that he would win at any cost. But the cost that we are referring to is not a cost to the Prime Minister; it is a cost to the taxpayers and business people of this country who are attempting to earn their living in the tourism industry. </PARA>
<PARA> The dispute has gone on now for some 11 weeks. We hear of planes and pilots being brought from overseas. We have seen and heard of the agreement which has been presented to the pilots by the airlines. I have in front of me tonight a copy of the agreement which has been presented to the pilots by Australian Airlines. It is headed `Airline pilot contract of employment'. I shall not read all of the agreement because there is not the time to do so. But I will read some of the points that have been made by a well respected legal firm which was asked to give advice to the pilots on the contract which was presented to them. The letter says:</PARA>
<PARA> We acknowledge your instructions to peruse the draft Airline Pilot Contract of Employment given to you by Australian Airlines Limited (``the Contract''). </PARA>
<PARA> We note your instructions to consider the draft Contract as to whether it is fair and reasonable from a commercial law point of view. We have considered our advice bearing in mind that our instructions are from a pilot being requested to enter into an agreement for the purposes of enabling him to continue flying as an employee of the airline. </PARA>
<PARA>The legal firm goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA> We make the following comments:-</PARA>
<PARA> 1. We have not given detailed consideration to the terms of the definitions in clause 1, in the absence of your specific instructions as to the same. </PARA>
<PARA> 2. We note your instructions that you have no objection to clause 2d, which gives the right of the employer to require you to fly in any part of the world. We do however feel that clause 2e should be amended to provide that the employers consent will not be unreasonably withheld, as we understand that it is not unusual for pilots to fly other aircraft while employed as a pilot with a major airline. </PARA>
<PARA> 3. Clause 3a gives too much discretion to the employer, as they may deem duties quite unconnected with flying, such as ticket collection and baggage handling, to be necessary for the efficient and safe conduct of airline operations. </PARA>
<PARA> Clause 3b-similarly, this clause should be amended so as to specifically define pilot's duties as being consistent with the obligations of a qualified pilot. </PARA>
<PARA>Few of us who fly regularly would disagree with such an opinion. The letter continues:</PARA>
<PARA> Clause 3c-while there appears to be no objection to pilots being available to perform more than 55 flying hours per roster period and being paid an additional hourly rate if they fly in excess of 55 hours, we do suggest the calculation in clause 7g be amended so the denominator is a number of hours equal to the expected standard hourly flying per annum. 660 is a product of 55 hours per month times 12 months. It does not take into account the reduction in hours due to annual leave, sick leave and training time. The clause also does not define what is meant by the word ``available'', which should be the case so the clause can be properly interpreted. </PARA>
<PARA>The firm of solicitors also gave this advice to the pilots who were asked to sign the contract:</PARA>
<PARA> Clause 4a-you should give consideration to the provisions of CAO Part 48, as it will determine the obligation to perform pursuant to the roster. </PARA>
<PARA> Clause 4 generally appears to suggest that the roster shall be determined solely by the Employer, to the result that pilots will not have any rights to have determination as to their flying during the period of service. </PARA>
<PARA> Clause 4 e appears to have legal effect that even though the terms of clause 4 d have not been complied with by the Employer, there will be no breech of the Contract by the Employer as the pilot will be entitled to a replacement day off, although there is no statement as to when and how that replacement day can be taken by the pilot. </PARA>
<PARA>There are several other comments in relation to clause 4. </PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Senator Archer" NAMEID="IE4">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="IE4">Senator Archer</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;What sort of agreement is that?</PARA></TALK.START>
</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VI4">Senator REID</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is an agreement presented by Australian Airlines to a pilot. In fact, I believe that it has been presented to a number of pilots. But a particular pilot sought the advice of a leading firm of Australian solicitors as to the implication of the agreement that he was presented with and as to whether or not he might consider signing it. It might be helpful if I refer to the comments made by this firm in respect of a number of other clauses. In regard to clauses 4 f, 4 g and 4 h the solicitors said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>-it seems when a pilot is rostered for reserve duty, they will receive no payment, also a pilot could be placed on reserve duty almost continuously, on the basis that they would be rostered for a period of time, not exceeding 15 consecutive hours, each day. Additionally, it is noted that the word ``available'' is again used. There should be a definition of the word included in the Contract. There should be some credit for reserve duty, by extending the terms of clause 7 g. </PARA>
<PARA>The solicitors refer to the definitions and suggest that the word `available' ought to be defined. It might be worth pointing out the words that are defined under this contract. Those words include `administrative captain', `base', `captain', `check captain', `cleared to the line', `deadhead'-and I rather hesitate to read what that might mean. </PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Senator MacGibbon" NAMEID="YH4">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="YH4">Senator MacGibbon</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Is that the Prime Minister?</PARA></TALK.START>
</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VI4">Senator REID</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The honourable senator suggests that perhaps `Prime Minister' is the definition of `deadhead'. I make no comment. Other words that are defined include `duty', `employer', `flight time limitations', `first officer', `line competency', `roster', `sign off time', `sign on time', `time', `trainee pilot' and `training captain'. They are the words which are defined in the contract of employment offered by Australian Airlines to the pilots. It is suggested by the solicitors that the word `available', given the number of times that it is used, should also have been defined. I think there is good reason for suggesting that the solicitors are right.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The solicitors go on to deal with clause 5 a and clause 5 b. In relation to clause 5 a they say:</PARA>
<PARA>-this clause has the effect that the Contract is, during the first six months of service, only a 7 day Contract. After the completion of six months of service, the Contract is a one month term Contract only. </PARA>
<PARA>People listening might wonder why it is relevant to go through the contract of employment that has been offered by Australian Airlines to its pilots and to read the legal opinion which deals with clauses included in it. It is relevant to look at this material in the light of the topic which we are debating tonight because, as a consequence of the dispute that exists, many people are suffering grievously. I have dealt with some of these matters. </PARA>
<PARA> I referred earlier to the remarks of Senator Collins and Senator Evans. When I spoke before the suspension of the sitting for dinner, I said that one can always tell when Senator Evans is attempting to push an argument which is quite contrary to what he believes to be the case. The first sign that one sees is that he is abusive of those who present any alternative argument. The second sign is, of course, that he raises his voice considerably and speaks very loudly. He put forward a very twisted argument that the Opposition was responsible for the dispute being extended. He said nothing convincing to the Senate about why so many people in this community are suffering as a consequence of this dispute. </PARA>
<PARA> I have had many meetings with people in Canberra who have been affected by the dispute-people from the major hotels, tourist operators, taxi drivers and hire car operators. Many small businessmen have suffered grievously as a consequence of this dispute which is now in its eleventh week. Today I invited people to ring me on an open line to my electorate office and to tell me whether they have suffered because of this dispute. The results of that have been illuminating. </PARA>
<PARA> I referred earlier in this debate to the situation at the Canberra Airport kiosk and bar. That is the most obvious of all because at Canberra Airport things are not happening in the way that they normally do. I have spoken of the staff who have been put off or who have been required to take leave; I have referred to the fact that the manager is virtually the only person left who is working there at all, to the fact that the business is required to remain open under its contract notwithstanding the fact that the airline terminal is not functioning in its normal fashion; to the fact that three university students who need the money to maintain their lifestyle and their studies were employed there on a part time basis and have been put off as a consequence. The bar at the Canberra Airport has virtually been closed for eight weeks and the bistro gift shop likewise has put off a number of employees who normally work there. Some of them are single mothers who need their employment to be able to continue with what they are doing. </PARA>
<PARA> I have given examples of many others in this community who have suffered, such as the newsagent no longer supplying the same range of newspapers and magazines as has previously been the case. I can tell the Senate of coach operators who have suffered as a consequence. Some coach operators are doing better because they are travelling up and down the Hume Highway. I have spoken of the conferences that are being lost to Canberra and others that will be lost in the future and of the plight of the taxi drivers and hire car drivers who no longer have the work that they previously had. I have had phone calls today from many people pointing out the way they have been affected. I believe that the Government would be astonished to know the truth of the matter. The time for this debate has expired. I move:</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Temporary Chairman, I seek your indulgence. I suggest that it would suit our convenience if the Government's amendments and the Australian Democrats' amendment were all taken together because they all relate to the same clause. We could have a discussion on the whole clause with questions being put, obviously, on the separate amendments. We have given the Minister leave to move his amendments together and we will seek leave of the Committee for Senator Macklin to introduce his amendment. We can then have the discussion on the Government's amendments and the Australian Democrats' amendment to the same clause at the same time.</PARA></TALK.START>
</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="UI4">Senator ROBERT RAY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank Senator Puplick for his suggestion. These three amendments arose out of the report of the Standing Committee for the Scrutiny of Bills on clause 32 of the Electoral and Referendum Amendment Bill. At that time, when I was Minister in charge of these matters, I gave an undertaking to further amend this Bill to bring it into line-that is, to require the Electoral Commissioner to be satisfied as to the existence of adequate safeguards to ensure that information supplied to Government departments under clause 32 will be properly protected, and also to exclude from the operation of clause 32 such Commonwealth authorities with commercial operations as are prescribed by regulations under the Act, bodies such as Qantas Airways Ltd and the Commonwealth Bank.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I have had a look at the amendment of the Democrats, which would remove proposed new subsection 91 (9), which provides that the Australian Electoral Commission may provide microfiche rolls to Government departments and authorities and other such information that the AEC has-that is, occupation, date of birth and sex. The amendment would not remove the Australian Electoral Commission's ability to provide to departments copies of the roll; indeed, departments could go out and buy them at the reprint. But this would be a once only exercise. We have put proposed subsection 91 (9) in the bigger Bill to confirm the current practice. I also add, although I cannot be absolutely definitive on this-I have been looking at it in another context-that the Democrats' amendment has now probably been made obsolete by the principles of the Privacy Act under which the Electoral Commission has to ensure that appropriate safeguards are in place. I am not sure whether that totally covers the concerns of the Democrats. </PARA>
<PARA> The justification for providing this sort of information which has gone on for a long time really relates back to efficiency of government. It should always be stressed, though, that the electoral roll exists not for the service of other government departments, solicitors, missing persons agents or local real estate agents, although they all write and indicate that that is the reason that it exists. It exists on the basis of a certified roll produced every three years. That is the basic substance of it. At this stage the Government will resist the Democrats' amendment and press on with the amendments suggested, for the reason that we believe that the safeguards provided by the Privacy Act are adequate to protect the information contained in the roll. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1"> -by leave-I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Page 12, clause 32, proposed subsection 91 (9), lines 39 to 44, leave out the proposed subsection, insert the following subsection:</PARA>
<PARA> `` `(9) Except as otherwise provided by this Act, the Electoral Commission shall not provide any person with any information which discloses particulars of the occupations, sex or dates of birth of electors.'.''. </PARA>
<PARA>Clause 32 is a source of some contention. The Australian Electoral Commission has had a fair amount of difficulty in working out whether it has the power to provide this information. It provided it quite readily until recently, when it stopped on some type of legal advice, as I understand it. As the Minister has already said, this essentially is to put beyond doubt what the Electoral Commission is or is not able to do. The amendment that I have moved is an attempt to specify quite clearly where the information that the Electoral Commission has is able to be delivered. I refer back to the eighth report of the Senate Standing Committee for the Scrutiny of Bills last year which stated:</PARA>
<PARA> This provision appears to be wider than that recommended by the Joint Select Committee. It . . . gives an apparently unfettered power to the Electoral Commissioner to supply that information to any Department or authority of the Commonwealth. No obligation is placed on the department or authority . . . to whom the information is supplied to deal with that information in confidence. </PARA>
<PARA>The Senate Committee also noted:</PARA>
<PARA> The proposed subsection 91 (9) does not require the bodies seeking this information to establish some reasonable justification for its supply. It would accordingly engage the Electoral Commissioner in compiling and supplying information for no apparently useful purpose. </PARA>
<PARA>To that report of the Scrutiny of Bills Committee the Minister for Home Affairs at that time responded in the eleventh report of 1988. He undertook to move an amendment to the Bill `so as to require the Electoral Commissioner to be satisfied as to the existence of safeguards ensuring confidentiality before such information is supplied'. Moreover, the Minister undertook `to introduce a Government amendment to exclude from the operation of the amendment such Commonwealth authorities with commercial operations as are prescribed by regulations under the Act'. One of the amendments that the Minister has moved does precisely that. </PARA>
<PARA> Quite frankly, we believe the Government is now engaging in simply a bandaid exercise which does not address our fundamental objection to this, which is that we want to know for what purpose the information is collected by the Electoral Commissioner. We believe that the Electoral Commissioner should rightly have certain information to assist in determining who can vote and who is on the electoral roll. Obviously, the names and addresses of all voters is essential for the Commission, and that type of information is publicly available. However, people do not provide information to the Electoral Commission for purposes other than those associated with the legitimate role of the Commission in the community. So, in putting together our amendment, we are mindful of what has been debated here on a number of occasions. I refer the Minister to the second reading speech made on behalf of Senator Bolkus on the Privacy Amendment Bill 1989 in which he said:</PARA>
<PARA> It is generally accepted that individuals have the right to have certain data protection principles applying to large collections of sensitive personal data. The OECD Guidelines on Personal Privacy, which Australia has adhered to, set out these basic principles. These principles are:</PARA>
<PARA> there should be limits to the collection of personal data and any such data should be obtained by lawful and fair means with the knowledge or consent of the data subject. </PARA>
<PARA>I think that is already well taken care of within the Act. The next principle is:</PARA>
<PARA>personal data should be relevant to the purposes for which it is to be used and should be accurate</PARA>
<PARA>While we have had some disputes in the past about the range of material collected, because of the dual role situation we have accepted that additional material should be able to be collected but that that material should not appear on the rolls. At one stage that was the intention but the Government withdrew it after a fair amount of community concern on that proposal. The next point is:</PARA>
<PARA>the purposes for which personal data is collected should be specified at the time of collection and subsequent use limited to the fulfilment of these purposes. </PARA>
<PARA>I contend that the information collected by the Electoral Commissioner is for the purpose of elections only and not for other departments to use simply as a repository for all the information that they may wish to use on some occasion. It is not a repository information to allow private investigators to track down people whom they want to find. It is not a repository for any of those things and I do not think it should be used as such. </PARA>
<PARA> The last point is one which, if the Government's amendment is carried, the Government will be ignoring in this Bill. It states:</PARA>
<PARA>personal data should not be disclosed for other purposes except with the consent of the data subject or where required by law</PARA>
<PARA>When one signs a form to enrol on the electoral roll, there is nothing to suggest that the information will be funnelled off to every department which is too lazy to collect it itself or which feels that it may need it. Also, in regard to this Act, no reason is given why a particular department would wish to get hold of this material or what it might wish to do with it. In looking at the amendments we have tried to work within the constraints of the Act. Our original intent was to circumscribe all information, but obviously that is not possible because, as Senator Ray has quite rightly pointed out, a department can whip around the corner and buy a set of rolls if it wishes to do so, in the same way as can anyone else in the community, and therefore have access to the names and addresses. Of course, in those circumstances it would not have access to the names and addresses on the silent rolls. I wonder whether Senator Ray can inform us of the Government's intention with regard to the silent rolls. I know that not many people have made use of them, but there are names on them. </PARA>
<PARA> Our amendment is cast purely in terms of the data currently collected, that is, occupation, sex and date of birth of electors, which are key identifying characteristics. People in the chamber who have been following the credit reference and privacy debate will know full well that these are items that can trigger searches and hence are very useful items. We are saying that this will not be provided elsewhere. I take the Minister's point with regard to whether or not this has been superseded by the Privacy Act-that is, the one from last year. I am not sure that that is the case. I submit that because the Government has gone ahead with this particular clause in this Bill it has some doubts as to whether that is covered by the Privacy Act. In any event I do not think we need to take up the legal exercises. I think we can address ourselves quite particularly to the Electoral Commission. </PARA>
<PARA> I remind Senator Ray of one of the principles he set himself very early on as Chairman of the Electoral Reform Committee. That was to put in one Act all the references to elections so that people would not be required to go elsewhere. They would have a complete compendium in one Act. I support that principle. I think it is an excellent principle with regard to this area. Whether this is covered in the Privacy Act or not it bears repetition. I do not believe it is covered and hence I have moved the amendment that has been circulated. If it is not carried I would most definitely support Government amendment No. 5 which enables the exclusion that was offered last year with regard to commercial operations. I believe that we should not go down that track. We should limit ourselves directly. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not know what the view of the Electoral Commissioner is with regard to this particular matter but I know from past discussions on the Electoral Reform Committee that the Electoral Commission would be quite happy not to respond to the vast number of requests it gets to do detailed searches of its information. It is a time consuming and expensive exercise. Giving a protection such as is in the amendment that I have moved will mean that the Electoral Commission can spend the little money that it gets doing the job it is required to do-that is, to keep the rolls up to date and to keep the system operating as well as it has been able to do in the past. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I indicate in relation to those amendments that the Opposition supports amendment No. 4 which is a purely procedural and mechanical amendment. In relation to amendment No. 5, we regret that the Government has proceeded on the basis of saying that an authority of the Commonwealth which shall have access in certain circumstances to the details held by the Electoral Commission which do not appear on the printed roll, shall be an authority of the Commonwealth other than those which have been excluded from the operation of this subsection. We believe that the correct procedure should have been that they would have been available to those authorities of the Commonwealth which had been included in the regulations.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In other words, we have a situation where all of the Commonwealth authorities are included unless specifically excluded. The process of exclusion is done by regulation. The regulations are disallowable instruments. As such, the Senate is faced with this problem: if we disallow the regulation it means that that authority has access. The Government should have provided that only those bodies included by regulation should have access. The Senate would then be allowed to determine whether it agreed with the Government that that particular body should have access. That is actually quite an important point because everybody has access unless excluded. The power of the Parliament is such that if it knocks out the regulation which excludes the body that body remains included. What should have happened is that only those bodies included by regulation should have been allowed to have access. We could then have determined by knocking out or by sustaining the regulation whether that was a proper body to have access. </PARA>
<PARA> I apologise if the argument sounds convoluted. It seems to me that it is very important that Commonwealth bodies should have been dealt with on the basis of those which are included and therefore have been subject to disallowance. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="TI4">Senator PUPLICK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am attempting to focus on simply the practicalities, the mechanical steps, which now apply. We would have preferred this clause to say that the Commonwealth authorities shall be those authorities declared by the regulation to be included for the purposes of this section. What has happened is that we have said everybody is in unless excluded. Because they are excluded by regulation, if we knock out the regulation they go back into the available data. I think that is the wrong way to proceed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In the 24 hours or so in which I have had a copy of these amendments I have not had the opportunity, through the processes of my Party, to get the necessary amendment drafted to put it the other way around. I would be interested in the view of the Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs (Senator Robert Ray). If the Minister is persuaded on the basis of the argument that I have put we could stand this clause aside. We are not going to finish this Bill tonight. I understand that the Minister does not intend, for good and proper reasons, to proceed with it tomorrow. As a result, I would be interested to know whether the Minister is prepared to lay aside this amendment and look at whether the regulation should be an inclusive, rather than an exclusive, regulation. If the Minister is not so minded, we will have to come to some judgment on this matter on the way through. </PARA>
<PARA> The third Government amendment that we have in front of us, amendment No. 6, is one which I regret to inform the Minister we intend to oppose. We intend to oppose it for this reason: it provides that where a tape or disc has been provided to a political party under section 91 (5) persons shall not use that information for a purpose other than what is described as a permitted purpose in relation to that party. Under subsection (2) that permitted purpose in relation to a political party includes any purpose in connection with an election or referendum; monitoring the accuracy or information contained in a roll; and the performance by a senator or member of the House of Representatives in the discharge of his functions. It seems to me that that says to political parties that if they obtain information from this roll they are not allowed in a non-election period to use that information to pick out particular groups of persons and write to them, for example, asking for donations. They cannot identify particular persons in terms of material that they want to send them which is not directly related to purposes in connection with an election or referendum. In other words, they cannot send them a questionnaire to solicit their views or write to them to ask for a financial donation. It seems to me that, on a reading of the clause as it stands, that would not be a permitted purpose. It is not in connection with an election, it is not in connection with monitoring the accuracy of the roll and it may not be in accordance with the performance by a senator or member of his duty where, for example, the political parties have a code which prevents senators or members from writing to people asking for donations. It seems to me that, under those circumstances, it is an unnecessarily restrictive detail to place upon the political parties. If the Minister says that I am in error in that regard, we can debate the matter a little further in the processes of the Committee. </PARA>
<PARA> For the sake of completion, I should indicate to the Committee that the Opposition will support Australian Democrats amendment No. 1, which is to provide a restriction so that the Commission `shall not provide any person with any information which discloses particulars of the occupation, sex or date of birth of electors'. Therefore, I do not intend to canvass the issues raised by Senator Macklin. He has indicated what they are, he has indicated the privacy aspects of the whole thing and, to that extent, I accept the thrust of his argument and indicate that the Opposition parties will support that amendment. We really have two issues in contention. One is whether the question of the prescription of the authorities of the Commonwealth to whom this section applies should be a prescription which is exclusive-those who are not in--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Sure, I understand. I am simply saying that, because of the way in which we will vote on these particular matters, it is important to put down for the purposes of the record what those specific issues are. Senator Macklin's amendment causes us to leave out the area which the Minister had previously moved, that is to say, section 9 means quite simply that the authorities of the Commonwealth will have access only to the printed roll which, as Senator Macklin rightly says, if they want to pay for they can get. I raise that matter because I think it is a matter in principle, in terms of the drafting of the legislation, as to how the inclusion or exclusion of bodies should occur. I therefore focus very much upon the question of the impact of proposed new section 91a and what are the permitted purposes in relation to a political party, and I will be most interested to hear what Senator Ray has to say in relation to that matter.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;One of the issues raised by Senator Macklin was what is on the enrolment form. The new enrolment form specifies to people enrolling that the information they are providing, including date of birth, may be disclosed to a series of agencies listed on the form, although I note that that would probably leave us with two categories of people in relation to this matter.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The argument is not a matter of privacy. I wish it were. I think that Senator Macklin is wrong when he says that the electoral commissioners are expressing a lot of concern over this matter. On my memory of it, their major concern, the thing that drove them bonkers, was freedom of information requests by private individuals. I have just had a memory lapse and I cannot remember whether we have ever blocked that in the Act. But that is what was driving them mad-inquiry agents, real estate agents and solicitors all making these sorts of requests. I think we went some way towards resolving that problem by making microfiches available in all Commonwealth centres and telling people to look there, so that is probably resolved. </PARA>
<PARA> This is not a privacy problem; it is an efficiency problem. We cannot protect the privacy of individuals' names and addresses. We have to print those every two years. We have to make a roll, except for the silent roll, available to everyone and the worst thing we could have is an unchallengeable roll. In terms of its use by other government agencies, it is basically an efficiency matter. </PARA>
<PARA> Probably all that the amendment will mean is that those who do not move over a four or five year period will always get caught by the agencies, because they can get a printed roll and catch them, but those constantly on the move, even though most people tend to update their enrolments, will tend not to get caught. Obviously, though, there are privacy matters involved. I do not think it would break the electoral commissioners' hearts if they were prohibited from supplying other government agencies with information. I think we all have some doubts about the exchange of information, but when the pressure comes on, to do with drugs, tax evasion, et cetera, we tend to lower that resistance and try to use every weapon available to catch the people involved. There is no doubt that the Department of Social Security has tracked down a lot of people who were committing fraud. In child maintenance matters, the electoral roll becomes critical for the disclosure of the sort of information needed to track people down. </PARA>
<PARA> There is no doubt that, if this prohibition is carried, enrolment will go up ever so slightly, as people will believe that they cannot get tracked down, therefore they may as well go on the roll. So in general the Government will oppose Senator Macklin's view. I am not surprised that the Liberals will support it. For 30 years in government, they exchanged information with the Electoral Commission or the Electoral Office. Suddenly now, in Opposition, they have decided not to and I dare say that, if they get back into government, it will be one of the first things they try to do. </PARA>
<PARA> On the latter of the two matters raised by Senator Puplick, I do not have an interpretation of the restriction of rights concerning the use of the roll by members and senators. I know that that is not the intention. The main intention is that someone cannot flog it off to Reader's Digest or someone else. That is the basis-no commercial use and no misuse. That is the intention. If the Opposition considers that the clauses do not cover it well enough, I guess it becomes a matter of interpretation. I am quite satisfied that it will not prohibit a member of parliament from carrying out any particular action at any particular time. </PARA>
<PARA> As for the way the other clause is structured, it will not matter much if Senator Macklin's amendment is carried, so at this stage I will not offer to set aside the clause. I have no objection to that process of setting it aside and coming back to it. I could offer to set it aside now, but I think it will die about five minutes hence if Senator Macklin's amendment is carried, so that will not be necessary. Senator Puplick might be right. I have listened to his argument. My initial reaction was to draw it to the attention of the Minister for Administrative Services (Mr West) to see whether he wanted to change it when it went to the House of Representatives. But, if it is not going to arrive in that form, he will not have to. </PARA>
<PARA> There is not much else I can say on these clauses except to reiterate that they were not in the original amendment. They were prompted by the Scrutiny of Bills Committee. It is still our belief that the privacy provisions in the Privacy Act provide sufficient safeguards. If Senator Macklin's amendment is carried, it will disarm government too much in its attempts to eliminate a whole variety of fraud on the Commonwealth. As I say, it is not strictly a privacy matter when it comes to the Electoral Commission. It is when it comes to the immigration area of my Department or to the Australian Customs Service-it is strictly a privacy matter then. But here we have names and addresses on rolls. </PARA>

There is no way we can stop departments from using rolls as a way of tracking people down. The best thing that could come out of it, although I doubt that it will, for fiscal reasons, is that the rolls would have to be reprinted more often. People in this country seem to be old fashioned and want something printed in their hand rather than go to microfiche. I think that it would be a backward step to carry Senator Macklin's amendment, but if the numbers are not here, so be it. It will not break the heart of the Electoral Commission, but it will impair other government agencies in carrying out their duties. That is a pity because I do not think that the rolls have been abused and misused in the last couple of years in particular, when a little more observance and basic privacy have obtained.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to comment first on the point raised by Senator Puplick with regard to the disallowance argument. I take his point. I think it is a good one. Hopefully the Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs (Senator Robert Ray) will draw it to the attention of the drafters because the way this is done disarms somewhat the Senate's ability to deal with the matter. What Senator Puplick suggested would be far better. I did not comment on the last of the amendments moved by the Minister with regard to rolls being provided on disc and tape to political parties. We will be supporting that. Senator Puplick made the point that we could, if we wished to, make the point clearer. Proposed new subsection 91a states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The permitted purposes in relation to a political party are:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) any purpose in connection with an election or referendum . . . </PARA>
<PARA>It does not say `during an election period'. That means, on my reading, that, if it were an election period, it would be a very tight exercise. I would imagine that the soliciting of money is a purpose `in connection with an election'. Looking at the money that is about to be spent in the next year certainly it is one of the fundamental elements connected with an election. </PARA>
<PARA> I did not read it in the way that Senator Puplick did, although I am mindful that the Electoral Commission has already read down its own interpretation of a number of things that appeared in the Act. I would not necessarily be totally sanguine that the point Senator Puplick made would not occur, because it has already occurred with regard to some other elements in the Act which seemed to us to be pretty clear when we suggested them and which seemed to be clear even when we had passed them. But then somebody else got hold of them who did not seem to understand what we were about and interpreted them in a totally different fashion. </PARA>
<PARA> I hope that under the Acts Interpretation Act 1901 people might look at this debate and see quite clearly the purpose that Senator Ray and the Government had in mind and what we have in mind in supporting it-and I remember earlier discussions on this in the Committee-which is that we are not interested in any way in allowing this material to simply become a fundraising exercise by being sold off, as the Minister said, to Readers Digest or someone else, but believe it should be used for legitimate political purposes only. It is provided on a tape or disc, whereas normally political parties get it on paper. All this is doing is providing an electronic exercise. That is interesting because it enables political parties to undertake legitimate exercises that would become massively expensive if they had to work from paper. Since all the material has already been put on tape, it seems an unnecessary cost, particularly as a lot of that cost could be recycled through Consolidated Revenue by way of the public funding exercise. I know that Senator Puplick does not like that, but unfortunately he will have to accept the money after the next election and cry as he goes to the bank to pay for the cost of winning or losing government. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Actually, I was referring to Senator Puplick. With regard to the last point about restriction of information going to other departments, one of the basic problems of the privacy exercise is that it restricts information. I do not think there is anything terribly new about that. Indeed, I remember some discussions on the Australia Card when the Committee informally-and this included the Liberals on the Committee and me-said that, if the Australia Card went ahead, in terms of that vast amount of information it would make eminent sense for there to be some connection with the electoral information so we could actually use it for keeping the rolls up to date in a very cheap way. If one was going down that route, one would not want to cut off the operation. The Australia Card did not come about and, instead, the Government itself has moved to take up a number of the privacy concerns out there in the community. In keeping with that, I think this is well within that exercise. Departments will be able to get names and addresses and will be able to operate with them in the same way that anybody else in the community can. What they will not be able to get hold of is the information which is not publicly provided.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I refer the Minister to the question that I had on the private rolls. I suppose it becomes academic if my amendment is carried. Was there an intent in terms of the private rolls? Was there any discussion about where the private rolls would fall in regard to the ability of the Electoral Commission to provide information on private rolls to other departments? As I read it, this amendment would in no way exclude the Electoral Commission from handing on all the material in private rolls to various people. I would have thought that was quite contrary to what we did in establishing those private rolls. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I reiterate for the sake of the record that, having heard Senator Ray on this matter, we will continue to support Senator Macklin's amendment. That amendment provides that `except as otherwise provided by this Act' the Electoral Commission shall not do certain things. Therefore, I presume that, when that is carried, later in the debate before this Bill is concluded in the Senate and goes down to the House of Representatives the Government can simply include a clause which states that bodies shall be included for the purposes of this section by regulation. That will then allow each individual body which the Government seeks to include to be prescribed by regulation. That will overcome the situation with which Senator Ray has difficulty, because clearly the Australian Taxation Office, the Australian Federal Police, the Narcotics Bureau, or whatever it happens to be, ought to have access to the information. If we proceed, depending on how the Australian Democrats vote, we will vote for Government amendment No. 5 and insert a new subsection in the Act and then vote for the Democrats' amendment No. 1, which excludes amendment No. 5 and substitutes a new amendment.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Precisely. So we will not put something in and then take it out again. Because this debate will continue on another day, the Government will be given the time to come back with an amendment, which we will support, that says that, in relation to what will then be section 91 (9), bodies may be prescribed by regulation for the purposes of this subsection. That will allow the Government to determine which bodies ought to have access to that information. It will be able to do that by regulation, the regulations will come to the Senate and the Senate will be able to decide, on an issue by issue or authority by authority basis, whether they should have access. As a result, the Taxation Office, the Department of Social Security or the Australian Federal Police can be looked at as each regulation is made. That is the correct way to proceed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> However, I persist in indicating my opposition to Government amendment No. 6, not because I object to the tenor of proposed new subsection 91b but because I object to the tenor of proposed new subsection 91a. Both Senator Ray and Senator Macklin are of the view that a permitted purpose is any purpose in connection with an election or referendum, but I draw honourable senators' attention to the fact that in public funding provisions of this legislation there is a clear distinction drawn between maintenance and campaign as far as funding is concerned. In other words, if one writes to somebody seeking a donation for the purposes of an election campaign, that is clearly identified as being a specific exercise which attracts certain provisions of the public funding parts of this legislation-and which has to be dealt with in a specific manner. But if one writes to people for the purposes of soliciting money, or if one receives money, for the purposes of party maintenance, a different regime applies. </PARA>
<PARA> The concern which the Opposition parties have about 91a concerns what would happen if one were to write to somebody using the information obtained from the tape or disc. For example, we might decide to write to all persons within particular postcodes because that is an area where we think we are more likely to obtain financial support for the maintenance of our political party. At the moment if a person has the hard copy, the printed roll, it is a difficult exercise to go through and mark out everybody who is in that particular postcode area. But if that information is on a tape or disc all a person has to do is punch in the postcode number and he will get a printout which indicates all of the persons in that particular postcode district. </PARA>
<PARA> If we write to them and say, `We are writing to you on behalf of the Liberal Party or the National Party to seek your support for the provision of funds for the maintenance of the party'-bearing in mind that maintenance funds do not have to be disclosed in precisely the same way as campaign funds-it seems to me that that is potentially a breach of subclause 91a (2) because it is not a purpose in connection with an election or a referendum. It is not a purpose in relation to the accuracy of the information and it is not a purpose in relation to the performance by a senator or a member of the duties of a senator or a member. </PARA>
<PARA> To that extent, despite the fact that we now have Senator Robert Ray's indication that he does not believe that to be the case and Senator Macklin's indication that he does not believe that to be the case-and when the vote is taken, therefore, clearly an indication that a majority of the Senate does not believe that to be the case-if an electoral commissioner or if a person who has to pronounce some judicial opinion on the matter simply chooses to ignore what has been said in the course of the to and fro of this debate he is entirely entitled to do so. Under those circumstances we believe that this is a significant restriction on the capacity of the political party in this regard. I do not resile from the point that I make in relation to the political requirements and the political advantage of my Party and of the National Party that that is a restriction which we think unfair and improper. </PARA>
<PARA> I draw attention to the fact that the penalty is a derisory penalty. One thousand dollars is a pretty derisory penalty but it does, nevertheless, involve--</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="TI4">Senator PUPLICK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think the point at issue is quite simply that whether the fine is $50, $1,000 or $50,000 it involves a potential conviction; it involves a potential recording against a particular person. I presume that it may be the signatory of the appeal letter. It will be interesting to see whether, if the signatory of the appeal letter is Mr Hawke, Mr Peacock or Senator Haines, the electoral commissioner decides to proceed; whereas if it is Joe Blow, campaign manager from Barton or campaign manager for Aston or campaign manager for Capricornia, the electoral commissioner may be perhaps a little more minded to proceed. People ought not to have a conviction recorded against them for going about what we believe to be a legitimate purpose in relation to the ongoing business of the conduct of politics in this country. Therefore, I say in conclusion that Government amendment No. 4 is fine. We will support that. In relation to Government amendment No. 5, now, clearly with the view of the Democrats, we will oppose that amendment.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I briefly raise a couple of points. Senator Macklin raises the question of those on the silent roll. I do not see any conflict with that being provided to certain agencies. It is basically a silent roll to protect certain members of the public. Those who have availed themselves of that tend to be people in violent domestic situation, people in a law and order position, judges of the Family Court of Australia. So I do not really see that as a major problem. I admire Senator Puplick's dexterity. I could almost hear the penny drop as he spoke when he said he would support Senator Macklin's amendment, and that was that. Now he is suggesting that Senator Macklin's amendment be carried but has provided a way in the Act that he will later support to bring everybody back into the ball game. Senator Macklin had a big win there for about five or 10 minutes. That is probably down the drain now.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I must say that if the Government is forced to bring back a list of the agencies, it gives this chamber a good opportunity to look at that list of agencies. I have more of a feeling that it should be in legislation rather than in regulations so that we could have a good look at it on the spot. But we will do that. In regard to amendment No. 6, Senator Puplick's interpretation is not my interpretation. I note Senator Puplick's reference to $1,000 as a paltry fine. The Opposition senators have been carrying on like pork chops when a New South Wales Party secretary was fined $50 and his character was cleared by the relevant magistrate. He must be almost a saint by now by Senator  Puplick's--</PARA>

I ask for the permission of the Committee that the question on amendment No. 4 be put first; Senator Macklin's amendment could be put second. If that is carried then we will withdraw amendment No. 5 and then we could put amendment No. 6. That seems to me to be a more sensible way of approaching the matter.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1"> -In light of what Senator Puplick has invited the Government to do and in the light of the fact that Senator Robert Ray has avidly grasped at the straw and hence the whole matter will be changed, it seems to me that if we are not to finish this matter tonight we should put the whole thing off. Some of the points that Senator Puplick raised with regard to clause 91a seem to indicate to me that he has doubts about it. There are easier ways of doing what the Government intends and what we support. One way of doing that might be in keeping with what has already been suggested by Senator Puplick. For example, the clause could state that a person shall not use information obtained by means of a tape or disc except for a purpose that is a purpose by regulation. In other words, it might be useful not to deal with this particular section at the moment. The Government may wish to look at it again. I invite the Government to do so. If it does not want to, we will be supporting it. It seems to me that if the Government wants to look at it again we will be happy to do so. I think it would be useful to look at the first amendments again. Instead of voting in amendments that we would then have to take back out it would seem to me to be more sensible to put them aside and for the Government to come back with an amendment that is acceptable.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will address two of these matters. A lot of thought has been put into amendment No. 6 to get it right. It is not one that has been quickly drafted because there are a lot of problems writing this amendment in the generality. That is why it was written in the fairly specific manner in which it is. That is why I would prefer it to be in legislation rather than in regulation. That is a much more preferable course. The Government would want to persist with amendment No. 6. Senator Macklin's amendment No. 5 is not quite as useful as he now says it is with a further amendment coming in because of the key words that are in that amendment-`except as otherwise provided by the Act'. I think it would be very valuable to have that in at this stage in that form. I would not suggest that Senator Macklin get too pessimistic about his amendment being carried. It will have an effect of making Government think very seriously now about who does get the roll.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As I said, I have a preference-but I would have to check with others-for those things to be put in the Act rather than being put in by regulation at the moment, or a preference to put them in the Act and say that they can be added to by regulation. Just to make it quite clear, and so everyone in this chamber can think in advance: which government agencies should have access to the electoral role and which ones should not? Senator Puplick named a few that we would like to have access to, such as the Australian Taxation Office, drug investigation agencies, et cetera, and maybe the Department of Social Security. Three or four others could probably get the flick and no-one would be any worse off, especially those that seem to be the better leakers of this sort of information. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Opposition is of the view that proposed new section 96a should be opposed. In other words, we are opposing the amendment proposed by the Government which relates to the question of the enrolment of prisoners. This is one of the significant issues which I raised in my speech in the second reading debate and it has been raised by a number of other senators. Proposed section 96a has to be read in conjunction with elements of Schedule 3. We find ourselves in an odd position in this sense: in the bulk of the legislation the Government is proposing an arrangement for the enrolment of prisoners so that they may be electors and in the schedule to the Bill it is removing those sections of the Act which currently disenfranchise certain people who are in prison. So I think it is fair to characterise this as legislatively putting the cart before the horse.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We believe that the Government should first of all have dealt in the Bill with the question of the removal of the prohibition on certain prisoners voting which, after all, is contained in section 93 of the principal Act. I really do believe that it is unfortunate-and I choose my words carefully-that an issue which is as significant as the question of the enrolment of prisoners should in fact be found in schedule 3 to the Bill under the heading `Minor Amendments of the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918'. The relevant parts in the schedule relate to paragraph 93 (8)(a), 93 (8)(b), section 109 and subsection 110 (1) of the principal Act. We believe that they should have been incorporated in the main body of the legislation. If they were, we could then deal with the enrolment of prisoners under the proposed regime established by new section 96a. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not believe that the enfranchisement of prisoners previously disenfranchised is a minor matter and it should not have been in the schedule to the Bill. In fact, I think that is a pretty unfortunate and somewhat less than satisfactory way of dealing with such a major issue. When we get to schedule 3, we propose to move a series of amendments to delete the four parts that I have just mentioned. However, we first of all have to deal with clause 35 of the Bill which seeks to put in place proposed new section 96a. </PARA>
<PARA> Proposed new section 96a provides a regime which will make sense only, it seems to me, if schedule 3 is carried. The proposed new section relates to a number of prisoners who would, nevertheless, be entitled to vote even under the existing provisions of the Act because their sentences are not of sufficient length to disenfranchise them. Nevertheless, we believe that we should start by in fact opposing this proposed new section. It is certainly true that some prisoners have the right to vote. They retain that right because their sentences are not of sufficient length of time to disenfranchise them. The proposed new section relates to those prisoners in addition to prisoners who might be enfranchised. If schedule 3 in its printed form is passed, certain things will flow. Proposed new section 96a (1) provides:</PARA>
<PARA> A person who is serving a sentence of imprisonment is entitled to remain enrolled for the Subdivision (if any) for which the person was enrolled when he or she began serving the sentence. </PARA>
<PARA>A series of proposals are then set out. Frankly, we have some real concerns about subsection (2) of the proposed new section. Subsection (2) states:</PARA>
<PARA> An eligible person who is serving a sentence of imprisonment but who was not enrolled when he or she began serving the sentence is entitled to be enrolled for:</PARA>
<PARA>The subdivision then specifies a number of areas. Paragraph (a) states:</PARA>
<PARA>the Subdivision for which the person was entitled to be enrolled at that time;</PARA>
<PARA>That is to say, they shall be put on the roll that they were entitled to be on when they go into prison even if they had not put themselves on the roll prior to going in to prison. In other words, they will be put on the electoral roll as a consequence of their going to prison. Does it necessarily mean that one has to make an application when one goes into prison to be put on the roll or will one be automatically enrolled at the time one is convicted? If that is the case, I think it is ridiculous. Paragraph (b) states:</PARA>
<PARA>if the person was not so entitled, a Subdivision for which any of the person's next of kin is enrolled . . . </PARA>
<PARA>I mean, really! Since when have we had a decision under Commonwealth electoral law that a person not convicted of anything--</PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Senator Robert Ray" NAMEID="UI4">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="UI4">Senator Robert Ray</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Haven't you read the section on itinerants? It is exactly the same, and you voted for it.</PARA></TALK.START>
</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="TI4">Senator PUPLICK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We are not about to start equating the rights of prisoners with the rights of itinerants. Paragraph (c) states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>if neither of paragraphs (a) and (b) is applicable, the Subdivision in which the person was born; and . . . </PARA>
<PARA>Crown Street Women's Hospital is not mentioned in the subsection. Nevertheless, I am sure that there are a fair number of people who, in terms of any of the major city maternity hospitals, would claim that they were entitled to that particular enrolment. Paragraph (d) states:</PARA>
<PARA>if none of the preceding paragraphs is applicable, the subdivision with which the person has the closest connection. </PARA>
<PARA>Again, that seems to me to be a pretty extraordinary type of situation. In some instances, the person about whom we are speaking will in fact not have his next of kin anywhere in the country. The next of kin might not have been born in this country and may not have been enrolled at the time the person went into prison. </PARA>
<PARA> I suppose that, taking it to its logical conclusion, the Opposition would have only a minor degree of concern about proposed subsection (2) (a). However, paragraphs (b), (c) and (d) present certain other problems. The fundamental problem that they raise is this: we believe that a person who was not enrolled at the time he was sentenced to prison should not be placed on the electoral roll as a consequence of being sent to prison. This seems to me to be a quite illogical type of situation. </PARA>
<PARA> The substantive debate will be on schedule 3 where the fundamental issue of principle is to be resolved-namely, whether a person under sentence, who has been convicted of an offence which carries a certain penalty, should or should not be entitled to vote. That is the issue of principle and that will be argued when we come eventually to schedule 3. Nevertheless, certain things flow as a consequence of our general view on this matter. We regard proposed new section 96a as a quite unsatisfactory method of dealing with either those prisoners to be enfranchised if schedule 3 is passed or those prisoners who are currently under sentence but, nevertheless, still entitled to vote. </PARA>

When the Committee looked into this it found a whole series of categories of people who for one reason or another had been deprived of the vote because the system was not flexible enough to enable them to be included on the roll. An example of that might be the workers at an Antarctic base. Quite elaborate systems have been devised to enable that to occur. People who were overseas for a period were often disenfranchised, as were people working in diplomatic missions or in the armed forces. Within Australia itinerant workers and prisoners were often disenfranchised because the system was not flexible enough to contain them.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator Puplick got a bit upset by proposed new section 96a (2) (b), which refers to next of kin. Section 96 (1) (c) of the principal Act, which relates to a person who is entitled to have his name on the roll but has not been on the roll for whatever reason, states that such a person can apply to have his name added to the roll. It reads:</PARA>
<PARA> Where a person . . . applies to . . . have his name added to the Roll for a Subdivision in the State that is-</PARA>
<PARA> (c) the Subdivision for which the person's next of kin or, if the person has more than 1 next of kin, one of the person's next of kin, is enrolled at the time when the application is made . . . </PARA>
<PARA>That was supported last time around. Section 96 (1) (d) states:</PARA>
<PARA>the Subdivision for which the person last had an entitlement to be enrolled;</PARA>
<PARA> (e) the Subdivision in which the person was born; or</PARA>
<PARA> (f) in a case in which there is no Subdivision for enrolment for which the person can apply in pursuance of paragraph (c), (d) or (e)-the Subdivision with which the person has the closest connection. </PARA>
<PARA>In other words, the principles that are applied in this amendment are taken from the Act which already exists. The group of people, the itinerant workers, who do not have a particular place of abode are picked up. I find it very difficult to understand why the Opposition takes objection to the method of finding out where we should enrol eligible prisoners, enabling them to select from a range of subdivisions in the same way as itinerant electors. </PARA>
<PARA> The other reason provided by the Opposition is that it felt it was not acceptable that a person who was not enrolled should be enrolled as a result of going to prison. Quite frankly, I find that an extraordinary reason for voting against this measure. The exercise of enrolment under this legislation is to make people accept an obligation. There is not an obligation to be enrolled, but there is an obligation to vote once enrolled. I would have thought that the reverse would be the case; that is, that the Opposition should be reasonably happy that we had induced people to put themselves on the roll as part of an exercise, as it were, of coming back into the mainstream. If prisons are to be seen as places where people are rehabilitated, then I cannot see any objection to the exercise whereby somebody who is in prison for whatever time-it may be a very short time; it could be a matter of weeks or even days-is sought to be placed on the roll. There is no provision and no structure to enable prison authorities to do that. </PARA>
<PARA> Remembering that all the prison authorities are State authorities, I do not think any of them will necessarily pursue this as one of their top priorities. I doubt whether in looking at what has occurred in the past we should get excited at the number of people who were on the rolls and who actually voted. In fact, the disparity between the various States in terms of prisoners enrolled and voting is so extraordinary that at one stage I tried to find out why in some prisons people were voting and in others they were not voting at all. It seems very much to do with the prison authorities and whether they see it as a matter of importance. There is no particular provision to get the State authorities to do anything about this matter, but we are saying that, if this occurs, we have to have a mechanism for slotting prisoners into a subdivision. The method the Government has chosen is obviously the correct one; that is, to take the Act as it already stands with regard to another class of voters-itinerant electors-and to use that, since it has already been accepted by the Parliament and has been in operation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think that Senator Puplick is under a total misapprehension. There is no automatic enrolment for prisoners under proposed new section 96a (2). I think the key words there are `entitled to be enrolled for'. That is what the clause says. If a prisoner does not fill out an enrolment card he will not be on the roll. No pressure is to be put on prisoners. Senator Puplick's implication that they are automatically put on the roll or forced on the roll is a total red herring and is not covered in this legislation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The provision to allow prisoners certain voting rights went through with some support in this Parliament from all quarters. The dividing line was about five years and they all supported that. What was not given much thought was where the people would be enrolled. A lot of thought was given to that point previously on the question of itinerants. It has now been decided to give that thought to prisoners. It probably would be undesirable to make all prisoners enrol in the electorate in which their prison is located. Let us face it-in a marginal electorate many Liberals would go to gaol just so that they could enrol there, or whatever. It would be open to a manipulation of all sorts, especially in State government seats, I would have thought. I do not think prisoners very often vote for the incumbent State government. I do not think that party lines matter much there; they vote for whoever is out of power rather than who is in power. </PARA>
<PARA> I point out that these clauses are hierarchical; that is, the prisoners do not get a choice. Most of the people that these provisions will apply to are 17-, 18- and 19-year-olds who are not yet on the roll. In some cases the reason for someone not being on the roll is that he was in prison before the age of 18, before he could get on the roll. We also have to remember that some of these people have a highly mobile lifestyle. That is why their charge sheet reads, `place of abode or address unknown. No normal address applies.' Therefore, I think that these provisions are utterly suitable. I wonder why the Liberal representatives on the Joint Committee on Electoral Reform did not object to them. As I recall, they supported this particular set of provisions. I would also have to argue that they strongly opposed those mentioned by Senator Puplick which come later in the schedule. This merely puts more detail into the Act. As I say, there was no objection with regard to itinerants. There is no implication in this set of provisions that anyone will be forced to be enrolled when he is not on the roll. It will merely aid the Australian Electoral Commission and everyone concerned to determine which electorate a person will be enrolled in. I also think it is an appropriate order that if a person has an address at the time of his arrest that address can be taken as a place where he can be enrolled; if not, the other three paragraphs can apply in hierarchical order. In most cases paragraphs (b), (c) and (d) will not have to apply, thank goodness, but in some cases they might have to. I think all this clause has done is give Senator Puplick a bit of a dry run at the later clauses in the schedule which we may get to, at the current rate, some time in December. </PARA>

<PARA> (2) Page 36, after clause 53, insert the following new clause:</PARA>
<PARA> ``53a. The Principal Act is amended by inserting the following section after section 206:</PARA>
<PARA> How-to-vote posters in polling booths</PARA>
<PARA> `206a. (1) In providing and furnishing proper polling booths for the purpose of paragraph 203 (1) (a), the Divisional Returning Officer shall ensure that there is displayed in each separate voting compartment a poster formed from the how-to-vote cards submitted to the Officer by candidates in the election. </PARA>
<PARA> `(2) How-to-vote cards submitted to inclusion in posters under subsection (1) shall be:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) in the prescribed form;</PARA>

<PARA> (c) received by the Divisional Returning Officer not later than 7 days before polling day; and</PARA>
<PARA> (d) such that each how-to-vote card submitted by or on behalf of the same candidate or group of candidates is in identical form.'.''. </PARA>
<PARA>This matter goes back quite some time. Indeed, in the first report of the Joint Select Committee on Electoral Reform in September 1983, I submitted a minority report on the banning of how-to-vote cards at polling booths and urged that a couple of other methods be used that would enable that process to be carried out in the way that senators or members wished. Since this issue has been around some significant changes have been made to the Commonwealth Electoral Act. For example, the names of political parties have been put on the ballot paper. We have had the introduction of the above and below the line Senate voting, or the ticket voting system as an option. We have sought quite deliberately to reduce the number of informal votes by providing additional information to electors about the nature of the activity that they are engaged in. </PARA>
<PARA> This amendment is not a new suggestion in the Australian context. If we look, for example, at section 246 of the Tasmanian Electoral Act 1985, we see that it specifies that the distribution of voting material, such as how-to-vote cards, handbills, et cetera, is banned on polling day. There are many good reasons why the Federal system should now follow the lead given by Tasmania. First of all, let us take as a base 10 million voters going into the polling booths. Undoubtedly, each voter would receive a minimum of three and a maximum of five how-to-vote cards, so we are looking at between 30 and 50 million being provided at that point. With the number of new political parties currently being registered at a rate of knots, if they ever get around to handing out how-to-vote cards there will be a question mark over how voters will be able to get into the polling booths. </PARA>
<PARA> Many voters object very strongly to what goes on outside the polling booths. They see it as almost having to run the gauntlet to get in there. In order to maintain the secrecy of their ballot, most people accept all of the how-to-vote cards offered to them. If one takes simply a Labor, Democrat, Liberal or National Party how-to-vote card, it is like disclosing one's voting intention. Of course, it does not necessarily do anything of the sort but it is seen as breaking secrecy. Some people do it quite deliberately and openly; others simply take all of the cards. </PARA>
<PARA> In estimating how many how-to-vote cards are needed, most political parties take the number of electors in the electorate and add at least 10 per cent to account for differences in the way they may be used at polling booths. Some polling booths pick up more than others. The main consolidated polling booths are in the capital cities where special how-to-vote cards are printed. Then there are the interstate how-to-vote cards. The major polling booths-for example, in Queensland, the Sunshine Coast, the Gold Coast and Brisbane-have to have their how-to-vote cards provided generally from Victoria and New South Wales. That is a massive exercise, which is a legitimate electoral expense and hence is able to be paid for from public funding. So it is no longer purely a party matter. It is capable of being paid for from Consolidated Revenue and hence the general population has an interest in this. </PARA>
<PARA> If we take 40 million as the average number, being halfway between 30 million and 50 million, of how-to-vote cards needed, we will need about 150 tonnes of paper, involving some 75 hectares of forest, for one Federal election. I suppose one could say that it was a necessary item if there were not other methods. In some States the how-to-vote cards are a necessity. For example, in my State of Queensland the State Government has resisted putting party designations on the ballot papers as doing so enabled voters to have a better chance of working out on their own who they want to vote for and how they wish to distribute their preferences. So in that sense one could argue reasons for them. </PARA>
<PARA> Many people do see the need for how-to-vote cards. They like to vote the way that a particular political party suggests. Senator Ray can probably correct me on this if I am wrong, but I think that for the 1985 election, when the analysis was done of the ballot papers in a number of seats to establish the informal vote structure, it was clearly obvious that the vast bulk of people used the how-to-vote cards. This is not surprising in, say, New South Wales, where the ballot paper can have 75 or 76 candidates. It would be amazing if a person were able to come up with the same permutation of numbers as on a political party's how-to-vote card without having used such a card. Therefore, it would be obvious that a voter had placed the candidates in the same sequence as on the how-to-vote card. As I have said, most people do use a how-to-vote card. That is probably a good reason for providing them, at least in some fashion. </PARA>
<PARA> In 1983 I made a couple of suggestions of alternative ways that this could be done. One was the poster a la the South Australian method and another was to provide them in self-dispensing boxes at the polling booths. So it could be done in a variety of ways. In my amendment I have chosen the method which has now been tested in a couple of State elections in South Australia, and presumably will be tested again when the next South Australian election is called. This involves getting from each of the political parties its designated how-to-vote card and displaying them in the voting compartment in such a way that they cannot be defaced and are there for each person using that voting compartment. This method would provide all the information normally provided through those 40 million pieces of paper. Nobody would be deprived of any of the information currently available, yet it would result in a massive saving on paper, which in this country is a relatively precious resource. </PARA>
<PARA> If we look at voting systems and the habits adopted by voters, Tasmanian voters have had that prohibition in their Electoral Act for a long period and there is a very high below the line Senate vote. Also, in their method of voting at the State level they have shown a very deliberate use of their vote. These things are tied together over time. The hope is that a more educated and more interested electorate will determine how to vote prior to going to the polling booth. That is what I am sure all senators in this place hope will occur. One method of doing that is to get people to make their choice prior to polling day instead of waiting for the how-to-vote cards. Some political parties are addressing this by the provision of information prior to the election by way of advertisements in newspapers, letterbox drops or whatever, in which they set out all the candidates running in the election. The hope is that individual voters will see that there is an advantage in working out their own how-to-vote card independently of what the parties determine. </PARA>
<PARA> I think every senator in this place has come across people who believe that they have to vote in the way which the how-to-vote card sets out. That is often promoted because people in political parties find that is the best way of dealing with matters. It is not the case; people are entitled to vote by putting down numbers consecutively in any way they wish, even giving one vote within a particular party group and giving their second vote to a second party group. That additional knowledge and understanding on the part of the voters is something that should be supported. Moving away from that open display outside would add to that movement and would say to people that it is a good and valuable thing if they work out their own how-to-vote cards prior to coming to the polling booth and casting their ballot. After all, we are asking them to vote for a government in their own country only once every three years. It is not a major imposition that we are asking them to engage in. To have made up their minds prior to coming to the polling booth is something that we ought to be able to expect of all conscientious voters. </PARA>
<PARA> As I said, my amendment is modelled on section 66 of the South Australian Electoral Act in terms of posters. I believe it is a method which has been tried and which works. The bugs that existed in the initial system in South Australia have now been ironed out. The South Australians have the same type of information that everybody else has. It is not a matter of depriving anybody of any information. It is seeking to save a vast amount of paper. It is seeking to save that harassment at the polls. I think it is a streamlined method of dealing with something that over time has become a massive annoyance to electors as they approach their task of selecting the government of the day. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not think the Government is minded to support this particular amendment put forward by Senator Macklin. I have listened to his arguments over the years on this question. Our first objection relates to practicality. Senator Macklin says that it works in South Australia. I do not know how many people had a look at the how-to-vote cards or posters that were used in the last Senate election in the various States. The poster in Victoria was so large that, if Senator Boswell and I stood shoulder to shoulder, no-one could see us behind it. That gives people an idea of the size of the poster.</PARA></TALK.START>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="UI4">Senator ROBERT RAY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not tell a lie; that is how big the poster was. How are we going to fit that inside a voting cubicle? Clearly Senator Macklin has thought it out and knows that it has to be behind glass, otherwise it will be defaced. Then again we have arguments. Who goes on top? Are we allowed to have party colours? Why can we not have our ethnic how-to-vote advice in nine or 15 languages? The bottom line is that practicality makes it impossible. I believe we could probably do it for the House of Representatives by itself. We could probably fit it in, given current nomination practices. But in the Senate it becomes a nightmare. It is an infringement on some people's voting rights if they cannot get a how-to-vote card. If it is so small that it cannot be read, then it is useless. We cannot make voting cubicles big enough to accommodate the Boswells and Rays of this world together; it is just impossible. Think of the cost of that and the storage and everything else. It is simply impossible.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The other reasons adduced by Senator Macklin are more interesting. He should go to the Norm Sanders school of how to put a case when his heart is not really in it and self-interest is really overriding. Senator Macklin, for all his ability in this chamber, has never been good at carrying a proposition that involves self-interest for the Australian Democrats. It always weakens his argument. His first argument is that we should think of the paper we will save. By the next election we will all be using recycled paper for how-to-vote cards. If we cannot buy that paper we will have to make our how-to-vote cards look like recycled paper. We will not have much choice in that. We will all make sure that it is collected and recycled again for another election or for another form of paper. It really comes back to the fact that every three years that amount of paper is not that enormous compared to the paper we see scattered around here and throughout the community. </PARA>
<PARA> The next argument adduced by Senator Macklin is that it is very hard to get in to vote because all the people are jostling outside with their how-to-vote cards. It is a lot easier these days because it is pretty hard to find a Democrat in a polling place, which has sometimes been a matter for regret. I do not think we would have drawn the Nunawading election if the Democrats had manned all the booths or, to use a less sexist word for Senator Boswell, staffed all the booths. I cannot get out of the old habit either. Staffing polling booths is what this amendment is all about. The Democrats cannot do it. They have a very low base membership of their political party. They are not that different from the others. They just find it harder because they have to concentrate their efforts in the Senate and therefore would like to have someone outside every polling booth with a how-to-vote card. This proposition is coming forward because of their inability to do so. I understand that. Small parties have some advantages, as do big parties. One of the advantages of the bigger parties is that we can have someone outside every polling booth. But when we go to the electorate we carry other responsibilities and other lead in the saddlebags that small parties do not. These things tend to have a habit of dying out. I would also like to assist the chamber with another argument that I was given in the advice. I have been told that many party activists would feel deprived of one of their most enjoyable duties. </PARA>

I can remember, after Jack McEwen retired, how wonderful it was to get up at 4 o'clock in the morning and drive to Katandra West to open the Katandra West polling booth at 8 o'clock in the morning. Ninety-four people voted in the 12 hours I was on that booth. I was not there for the whole twelve hours, but for 94 votes we decided to staff that particular booth. One of Senator Boswell's colleagues was there at 8 o'clock in the morning. He abused the living heck out of me for the first hour but, because no-one else was coming through, by 9.30 we were discussing the football, by 12.30 he was shouting me a counter lunch at the local-so we let a few people through without how-to-vote cards-and by the end of the night, when we counted the votes, there was a 10 per cent swing against us-on the only occasion we had ever handed out how-to-vote cards! Some of the local National Party people worked out who the Labor socialist candidate mongrel was and would not vote for him. What a wonderful effort that was.

Some of Senator Faulkner's colleagues in New South Wales once insisted on scrutinising a polling booth where they believed people were ringing through their votes. He would remember the circumstances well. We had someone inside all day. The phone would ring and the returning officer would say, `I'm sorry, Joe, you will have to come down to vote'. When they opened the ballot box that night our vote dropped from 40 per cent to 20 per cent. As the local returning officer said, `I was always fair: I used to vote 60 per cent National Party and 40 per cent Labor Party'. We made everyone come in and got a 20 per cent swing against ourselves. That does not always operate to our advantage. I do not think we will do away with how-to-vote cards at the moment. It may come one day with a more simplified voting system, but at the moment it is a bit like disarming in the Middle East-no-one is willing to start first. We will not find any unilateralists on that side or this side to do away with how-to-vote cards.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to take a few minutes of the time of the Senate to talk about an issue which relates to the price of books in Australia and to a series of reports which have been forthcoming in relation to book pricing in Australia. Earlier today, in the House of Representatives, my colleague Mr Neil Brown, the honourable member for Menzies and shadow Attorney-General, introduced a private member's Bill entitled the Copyright Reform Bill 1989, the purpose of which is to put in place the recommendations of the Copyright Law Review Committee in relation to parallel importing and to the related operations of the Australian book trade and industry. I seek leave to incorporate in Hansard the brief speech made by Mr Brown in presenting the Bill.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The speech read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA> Mr N. A. BROWN (Menzies) (11.00) I present the Copyright Reform Bill 1989. This procedure allows me to introduce a private member's Bill and to make a five minute statement in support of it. I have just introduced the Copyright Reform Bill 1989. It is described as a reform Bill because it will very substantially reform the copyright law in Australia. The Bill, in effect, will implement the recommendations of the Copyright Law Review Committee on imported books and other reproduced articles. The problem that this Bill seeks to resolve arises from the fact that over many years, as many honourable members in this House would realise, readers and booksellers have been quite infuriated by one of the undesirable consequences of the copyright law. It is not necessary for me to explain the details of the copyright law on this occasion. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the results of the copyright law is that books published overseas are very often not available in Australia until months, sometimes years, after their publication. Sometimes they are never available despite the fact that they have been published overseas. Indeed, when books are eventually brought to Australia by overseas publishers for sale here the prices of these books are far in excess of any reasonable price and far in excess of the price at which they sell in the country of publication. There has been a lot of evidence to suggest that the increase in prices maybe 10 per cent, 20 per cent or in some cases 30 per cent. This undesirable situation comes about as a result of the provisions of the Copyright Act, which provides that the publisher has copyright in the book and can determine when and where the book is sold. </PARA>
<PARA> The Copyright Law Review Committee has investigated this issue and has proposed a series of reforms to the law, which will be implemented by this Bill. Briefly, these reforms provide that overseas publications will be able to be imported and sold here if either of two circumstances arise. The first is where the books are not available here within a reasonable time from when they are available overseas. That is the first situation-the reasonable time test. The second is a more narrow one. It is where a distributor in Australia, for example, a bookseller, has a specific order for an item that a consumer wishes to import but not re-sell; in other words, wants to keep it to read it. The Copyright Law Review Committee recommended draft legislation to implement these proposals. This Bill will incorporate those changes to the Copyright Act. If the Bill becomes law, members of the Australian community will have better access not only to books but also to records and other reproduced articles published overseas. Not only will they have access to them but also they will be able to buy them at lower prices and with much earlier delivery times than are presently available. </PARA>
<PARA> I hope the Government will support this Bill. At the same time, I hope that the Government will respond to the recommendations of the Prices Surveillance Authority, which recommended virtually complete deregulation of the industry of the distribution of books and other reproduced articles. The recommendations of the Copyright Law Review Committee are milder than those of the Prices Surveillance Authority. There is now an onus on the Government to show any reason, if there is any, why the recommendations of the Prices Surveillance Authority should not also be implemented. That response-I can understand that the Government may need a few weeks to examine the Bill-should not be allowed to delay the Copyright Law Review Committee proposals, which I now propose in this Bill should be put into law. </PARA>
<PARA> It is a very healthy example of micro-economic reform. In many areas the Government has been dragging the chain on micro-economic reform, and here is a very good example. The Government should pick up the ball and run with it, accept this Bill, take it over as a government Bill and make sure that it is passed and put into law as soon as possible. Consumers will benefit; purchasers will benefit; industry and commerce and the economy will benefit. Nothing can really be said against this Bill. Therefore, I hope that in the interests of all buyers and readers of books, the Government will support the Bill. </PARA>

<PARA>THE COMMITTEE'S RECOMMENDATIONS</PARA>
<PARA> 2. The principal question which has concerned the Committee in this Reference is whether it should recommend the repeal of the importation provisions of the Copyright Act 1968 in their application to non-pirated articles, i.e. parallel imports. The Reference has involved the Committee in a lengthy consideration of submissions from a great many interests. The Committee's inquiries have covered a number of copyright areas, the principal being those of books, sound recordings, films and computer software. Additionally, it has considered the question of copyright in labels attached to articles which are not themselves the subject of copyright protection. The Committee has unanimously reached the conclusion that the sections should continue to apply to parallel imports, but that their application to such imports should be relaxed in a number of respects. </PARA>
<PARA> 3. Committee's recommendations are:</PARA>
<PARA> (1) The Copyright Act be amended so as to modify the provisions of ss. 37 and 102 (infringement by importation for the purposes of trade, for example, sale or hire) in the following respects:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) The importation of a non-pirated copyright article by a person engaged in trade or commerce be permitted without the licence or other permission of the owner of the copyright if:</PARA>
<PARA> (i) The article is not available in Australia, and will not, within a reasonable time, be available in Australia, from the copyright owner or his or her licensee or agent; OR</PARA>
<PARA> (ii) Although the article is available in Australia, the importer has received a specific order in writing for the article signed by the person requiring it in which that person states that the article is not required for the purposes of trade or commerce. </PARA>
<PARA> (b) The onus of establishing the matters specified in paras. (a) (i) and (ii) be upon the importer. </PARA>
<PARA> (c) For the purposes of para. (a) (i), an article shall be taken to be unavailable in Australia if the importer, after reasonable investigation, is satisfied that the article cannot be obtained in Australia from the copyright owner or his or her licensee or agent within a reasonable time. The reference to a reasonable time is included so as to take into account the time which is reasonably required in the industry in question for an Australian copyright owner to import or manufacture and market copies of the article. The Committee's objective is not to deprive the Australian copyright owner of the right to supply articles to the Australian market but to ensure that the Australian community is able to obtain access to copyright articles within a reasonable time of their becoming available overseas. </PARA>
<PARA> (d) There be included a provision along the lines of sub-secs. 109 (3) and (4) of the Act empowering the making of regulations prescribing, in relation to all articles or to particular articles, the period or periods which is or are to be a reasonable time or reasonable times for the purposes of sub-para. (c). </PARA>
<PARA> (e) An article shall be taken to be available in Australia if there is lawfully available here an article which is substantially similar to that which the importer proposes to import. The Committee is not able to suggest a more precise expression than `substantially similar to'. It will be for the courts to apply these words to the infinite variety of circumstances that may arise. The Committee recognizes that this may lead to some uncertainty, but the use of more precise language would be likely to create a different problem, namely, that the legislation would be too inflexible. Rather than attempt a more precise definition, the Committee has given some guidance as to the way in which its proposal is to be understood by reference to some concrete examples (see paras. 91 and 137). </PARA>
<PARA> (2) The Copyright Act be amended so as to modify the provisions of ss. 38 and 103 (infringement by sale, letting for hire or otherwise by way of trade, offering or exposing for sale or hire articles known to have been imported into Australia in contravention of s. 37 or s. 102) so as to bring them into line with the provisions of ss.37 and 102 as modified in accordance with para. (1) above. </PARA>
<PARA> (3) There will be no infringement of the sections if an article is imported and copyright subsists only in a work comprised in a label or mark affixed or attached to the the article or to its packaging provided that the owner of the copyright has consented to the use of his or her work on the label or mark. </PARA>
<PARA> (4) Although the preponderance of submissions from those seeking the retention of the sections did not favour an amendment to the provisions concerning knowledge, the Committee is of opinion, because of the amendments which have been made to s. 132 by the Copyright Amendment Act 1986, that the knowledge provisions should be brought into line with the provisions of s. 132. </PARA>
<PARA> (5) The Committee considers that a person importing a non-pirated article ought not to be subject to criminal proceedings and sanctions. Civil proceedings only should lie against him. </PARA>
<PARA> (6) Section 135 of the Copyright Act 1968 be amended to cover all works and subject matter other than works. In consequence subsecs (4) and (9) will need to be amended to remove the reference to printed copies so that the section will apply to reproductions of all kinds. The sections should be amended to apply to exclusive licensees of copyright material as well as to owners thereof. </PARA>
<PARA> A suggested form of amendment of the relevant sections, other than s. 135, is attached as Appendix A. The amendment is not intended as a final legislative draft, but rather to indicate more precisely the ambit of the Committee's recommendations and that their implementation would be practical. No draft of an amendment to s. 135 is included because the alterations to it will be of a mechanical kind only. </PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="TI4">Senator PUPLICK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the Senate. In effect, the Copyright Law Review Committee proposed that the current restrictions under the old system relating to the parallel importing of books should be altered in such a way that, where a non-pirated copyright article is required by a person engaged in the purchase of books, that person would be allowed, through an agent, to import into Australia a book which was not available and would not be available within a reasonable period, or a book for which the importer had received a specific order in writing for the article, signed by the person requiring it, in which the person stated that the article was not required for the purposes of trade or commerce; that the onus of establishing these matters lay upon the importer; and that certain other steps were to be taken to accord protection to copyright owners so that pirated editions were excluded from this procedure.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The long and short of this issue is that Australians simply pay too much for their books. I wish to indicate that to the Senate by giving a few examples. I have here a book entitled The Brief History of Time by Stephen W. Hawkings. A hard cover version of this book retails for $34.95. It is one of the most successful books in terms of popular science to have been printed and published in the course of the last couple of years. It is also outstandingly one of the best popular science books of the post-war period. It has been on the best seller list in this country for the best part of 18 months. As I say, its retail price is $34.95. </PARA>
<PARA> It is expected that, some time towards the end of the year, a paperback version of this book will be available. At the moment, no paperback version is available. I have here, however, a paperback version of the book. It is exactly the same book, which is printed by Bantam Books Ltd. I purchased it at the airport in Bangkok, as I was on my way through that city earlier this year, for in the order of $A8. Australians cannot currently purchase that book in paperback form in Australia, nor are they likely to be able to for some months yet. They have to rely on purchasing the hard cover version for $34.95.</PARA>
<PARA> The second example is the fairly notorious book by Salman Rushdie entitled The Satanic Verses. It is available and has been available in this country for some time. Its retail price is $35. It is not yet available in Australia in a paperback version, nor is it likely to be until the latter part of next year. Here, however, I have a paperback version of exactly the same book, The Satanic Verses by Salman Rushdie, purchased again when I was on my way through Bangkok. It is printed by Viking Press and is available for approximately $A12. That book, terrible as it is-awful, wretched, second-rate book that it is-is nevertheless not available in that form in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> A third example is a book by Alexander Leggatt, published by Routledge and Kegan Paul Ltd, entitled Shakespeare's Political Drama. It sells in the United Kingdom for #29.50. It is therefore a fairly expensive book. It is not a large book. In fact, it runs only to 270-odd pages. It is a very interesting book. As I said, it costs #29.50 in England and it would cost another couple of pounds to have it airmailed to Australia, so an Australian purchaser might be looking at $60-odd in terms of legitimate currency conversion. It is in fact available in Australian bookshops for $105. </PARA>
<PARA> The reason for this situation in which books are expensive and are unavailable in their cheapest form is that we follow a system derived essentially from a colonial mentality, a colonial arrangement, in which the world has been divided up essentially between the British Empire and the rest of the world for the purposes of book publication and distribution. Australia is still treated in this respect as part of the British Empire, part of a closed network of distribution of books and control of book prices. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government, to its credit, some time ago gave a reference to the Prices Surveillance Authority to look at the question of book prices in Australia. I seek leave to incorporate in  Hansard the summary of the recommendations of the Prices Surveillance Authority. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The document read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA>PSA</PARA>
<PARA>SUMMARY</PARA>
<PARA> This Interim Report of the Authority's Inquiry into Book Prices focuses on the effects of the importation provisions of the Copyright Act 1968 on book prices and related issues of economic welfare and efficiency. It aims to provide a more extensive economic analysis of those issues than the Copyright Law Review Committee (CLRC) was able to provide. </PARA>
<PARA> Chapter 2 sets out the economic rationale for copyright protection, based on the general theory of property rights. In practice the State places limits on all property rights. In economic theory, those limits should be chosen so as to maximise economic welfare. The granting of copyright provides a necessary incentive for the production of intellectual products, but this benefit must be balanced against the costs of limiting access to copyright works. </PARA>
<PARA> The question posed by the importation provisions is whether those property rights should extend beyond the first sale to provide control over the further trading and distribution of copyright works. Those provisions currently make it illegal to import and distribute books for purposes of trade without the permission of the copyright owner. The provisions treat pirate copies and so called `parallel imports' in an identical manner. </PARA>
<PARA> The provisions do not derive from any international agreements to which Australia is a signatory. The Berne Convention and the Universal Copyright Convention provide for basic international recognition of copyright in reproduction not distribution. The nature and degree of protection beyond this minimum is on the basis of equal national treatment according to domestic laws. </PARA>
<PARA>The optimal level of protection (if any) against parallel imports depends on a balancing of costs and benefits. These costs and benefits are likely to vary between countries with a different location in the pattern of international trade. </PARA>
<PARA> Chapter 3 sets out the broad structure of the Australian book market. The retail value of book sales in Australia is estimated to be a little over $1,000 million. A `market for books' does not really exist in an economic sense. Substitutability in supply and demand may be quite limited between different types of books; while substitutability with other leisure and learning products, such as TV, videos, newspapers and magazines, may be quite high. </PARA>
<PARA> Demand for books is a function of income and occupation. Price elasticity of demand in sub-markets varies from very high to very low. For most individual titles, elasticity of demand is high. However, for some professional and technical books it may be quite low. </PARA>
<PARA> The supply of books is via publishers and retailers. Publishing is dominated by large global corporations, sometimes with interests in substitute and complementary products. </PARA>
<PARA> The traditional territorial division of copyright in English language books has meant that the supply of books to the Australian market has historically been dominated by British publishing houses and the majority of books are still imported. </PARA>
<PARA> Australian (and overseas) authors have found it difficult to negotiate separate publishing rights in Australia. Educational texts (other than tertiary) are now a major exception to this situation, where supply is dominated by Australian originated texts. </PARA>
<PARA> During the 1970s, overseas publishers created a `closed market' for the supply of imported titles to Australia. Retailers can only obtain titles legally from the exclusive distributor. </PARA>
<PARA> Retailing has traditionally been dominated by the small independent bookstore, and by newsagents for `mass market' titles. This situation is changing with the growth of discount bookstores, and increased sales through Department stores. </PARA>
<PARA> Chapter 4 examines issues of book pricing and efficiency. Copyright itself is not inconsistent with competitive product markets. It corrects the `free rider' problem associated with intellectual products. Competition between titles which seek to satisfy the same consumer wants would result in normal profits being earned. However, by extending copyright into the sphere of distribution, the importation provisions are likely to put Australia on an uneven footing with other industries, resulting in a misallocation of resources and cost inefficiencies. </PARA>
<PARA> Profit-maximisation from an individual title will determine a price at which marginal revenue equals marginal cost. Book publishing involves a considerable amount of risk. The publisher must estimate what demand is going to be; on some titles they will make above average profits and on other below average, but averaging across titles would provide a normal return in a competitive market. </PARA>
<PARA> The profit-maximising levels of output and price will not normally be those which maximise revenue and therefore authors' royalty payments. </PARA>
<PARA> Publishers set a uniform recommended retail price (RRP) for books throughout Australia. This `freight absorption' by suppliers is a common phenomenon in economics. It represents the profit-maximising strategy in response to demand conditions, falling marginal costs and the administrative costs associated with variable pricing. </PARA>
<PARA> For publishers operating in several territorial markets with different demand conditions, international price discrimination represents a profit-maximising strategy, providing markets can be effectively segmented. Importation provisions in copyright legislation provide such effective segmentation. </PARA>
<PARA> Competitive markets and the price mechanisms generally act as an effective mechanism for producing an optimal allocation of resources and cost efficiency in production and distribution. The distribution of books in Australia is not currently subject to such a market test. </PARA>
<PARA> In a world of limited economic resources, there can be too much variety, service and quality in book distribution. Stockholdings by publishers in Australia are considerably higher than for most manufacturing industry. It is suggested that a competitive market would be the best determinant of an optimal level and composition of stockholdings. </PARA>
<PARA> The costs of distribution make up around half of the RRP of a book. Although some publishers appear to have technically efficient distribution systems, others may be hiding operating inefficiencies behind the protection of the importation provisions. The wealth of evidence on poor delivery times suggests such inefficiency is widespread. While recent years have seen some improvements in terms of mass handling, the current multiplicity of distribution systems would appear to be losing out on potential gains in operating efficiency. </PARA>
<PARA> Chapter 5 examines empirical data on book prices in Australia. There are many pitfalls to beware of in examining price data, especially in making price comparisons. The comparisons utilised in this chapter all compare identical samples of books and examine the issues of international price discrimination and the relative prices of US and UK editions of books. </PARA>
<PARA> The evidence suggests that publishers do engage in international price discrimination and that Australian consumers generally lose out from this practice. Publishers operating in the UK, Canada and Australia are able to set Canadian retail prices consistently below those in the UK, despite the additional costs of freight; while charging consistently higher prices in Australia. The average price differentials for Canada were $0.35 and 2.6 per cent below the UK; and for Australia $2.99 and 31.30 per cent above the UK. Price discrimination appears to have its greatest effect in the market for professional and technical books; while tertiary text books are generally priced at quite reasonable levels in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> Where separate UK and US editions of titles are published, Australia generally has access only to the UK edition. For a sample of mass market paperback bestsellers, the domestic price of the UK edition was an average of $US1.54 and 30.6 per cent more expensive than the domestic price of the US edition. Quality differences exist between the two editions, but these differences cannot be judged in any absolute sense. Consumers in Australia are not currently able to exercise a choice. </PARA>
<PARA> Chapter 6 considers the possible consequences of repeal of the importation provisions or reform along the lines proposed by the CLRC. Repeal of the provisions would create enormous potential for improvements in allocative and cost efficiency, lower prices and improved economic welfare. While the CLRC proposals would go some way to improving delivery times in book distribution, it seems unlikely that there would be any major benefit in terms of lower prices. A major problem of the proposals is their essentially regulatory nature and the administrative costs which that would impose. Repeal of the provisions may pose some dangers for the further development of Australian literature, but recent growth in that area is essentially demand and profit driven. Furthermore, repeal would seem likely to make separate publishing rights for Australia more feasible, since the value of those rights to UK publishers would be reduced. </PARA>
<PARA> Chapter 7 contains the Authority's conclusions and recommendations. The Authority recommends repeal of the importation provisions with two exceptions: pirate editions; and Australian resident authors with separate Australian publishing contracts. The latter is to operate for ten years, to provide support for an `infant industry'. The Authority recognises that this may cause some problems in relation to the Berne Convention; although the importation provisions do not derive from that Convention, it may be construed as requiring national treatment if such provisions exist. It is also recognised that overnight repeal of the provisions could cause significant disruption for industry participants, and it is recommended that a one year period of notice be given to allow the industry to prepare for a competitive market. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the Senate. The Prices Surveillance Authority has recommended what might be regarded as a fundamentally deregulatory approach, an open market approach, for Australian books. It has done so by making an attack upon the copyright restrictions and provisions of the Copyright Act as they exist at the moment and as they serve to protect the position essentially of British publishers and to impede the position of Australian purchasers. The recommendations say in part:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Competitive markets and the price mechanism generally act as an effective mechanism for producing an optimal allocation of resources and cost efficiency in production and distribution. </PARA>
<PARA> The distribution of books in Australia is not currently subject to such a market test. </PARA>
<PARA>The report goes on to assert that price differentials between books which can be purchased in Canada, the United Kingdom and Australia are as follows: for Canada, 35c and 2.6 per cent below the United Kingdom; and for Australia, $2.99 and 31.3 per cent above the United Kingdom. The Canadians, who are part of the same British Commonwealth market as Australia, nevertheless have book prices which are reduced by their proximity to the more open, and more accessible, United States market. </PARA>
<PARA> In Australia we continue to pay an additional premium for a whole series of reasons. I do not deny that the people who support this particular system claim two things: first, the size of the Australian market and, secondly, the necessity to protect the position of Australian authors are such that some sort of restricted arrangement in terms of Australia's economic evaluation and cultural policy should be maintained. Those arguments have been carefully thought through and carefully analysed by the Prices Surveillance Authority and essentially have been rejected, although the recommendations of the PSA provide a let-out for people who have local Australian contracts and for the protection of Australian authors for a period of, I think, 10 years. Therefore, an open slather is not proposed by the PSA but, rather, a modified version which would lead in due course to a freeing-up of the market. </PARA>
<PARA> At this stage I pause to pay great tribute to Professor Fels, the Chairman of the PSA, and his colleagues on that body for the extraordinarily perceptive and significant job they have done in producing their report. However, I must say that one of the things that immediately came to mind when I analysed what the PSA report says about book importers and publishers was a very famous quote of Adam Smith in his book The Wealth of Nations:</PARA>
<PARA>People of the same trade seldom meet together, even for merriment and diversion, but the conversation ends in a conspiracy against the public, or some other contrivance to raise prices. </PARA>
<PARA>To all intents and purposes that is precisely what has been occurring in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> This matter has not gone without public comment over a prolonged period of time. I pay great tribute to the work of the journalist Robert Haupt, who has for a prolonged period of time campaigned on precisely this question. I have looked at Robert Haupt's articles, stretching back over a period of almost 12 months. On 5 November 1988 he wrote an article entitled, `Bound for Botany Bay. Why Britain still decides what you can read'. On the same day he wrote, `New try to break UK hold'. On the same day, `The closed book market'. On 7 November 1988, `A long drawn-out lesson that words are cheap'. Again on 7 November, `Publishing power game-why we must wait for books'. On 8 November 1988, `Bowen's quest is to strike an equitable balance'. On the same day, `Australians pay more for their paperbacks'. On 18 November 1988 he wrote, `Something rotten in the state of the book battle'. On 10 March 1989, `Touche! The publishers strike back'. On 14 March 1989, `The truth about our publishers'. On 22 July 1989, `Wilder's broadside could free book market from British control'. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Haupt was quite assiduous in pursuing a lone campaign to bring to the attention of people in Australia the rort which was going on in our book trade. When the PSA report appeared, Mr Haupt appeared to have a slight wheel wobble about going immediately to the more deregulatory model. On 12 September 1989 he wrote an articled entitled, `Book market reform plan perhaps a little drastic'. After thinking about the matter for another fortnight he was able to write on 25 October 1989, `Turning the page to new era of freedom'. Mr Haupt deserves great credit for bringing into the public domain the debate about book pricing in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> When the PSA report came out it was largely welcomed. The Sydney Morning Herald, in its editorial on 12 September, stated, `PSA right on publishing'. On the same day, in the same newspaper, John Sampson wrote, `Books: A victory for the reader'. On the same day Paddy McGuinness wrote in the Australian, `Our book market must grow up'. He wrote in another article, `Time is up for British publishers' cosy deals'. In the Australian Barry Lowe wrote, `PSA slams book trade monopoly'. Julie Power, in the Australian Financial Review on the same day, wrote, `Open book market urged'. On 4 October 1989 Tom Dusevic wrote in the Australian Financial Review, `Book market debate ignores the importance of Australian readers', making the point that the PSA report was the first report to put the book reader as the central determinant of the Australian book import policy. On 13 September 1989, in the Sydney Morning Herald, Ross Gittins wrote, `High book prices literally a rip-off'. Max Suich, in the Sydney Morning Herald on 24 October 1989, wrote, `A small advance in the debate on Australia's publishing trade'. The PSA report has been increasingly seen as one which looks after the interests of the Australian book reading public. </PARA>
<PARA> Needless to say, there was a certain amount of opposition to the PSA report. Bodies such as the Australian Music Publishers Association and the Australian Record Industry Association noted that the PSA, in its report, said that it would look at the record industry next and were suddenly up in arms about that. Distinguished authors such as Peter Carey thought it would be the destruction of Australian literature and the position of Australian authors. Mr Mark Rubbo of the Australian Book Sellers Association believed that book sellers would be substantially disadvantaged. They basically said, `If we have an open market stuff will be dumped on us, particularly American products'. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Zifcak, the Executive Chairman of Collins booksellers, wrote a letter to the Australian Financial Review on 26 September basically saying, `If we have got to go to the process of reform let us go to the copyright law review committees-a lesser position. But for heaven's sake, let us not be pushed into a deregulatory open market situation because all sorts of things could happen, including the fact that our distributors would not hold as much stock in Australia and, as a result, people would find it more difficult to get the books they want'. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Laurie Muller, the head of the University of Queensland Press, made the claim that this would be a blow to Australian culture. In the Sydney Morning Herald on 3 August 1989, Mr Muller wrote:</PARA>
<PARA> This country, as it struggles to its cultural feet after two centuries of insecurity, is in very real danger of being put on its backside again by the new tyranny of a threatened open market. We simply do not have the size, or resilience as a nation, to survive culturally in such an environment. </PARA>
<PARA>That is probably the ultimate cultural cringe. Eventually, even the booksellers started to wake up to the realities of the world and, earlier this month, suddenly decided that they would back the Sheppard halfway house recommendations, although I note that the New South Wales branch of the Book Publishers Association indicated its support for an open market. </PARA>
<PARA> When the report came down, in my capacity as shadow Minister for the arts, with responsibility for cultural policy matters, I put out a press statement on 12 September headed, `The Australian Books Trade: Report by Prices Surveillance Authority', in which I said that the report was moving in the right direction. I seek leave to incorporate a copy of that press release in Hansard. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The document read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA>THE AUSTRALIAN BOOKS TRADE: REPORT BY PRICES SURVEILLANCE AUTHORITY</PARA>
<PARA> In terms of its potential impact on Australian cultural policy, the draft report from the PSA on the Australian book trade is one of the most important developments in recent years. </PARA>
<PARA> I welcome the report, endorse its general conclusions and hope that the Government will now take action to move in the direction which it suggests. The Report builds upon the constructive recommendations made some time ago by the Copyright Law Review Committee which themselves have languished without sufficient support from Government. </PARA>
<PARA> The work of journalists such as Robert Haupt has over recent months focused attention on what Australian book purchasers have known all along-that books in Australia are too expensive and often too difficult to obtain. It is quite outrageous that those of us who are able to travel overseas can purchase cheap editions of best-sellers such as Hawking's A Brief History of Time (Bantam) or Salman Rushdie's Satanic Verses (Viking) at airports like Bangkok or Singapore for $A10 while domestic consumers have to pay $A20 to $A30 for the same book in restrictive hard-cover editions. </PARA>
<PARA> I am not impressed with the argument that opening up of the Australian market will pose a threat to the continued viability of the Australian publishing industry or destroy the demand for Australian works of literature. So long as Australians want to read the works of their local authors the demand will be there and hopefully the interest in Australian literature overseas will continue to grow. </PARA>
<PARA> Lessons from our film and television industry need to be studied in this regard as do the lessons to be learned from the growth of international interest in writings from South and Latin America. Support for this industry also exists and can be adjusted within the terms of the Bounty (Books) Act under which some $25.5 million was spent last year. </PARA>
<PARA> Taken together the Copyright Law Review Committee, the Prices Surveillance Authority recommendations are genuinely radical. They strike at the heart of a closed, cosy colonial relationship which has benefited a large number of people, but not the people who really matter-the Australian book consumers. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe the time has arrived to strike out into this intellectual brave new world-for those who believe that ideas and literature should be challenging and should be prepared to confront the perceived verities and the comfortable status quo let them also apply these tests to the structure of their industry, in the end I am sure we will all benefit. </PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="TI4">Senator PUPLICK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Professor Fels, the Chairman of the PSA, in a letter published in the Australian Financial Review on 4 October made the point that this was not a matter of the privileges of the Australian publishers; rather it was a matter of Australian consumers. He wrote in that letter:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>The choice for Australian consumers is not between having a title `for $12.95 now or $10.95 in four months' time'. For new titles it is more likely to be between having a title for $12.95 whenever it suits the British publisher to supply it, or having the title for $10.95 now under an open market. </PARA>
<PARA>I think that that is entirely correct. I want to say a couple of words about the Australian book market. People tend to think that we are talking about a market in which there is only a small amount of Australian material. The truth of the matter is that Australian-originated books are now at least 50 per cent of the books sold in this country. That figure has increased since 1974 when the figure was only some 15 per cent. Like Australian drama on television it has increased because Australians want to read Australian material. It has increased fundamentally not because of all other extraneous supports which are provided to the industry but because Australians want to read about Australia in works published by Australians. It ought to be made clear that they tend not to read what is regarded as highbrow literature. In non-fiction material in Australia, Australian book sales are dominated by food books, sport books and books about improving our health. If we look at the best sellers in Australia, the best selling books in Australia listed in an article in the Bulletin of 4 October 1988--</PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="TI4">Senator PUPLICK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Almost a biography of Bob Hawke; it is a book by John O'Grady entitled They're a Weird Mob. It managed to sell 1.2 million copies in this country. The best foreign books at that stage were the novels The Godfather by Mario Puzo and Jaws by Peter Benchley, each of which had sold half a million copies. The best selling hardcover books in Australia included, for example, The Australian Women's Weekly Cookbook, which sold more than one million copies. In terms of sport, Fishing in Australia by Jack Pollard sold more than 650,000 copies. That is not a cheap book. It is quite clear that in Australia books about lifestyle, sport, recreation, cooking and fitness are major sellers. Those sorts of books will not in any way be affected by these changes.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Indeed, Australian publishers have significant opportunities in the international market. In the United States, Australian books teaching people about literacy are major sellers. Senator Colston, who is here this evening, has had a long interest in questions of literacy and education. I may say, for example, that the State of New York has spent more than $250,000 training 70 tutors on the basis of using South Australia's early literacy in-service courses. Books written in Australia about the promotion of literacy and about teaching people to be literate are major international sellers and an area in which Australian books are extremely well regarded and have an extremely bright commercial future. According to the figures prepared for the Cultural Ministers Council's statistical advisory group in March 1989, wholesale book sales in Australia constituted some $500m worth of wholesale book sales and some $880m worth of retail book sales. </PARA>
<PARA> There are some unique niches. For example, I have had representations on behalf of Koorong Books Pty Ltd, which is one of this country's major importers of Christian books, saying that it hopes that the barriers will be reduced because there is a substantial disadvantage to it in importing Christian books, nearly all of which are published overseas. The National Library of Australia in its submission to the Prices Surveillance Authority said that it believes that the Copyright Law Review Committee report should be put in place because this would go some way towards ensuring the timely availability of overseas publications to the Australian community. </PARA>
<PARA> It is not as if the book industry and publishers have been without assistance in this country. They have had that in some respects since the introduction of the Berne convention in 1886, since 1952 with Australia's accession to the Universal Copyright Convention and since the 1912 Copyright Act which was modelled on the 1911 UK Copyright Act. In 1968 following the report of the Spicer committee we eliminated parallel importing which had operated up until that date in order to give some protection to Australian booksellers. In 1977 as a result of the Time-Life case taken against Angus and Robertson, they were prevented from importing books under the parallel importing system which the Spicer committee had outlawed to protect the local industry. In 1969 the Bounty (Books) Act was introduced. It provided a bounty assistance to local publishers which, although it has been declining over recent years, is still nevertheless a significant bounty. That bounty aids local manufacturers, particularly at a time when the value of the Australian dollar is falling. The Act also has additional clauses that help the book industry in Australia by the restrictions which are imposed under customs legislation about the importation of books which are obscene, indecent or blasphemous. Those books nevertheless can still be printed in Australia but cannot be imported to Australia because of the provisions of the Customs Act. </PARA>
<PARA> In 1971 after the report of the Trade Practices Tribunal retail price maintenance was abolished. In 1974 there was a major anti-trust case in the United States, where the United States Department of Justice filed suit against 21 American publishing companies because of the carve-up of the world between the United States and the British Commonwealth. As a result of that in May 1976 there was an out of court settlement which scrapped the traditional markets agreement, as it was called, and opened up the United States to a great deal more competition. As I said, the Bounty (Books) Act is not insignificant. For example, in this last year $25m of public money went to support the Bounty (Books) Act. The bounty paid on printing of books in Australia has been substantial-$17.4m in 1984-85; $18.8m in 1985-86; $18.4m in 1986-87; $20.7m in 1987-88 and, as I said, $25.5m in the last year-representing throughout those years a percentage of our total bounty and subsidy payment rising from 6.59 per cent in 1984-85 to well over 8 per cent in this last year. </PARA>
<PARA> The economics of the book industry are something we could take another couple of days to discuss. I want to say to the Minister-I am grateful to Senator Bolkus for coming into the chamber and listening to my contribution this evening-that we believe there are two steps to be taken in this particular matter. The first is to proceed straight away with the enactment of the Sheppard recommendations to bring about a situation of parallel importing. The second is to encourage the Prices Surveillance Authority to move from its interim report through the process of coming to its final report. We will not pre-empt what the PSA has to say in its final report. But I make it clear on behalf of the Opposition that we think that the PSA is moving in the correct direction. We believe that it is proper to wait until the PSA brings down its final report and then to consider a position based on that: nevertheless the PSA is moving in the correct direction. </PARA>
<PARA> The removal of the barriers to the importation of books to Australia so that the Australian consumer gets the book at the cheapest possible price in the edition that he or she chooses to buy and in the minimum period of time is the correct way to move. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Recently I, along with, I assume, all my colleagues, received a roneoed bulk mail-out from one Barbara McGregor, the publisher of a magazine called Australian Well-being. I freely admit that I do not give as much attention to a roneoed bulk mail-out as I do to personalised letters which someone has bothered to write to me and sign. Ms McGregor has a very good point to make. She drew to the attention of everyone to whom she sent her little package a change in Australia Post's regulations with respect to subscription discounts for publications produced in Australia. Apparently, Australia Post has now decided that, where the retail price of a publication exceeds $5 these discounts will no longer be available. Ms McGregor says that this is a stupid move and the case that she puts, I think, is quite a good one.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> She says that as a consequence of this, a monthly publication such as the Australian Women's Weekly-which is not at all intended to diminish the standing in the community of the Australian Women's Weekly-will continue to be posted to subscribers for around 45c per edition, whereas a bi-monthly publication such as hers, Australian Well-being, of a similar size and weight, will now cost the publisher somewhere between $1.65 and $2 each to post, depending on where the magazine is being sent, that is, a fourfold or fivefold increase. </PARA>
<PARA> I am told that the argument Australia Post put forward is that it is losing $20m a year on subscription postal handling. Australia Post cannot exactly identify where this money is lost. It is not really full bottle on its own argument. But, as Ms McGregor says, in this area an enormous amount of pre-sorting is already done. She makes the point that publications that sell for less than $5 are printed on cheaper paper, have a high advertising content and are generally disposable in the short to middle term, whereas material costing over $5 is generally on higher quality paper, has a higher editorial to advertising ratio and operates on far less a publishing margin than the mass media do. She asks the question: Can Australia Post really contend that Kerry Packer, for example, is less able to afford a higher rate of postage for subscription handling of the Australian Women's Weekly than she is, a small and unknown publisher?</PARA>
<PARA> Ms McGregor was kind enough to send everybody a copy of her magazine. It is quite different from the Australian Women's Weekly. It contains article on herbs and nutritional updates. If I want to read the advertisements I can, for example, select from a number of advertisements on flotation tanks, if I feel that I need some sort of relaxation. If I think I need some nutritional or colon therapy there are plenty of advertisements telling me where I can go to get that. </PARA>

<PARA> I have no self-interest in raising this matter. I am not a reader of Australian Well-being and, having had a quick look at it, am not sure that I will become one. But none of that detracts from the points that Ms McGregor makes. Why should Australia Post offer this discount to people who sell material for less than $5 and not to people who want to sell it for more than $5? It seems a totally irrational and typically bureaucratic decision. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="7E4">Senator VANSTONE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As Senator Puplick says, and the point is made by plenty of people upset by this, it will destroy a lot of the small cultural magazines that necessarily, because of their small size, have an expensive price on their magazines. Worse still, sometimes we can wear irrational and bureaucratic decisions if we have had a hand in fighting the battle, but in this particular case the proposal was apparently announced totally without consultation and at very short notice, without any attempt to phase it in over an extended period. This, of course, means that publications that have worked very hard at getting long-term subscriptions at an accepted subscription price just have to weather the loss of income occasioned by higher expenses; namely, higher postal charges.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The further point is made that Australia Post says that it cannot continue to subsidise these sorts of magazines. That may be the case. Perhaps Australia Post does want to look at the rules and regulations that govern registered postal discounts. But it is my suggestion that if it wants to look at that it should do so with some sense and not just draw some $5 cut-off point and leave it at that and have the quality magazines, those that are trying to do a good job, pay more. This cut-off point would in fact give a discount to the cheaper publications. It just does not seem sensible. </PARA>
<PARA> Apart from it not seeming sensible because it has no rhyme or reason to it in the first place, it is not sensible for another reason. The publications that are printed in Australia-and this magazine is a quality printing job; we could not call it a second-rate job-will have to look at how they are going to cut their costs if they want to keep going. One way they can cut their costs is to send their printing offshore. They would make significant costs reductions, perhaps enough to make up for the increased Australia Post charges. But where will that leave us? Australian printers will be out of jobs. Why? Because Australia Post thinks that someone selling something for over $5 should be able to pay a higher postal charge than someone who is selling for less than $5. </PARA>
<PARA> The idiocy of this is that some of the magazines that will continue to get this discount are high volume magazines. It is not as if there is any real benefit to Australia Post, as if there is any saving in higher volumes. Subscription magazines still have to be put in each letterbox. If a magazine is subscribed to by 16 million people, is that 16 million times a postman has to put that magazine in a letterbox. There is no way of reducing the cost of doing that. It is not as if there is a saving in that respect. So I think Ms McGregor has probably made some very good points. </PARA>
<PARA> I understand that one of the Australian Democrats, Senator Sanders, has raised this matter and put some questions on notice. I am informed by my colleague Senator Reid that an answer has been produced, but I have not had the opportunity to see it. Without wishing to appear an intellectual pig, I am reasonably satisfied that the answer will not answer these questions. It cannot. The case is so good for not drawing a line on the basis simply of the price of a magazine that I am at a loss to imagine what the answer will be. I look forward to leaving the chamber and looking at that answer. I give the Minister at the table, Senator Bolkus, an undertaking-and not lightly-that if the answer is a good one I will come back on Monday and withdraw everything I have said. But I am quite sure it will not be. I invite the Minister to address the attention of his colleague Mr Willis to this matter and to the answer that has been given. If it is, as I suspect, a glib cover-up of a hopeless and inefficient bureaucratic decision that he will give a return undertaking to have something done about it so that the producers of quality magazines such as Australian Well-being first of all do not suffer higher costs as a consequence of a stupid decision but also, secondly, do not take their printing offshore and so cause Australian jobs to be lost as a consequence. </PARA>

He also has a very keen interest in ensuring that subsidies are not given in an indirect way. Maybe what Australia Post is trying to do-I take the point that $5 seems to be an arbitrary figure; and I am not a long-time defender of Australia Post-is rationalise its community service operations. The rationale behind its decision may be to assist the least expensive magazines. I am sure, as she said, that Senator Sanders has had a reply. I am also sure that she will get a free annual subscription to Australian Well-being.

<PARA> I was very pleased to hear the comments made by Senator Puplick. I think it has taken 99 months for us to come to some agreement across the chamber. I am pleased to see that Senator Puplick has taken a certain position on the whole question of the book trade in Australia. I asked the Prices Surveillance Authority (PSA) to inquire into the price of books in this country. This was stimulated by my own concern about the way in which the book trade is run, the articles that Senator Puplick mentioned by Robert Haupt and the Sheppard report-the Copyright Law Review Committee report-which also made mention of the need for an economically based inquiry into the area. </PARA>
<PARA> I agree with Senator Puplick that the PSA has done a marvellous, if not sterling, job in this instance. I think Senator Puplick mentioned Professor Allan Fels. We should also recognise the work done by David Cousins, Len Hatch and also Stan Honey who have produced the report. Basically they found that what we read in Australia, when we read it and how much we pay for it is dictated by British publishers who have no real recognition of the demands of the marketplace in this country and, in fact, the demands of the consuming public in this country. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Puplick cited some books that he has had problems with. During the course of this inquiry a couple of books came to my notice that I thought were handled by the publishers in a most outrageous way. One example of this is a book written about Michael Dukakis and the Unites States presidential campaign. That book was quite relevant and timely where it was published in the United States. But from what I have been told, it seems that this book has been published in Australia in the last month or so. It is quite irrelevant to the Australian scene. As people in the United States are asking, `Where is Dukakis now?'. One wonders what people in Australia are saying about Michael Dukakis and his relevance to world politics. </PARA>
<PARA> I have been trying for some time to get a book called Love in the Time of Cholera by Gabriel Garcia Marquez. The book was published internationally probably 18 months or two years ago and was written by a Nobel Prize winning author. It was in the book stores of Australia in hard cover at the end of last year, but was released in paperback only in the last three weeks. I think that for the book publishing industry to be under scrutiny publicly and at the same time to deny the Australian public access to a book such as this by an internationally acclaimed author is totally outrageous. Such an attitude totally disregards the considerations and sensitivities not only of government, but also of book readers. I do not think there is any doubt that the Sheppard review and the PSA review have demonstrated the need for change, the need for law reform in this area. It has been demonstrated very strongly. There is no doubt that the book-reading public are the ones who will benefit from that particular change. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not accept, as Senator Puplick does not, the arguments of very few Australian authors who have gained some prominence in recent days. I am quite sceptical also of the interwoven nature of the Australian book publishers coming out in support of some protection for the British copyright holders. It is curious to see what sort of interwoven relationships there are between those publishers and those in the United Kingdom, but also when we remove the corporate shield the sort of interwoven relationship there is between the British publishers and those in the United States who will have access to Australian markets, given some law reform in this area. I am pleased to see that Senator Puplick mentioned that he is committed to the PSA attitude in this area. I am and, as I said earlier, I have no doubt that the Government recognises there is a need for change and that the aspirations of quite a number of people for reform in this area will be met in the very near future. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Defence Science and Personnel has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Australian Taxation Office responded to Defence on 27 June 1989 advising that it was unable to relax the substantiation rules as requested, nor could it grant a general remission from tax penalties. However, ATO branches were to be advised to take the change in circumstances into account in cases where ADF members were requested to substantiate UMA expenditure. Further, penalties would not be imposed where members had not included UMA in tax returns and not claimed a deduction; or where any deduction claimed did not exceed the amount of UMA included in the return. Full substantiation rules were to apply from 1 July 1989.</PARA>
<PARA> The response was received too late for inclusion in the 1989 ADF Income Tax Guide which was released on 19 June 1989 to enable the Guide to be published in July editions of the Services' newspapers.</PARA>
<PARA> The information contained in the Australian Taxation Office response was circulated to the Services on 3 July 1989.</PARA>
