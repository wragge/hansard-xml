<TITLE>Privacy Legislation</TITLE>
<PARA>To the Honourable the President and members of the Senate assembled.</PARA>
<PARA> The petition of certain citizens of Australia draws attention to the Senate of their concern regarding proposed changes to the laws governing credit reporting as suggested in the Bill `The Privacy Amendment Bill 1989'.</PARA>
<PARA> The proposed reforms will:</PARA>
<PARA> Restrict the legitimate use of credit checking by business who sell/supply goods and/or services to their customers on credit terms.</PARA>
<PARA> The proposals/reforms will prevent businesses from determining the solvency of their customers and will increase the financial risk of credit providers, leading to an increase in company liquidations and individual bankruptcies.</PARA>
<PARA> Additional costs to business from bad debts due to the lack of adequate credit checking information will result in increased prices/charges and will result in credit providers refusing credit facilities.</PARA>
<PARA> Your petitioners therefore pray that the Senate will call on the Government to refer these proposals restricting credit checking to a Senate Standing Committee for further consideration before proceeding with the matter.</PARA>

<PARA>Mrs Margaret Reid</PARA>

<PARA>Parliament House</PARA>
<PARA>CANBERRA ACT</PARA>
<PARA>Dear Mrs Reid,</PARA>
<PARA> El Salvador, our country, has been living for many years in a bloody conflict known throughout the world. This has been aggravated till the extreme of making our own Capital, San Salvador, a battlefield.</PARA>
<PARA> We Salvadorians living in Canberra fear for the personal safety of our country men/women in El Salvador, and have felt obliged, due to the continuing tragic situation they are facing, to raise our voice to the Australian Government Authorities in favour of them.</PARA>
<PARA>1. PRIORITY MIGRATION PROGRAMS</PARA>
<PARA> We would like to ask the Australian Government to use the Contingency Plan that is available, for the processing of application of prospective families in need of abandoning the country, as well as the Migration Program to Australia to be given priority to applicants seeking permanent residence in this warm country.</PARA>
<PARA>2. BASIC HUMANITARIAN HELP</PARA>
<PARA> The shortage of essential medicine and blood supplies make it necessary-given the worsening of the Salvadorian conflict with a high number of casualties-to excite the humanitarian spirit of civilized governments and countries, to provide these basic elements. Humanitarian help could be extended to other needs-resultant as a consequence of the conflict-with the suggestion that this distribution be made through Institutions or Organisations of international character.</PARA>
<PARA>3. NEED FOR OFFICIAL APPROVAL</PARA>
<PARA> As a consequence of the above mentioned we request the Australian Government to step into the negotiation for the cessation of hostilities and a peaceful solution to the Salvadorian conflict, in respect to which there are documents and willpower, but the official voice of democratic governments, like Australia, will always be necessary, with the aim of reaching the most awaited peace for all Salvadorians.</PARA>
<PARA>4. INTERVIEW PETITION</PARA>
<PARA> Finally, we would like to ask, with all respect, that an interview be given as soon as possible, due to the urgency of the matter, to some of the undersigned, to expose the tragic situation of our country.</PARA>
<PARA> We can be contacted by written correspondence to:</PARA>
<PARA> Canberra Salvadorian Residents (in formation),</PARA>
<PARA> PO Box 496,</PARA>
<PARA> BELCONNEN ACT 2616</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-At the request of Senator Walters, I present to the Senate the following petitioning letter from 12 signatories:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Dear Mrs Shirley Walters</PARA>
<PARA> As children are unfortunately exploited and treated unjustly in some countries, I can understand why the Convention for the Rights of the Child is necessary. However, I am concerned by certain aspects of this legislation. Firstly, it allows forces outside of our country to influence and control our policy. Secondly, it gives the potential to an unscrupulous government to remove freedoms, break up families and subjugate society. For example, Articles 2 and 19 could be used to deny parents the right to communicate their belief and value system to their children, and discipline them. Article 3 although acknowledging the rights of parents, does not say that these need to be honoured and so could be used to veto the wishes and authority of parents. Article 14 although it gives the right of freedom of religion, also subtly takes this away by saying that it can be limited by law, and so gives the potential for religious persecution. Finally, Article 13 gives children the freedom of choice, but because of their ignorance and inexperience, they usually do not know what their best interests are. Consequently, far from being helpful, without amendments, this Convention could lead to greater exploitation, and the break down of the family unit as we know it now.</PARA>
<PARA> I hope that you will do all in your power to protect and ensure the continuation of our political, parental and religious freedoms.</PARA>
<PARA>Yours sincerely,</PARA>

The Liberal and National parties have examined very closely the issues surrounding this regulation and I would like to explain very briefly the reasoning behind the notice that Senator Vanstone has given on our behalf today.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The coalition strongly supports the community rating principle as it applies to private health insurance. Community rating fairly spreads the risk between insurers and serves to maintain contribution rates at reasonable levels for consumers. Our own health insurance arrangements, which we will apply after our election to government, will be community rated. We also support the right and freedom of individuals to purchase other insurance packages of their choice and for insurance companies to offer competitively a range of insurance policies. The problem arises, as it has in this case, where another type of insurance policy impacts or has the potential to impact adversely on community rated health insurance. We have carefully studied a range of personal accident, disease and sickness policies and, while the vast majority of them conform to the 1986 administrative guidelines issued by the Department, we are forced to conclude that a recent package marketed by one of Australia's large banks could-I stress, could-lead consumers to think that they are purchasing health insurance when in fact they are not. </PARA>
<PARA> If we were in government we would not have dealt with this matter by way of regulation, preferring instead to enforce stricter compliance with the 1986 administrative guidelines. We would seek to encourage greater industry self-regulation and to investigate a greater monitoring role for the Insurance and Superannuation Commission. On all of these matters we would have consulted with the insurance industry and interested parties. Further, if we were in government, the fundamental conflict over the principle of community rating would not have arisen. Our health insurance arrangements will ensure that all Australians and their families have comprehensive medical and hospital insurance at a basic minimum level. If people also wish to purchase other personal accident, disease or sickness policies, that is well and good, but there will be no opportunity for these types of policies to be substituted for or misconstrued as health insurance. The cold reality, however, is that the Liberal and National parties are not yet in government. We are not able to introduce our health insurance policy, nor are we able to manage the current controversy in the preferred way outlined as the Australian Democrats have indicated their likely support for the Government on this issue. In government, once our community rated health insurance arrangements are firmly in place, we will repeal this regulation and once again allow the personal accident, sickness and disease policies, which are proscribed, to be properly marketed and sold. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-It is usual at the end of each session for the Chairman of the Senate Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances to seek leave to make a short statement relating to the work of the Committee during that session. Perhaps the most noticeable characteristic of the bipartisan technical legislative scrutiny of the Committee during these sittings has been the large volume of instruments which came before it for examination. The Committee scrutinised 708 instruments made by the Executive and other law makers under delegation from Acts of Parliament. Each of these instruments was considered by the Committee in light of its principles, or terms of reference, which are to scrutinise delegated legislation for breaches of personal rights or parliamentary proprieties. The Committee noted that 77 of these instruments, or somewhat more than one in ten, were at least prima facie deficient in respect of one or more of its principles. These matters were raised by the Committee with the Minister or statutory authority responsible for the delegated legislation, with a request for an explanation. The Committee reports that the replies of the Ministers have in every case satisfied its concerns, often by undertakings to amend the instrument in question or to take appropriate administrative action. In other cases the Minister has supplied additional information and documentation to assist the Committee in its deliberations. The Committee expresses its appreciation of the cooperation it has received from Ministers in its operations.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Committee has experienced some continuing difficulties in its bipartisan scrutiny. Some of these are delay by departmental officers in preparing replies to Committee correspondence and a lack of appreciation of the standards the Committee expects in the drafting, presentation and content of delegated legislation. These standards are detailed in the various reports of the Committee, and in the statements made to the Senate of the Committee's examination of each of the many instruments in respect of which it feels obliged to give a protective notice of disallowance. These statements outline the concerns of the Committee and include copies of Committee correspondence with Ministers. It is expected that departments and statutory authorities should be familiar with these principles and ensure compliance with them. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee thanks its legal adviser, Emeritus Professor Douglas Whalan, for his usual assistance. Professor Whalan not only reads through each item of delegated legislation and highlights what may be deficiencies, but also attends meetings of the Committee where his expertise may be needed and prepares scholarly papers on various aspects of the work of the Committee. Finally, members of the Committee thank their colleagues in the Senate for their commitment to the parliamentary ideals and practices of the Committee, whose effective operation is ensured by the knowledge of their continuing support. I seek leave to incorporate in Hansard the usual statement relating to the work of the Committee during the present sittings. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The document read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA>SENATE STANDING COMMITTEE ON REGULATIONS AND ORDINANCES STATEMENT OF WORK OF COMMITTEE DURING BUDGET SITTINGS 1989</PARA>
<PARA>The work of the Committee over the past sittings has been characterised by the continuing large numbers of instruments of delegated legislation which have come before the Committee for scrutiny. </PARA>
<PARA> The volume and variety of these instruments illustrates the central position of delegated legislation in the administration of programs by the Executive. It is clear that these programs are able to operate only through the capacity of the Executive to make laws to fill out details and make frequent changes, often technical in nature, to administrative requirements and procedures. These Executive laws, of course, may be made only through the direct and express authority and permission of the Parliament expressed in a parent Act which confers such power. </PARA>
<PARA> Such delegated legislation, however, is not made by the Executive without supervision or control by the Parliament. The Committee acts on behalf of the Senate to scrutinise each of these instruments to ensure compliance with its principles of personal rights and parliamentary propriety. The results of the Committee's scrutiny will be discussed in detail later in this statement, but in the meantime honourable senators are reminded that these principles were adopted with the concurrence of the Senate. Each of the instruments scrutinised by the Committee is subject to the direct sanction of the Senate through the requirements of tabling and possible disallowance. There is thus not only a structural link between each parent or enabling Act and every instrument of delegated legislation made under its authority but a practical supervision of its making and contents. The Committee acts on behalf of the Senate not as a delegate vested with formal power, as power to disallow remains with the Senate itself, but to warn and alert the Senate to possible action that it may wish to take. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee deals with Ministers and others who make delegated legislation with the knowledge that it has received the full support of the Senate for every recommendation it has made. Ministers and administrators are also aware of this and it is therefore usually possible to resolve the concerns of the Committee without reference to the Senate itself. Nevertheless the sanction is always present to concentrate the minds of those with whom the Committee raises its concerns. </PARA>
<PARA> The attention of Honourable Senators is drawn to the following Table, which sets out the various instruments of delegated legislation which came before the Committee for scrutiny during these sittings. The number of different types of delegated legislation is remarkable. Even the present list has been abbreviated for convenience. The Ordinances of all of the external territories, for example, appear under only one heading. The education assistance determinations are made under different provisions of a number of parent Acts as are the health legislation instruments, none of which have a satisfactory system of numbering or citation. Delegated legislation in the list is made under the authority of parent Acts administered through almost every department of state and statutory authority. The Statutory Rules series, by itself, represents legislation made on advice from virtually every portfolio. The list includes only those instruments actually considered by the Committee. Some instruments made late in the sittings will not come before the Committee until next year. </PARA>

<PARA>708</PARA>
<PARA> The Committee considers each instrument of delegated legislation which comes before it in the light of the four principles which form what may conveniently be called its terms of reference. Each instrument which does not comply with these principles is discussed by the Committee and a letter is written by the Chairman to the Minister responsible for the delegated legislation with a request for an explanation of the apparent breach. </PARA>
<PARA> During the present sittings the Committee detected at least prima facie defects in 77 out of the 708 instruments which came before it. These defects are now discussed under each of the four principles. </PARA>
<PARA> (a) Is the delegated legislation in accordance with the statute?</PARA>
<PARA> This first principle directly concerns parliamentary propriety and is therefore an area where the Committee is particularly vigilant to ensure that this propriety is protected. The Committee's concerns here relate not only to whether a particular instrument of delegated legislation is within the powers granted to the executive by the provisions of the parent Act, but whether all legal, procedural and other formalities are correct. The Committee expressed concern about the following aspects of different instruments. </PARA>
<PARA> Several instruments were so deficient in presentation that it was not possible to determine whether they had actually been made. The Committee asked for confirmation that this fundamental requirement had been satisfied. In another case the Committee was furnished with an unsigned instrument. </PARA>
<PARA> Other instruments were deficient in citation references to parent Acts, to other Acts and to other delegated legislation. One determination had different references in its heading and its enacting words to the enabling provision of its parent Act. As the reference in the heading was incorrect and the reference in the body of the instrument itself was correct, the instrument was valid in this case. The Committee is careful to check references in delegated legislation to enabling provisions. While an incorrect reference may not be fatal to the validity of the instrument the Committee regards these as a breach of parliamentary propriety. In a similar case the Explanatory Memorandum cited both the parent Act and the principal regulations incorrectly. In another case two separate but related Statutory Rules each referred twice in their Explanatory Statement to a particular Act, once correctly and once incorrectly. </PARA>
<PARA> The Explanatory Statement for a fresh set of regulations made to repeat the substance of previous regulations consequent upon the repeal and replacement of an Act cited those previous regulations incorrectly. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee scrutinised two determinations incorrectly numbered by reference to the number of an earlier instrument. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee expects care in the production of instruments and the Explanatory Statements which the Committee insists should accompany them. Anything less is a breach of parliamentary propriety. The Committee normally does not write to Ministers about minor typographical errors, unless it has other concerns with the instrument, but it does raise more obvious errors. Thus the Committee wrote to the Minister about an Explanatory Statement which twice referred to ``Torres Straight Islanders''. Another Explanatory Statement referred to Parts of the parent Act by reference to arabic instead of roman numerals and omitted several Parts. This was raised by the Committee in the context of other concerns with the Explanatory Statement. The Committee did not expressly write to the Minister, however, even where the same misprint appeared 14 times in six pages. </PARA>
<PARA> Incorporation in instruments of material ``as amended from time to time'' presents problems of validity. Under s. 49a (1) of the Acts Interpretation Act 1901 this drafting technique is generally only valid when regulations (defined as regulations or rules under an Act) incorporate the provisions of other regulations. There were several instances where the Committee questioned instruments which purported to effect such incorporation. The Committee is concerned not merely that an instrument should be valid under its parent Act, but also that it is valid under every other Act. </PARA>
<PARA> A parent Act or other Act may require special conditions to be met before delegated legislation can be validly made. The Committee questioned several instruments in which this requirement was not merely not recited in the enacting words of the instrument itself, but was not mentioned in the Explanatory Statement. Such recital may not affect validity but its lack in appropriate cases is regarded as a breach of parliamentary propriety. </PARA>
<PARA> One instrument was questioned by the Committee for possible invalidity due to uncertainty. The instrument required certain public officials to act in accordance with ``policies of the Commonwealth''. It is a breach of the first principle of the Committee, as well as its second principle, if the provisions of an instrument are so uncertain as to make compliance difficult. </PARA>
<PARA> The Acts Interpretation Act 1901 provides that regulations, defined broadly to include most disallowable instruments, may not operate retrospectively where such operation would prejudice the rights or impose liabilities on any person other than the Commonwealth. The Committee has questioned a number of instruments on this ground, including two where possible prejudicial retrospectivity of one day was involved. </PARA>
<PARA> In another case the heading of an instrument advised a purpose for an instrument which appeared unrelated to its substance. The Committee normally questions such cases of apparent internal inconsistency. </PARA>
<PARA> One instrument purported to substitute some of its provisions ``in lieu of'' earlier provisions. The Committee raised the question whether this was intended to repeal the earlier provisions. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee also wrote to the Minister where loose-leaf amendment pages did not appear to follow on from each other. </PARA>
<PARA> (b) Does the delegated legislation trespass unduly on personal rights and liberties?</PARA>
<PARA> This is another area where the Committee is particularly vigilant. The Committee raised concerns about instruments which might offend against its second principle for the following reasons. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee questioned a provision that effectively prevented a person from challenging earlier evidence which may be used against that person in later proceedings. The Committee believes that delegated legislation should not deprive a person of the fundamental right to test evidence which may be adduced in proceedings to which they are a party. </PARA>
<PARA> One instrument appeared to permit the Australian Federal Police to release details of convictions and reports of various investigations, some involving criminal offences, without any safeguards relating to the privacy of individuals concerned. The Committee considers that the right to privacy from inappropriate intrusions through executive law-making is a fundamental liberty. Similarly, another instrument seemed to allow Telecom to release personal details of its millions of subscribers without adequate safeguards. </PARA>
<PARA> Another basic personal liberty is protection from entry by public officials onto private or business premises without proper authorisation. Delegated legislation may provide for entry onto premises by inspectors or other similar officials in the course of administering a program or scheme. The Committee in such cases, however, insists that the warrant or other authority is drafted so that maximum protection is given appropriate to the circumstances. Thus the Committee questioned a provision that a search warrant ``may'' be in a particular prescribed form, rather than ``shall'' be in that form. Warrants should also preferably be issued by judges or at least stipendiary magistrates, rather than by justices of the peace; and entry should be restricted to ``reasonable'' times between particular dates. </PARA>
<PARA> A conviction for an offence is a serious matter and the Committee ensures personal rights are protected in relation to offence procedures. Thus the Committee questioned a provision under which a fine for breach of a provision could be paid by post, as an alternative to attending court where a higher fine could be imposed. The Committee was concerned that the notice sent out to offenders did not point out that payment by post would not only discharge liability but that no offence would be recorded as having been committed. </PARA>
<PARA> Delegated legislation may also authorise officials to give directions to individuals or to require production of documents. In several cases the Committee was concerned that these be limited to reasonable directions or requirements. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee was concerned at two instruments which provided for strict liability offences. The Committee always questions such provisions and accepts justifications for them only in the most exceptional circumstances. </PARA>
<PARA> Another area of immediate concern to the Committee is the right to practise a livelihood. A possible abrupt curtailment of existing rights to enter into certain types of contract affecting this right was questioned by the Committee. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee noted four instruments where forms which previously had been prescribed and which were thereby subject to tabling and disallowance were removed from the scrutiny of Parliament. In such cases the Committee is concerned that the new forms should as far as possible be approved by the Minister rather than by a public official, that the power to delegate approval of the forms should be limited, and that the instrument itself should set criteria for the contents of the forms. The public has a right to expect that mandatory forms are either directly subject to the scrutiny of Parliament or are made under close limits which are themselves subject to scrutiny. Similarly the public has a right to expect that as many instruments as possible are not only subject to tabling and disallowance but are subject to the full requirements of the Statutory Rules Publication Act 1903, and this matter was raised with the Minister in respect of two instruments. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee believes that the public has a right to expect standards of drafting, presentation and access in delegation legislation which are no less than such standards applicable to Acts. This will be elaborated later in this statement. In respect of these aspects, the Committee noted that 20 Explanatory Statements were deficient sufficiently to warrant comment, some in respect of more than one instrument. In addition, five separate types of instrument had no numbering or citation. Some of the deficiencies in Explanatory Statements were failure to mention that an amendment was being made to implement an undertaking given by a Minister to the Committee, confusing or no advice for the reasons the instrument was made, including no reasons for fees which were doubled and for exemptions from fees, and a correct heading whose contents related to another instrument. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee was concerned in respect of seven instruments which either directly incorporated other documents or which referred to them in such a way that it was necessary to consult them to understand the instrument. The Committee's concerns in these cases are that the public have convenient access to the documents. </PARA>
<PARA> (c) Does the delegated legislation unduly make the rights and liberties of citizens dependent upon administrative decisions which are not subject to review of their merits by a judicial or other independent tribunal?</PARA>
<PARA> This principle is partly a corollary of the Committee's concern with personal rights and liberties. Delegated legislation scrutinised by the Committee may grant discretions to Ministers, public officials or others to make decisions which may have important personal or commercial effects upon individuals. The committee examines all such cases to decide whether it is appropriate that these discretions should be subject to external review of their merits by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. </PARA>
<PARA> During the present sittings the Committee raised concerns in respect of 21 instruments which granted discretions to the executive with no apparent right of review either on the face of the document or explained in the Explanatory Statement. </PARA>
<PARA> Some of these discretions were to exempt persons from the payment of fees or charges, others were to determine allowances, to deem standards to be satisfied and to remove names from a register. In some cases this discretion was vested in the Minister, in another with the Commissioner of the Australian Federal Police, with the secretary of the department, or with a statutory Council or statutory officer. </PARA>
<PARA> In some cases the Committee was satisfied by advice that a power was to exempt for a brief period only, for safety reasons. In another it was satisfied that the discretion related to the allocation of finite resources, in a situation which the Administrative Review Council had accepted was not appropriate for review. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee looked closely at several instruments which not only did not provide for external review, but which apparently permitted delegation of the exercise of the discretion. Where there was no right of review of a discretion the Committee expected to see detailed criteria to limit and control its exercise. Similarly, in several cases where a parent Act provided for external review the Committee considered that review of discretions should also be provided for delegated legislation made under that Act. The Committee wrote to Ministers during the sittings confirming its long-established attitude that internal review is acceptable only in exceptional circumstances. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, the Committee wrote to Ministers in respect of Explanatory Statements which did not advise that rights of review of discretions in the instrument were available elsewhere, either through the parent Act, another Act or the principal regulations. </PARA>
<PARA> (d) Does the delegated legislation contain matter more appropriate for parliamentary enactment?</PARA>
<PARA> This principle is the most subjective of the criteria in respect of which the Committee scrutinises delegated legislation. During the present sittings the Committee questioned several instruments on this ground. </PARA>
<PARA> The Sex Discrimination (Operation of Legislation) Regulations, Statutory Rules 1989 No. 200, prolonged the existence of certain legislation which would otherwise be in breach of the Sex Discrimination Act 1984 by a further 12-month period, to bring the total period of such exemptions, all effected by regulation, to six years. The Committee noted advice in the Explanatory Statement that the government will consider amendment of the parent Act and repeated its views, given on previous extensions of exemption by regulation, that legislation would be appropriate. The Committee suggested that an amending Bill should be introduced before the present regulations expired. </PARA>
<PARA> An analysis of the instruments scrutinised by the committee this sittings emphasises the continuing trend whereby only a minority of instruments are part of the Statutory rules series. As with the previous sittings less than a third of instruments are made as Statutory Rules, which include all of the protections and safeguards required by the Statutory Rules Publication Act 1903. A substantial majority of delegated legislation, therefore, is made without the discipline of these provisions and, although subject to tabling and possible disallowance in Parliament, lacks other requirements which are present in the Statutory Rules and which should be characteristic of any acceptable system of executive legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> Statutory rules mainly consist of Regulations by the Governor-General, although there are a few other categories, such as Rules of the various Commonwealth Courts, which are made by the judges of those Courts. The Statutory Rules provide a comprehensive, unified and definitive series of all such instruments made in the course of a calendar year. </PARA>
<PARA> The citation of each of these is clear, with a short, precise title and a numerical sequence. The preamble or enacting words recite the authority under which each instrument is made, citing the parent Act or Acts and any other relevant provisions such as section 4 of the Acts Interpretation Act 1901, under which regulations may be made even though the enabling provisions of the parent Act have not yet come into effect. The recital also expressly indicates that the Governor-General makes the regulations with the advice of the Federal Executive Council. If the parent Act imposes a condition on the making of regulations such as prior consultation with an industry group, then the existence of this condition is normally also recited. The Committee had written to the Attorney-General, the Hon. Lionel Bowen MP, on this aspect of the recitation. The Minister assured the committee that in all appropriate cases the Statutory Rules would expressly recite that such requirements had been satisfied. The Minister of State who sponsored the Regulations is also clearly indicated, with the date of making. </PARA>
<PARA> Other procedural formalities of the Statutory Rules are also included on each instrument. The date of notification in the Commonwealth of Australia Gazette is set out, as is the complete history of the Regulations in question, from the date of first making to the most recent amendment. </PARA>
<PARA> The body of each of the Statutory Rules is similarly well presented with a clear drafting style that emphasises the continuity and unity with the principal regulations of amending legislation. Printing and presentation of the Statutory Rules is of a high quality and is uniform in lay-out throughout the series. Each yearly series of Statutory Rules is bound in a permanent, hard copy volume. </PARA>
<PARA> The position of the Committee with respect to the drafting, presentation and access of delegated legislation is quite clear. This is that delegated legislation should not be inferior in any of these aspects to Acts of the Parliament itself. Delegated legislation is not legislation which is somehow lesser in status than an Act. If Parliament has expressly provided in a parent Act for legislative instruments to be made by the executive then the executive should ensure the same high quality of these instruments as the Parliament does for Acts. </PARA>
<PARA> From the point of view of the citizen, rights and duties granted or imposed by delegated legislation are no less than those granted or imposed by an Act of Parliament. Many instruments of delegated legislation, for example, provide for penalties of fines or imprisonment for breaches of offences created by those instruments. Other delegated legislation affects the ability of individuals to practise a livelihood or supervises important areas of economic activity. From the point of view of the Parliament, delegated legislation is made, and can only be made, by the express authority of an Act. The executive, when making delegated legislation, is acting as a surrogate of the Parliament. Delegated legislation which is any way inferior to Acts is a reflection upon Parliament itself. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee is pleased to report that the Statutory Rules series generally satisfies what it believes should be proper standards of drafting, presentation and access. It is unfortunate, therefore, that this series is now less than a third of the instruments of delegated legislation coming before the Committee. The position with respect to other instruments is far less satisfactory. </PARA>
<PARA> The many defects of delegated legislation apart from the Statutory Rules may be briefly described. A noticeable characteristic here is the great variation in quality. Some instruments, such as the different territorial ordinances and regulations, are in some ways equal to the Statutory Rules. Others can only be classed as poor in all respects. Such delegated legislation may be categorised as in no way comparable in presentational aspects to an Act of Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> The worst instruments which come before the Committee have no numbering or citation at all, no heading or title apart from a lengthy and complex preamble and poor paper quality. The drafting of their provisions do not indicate whether the instrument is intended to stand alone, to amend another earlier instrument or to repeal other instruments which appear to deal with similar matters. Consolidations or reprints are not produced and ADP aspects are not addressed. Such defects would be bad enough in one series of delegated legislation. The difficulties increase, however, when there is a multiplicity of these inferior series of delegated legislation dispersed throughout the various departments of state, government business enterprises and statutory authorities. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee is always concerned where there are particularly long delays in replies to correspondence or in the implementation of undertakings given by Ministers to the Committee to amend delegated legislation to meet its concerns. One option here, foreshadowed previously by the Committee, is to invite the responsible officials to appear before the Committee to explain the reasons for the delay. During this sittings the Committee invited two Ministers to nominate appropriately senior members of their departments to discuss long delays in dealing with Committee initiatives. </PARA>
<PARA> In one case departmental officers had not prepared a reply for the consideration of the Minister more than six months after an inquiry from the Committee. This case raised particularly important questions of personal liberties which the Committee acknowledged would require careful consideration and possibly liaison with other departments. In its letter to the Minister inviting the nomination of senior officials to meet with it in Parliament House, however, the Committee pointed out that correspondence from the Committee should be dealt with in departments with a priority that reflects the importance of a communication from a committee of the Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> In the event departmental officers did not meet the Committee in this case. Following receipt of the invitation from the Committee a departmental officer contacted the Chairman, apologised for the delay and asked to be excused attendance if a reply was provided at once. The Chairman agreed to this, subject to the agreement of the other members. </PARA>
<PARA> The other case involved delay in implementing undertakings given by the Minister to the Committee to amend provisions of delegated legislation seen as defective by the Committee. There were two undertakings here, both given on 18 February 1988. The first related to the provision of photographic identity cards for persons authorised to enter upon private premises. The second involved a right of review of the merits of a decision of the Minister that a person possessed sufficient qualifications to practise an occupation under the terms of the delegated legislation in question. After a number of reminder letters the Committee was advised on 8 June 1989 that in respect of one of the matters that the department was still giving consideration to the issues, and in respect of the other the concept had proved not to be as simple as originally thought. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee wrote to the Minister indicating that it was concerned that the department had been working on these matters for a year and a half with no apparent resolution. The Committee invited the Minister to nominate senior officials to brief it on the work done by the department on these matters. Four officials, two from the department and two from a portfolio statutory authority, then met with the Committee in Parliament House. It is believed that this was the first time the Committee had invited departmental officials to explain delays in implementing Ministerial undertakings. </PARA>
<PARA> It has been, of course, a continuing characteristic of the Committee over the almost 58 years of its existence that the policy merits of delegated legislation are not raised. The provisions of a particular instrument may be subject to political controversy in the community and in the Senate but the Committee restricts its consideration to issues of technical, legislative scrutiny. This has also been one of the great strengths of the Committee, which, combined with its strictly bipartisan operation, has resulted in the trust and confidence which the Senate has always placed in the Committee. It is appropriate to point out here that the Senate has never failed to act on a recommendation of the Committee. There can be no higher tribute to the work of a committee. </PARA>
<PARA> A corollary of the confidence of the Senate itself is the equal trust of the Committee by Ministers. </PARA>
<PARA> There are, however, areas of policy where the Committee does raise concerns and requests advice and explanation from executive law makers. The policy of an instrument will always be questioned by the Committee if it infringes the Committee's principles relating to personal rights and parliamentary proprieties. The Committee does not accept that its concerns may be met by a reference to policy considerations without further elaboration. During the present Sittings, for example, one Minister wrote to the Committee in response to questions it had raised, that ``high government policy'' was the reason for an apparent deficiency in the instrument. This was, however, accompanied by additional details addressing the Committee's concerns. The Committee responded that it would not have been satisfied by the sole assertion of government policy. This will, of course, be a relevant factor for the Committee to take into account in its deliberations, but assertions of policy require separate and full justification. The alternative would reduce the effectiveness of the Committee. </PARA>
<PARA> The legal or legislative policy of an instrument is also examined by the Committee. Delegated legislation may be made only with the express authority of an Act of Parliament and the Senate is concerned that the high standards it expects and requires of Acts are followed by executive law-makers. In this context, the Committee's concerns with the Territory of Ashmore and Cartier Islands Interpretation Ordinance 1989 related solely to the legislative policy of that instrument. The Committee wrote to the Minister expressly in relation to considerations of legislative policy, seeking an explanation of the policy which led to the form of the Ordinance. The Minister for the Arts, Tourism and Territories, the Hon. Clyde Holding MP, replied to the Committee setting out in considerable detail the policy behind the Ordinance. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee does not operate in a vacuum, unrelated to other legislative scrutiny committees or to other administrative law bodies, although for decades the Committee was the only such body operating in this area in Australia. In recent years, however, with the establishment of the Scrutiny of Bills Committee by the Senate, with legislative scrutiny Committees in the States and Territories and with specialist Commonwealth, and in some cases State, administrative law bodies, there has developed a close network of these organisations which meet together to exchange views and discuss matters of common concern. </PARA>
<PARA> This network is not confined to Australia. The First Commonwealth Conference of Delegated Legislation Committees, held in Parliament House, Canberra, was an initiative of the Committee in 1980. The Committee also sent senior delegations to the Second Commonwealth Conference in Ottawa in 1983 and to the Third Commonwealth Conference in London, held in November this year. Honourable Senators will recall that on 7 December 1989 Senator Bishop, Deputy Chairman of the Committee, gave a personal report to the Senate on that Conference. Senator Bishop also indicated that the delegation will present a full report to the Senate, including a transcript of the proceedings of the Conference, when such proceedings become available. </PARA>
<PARA> Another example of the international nature of the network of delegated legislation committees is a request from the Chairman of the Regulations Review Committee of the House of Representatives of New Zealand for comments on a Statutory Publications Bill. Requests for comments were also sent to the State and Territory delegated legislation committees. The Committee replied with detailed comment on the Bill, adding that the approach from New Zealand was an encouraging example of the value of the network of members, advisers and staff of the various committees. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee was also approached by Professor Cheryl Saunders, President of the Administrative Review Council, for its views on the terms of reference of a Council project on rule making. The Administrative Review Council is a peak organisation established to provide advice to government on all aspects of administrative review, and is one of the most important constituents of the Commonwealth administrative law system. Professor Saunders indicated in her letter that the Council attached great importance to consultation with the Committee during the course of its project, and that the Council would also be grateful for the opportunity to draw on the expertise of the Committee. The Committee believes that the confidence shown in the Committee by an organisation with the reputation and position of the Administrative Review Council is not merely a tribute to the Committee, but also to the Senate itself, which has always given support to the Committee's operations. </PARA>
<PARA> At the conclusion of the last sittings the Committee reported how the responsibility for many of the ordinances, regulations and other instruments made in respect of the A.C.T. has passed to the new legislature and government of the territory. It also reported that the Chairman wrote to the Speaker of the Legislative Assembly for the ACT inviting a delegation of members from that legislature to meet with the Committee to discuss technical legislative scrutiny, and offering to assist the Legislative Assembly should it wish to establish a committee with similar functions. </PARA>
<PARA> The Legislative Assembly for the ACT accepted this invitation and sent a delegation to a meeting of the Committee to observe its operation and methods. The Committee remains willing to assist the territorial legislature. Many of the ordinances, which are now acts, which were transferred to the control of the territory, had been amended at the instigation of the Committee to safeguard personal rights or protect parliamentary propriety. Ministerial undertakings, not yet implemented when responsibility for the legislation in question passed to the territory legislature, had also been given to amend other provisions. Every mainland State and territory, with the exception of the very new ACT Legislative Assembly, has a legislative scrutiny committee which examines delegated legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> The Members of the Committee thank their colleagues in the Senate for their support of its bipartisan scrutiny of delegated legislation to protect personal liberties and parliamentary proprieties. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I table the explanatory memorandum and move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That this Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>The Australian Government recently looked at the legal position of companies incorporated abroad which do business in Australia, whether through a branch, local subsidiary or otherwise. One finding was that an Australian court may be called upon to make a decision on a dispute involving such companies by referring to foreign laws, and may well find itself in a situation where it has to choose between conflicting laws of two or more foreign jurisdictions. For example, the court may have to address such questions as the validity of the incorporation of a foreign company, the ownership of shares of such a company or, more generally, the rights and obligations of a foreign company. </PARA>
<PARA> 2. As a result of the examination, the Government concluded that in some circumstances there were no clear and predictable statutory rules which would overcome the uncertainties relating to claims of corporations of unrecognised states and governments. </PARA>
<PARA> 3. It is the policy of the Australian Government to encourage foreign investment which it judges to be in the national interest. The Government wishes to ensure that investors can make important decisions in the confidence that their legal rights in Australia will not be adversely affected by extraneous considerations such as the legal status of the territory in which their business is incorporated. </PARA>
<PARA> 4. The Australian legal system clearly meets this objective in most cases and obviously provides impartial legal services of high quality. However, it has become apparent that the traditional common law approach to the position of foreign corporations under Australian law may not, in some cases, adequately take account of the changes in the international trading system and foreign investment patterns in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> 5. Within Australia, there are now corporate entities from diverse political and legal systems and with various ownership arrangements. The sums involved in investment are often large and it is understandable that in such circumstances investors require certainty as to their legal status. In some countries, for example the United States, the courts have clarified the legal status of companies incorporated in unrecognised entities. However this is not the case in Australia and the approach an Australian court would take in dealing with a case involving the rights of foreign corporations from some parts of the world remains unclear. </PARA>
<PARA> 6. This Bill seeks to address these issues. It deals in general terms with the situation where an Australian court has to determine the legal rights of a foreign corporation by reference to foreign law. Thus, when the ordinary rules of private international law require that rights of a foreign company be determined by reference to a foreign law, the Bill will ensure that the law to be applied will be determined by the place of incorporation of the company, without regard to the political circumstances, questions of official recognition or otherwise of the government authorities there, or the legal status of the place of incorporation. </PARA>
<PARA> 7. The Bill's approach takes into account the Government's change in recognition policy announced by the then Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade on 19 January 1988. Under that policy, Australia no longer takes a position on the recognition or non-recognition of particular governments. Australia recognises states only. </PARA>
<PARA> 8. The government considers that it would now be appropriate to provide for protection of the legal rights of companies incorporated in unrecognised entities. Australian courts, when confronted with cases in which foreign relations questions are raised, traditionally have attached considerable importance to the attitude of the executive government. The Australian Government's view is that as a matter of public policy, the foreign relations considerations should not normally be the overriding factor in the determination of private legal rights, particularly those involving commercial transactions. The Government considers that Australia's public policy interests can be preserved on the one hand, while on the other hand normal commercial relations between private parties can be determined by reference, where relevant, to the law in fact in operation in the place of incorporation.</PARA>
<PARA> 9. There is no financial cost to the Commonwealth. I note however that passage of the Bill is likely to attract additional foreign investment into Australia. I present the explanatory memorandum to this Bill. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have a couple of questions to direct to the Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs (Senator Robert Ray) about clause 81. Clause 81 deals with a number of matters arising in relation to section 274 of the principal Act and relates primarily to the issue of the resolving of deadlocks, for example, in those odd cases-theoretical cases, almost-where there is an equality of votes. I cannot recall any situation where there has been an equality of votes at the end of a count. I think the closest I can recall was in New South Wales in, I think, the 1962 State election where in the seat of Lismore the thing was eventually decided by two votes. The Minister undoubtedly has some better recollection of precise circumstances where these things need to be addressed. Subclause (k), in relation to new subclause 274 (9), which appears on page 50 of the Bill says:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>If, on any count, 2 or more candidates have an equal number of votes and one of them has to be excluded, the Divisional Returning Officer shall decide which of them shall be excluded. </PARA>
<PARA>Can the Minister tell me by what method the returning officer is to decide which of them is to be excluded?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not know that it is specified, other than by reading other sections of the Act. I would think that it would be done by lot. Senator Puplick might leave that with me while I chase it up. This whole section came out of the Nunawading election in which 116,000 votes were cast and at the end of the day the vote was deadlocked. The returning officer decided to do a draw out of a ballot box to determine the winner. That drew criticism at the time because a lot of us thought that the whole exercise was pointless. When there is a drawn election there is no way a court of disputed returns will not find one vote missing and overturn it. One of the recommendations is that when there is equality of votes-in terms of the final two candidates-it will go straight to a court of disputed returns in any event, and save everyone a bit of money.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In relation to how candidates are eliminated, in my experience it has always been done by a draw from a ballot box. I may have to take that question on notice. At some stage that particular practice may need a more specific reference in the Act, and I think that it would be the will of the Parliament anyway. I suppose it could be taken in two ways. If we are talking about candidates getting primary votes and drawing having to be eliminated, I think that it would have to be done by lot. If we are talking about further down the count after some preferences have been distributed, I think that it should be the person who had the greatest number of primary votes. I will take that on board and pray that it will not happen at the next election. Even if it does, it may well be the ruling of the Electoral Commissioner-having listened to the debate between Senator Puplick and me today-that that will be the procedure. I am sure that it can be done by way of regulation, or a direction that that course be followed even if it is not covered or we cannot find it in the Act. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is precisely the point I wanted to make in the course of the debate. There have been essentially three ways in which deadlocks have been broken. One has been by simply drawing from a barrel. It is often a matter of curiosity, depending on which system one uses. For example, in my own political party, when it comes to preselections the name is drawn out of a hat and the person whose name is drawn out is the one who loses. Under our method of doing it, the person whose name remains in the hat is the successful candidate. But essentially there are three methods. It can be done by lot or by the casting vote of a prescribed divisional returning officer. Proposed subsection (13) provides that:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>The Divisional Returning Officer for a Division shall not vote in a House of Representatives election . . . </PARA>
<PARA>That mirrors part of the old subsection (9) of section 274. There is a direction which says that where there is equality of votes at a stage which is subsequent to the count of the first preference votes-in other words, where the tie has resulted after preferences have been allocated between candidates the candidate who is eliminated should be the candidate who received fewer primary votes. I think that, in fact, is a fair and proper way of going about things. I specifically asked the Minister about it because I think that if we have an equality of votes after the second, third, fourth, fifteenth distribution of preferences a prejudice should lie in favour of the candidate who polled the greater number of primary votes. I think it would perhaps have been better that the thing should have been specified in the legislation; if it is not it may well be that by direction and by regulation that rule can be put in place. It is our view that that is the proper way to go when the tie has resulted from a situation of counting the votes after the stage of counting purely the primary votes. I just wanted to put that on the record. </PARA>
<PARA> The second thing in relation to clause 81 is, in fact, that matter of the disqualification of the divisional returning officer from voting at any stage during the course of these counts. The current section 274 subsection (9) provides that the divisional returning officer shall have a casting vote. It provides that he shall not have a deliberate vote, but he shall have a casting vote. The section says, in part:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . and if, in the final count, 2 candidates have an equal number of votes, the Divisional Returning Officer shall decide by his casting vote which shall be elected, but, except as provided in this sub-section, he shall not vote at the election. </PARA>
<PARA>I just wanted to establish that it is the Government's intention in this legislation that, in fact, divisional returning officers around Australia will now, by this Act, in fact be precluded by statute from casting any vote, their own personal vote, at any stage in the determination of the outcome of a House of Representatives or a Senate election. I believe that is the consequence of passing this but I just want the Minister to confirm that, in fact, it is the intention of the Government by this new subsection (13) to provide that its own divisional returning officers are by statute disenfranchised. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Clause 81, proposed subsection (13), implies that only one type of divisional returning officer is disqualified; those who live in that particular division would be disqualified from voting. That is how I read that. My own experience is that, apart from in country areas-and that is something we might have to look at in the long term-very rarely do divisional returning officers live in their divisions. I have virtually never struck it; they always seem to live on the other side of the city and that is why we cannot get to the postal votes until 9.30 instead of 9.00, but that is another story. That is how I would read that-that they cannot vote in the division in which they live.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA> (1) Page 58, clause 93, at end of clause, add the following subclause:</PARA>
<PARA> ``(2) Section 297 of the Principal Act is amended by adding at the end the following subsection:</PARA>
<PARA> `(2) A payment under this Division is not to be made in respect of votes given in an election for a candidate or a group unless there is laid before each House of the Parliament, or if a House is not sitting, there is delivered to the Presiding Officer of that House, or in his or her absence, the Deputy Presiding Officer, for laying before that House on the next day of sitting, a statement by the Electoral Commissioner, in the prescribed form, that, in respect of the candidate or the group, the Electoral Commissioner is satisfied that there has been full disclosure of gifts for the purpose of section 304 of this Act.'.''. </PARA>
<PARA> (2) Page 60, paragraph 95 (fig. 1) (c), lines 30 and 31, leave out the paragraph, insert the following paragraph:</PARA>
<PARA> ``(c) by omitting subsections (5), (6), (7) and (8).''. </PARA>
<PARA> (3) Page 110, Schedule 2, leave out the proposed amendment to subparagraph 304 (5) (b) (i). </PARA>
<PARA>The aim of these amendments is to require that all donations made to political parties be made public. That has been our Party's policy since inception, and we believe that, following the implementation of half of that policy over the last couple of elections-that is, that donations provided to political parties for election purposes have been made public-there is a very strong reason now, in the light of quite a number of matters that have gone on, for all donations to be made public. Indeed, this particular idea received very strong support from the outgoing Electoral Commissioner, Dr Colin Hughes, when on his last day of office he made the statement that the necessity for full disclosure had been demonstrated in the Queensland Fitzgerald inquiry and in the hearings of the New South Wales Independent Commission Against Corruption. </PARA>
<PARA> The proposition for full disclosure, I think, has quite some considerable support. For example, in the lead-up to the Queensland State election the leader of the Confederation of Australian Industry, Mr Ash Forward-probably those who know him would hardly describe him as a radical-spoke about the importance of this particular issue. He said this:</PARA>
<PARA> I think the Fitzgerald inquiry showed that the National Party had clearly got donations for favours. </PARA>
<PARA>He said that all donations to political parties, including compulsory union levies which went to the Labor Party, should be identified by law, otherwise `it leads to all sorts of corruption and problems'. So I think there is a range of reasons as to why one would want to move to this next step. </PARA>
<PARA> The problems that we are facing I think are simply going to increase over time. In fact, the former senior counsel for the Fitzgerald inquiry, Mr Gary Crooke, QC, is quoted in the Age on 15 November as saying that governments should revise their methods of collecting political donations if they are serious about fighting corruption. He told the Fourth International Anti-Corruption Conference that the area of political donations was ripe for abuse, and it was too easy to camouflage donations that would result in corrupt influence. I quote from the paper he gave, when he said:</PARA>
<PARA> The very procedure of political donations does create a climate and a platform that, unless controlled, can be very much open to abuse. </PARA>
<PARA>In fact, there have been some recent current affairs programs-Four Corners is one that I would refer to-which can show how in fact political parties are able to move around the current disclosure provisions. So we have this climate operating, and I think that we have now seen in the electorate a very marked and very strong reaction to the exposure of political corruption in Queensland. It is not something that members of the community are willing to put up with. They want the game cleaned up and I think they want to be sure that those who are elected to office are elected in an honest and open contest. </PARA>
<PARA> The arguments we have had previously in this place about the ability to keep secret donations that go to political parties in some form or another have been convincingly lost within the community-and I think for a very good reason. The community is willing to override in this case what might be seen as a principle-that if one gives a donation to somebody or other, one should not have to tell anybody about it-for the specific reason that we are dealing with the fundamental structure of government and with something which is of vital interest to every member of the community. In doing so they want to have it out in the open, above board and without any strings attached to the exercises that go on. </PARA>
<PARA> The amendment, cast in the way that I have sought, would require that under this division a payment-that is, a public funding payment-would not be made until the Electoral Commissioner was satisfied that there had been a full disclosure of gifts. I have adopted this method because there are obvious problems in the way that political parties organise themselves in the States. For example, some quite strict laws have been introduced into the New South Wales Parliament. The New South Wales Parliament made laws with regard to the disclosure of donations. Those donations were sent to the Australian Capital Territory, which is outside the legislative jurisdiction of the New South Wales Parliament, and were then funnelled back in. I think that that demonstrates that there is a willingness on the part of political parties to avoid those types of pressures on them and to come clean about their political donations. </PARA>
<PARA> What I have sought to do is impose a penalty if there is not full disclosure of all donations made to political parties, and that includes moneys which circulate around at the State level, so that State political parties, or constituent bodies within political parties that are fighting Federal elections, cannot simply take out money and pop it into those accounts, thereby avoiding the normal Federal jurisdiction, and then funnel them back in in some other way. If the Commissioner is not satisfied that there has been a complete disclosure of gifts, a penalty will be imposed. The penalty can be quite high regarding public funding. But I do not believe that the community would wish to engage in the public funding of a political party that had not fully disclosed all the donations that it had received in any account. </PARA>
<PARA> Essentially, we are trying to avoid the brown paper bag syndrome set in place in Queensland, that disrupted so much of political and commercial life in that State for so long. I believe that one of the factors at the Federal level that has been really something of a grace-and probably one cannot find too many of them-is the absence of corruption at the Federal level, in fact, probably for the whole of Federation. However, that has to be under pressure simply because of the enormous amounts of money that are now necessary to run a modern political party and a modern campaign in our society. I think that we have an obligation to make it very clear and to be very open with the public about what goes on so that not only is justice done in this regard but also that it is seen to be done so that political parties running for office can say to the electorate that there is nothing hidden, there are no donations slipping around the back way, and that everything is up-front and out in the open. I think that in those circumstances the public will have much more confidence in the political process which I think all honourable senators wish would occur. For that reason I have moved the three amendments, which would require the disclosure of all gifts received by political parties and impose a penalty of not receiving public funding until such disclosures had been made. </PARA>

<PARA> Let me go to the basic issue. I believe, as Senator Macklin has said, that there can be problems with donations. That was one of the reasons I supported public funding: to try to relieve political parties of their reliance on private finance. Unfortunately, the cost of campaigning has well and truly outstripped any thought of that theory working. We have had problems. The Labor Party had problems with a donation from Harris-Daishowa (Australia) Ltd which resulted in one of our key members being fined $50 or something. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Let me draw the honourable senator's attention to his colleagues receiving $125,000 from Broken Hill Proprietary Co. Ltd before the last election. It has never been denied. No-one has jumped to his feet and said, `Hey, we did not get $125,000'. Where is it, Senator Stone? It has not been declared yet. Where is it?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> When those provisions were put into the Act in 1983 and 1984-and I suggest honourable senators read the Hansard-no-one said that they would cleanse the whole system. Senator Macklin and I are probably on record-I know that I am and I think Senator Macklin is too-as saying that they would have no more than moral sanction, would address the issue around the edges, but were not part of a comprehensive Act of Parliament to enforce total declaration. Nor did we ever say it would be totally effective-and nor has it been. It has been less effective than one would have wanted. We have page after page here which can be slipped through so easily. Imagine how easy it is going to be to slip through Senator Macklin's amendments, which do not come to more than about 40 sentences. We have always had that constitutional problem of forcing State branches, for State electoral purposes, to declare donations. What power do we have in relation to the declaration of donations towards municipal campaigns?</PARA>
<PARA> I just wonder how any party is going to get public funding under Senator Macklin's particular proposal. I mean, there are so many different unions! His Party might have only five or six branches in the State of Victoria that have to be audited-I do not know. We are not the biggest Party in history in Victoria, but we have 38 Federal accounts; 88 State accounts; several upper House accounts; 300 or 400 branch accounts-and on it goes. I believe that, after the next election, given the report on advertising et cetera, this whole issue is going to be addressed. I do not think it can be addressed two to six months out from an election. I do not think it can be addressed in the way Senator Macklin seeks to amend the Act, although I must acknowledge that the basic principle of the approach that he has taken-that is, donations do not have to be declared but, then again, one does not have to take any public funding-is the necessary lever. That is right in concept, I think; that is the only way we can do it. </PARA>
<PARA> I suggest to Senator Macklin that he would need a far more extensive amendment of the Act to make this effective, to do it two to six months out from an election. There would need to be other trade-offs, otherwise a lot more donations may dry up and, therefore, the ratio we determine between donations and public funding would no longer apply. There would be all these sorts of problems with these suggested amendments on disclosure. The Government cannot support them this time, but puts everyone on notice. Long term, in principle we agree with total disclosure and total auditing of political parties. That is our belief-into the open. We will get applauded by newspaper reporters and newspaper owners for that. I would like to see their books opened up, too, before they get too cheeky on this issue. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1"> -The best arguments to the proposition I was advancing were in the banter across the chamber between Senator Stone and Senator Ray. They were able, on their feet, to swap instances which had occurred in one another's parties, straight off the top of their heads. If they are able to do so, what does the public think about this matter? Obviously, the public is sick and tired of it and wants it cleaned up. I urge that we clean it up now, before the next election. The time to do it is now, when there is strong public support for this proposition. That has been demonstrated in the Queensland election in an overwhelming way.</PARA></TALK.START>

Millions of dollars are needed to finance an election.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Chairman, the Opposition opposes clause 96 and will be voting against it. This is a clause which further deals with some of these matters in relation to donations to political parties. As you would know, Mr Chairman, the next piece of legislation which we are to debate in this chamber once we have got past the Electoral and Referendum Amendment Bill is a Bill about privacy. This is a new section to go into the Act which, in fact, once again tramples upon the privacy of individuals who wish to participate in the political process. It provides that in relation to a gift certain things must be made public. It states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>. . . in the case of a gift made on behalf of the members of an unincorporated association-</PARA>
<PARA>we have to have supplied, in a public fashion-</PARA>
<PARA> (a) the name of the association; and</PARA>
<PARA> (b) the names and addresses of the members of the executive committee (however described) of the association;</PARA>
<PARA>Here, in fact, is an amendment to electoral law which says in relation to the disclosure of gifts that all of the names and addresses of the members of an executive committee, however described-in other words, whether it is an executive committee, a management committee, a board, whatever terminology is used-are to be made public. It is proposed that section 305 of the principal Act be amended by deleting the current paragraph 3 (b). The current paragraph 3 (b) of the existing Act states:</PARA>
<PARA>The reference to the relevant details, in relation to a gift, shall be read as a reference to the amount or value of the gift, the date on which the gift was made and the name and address of the person who made the gift. </PARA>
<PARA>The new provision goes beyond the question of the person who made the gift, who in many cases in relation to an incorporated association would be some sort of chief executive officer-a secretary, a treasurer or a president. He or she would be the person who made the gift. The gift would be disclosed under the existing Act in relation to the amount or value of the gift, the date on which the gift was made and the name and the address of the person who made the gift. Now it will not be just the person who gave the gift and who is the responsible officer who will be identified by name and address. The names and addresses of all of the members of the executive committee however described are to be placed on some sort of public register. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not know the extent to which there has been, in terms of practical experience, any difficulty in establishing the nature of the gift, the value of the gift, the date on which the gift has been made or in identifying the source of that gift by identifying the particular individual who has been responsible or who, under the Electoral Act, is held responsible for having given that donation. We have not had donations which in that sense have been untraceable, which have been inadequately specified in relation to the name and address of the person responsible for making the gift. But now every single member of the executive committee, or whatever term is to be used, of an unincorporated association is to have his or her name and address entered on a public register. So in other words, if one wishes to find out the names and personal addresses of all the people who are on the executive committee of an unincorporated association which has made a donation to a political party, which comes within the ambit of the Commonwealth Electoral Act, that will have to be disclosed. </PARA>
<PARA> I cannot for the life of me see what is added to, in terms of the public knowledge which proponents of the public funding system find attractive, by splashing the personal names and addresses of all of the members of the executive committee across the public record, their addresses in particular. Why should people have access to that sort of information? Why should the personal addresses of people who are on the executive committees of unincorporated associations that make donations to political parties be a matter of public record? What happens, for example, if there are persons who quite legitimately are on the electoral roll but who have their addresses specifically excluded from the electoral roll because that is the security requirement. </PARA>

Let them give a holiday home in another State'. What is actually advanced by requiring that these names and addresses be made? I know what the answer to that is. We all know what the answer to that is. It is typical of the ongoing, intrusive invasion of personal privacy which has been a hallmark and feature of government in this country for the last 6 1/2 years and which has been a hallmark of the use of the Electoral Act for quite bogus purposes to intrude upon the personal rights, the personal privacy and the personal affairs of individuals in this country. It is absolutely disgraceful that we are using the Commonwealth Electoral Act to further invade the privacy of individuals for what I see as no good purpose.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> What is wanted by those who believe in this system of disclosure is information regarding what money or gift was given, what its value was, when it was given, to whom it was given and by which organisation it was given. That is already provided for in the Act, in existing section 305 (2) (b), which is now being repealed in order to make these names and addresses even more publicly available. The Opposition does not believe that there is any justification whatsoever for this further invasion of privacy being undertaken under the guise of amendments to the Commonwealth Electoral Act. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Sections 304 and 305 of the Commonwealth Electoral Act require disclosure of relevant details of each gift above the disclosable level. That disclosable level is $1,000 or more for a gift to a political party, Senate group or third party-a third party being an individual or organisation not directly seeking election but participating in an election campaign-or, on the other hand, a $200 or more gift to a candidate. Relevant details include the name and address of the person who made the gift. Under section 306 it is unlawful to receive a gift of $1,000 or more, or in the case of a candidate $200 or more, unless the name and address of the person making the gift are made known. An unlawful gift has to be forfeited to the Crown; in other words, any anonymous donation above that level-even if it is made up of four or five different units that come to that level-must be forfeited to the Crown.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Australian Electoral Commission sought legal advice from the Director of Public Prosecutions as to whether an unincorporated association was a person under the disclosure provisions. The request was made in relation to a gift to a political party under section 304 but the advice provided is also relevant to sections 305 and 306. The Director of Public Prosecutions advised as follows:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . it is my view that an unincorporated association, which is not a legal entity, cannot be a `person' for the purposes of that provision. </PARA>
<PARA> An unincorporated association is in the eyes of the law no more than the aggregate of its individual members. If a gift is made to a political party by an unincorporated association, the gift is made jointly by members of the association. Compliance with section 304 (4) probably requires that when a gift is made by an unincorporated association the name and address of each member of that association must be disclosed. </PARA>
<PARA>He further indicated that it would be difficult, and may in some cases be impossible, for a political party to provide the name and address of every member of an unincorporated association which has made a gift to it. He pointed out:</PARA>
<PARA> The membership of unincorporated associations is often large and fluctuating and it may be difficult to determine whether a particular individual is a member at any given time. The cost to a political party of identifying and naming all members of an unincorporated association may exceed the value of the gift . . . </PARA>
<PARA> Strict enforcement of section 304 (4), and section 306 dealing with anonymous gifts, could have the practical effect of preventing political parties from accepting gifts from unincorporated associations . . . </PARA>
<PARA>So there is the view of the Director of Public Prosecutions. It was on this basis that the Commission, therefore, decided to accept disclosure of names and addresses of the members of the managing body as the source of the gift by the association. Since the present provisions of the Act have led people into the error of thinking that they are complying with the legislation by naming an unincorporated association as a donor of a gift, the Commission raised this matter with the Joint Select Committee on Electoral Reform. The Joint Select Committee recommended that an Act be amended so that in respect of a gift by an unincorporated association it specifies that disclosure is required of the name of the unincorporated association and the names and addresses of the members of the managing body, however described. I think it was in his speech at the second reading stage that Senator Puplick criticised this particular section. Senator Puplick has put his own views today. </PARA>
<PARA> I will just go through the issues that I think are raised. Companies which are incorporated are persons. The disclosure requirements in relation to corporations are unchanged. Only the name and address of a donor corporation are required to be disclosed. Trade unions which are federally or State registered have a status which is effectively corporate status and therefore are persons for the purposes of disclosure. Only the name and address of a donor union are required to be disclosed. For unincorporated companies and unions which are not registered federally or under State industrial legislation the disclosure requirements are less intrusive under the proposed amendment which requires disclosure of names and addresses of members of executive committees, however described, than under the current legislation which requires disclosure of the names and addresses of every member of the association. </PARA>
<PARA> In summary, Senator Puplick has made a philosophical assessment of how intrusive into privacy this Government is; I do not accept that. Listening to him, one would be led to understand there is almost some conspiracy in which a set of Stalinists have decided to intrude themselves into society as much as possible. I do not really think Senator Puplick believes that. But just on that question of privacy, by deleting this section the Opposition would be broadening the scope for any intrusion that is necessary, because the Electoral Commission, on the advice of the Director of Public Prosecutions, is going to have to insist that the name and address of every member of the organisation be disclosed, otherwise the donation will be returned. That is the effect of opposing this clause. </PARA>
<PARA> The effect of this clause is that only the executive of the association or unincorporated body need have the names and addresses. That is not an ideal thing from Senator Puplick's point of view because I guess what he would really like to do is just remove the whole thing holus-bolus, but that is not the choice now before the Senate. The choice is the degree of intrusion, and this represents much less intrusion into the process than that which would occur if the Act were left unamended or unchanged. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1"> -I was going to make a very similar point to the one that Senator Ray ended up on, and that is that if we accepted the Opposition's amendment we would have to have everybody's name and everybody's address. If Senator Puplick is concerned about that, as he seemed to be in his speech, it is very odd that he is moving this particular amendment because the provision in the amending legislation at least corrals it to the executive committee. The acceptance of his amendment would in fact require-and I am quite sure that the Commission would have to work on the advice given by the Director of Public Prosecutions-extension of the requirement to all members. I remember discussing this matter. It certainly seemed to the Joint Select Committee on Electoral Reform that the simplest way was in fact to deal with the executives. This is normally the case with regard to unincorporated associations. So we believe that it is sufficient that members of the executive be identified. We do not agree with Senator Puplick that every member of the organisation should be identified. This is a workable mechanism to deal with the problem that has arisen. I think Senator Puplick's proposition takes it back into that area which quite frankly is unworkable because of the fluctuating and almost indefinite nature of most unincorporated associations.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA> (a) by inserting after `Act' in subsection (1) `(other than subsection 329 (2))'; and</PARA>
<PARA> (b) by inserting after subsection (1) the following subsection:</PARA>

<PARA> I have moved the first of these amendments on previous occasions, as the Committee will be aware. It is an endeavour to institute the first step only in bringing political advertising into line with all other advertising. It is modelled on the Trade Practices Act. The difficulties that have been raised in the past have been taken on board. It does not seek to solve anything-I acknowledge that-but it does seek to make a first step with regard to this matter. The amendment states:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . any electoral matter containing a statement:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) that is untrue; and</PARA>
<PARA> (b) that is, or is likely to be, misleading or deceptive.'; and . . . </PARA>
<PARA>They are essentially the two provisions in the Trade Practices Act that apply to any commercial advertiser seeking to advertise his or her product in the Australian community. I readily acknowledge that this does not include those statements which could be either true or false. For example, it cannot cover statements of future activities; statements about what somebody will do in the future. They are not statements of truth and hence are not caught up under this definition. This refers only to those statements which have a truth value in that very strict sense. Basically, it refers to statements from the past and statements in print or in writing. For example, it would refer to a statement like: `The Australian Labor Party's policy is such and such'. If that quotation were incorrect, untrue or if it were done in such a way as to be misleading or deceptive, it would be caught up under this provision. </PARA>
<PARA> So this is an attempt to take away what a lot of people in the community, quite rightly, have seen as a licence on the part of politicians to be able to lie and yet an obligation imposed on ordinary advertisers, ordinary people operating in the community, by politicians not to do so-in other words, a double standard. We have passed a law through this place imposing that obligation and yet we have refused to submit-even in a small way, such as is contained in my amendments-to that restriction. </PARA>
<PARA> It is a restriction that extends to a very limited range of statements but it would be the first step to solving a problem that has been raised many times in the past: that we are happy to impose on others restrictions that we are not happy to take on ourselves. If this Parliament believes that it is important for somebody advertising soap to tell the truth, when a political party makes a statement about the printed policy of another political party it ought to be obliged to tell the truth. </PARA>
<PARA> I find it very difficult to understand how we can say to small and large businesses out there, `You tell the truth about your products when you advertise. However, we don't have to. You are dealing with soap. We are dealing with governing the community and putting in place laws. We do not have to abide by those strictures'. I do not think that is acceptable. I do not think that anyone believes, or would seriously want to argue, that that is acceptable. This amendment is framed, firstly, to catch only those statements which have a truth value. As honourable senators would know, that is a limited range of statements. Secondly, it is framed to catch what is or is likely to be misleading or deceptive. In other words, it is a double whammy. It is not just trying to pick up something inadvertent or even something which may be untrue but which is not likely to be deceptive. It is a double whammy exercise based on the Trade Practices Act. I believe that it ought to apply to politicians, as it applies to everybody else in the community. </PARA>

<PARA> I am even more opposed, of course, to the reliance on the Electoral Commission as the body that initiates injunctions.

It would put inordinate pressure on the Commission. Finally, if carried here today, it would be a great boon to my enemies-the lawyers. They would lap up hundreds of thousands of dollars in injunctions and court cases et cetera. Political parties would be impoverished and the lawyers, as always, would come out on top.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I suspect that the Chairman's sarcastic note would go something to the effect:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>What is truth? said jesting Pilate, and would not stay for an answer. </PARA>
<PARA>I suspect that is the basis of his sarcastic note. I endorse the general thrust of what Senator Ray has had to say. In terms of the definition of `truth', it is certainly possible that one would be able to state that the policy of a particular party is A, B and C; and it is testable, I guess, in some fashion as to whether that commitment actually appears in some written document or some printed document. If one then goes on to say, that, of course, the consequence of that is that the following will be the impact upon our lives, upon our country, upon the educational system, or whatever, the question of who is going to determine whether in fact that is true or untrue is really a matter to be left to the judgment of the electors. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Ray is also correct in saying that the proposed new section 383, which would be inserted by the Democrats' amendment, imposes a very considerable burden on the Electoral Commission to make applications to the prescribed court, for the court then to start determining these matters for endless arguments in the court as to what is true and what is not true and whether in fact it is likely to be misleading or deceptive. It does seem to me that the judgment in these things is one which electors are capable of making and which they have traditionally been capable of making. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Macklin basically says, `The electors are too dopey to know what is true and what is not true and therefore we need the Electoral Commission and a prescribed court and all of Senator Ray's friends in the legal profession to work out what is true and what is not true, what should be injunctive and what should be permitted'. That just seems to me to be so totally unworkable as to fail on the very face of it. The Opposition does not support this amendment. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I again have a matter to raise with the Minister which relates to clause 114. Clause 114 deals with amendments to section 360 of the principal Act regarding the power of the Court of Disputed Returns. It is proposed to insert a new subsection (2a) in the following terms:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>Unless the Court considers it desirable in the public interest, it shall not grant to a party to a petition leave to inspect a document that is not relevant to a matter identified in the petition as a matter on which the petitioner relies. </PARA>
<PARA>It does seem to me that in fact this casts the onus the wrong way round: if the object of the Court of Disputed Returns is to ensure that everything is done to ensure that an election is a fair election, that it is open and above board and that parties have access to all of the information, what this section should have said, in my view, is that, unless the court believes that it is in the public interest to withhold a document, then in fact it should make all documents available. I believe that it is the correct way when dealing with a matter like a Court of Disputed Returns to cast the onus the other way round-to say, `In order to be perfectly acceptable we ought to have a system in which anything is discoverable unless the Court believes there is a public interest that it should not be'. </PARA>
<PARA> What has happened is that this has been put the other way round. It has been put on the basis that, unless the Court believes that it is desirable in the public interest, it shall not grant-it is prohibited from granting-access to a document that is not relevant to a matter identified in the petition as a matter upon which a petitioner relies. In other words, I go to the Court of Disputed Returns; in my petition I indicate that I am relying upon certain things; I have access to the documents which the Court has and which go to those matters upon which I have said I am relying-but if there is a document lying around there which in fact substantiates my case that the election should be declared null and void but I have not previously identified it in terms of my petition, it casts the onus on the court to determine that there is a public interest that I should have access to it although I had not previously identified it in the petition. It means that if I do not get the petition exactly right I may in fact fail, and that failure may in fact be a consequence of what amounts to a legal technicality-the petition was not exactly correct. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee must bear in mind that the Court of Disputed Returns decision is final, unappealable. It is not as if this matter is then subject to some further evaluation in a higher court. The decisions of a Court of Disputed Returns are by virtue of the Electoral Act final and unappealable. It does seem to me that in fact this really should have been cast the other way round to say that, unless the Court considers that it is desirable in the public interest that a document not be granted to a petitioner or that access to a document not be granted to a petitioner, it shall make available to a petitioner any matter in the possession of the Court. I am curious as to whether in fact there is some substantial principle here that the Government relies upon to have cast the onus one way when I think the burden of the argument should have compelled the onus to be cast the other way. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am not sure that Senator Puplick's characterisation is accurate but it does derive from the Nunawading case, as much as these amendments do. What proposed new subsection (2a) is trying to define is the degree to which a petitioner can go on a fishing exercise. What happened in Nunawading was that virtually every accusation made as to irregularity at the time a petition was taken out was dismissed-at great expense in tracking down virtually every allegation. However, petitioners were allowed to go on a fishing expedition that turned up other material. This does not seek to halt that. What this seeks to do is to say that petitioners must have some reasonably based ground to seek those documents. I might point out that virtually all the documents concerned here anyway can be FOIed, as was done in the case of Fadden in 1984 but never proceeded with to finality. I am sure Hamish Lenecker and Co. actually FOIed all the necessary documents to get the relevant information. So there is an alternative route. But what this provision is trying to do is say yes to fishing expeditions, but not long-line fishing expeditions; I am sure honourable senators know what I mean. There is discretion in the court and I cannot imagine a court not having a fairly reasonable interpretation of the degree to which that discretion can be used. The provision says that a person cannot put in a petition to the Court of Disputed Returns and just head it, `We was robbed', then arrive in court and ask for documents to be made available. A person must have some grounds not just general grounds, to go to the court in the first place. That is what this proposed new subsection, arising out of the Nunawading case, seeks to do.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1"> -The principal Act in paragraph 360 (1) (iii) grants to the court powers to allow it to grant to any party to a petition leave to inspect in the presence of a prescribed officer the rolls and other documents, excluding of course, the ballot papers, used at or in connection with any election and to take, in the presence of the prescribed officer, extracts from those rolls and documents.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Proposed new subsection (2a) actually amends subsection (2), which simply allows the court to exercise all and any of its powers under this section, in its discretion in thinking it just and sufficient. The amendment to which Senator Puplick has drawn our attention, quite properly, is not necessary. The court already has the power to operate in a just and sufficient fashion. If it does not believe that the long-line fishing expedition that Senator Ray referred to is in fact just and proper, taking into account all of these matters, then the court will simply decline to allow the person to do that. It seems to me that it is better in these matters to leave that discretion in the hands of the court than to seek to confine them in the way this provision does. </PARA>
<PARA> If it is the wish to refer in some way to this I think that the construction Senator Puplick has raised is the proper one at this time. We should see how that operates before we go any further. I am not at all sure that we should move hurriedly on the basis of one exercise to circumscribe in such a fashion. The onus is upon the court to do whatever is in the public interest. I would have thought in some way the public interest is probably served by making sure we get the right person elected. In that sense this would probably not be a very onerous imposition on the court; it would simply say that any of the documents possibly may allude to, support or in some way bolster the case that is brought. We are not dealing with an extensive number of cases. At the end of the day I think it is probably better to have as open and as full an operation with regard to these matters as it is possible to achieve. I presume that Senator Puplick is saying that the Opposition proposes to vote against clause 114. I indicate that we would join the Opposition in that. </PARA>

<PARA>The particular proposition here is the issue of government spending during the constitutional referenda campaigns. As the Minister well knows, this goes back quite a considerable time and has been the subject of fairly heated debate in this chamber going back to 1983, as I remember. Most recently, of course, in the lead-up to the September 1988 referendum campaigns we saw again the expenditure of vast sums of public funds by State governments, in particular, and also by local government bodies. Indeed, I made a submission last year on behalf of my Party, the Australian Democrats, to the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters, expressing the grave concern that we had on this question. </PARA>
<PARA> Honourable senators would be aware that as the Act now stands the Commonwealth Government spending on the Yes and the No cases must be conducted within the guidelines of an amendment made to the Act in 1984 which I moved and which stipulated that Commonwealth moneys should be evenly divided between the Yes and the No cases. This had been a matter of convention until that point but, in seeking to depart from that, it seemed to us at that time, and still seems to us, that it is reasonable that any public funds spent at the Commonwealth level should be equally divided. </PARA>
<PARA> What I am seeking to do now is to apply that principle, that equality of funding to State and local government expenditure, during a referendum campaign. Obviously, of course, there are questions that may be put which could affect State and local government. Indeed, in the last referendum campaign there was an endeavour to enshrine local governments within our constitutional structure. Certainly, it should be entitled to put its views to the electorate. However, we believe that, if the current context is allowed to continue, those public funds at the Commonwealth level have to be dealt with in an even-handed way and yet at State and local government level they can be dealt with in any way they wish. In the current context, of course, where the Australian Labor Party controls all but one of the State governments in Australia, it obviously would be in an extremely advantageous situation if it wished to engage in a public spending exercise. It could do so very simply and very easily by bypassing the obligation that is imposed upon the Commonwealth and instead seeking to pick up those funds through the State governments' expenditure on a referendum campaign, whether it be for the Yes or No case. In fact, during the last referendum the then National Party State Government in Queensland spent about $1m promoting the No case, and the No case alone. </PARA>
<PARA> It is interesting to go back to the Hansard records of the 1984 debate when the Opposition parties argued very strongly for equality in public funding for the Yes and the No case and for a decision to be left to the electors; in other words, that public funds should not be used in such a way as to seek to prejudice the case but rather to state the case for both sides and then leave it to the electorate to make a decision. I do not want to go into great detail as to the type of exercise that was run in Queensland but rather to refer only to the principles. The thrust of these clauses is to require Commonwealth, State and local government to get the Electoral Commission's approval for expenditure. They would have to make an application for the expenditure of the money and the approval would be given through an approval certificate. The money then spent would have to be accounted for. There are other safeguards built into the Act in a way that would enable enforcement of this. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course, some objections could be raised with regard to the legal and constitutional powers to do this, and in the drawing up of these amendments I have sought advice on both of those levels and the advice has been very clear that there are no constitutional barriers under section 128 to this exercise. Section 128 provides that when a proposed law is submitted to the electors, the votes should be taken in such a manner as the Parliament prescribes. Clearly when a question in a referendum goes to the people to alter the Constitution, the Commonwealth, through the Parliament, may make laws with respect to the manner in which such votes are taken. Section 51 of the Constitution states:</PARA>
<PARA>The Parliament shall, . . . have power to make laws for the peace, order, and good government of the Commonwealth with respect to:-</PARA>
<PARA>. . . </PARA>
<PARA> (XXXIX.) Matters incidental to the execution of any power vested by this Constitution in the Parliament or in either House thereof, . . . </PARA>
<PARA>Given that the Parliament has the power to make laws with respect to Federal elections and referenda, the Democrats believe that it equally has the power to legislate in the field of State, Territory and local government expenditure on referendum questions and that it ought to do so. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is obvious that neither the Minister nor Senator Puplick was listening to my last comments. They merely asserted the opposite. In no way would this be struck down in the courts given the fact that the Parliament actually has the power to make laws with regard to the holding of referenda campaigns and also the power, under section 51 of the Constitution, to make laws incidental to the holding of any of those campaigns. This is an incidental power and it would be relied upon as being sufficient to carry the day. Indeed if it were not, I would refer the Minister to many other clauses of the Bill which are also dependent upon those incidental powers. For example, it is possible for the Commonwealth Parliament to make laws on the electoral items that we have been discussing which actually affect State and local government powers. Those types of exercises are often carried out under Federal legislation and in fact have overriden State and local powers precisely on the basis of the incidental power contained in section 51.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA>We have had a very long debate on this, I think twice already. I am not sure whether Senator Puplick was in on that one. I remember his talking about this issue. I do not know whether he was carrying it at that stage for the Opposition. We have got ourselves into an extremely difficult situation by way of formal clarification in this area. We believe that the wording I have put forward makes much clearer what would be a formal vote. The requirement for a vote to be formal is that the word `yes' or `no' is written alone in the squares on the referendum ballot paper. Any other words are irrelevant to the wish of the elector in terms of the validity of that vote. We are all aware of what happened in regard to the no dams issue. It seems to me that, provided the word `no' was written within a square and the word `dams' was written outside it, it should not have been ruled out as a valid vote. </PARA>
<PARA> My worry is that, the way it is expressed, it in no way refers to whether those words are inside or outside the square or anywhere else. I think we will find that we could get into more difficulties with this proposition, difficulties which would be avoided totally if, provided the `yes' and `no' were inside the square, any other words on the ballot paper were regarded as being irrelevant to the intention of the voter. </PARA>
<PARA> The Act now says, `Written alone or without words of qualification'. If it is written alone, how can it be written with words of qualification? What is the exact difference between the two? It makes no sense to divide them. People who have to count these votes ought to be clear that what they are looking for is a `yes' or a `no' inside the square and that everything else should be ignored. </PARA>

The Joint Select Committee on Electoral Reform had several goes at trying to get it right, as have Ministers and other people, including shadow Ministers. No-one has got it right yet. I am not sure that the Government amendment will get it right as it should be, but it will be a lot better without the addition of Senator Macklin's amendment, which will clearly disenfranchise a lot of people.

<PARA IN-LINE="1"> -As the reason given for rejection of the amendment is the possible disqualification of a number of voters, I ask the Minister whether his proposal would not disqualify even more voters, or at least it would have in cases in recent history. I cannot quite remember-the Minister is better versed in this than I am-the number of people who actually wrote `no dams', but it was a concerted campaign; Thousands of people did it. The number of people who may have got it wrong inside the square, and then crossed it out, would probably be only in the hundreds. If one makes a mistake on an ordinary ballot paper, one can go and get another one. If one makes a mistake on a referendum ballot paper, one can go and get another one. So those people have an avenue of redress.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In regard to what the Government is proposing, I find it difficult to understand what `written alone' or `irrespective of words of qualification' means but I presume that it means that if any other words appear anywhere on the ballot paper it will be invalid. That, I suggest, would rule out far more people every time. As the Minister well knows, in scrutinising these things-Senator Puplick raised this-some very ingenious suggestions arise on ballot papers as to what one can do and what one may not be able to do. People get quite inventive. But, if they are inventive, provided they stay within those parameters-a yes or no inside the square-what they write on the rest of the ballot paper in their inventiveness is irrelevant to the casting of their ballot. I believe that on balance the number of people whose votes would be ruled out if the Government's amendment were carried would be very large compared to the few who, having made a mistake, would be intimidated into not insisting on their rights and going and getting another ballot paper. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The old `no dams' claim is a bunch of rubbish. Usually at half past seven on any election night a press release would be put out saying that 40 per cent of people wrote `no dams'; but it was never on the basis of scrutineers. I have ordered people at various times at the recheck of votes actually to calculate the number of people who had written `no dams', and it is usually about 2 per cent. One of the problems the Australian Electoral Commission put forward is that a lot of people did not vote, did not put a yes or a no on their ballot paper, and quite a few of them put `no dams'. What the Commission was particularly worried about was that sometimes the word `no' would fall over into a square and therefore it would be taken as a No vote. From my memory, most of the people who wrote `no dams' usually left the square blank, as a sort of anarchistic protest.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA>This amendment concerns the rights of prisoners to vote. I do not propose to take very long on this matter. I have had some discussions with Senator Ray about it, and I wish briefly to draw attention to one thing. This huge amendment Bill runs to a grand total of 123 printed pages. It contains six schedules. Schedule 3, which is headed `Minor amendments of the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918', says:</PARA>
<PARA>Omit the paragraph. </PARA>
<PARA>That gives prisoners who have been convicted and given a sentence for a particular time the right to vote. It is not a minor amendment. I think that it is just a matter of drawing to the attention of draftsmen that when a significant policy question arises it ought to be dealt with in the substantive body of an Act and not shuffled off into a schedule headed `Minor amendments'. It is a policy change and, as a result, it ought to have appeared in the substantive corpus of the Bill rather than being put in a schedule. I make that point because I think that policy questions are properly dealt with in a more up-front fashion than being described as minor amendments and stuck away in a schedule. </PARA>
<PARA> As to the purpose of the Opposition amendment, I have canvassed at considerable length in an earlier debate the rights of prisoners to vote and I do not intend at this hour to rehearse all of those arguments. </PARA>
<PARA> Our amendment would restore the situation where prisoners who were convicted of certain offences and spent terms of imprisonment of more than five years should have their voting rights terminated. I believe that is manifestly correct on its face. I believe that the new move around the country towards what is called truth in sentencing will mean that such terms of imprisonment will be imposed only where the offences are genuinely of sufficient seriousness for them to carry that length of penalty. </PARA>
<PARA> Rather than weary the Committee any longer, I seek leave to have incorporated in Hansard the dissenting report, signed by former Senator the Hon. Sir John Carrick, the Hon. Michael MacKellar, MP, and Mr C. W. Blunt, MP, to report No. 2 of the Joint Select Committee on Electoral Reform entitled The Operation during the 1984 General Election of the 1983-84 amendments to Commonwealth Electoral Legislation in which they have argued the case. I urge the Committee to support the Opposition amendment. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The document read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA>Recommendation 23</PARA>
<PARA>Abolition of Voting Restrictions on Prisoners</PARA>
<PARA>Currently prisoners convicted and under sentence for an offence punishable by imprisonment for 5 years or longer are denied a vote. </PARA>
<PARA> The majority recommendation is that all voting restrictions on prisoners (except for the crime of treason) be abolished. </PARA>
<PARA> This section of the Act was amended in 1983 to increase the period from 1 to 5 years. The Committee then argued that anyone convicted and sentenced to 5 years had obviously committed a serious offence. In practice most would not be first offenders. </PARA>
<PARA> It is now argued by the majority that the incarceration itself is sufficient restriction and that the denial of voting should not be attached. </PARA>
<PARA> The concept of imprisonment, apart from any rehabilitation aspects, is one of deterrent, seeking by the denial of a wide range of freedoms to provide a disincentive to crime. The person having committed an offence against society, is denied the privileges and freedoms of society of which one important one is the right to vote. In that philosophy, in the past some electoral laws provided that habitual criminals (recidivists) should be permanently denied the franchise. </PARA>
<PARA> The essential question is whether, in certain proven offences, voting rights should be included amongst the many other restrictions of freedoms for those in goal. </PARA>
<PARA> On balance the 1983 amendment appears a sensible compromise. It does not seek to penalise the minor offenders. It retains the deterrent for the more serious and recidivist offences. </PARA>
<PARA> The AEC has pointed to difficulties in the present wording of the Act. This can be very largely overcome by the disqualification operating not by reference to the maximum sentence but to the actual sentence or to the period that the prisoner is actually in custody. </PARA>
<PARA> The argument that there is a serious lack of consistency in attaching a penal sanction to an offence is not a ground for removing voting restrictions on prisoners but rather a plea to re-establish consistency. The fact that some people who commit serious offences are fined and not gaoled cannot be taken to support the freeing from gaol of all prisoners of a similar magnitude of crime. </PARA>
<PARA> It is a current fact of life that the conduct of penal systems is not founded totally on deterrence and rehabilitation but rather on the political economics of maintaining gaols-a low priority. </PARA>
<PARA> There is a need for an objective study of crime, punishment and rehabilitation to derive optimum decisions free of the grave distortions of priorities in government financing. A similar objective approach should be made to the question of whether one of the many losses of freedom impacting on certain prisoners should be the freedom to vote for a certain period. </PARA>
<PARA> In the interim, the 1983 amendment seems appropriate. </PARA>

I thank the Opposition spokesman, Senator Puplick, for inadvertently alerting us to this by drawing attention to another section of the Act. When we went to the relevant section to disprove his point, we found a clause missing, that is, `Governor of a State'. We would very much like to reinsert it; otherwise, the Governor would be able to issue writs, but apparently not have to sign them. It is a bit embarrassing when such drafting errors occur, but they do occur from time to time. I thank Senator Puplick who had it raised via Neil Brown, via a constituent who picked this up.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Chairman, I am grateful to the Government for picking up this amendment. What in fact happened was that an elector by the name of Mrs Clare Howard wrote to Mr Warwick Smith saying that she had read the Bill and found something that she thought was totally defective about it. He sent it to Mr Neil Brown, the shadow Attorney-General, for an opinion. Mr Neil Brown wrote back to him saying that he thought Mrs Howard was absolutely correct and that the error in fact occurred in clause 49, amending section 152. They then sent it to me because I was handling the Bill here. I then gave it to the Minister who gave it to his departmental officials who had a look at it and decided that it was right after all. They have now produced this amendment to clause 49 to re-instate the requirements as far as the signing of the writs by State Governors are concerned. Mrs Clare Howard deserves whatever award it is that one hands out for members of the public in these circumstances. I seek leave to have incorporated in Hansard the letter from Mr Brown to Mr Smith which actually sets out the details of this matter and explains the background to the amendment which the Government has now moved.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA>CANBERRA ACT 2600</PARA>
<PARA>Dear Warwick,</PARA>
<PARA> I refer to representations you have received from Mrs Clare Howard concerning the Electoral and Referendum Amendment Bill 1988 which is presently before the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA> Mrs Howard has drawn attention to the fact that the Bill appears to make an attempt to remove the power of State Governor to issue writs for the election of Senators for the States. </PARA>
<PARA> The conclusion I have come to is either Mrs Howard is right about this or we have been presented with a very bad piece of drafting which requires some explanation. </PARA>
<PARA> The starting point is that section 12 of the Constitution provides that writs for the election of Senators for the States are to be issued by the Governor of the State concerned. </PARA>
<PARA> Naturally, as this is in the Constitution, no law of the Parliament may overrule it. </PARA>
<PARA> The Commonwealth Electoral Act reflects this position accurately. Section 152 of the Act provides that writs for the election of Senators and Members of the House of Representatives may be in the forms set out respectively in the Schedule to the Act. </PARA>
<PARA> The Schedule to the Act sets out three forms; the first for the election of Senators from a State, the second for the election of Senators from a Territory and the third for the election of Members of the House of Representatives. </PARA>
<PARA> The first form rightly makes provision for the title of the Governor of the State and clearly is an effective means of providing a form of writ to be issued by the Governor of a State. </PARA>
<PARA> The second form is for the election of Senators from a Territory and this form provides for the issue of the writ by the Governor-General. That is so because there is nothing in the Constitution to prevent it and because the Commonwealth Electoral Act provides that the Governor-General may issue those writs. </PARA>
<PARA> The third form provides for the election of Members of the House of Representatives and also provides for the issue of that writ by the Governor-General or by the Speaker. This is also consistent with the Constitution because section 32 provides that it is the Governor-General who may issue writs for general elections of Members of the House of Representatives and section 33 provides that the Speaker is to issue a writ for an election to fill a vacancy. </PARA>
<PARA> Bringing the matter up-to-date, at this stage one can say that the provisions of the Commonwealth Electoral Act are consistent with the Constitution and, for Mrs Howard's immediate question, the writ for the election of Senators from a State correctly provides for that writ to be issued by the Governor of a State. </PARA>
<PARA> We are now faced with the Electoral and Referendum Amendment Bill 1988. Amongst other things, this Bill amends the Act by removing a lot of gender-specific language, for example, by removing ``he'' and substituting ``the person''. In the course of doing that the Bill amends the Schedules to the Commonwealth Electoral Act which set out the writs for elections. They remove the expression ``by His Excellency's Command'' from each of the writs. Having done that, clause 49 of the Bill amends section 152 of the Act by providing that the writs are to be signed. </PARA>
<PARA> Presumably this is because, having removed the exhortation that the writ is issued by His Excellency, it was felt that the writs should actually be signed. </PARA>
<PARA> Now comes the curious part which is that, as Mrs Howard has correctly pointed out, the Bill provides that the writ is to be signed ``by the Governor-General or the Speaker as the case requires''. It does not provide that the writ is to be signed by the Governor of a State, the Governor-General or the Speaker. </PARA>
<PARA> I have already said that the writs for the election of Senators for a State must be issued by the Governor of the State. No one else may issue them. Consequently, you would expect the Bill to provide that when you are dealing with a writ for the election of Senators for a State that that writ is to be signed by the State Governor. After all, the Bill does in fact provide that for the election of Territory Senators and Members of the House of Representatives, the writ is to be signed by the Governor-General or the Speaker as the case may be. </PARA>
<PARA> One would, therefore, expect a similar provision providing that in the case of a writ for the election of Senators from a State, that that writ is to be signed by the Governor of the State. </PARA>
<PARA> But it does not provide that and that is the curious thing. </PARA>
<PARA> There are two explanations for this that I can think of. </PARA>
<PARA> The first explanation is that it is bad drafting and that the draftsman has made a mistake. So, what we should do is to have attention drawn to this when the Bill comes on for debate in the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA> The other explanation takes us back to the original provision in the Constitution which, as I have said, provides that the Governor of the State may issue the writ and, by implication, no one else. That being so, perhaps a deliberate decision has been made that you simply cannot say in a Commonwealth law that the Governor of a State is to sign the writ. The argument may be that it is surplusage. In other words, no matter what you say in the Bill, the provision in the Constitution is paramount and the writ is to be issued by the Governor of the State. </PARA>
<PARA> The point that is difficult to understand about this explanation is that if this is so, why has the Bill taken the words ``by His Excellency's Command'' also out of the form of writ for the election of Senators from a State as well as from the other writs. </PARA>
<PARA> Even if this is the explanation, we should still draw attention to this in the debate on this Bill in the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA> I have therefore taken the liberty of sending a copy of this letter to Wal Fife, the Shadow Minister in charge of electoral matters so that the matter can be addressed. </PARA>
<PARA> It certainly deserves to have attention drawn to it and Mrs Howard has done us a service by directing our attention to the issue. </PARA>
<PARA>Yours sincerely</PARA>

<PARA>Awareness Campaign</PARA>
<PARA>The Awareness Campaign is a three way venture involving the Commonwealth, the States and the film and video industry. In general terms, its purpose is to inform the community about the classification process, what each of the classifications mean and what kind of films and videos people are likely to expect in each category. It will also focus on the work of the Office of Film and Literature Classification and the principles it employs when making classification decisions. An initial survey will establish what other areas need to be addressed. As part of that process it will continue the current practice of promoting the Office as the place where people can obtain further information about classifications or direct their views about classification decisions. </PARA>
<PARA> The conduct of the Campaign will be in the hands of a professional agency, chosen by all three participating parties. The manner and extent to which the Office is promoted will depend upon the recommendations of the agency. The suggestion of a 008 phone number will be considered in that context. </PARA>
<PARA>Non-Violent Erotica</PARA>
<PARA>The Board has used the term non-violent erotica to distinguish the material in the `X' category from other sexually explicit material involving violence and coercion. </PARA>
<PARA> Prior to the introduction of an `X' classification early in 1984 the Board's practice was to refer to sexually exploitative material which was inexplicit enough to be accommodated in a theatrical `R' classification as ``soft-core pornography''. Explicit sexual activity (even of a consenting nature) was referred to as ``hard-core pornography'' and refused classification for public exhibition. When the `X' classification for video was introduced it encompassed the previously refused material including all but extreme depictions of sexual violence, cruel acts, bestiality and child pornography. </PARA>
<PARA> When the `X' classification was reviewed in December 1984 it was limited to ``explicit depictions of sexual acts involving adults'', but not including, ``any depiction suggesting coercion or non-consent of any kind''. </PARA>
<PARA> This excluded material which, in the public mind, had become associated with the expression ``hard-core pornography'', and Board members in their daily reference to such material coined the phrase ``non-violent erotica'' as a suitable shorthand description of the `X' guidelines referred to above. </PARA>
<PARA> The description, ``non-violent erotica'', seems appropriate to differentiate between material which is in the `X' category and material which would otherwise be refused classification. For that reason it was used as a description of the `X' category on the guidelines issued by the Board. </PARA>
<PARA> The term ``non-violent erotica'' has never been used by the Board as an alternative to `X'. The guidelines are being reprinted to take into account amendments to the Classification of Publications Ordinance in the Australian Capital Territory in which references to ``terrorism'' have been replaced by the broader reference to ``instructs in matters of crime or violence''. </PARA>
<PARA> In the reprinted version, the `X' category will be summarised as ``Consenting sexually explicit material'' instead of ``non-violent erotica''. </PARA>
<PARA>Prominence of `X' category in Awareness Campaign</PARA>
<PARA>No decisions have yet been taken about what resources will be used to clarify what material is in the `X' category. The Awareness Campaign is directed overwhelmingly to the mainstream of film and video viewers. Research conducted by the Australian Institute of Criminology and the Attorney-General's Department indicated that, even in the Australian Capital Territory where `X' is legally available, less than ten per cent of the viewers hire `X'-rated material. Therefore, as Mr Dickie said to you at the Estimates Committee hearing, the major pitch of the Campaign will be about the four mainstream categories: `G', `PG', `M' and `R'. </PARA>
<PARA> Obviously, in the Australian Capital Territory and the Northern Territory, there will need to be some reference made to the `X' category because `X'-rated material is one of the recognised categories. The question of the general confusion between the `X' and `R' categories will also have to be addressed. How important this question is in the general scheme of things and what resources will be devoted to it is something which can only be addressed when the research is being considered and resources are being allocated by the Steering Committee on the advice of the professional agency. </PARA>

<PARA>Senator The Hon. M. Tate,</PARA>
<PARA>Minister for Justice,</PARA>
<PARA>Parliament House,</PARA>
<PARA>CANBERRA ACT 2600</PARA>
<PARA>Dear Minister,</PARA>
<PARA>Thank you for your letter of 11 December which included the information provided by the Chief Censor in relation to matters raised by me in the Committee's consideration of Appropriation Bill (No. 1). </PARA>
<PARA> I cannot allow Mr Dickie's version of the ``X'' classification to go unchallenged because it is inconsistent with evidence provided by former Chief Censor Strickland to the Senate Select Committee on Video Material. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Dickie says that the ``X'' classification was reviewed in December 1984 when it was limited to ``explicit depictions of sexual acts involving adults but not including any depictions suggesting coercion or non-consent''. </PARA>
<PARA> The fact is that the review took place before the meeting of Attorneys-General in Sydney on October 26 1984 and the Film Censorship Board actually issued the guidelines in November 1984 (see JSCVM Report, volume 2, Appendix 5, Page 727). The Board had actually been applying those guidelines well before that date. </PARA>
<PARA> Despite the fact that the ``X'' classification was established for what is officially described as ``hard core pornography'' (see Explanatory Memorandum attached); despite the fact that physically violent pornography represented only 5% of ``X'' (A/G's Evidence JSCVM P. 03288), Mr Dickie now implies that the removal from the ``X'' classification of physically violent pornography actually removed ``hard core pornography'' from the ``X'' classification. </PARA>
<PARA> Referring to this very same revised ``X'' classification, former Chief Censor Janet Strickland told the Senate Select Committee on Video Material on 12 December 1984:</PARA>
<PARA> ``Nobody has ever pretended that the X or ER or whatever you call it-R+-is anything but hard core porn.'' (SSCVM Evidence P. 134)</PARA>
<PARA> The information which the current Chief Censor has provided to his Minister for Parliament is thus in direct contradiction to this official evidence given on behalf of the Film Censorship Board to a Parliamentary Committee. </PARA>
<PARA> As pointed out in the Senate on November 23, the ``X'' rated video industry has been waging a campaign to have its hard core pornography described as non-violent erotica (NVE) and have been assisted by this incorrect description being used by the FCB in its official publication. I now have a transcript of the program on Radio 2CN (Amanda Cavell Show, November 23, 1989) to which I referred in which publicist for the ``X'' rated video industry said:</PARA>
<PARA> ROBBIE SWAN: Yes, look the term non violent erotica is actually used by the Film Censorship Board in its information bulletin number 22, when it sets out the classification of films in Australia. It describes X-rated movies as non violent erotica, brackets-NVE. And that's in, I'm sorry, it's the Commonwealth Film Censor. It's in there. </PARA>
<PARA> I now note from Mr Dickie's letter that the Film Censorship Board will be abandoning its description of this material in its official publications as ``non-violent erotica'' but will be describing it as ``consenting sexually explicit material''. This phrase is also likely to be highly misleading to the public as to the nature of the material in the ``X'' classification as well as blurring the distinction between pornography and other sexually explicit material designed for educative, health or scientific purposes (see Report of the Joint Select Committee on Video Material, Page 45). I would also draw your attention to page 46 of the Report of the JSCVM (para 3.56) concerning the interpretation of the term ``sexually explicit'', and the inappropriate inclusion of certain material in the ``R'' classification. </PARA>
<PARA> The fact is that the FCB's intended use of the bland term ``consenting sexually explicit material'' for the ``X'' classification fails to convey the exploitative and degrading nature of the bulk of ``X'' rated videos which emphasise group sex and promote sexually promiscuous (AIDS high risk) behaviour. </PARA>
<PARA> Evidence cited by the JSCVM shows that such material engenders a ``sexually calloused and manipulative orientation towards women.'' It mediates in the mind of the habitual viewer a perception of women in general as being highly promiscuous and available. </PARA>
<PARA> It is interesting to note that at least four behavioural scientists whose research was submitted to the Committee saw non-violent pornographic videos as more harmful in this regard even than the violent pornography which has already been banned. </PARA>
<PARA> The Chief Censor has no legislative basis for describing this material other than in the terms of the Explanatory Memorandum to the ACT Classification of Publications Ordinance namely ``hard core pornography''. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The tabling the other day of the annual report of the Prices Surveillance Authority has prompted me to draw to the Senate's attention a number of aspects of the work of the Authority and of the Trade Practices Commission, in particular what I perceive as an abject failure of these watchdogs to ensure that Australians gain the benefits they should gain from free market competition; that is, in the area of the purchases of food and the basis necessities of life. These benefits should include a wide variety of goods on offer and a range in terms of quality and highly competitive retail prices. The prices encountered on the weekly trip to the supermarket to buy staples, that is, groceries, fruit and vegetables, are the factor that can make or break a family budget. For this reason the roles of the Prices Surveillance Authority and the Trade Practices Commission in ensuring that consumers get the best prices that a free market can provide and in protecting them from market manipulation and profiteering and other sharp practices are potentially of enormous importance to all Australians. The Trade Practices Commission's annual report for 1988-89 rather grandly states on its fourth page:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>The Act is a dynamic and positive instrument, deliberately designed to foster free and vigorous competition and a fair trading ethic, not simply to proscribe specified activities or conduct. As the Act demands, the Commission's overall goal remains to benefit ordinary Australians through the mechanisms of a fair, efficient and highly competitive market place'. </PARA>
<PARA>These are grand words, indeed, but do they really represent the reality experienced by Australian consumers? I believe emphatically that they do not. When the Act was first introduced, the market consisted of three types of players; the first were manufacturers and primary producers; the second were resellers such as wholesalers and retailers; and the third were end consumers. In this theoretical market-place which, indeed, reflected the reality of the time, consumers were protected from exploitation from two types and levels of competition. At the manufacturer level, there was competition between manufacturers in terms of both quality and price. Goods were sold to a large number of competing resellers. At the reseller level the consumer benefited from competition between retailers, each trying to outdo the other on quality and service offered to the consumer and on price. These two levels of effective competition were sufficient to guarantee to consumers both choice of quality and competitive pricing. </PARA>
<PARA> Over the intervening years, the Trade Practices Commission has made a number of rulings and published a number of explanatory statements, the effect of which, whatever may have been their intention, is effectively to blur the distinctions between manufacturers, wholesalers and retailers, allowing them all to be categorised simply as suppliers. It has become possible for massive retailing organisations to develop in Australia. They function as wholesalers to their own retail outlets and increasingly adopt also the function of manufacturers. Where independent manufacturers remain, they have become enslaved to the retail chains because these chains have such a high level of control over the market that they have the power to destroy any manufacturer who might decline to cooperate. They could, for example, simply refuse to stop goods manufactured by a particular manufacturer, reduce the shelf space allocated to those goods, decline to promote them or price them at such exorbitant levels that consumers would turn to competing brands. </PARA>
<PARA> Manufacturers are thus deprived of the opportunity to compete directly with each other in terms of quality and price. The big chains have total power to determine what will be available to consumers and at what price. Consumers are thereby deprived of competition between manufacturer and manufacturer. The Trade Practices Commission has allowed this situation to develop and it is, as far as I can ascertain, doing nothing whatsoever to correct it. </PARA>
<PARA> The big retail chains have adopted a number of strategies to exploit their power over the manufacturers; for example, they demand that manufacturers make payments to them for the shelf space allocated to the display of their goods. These payments are an additional form of income to the retail chains. The chains also demand that the manufacturers pay for in-store promotion of the manufacturers and their products. </PARA>
<PARA> These practices and the enormous buying power have enabled the big chains to undercut and gradually to eliminate the old style family grocery shop. Steadily they have increased their market share until the situation has been reached where two or three major retail chains control an enormous share of the market for food and other basic consumer items in Australia. At this point the other forms of competition in terms of service offered and price by competing retail outlets is virtually eliminated. If my choice was to pay 39c for an item in a Coles supermarket in suburb X or 39c for the identical item in a near identical Woolworths supermarket in neighbouring suburb Y or 39c for the identical item in a near identical Foodland supermarket, no competition exists. Those are the three major chains in Western Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> It appears from their pricing policies that the major retail chains, either independently, by tacit agreement, or in some other way, have arrived at the conclusion that they can maximise their profits if they charge more or less the same price and the top price on 95 per cent or more of the items they stock at any one time and perceive to `compete' with each other by offering a limited number of so-called specials each week. Since the different retail chains offer different sets of specials each week, the consumer gains no real advantage from shopping at one of the chains rather than at another. Specials, therefore, give an appearance of cutthroat competition when no real competition exists. </PARA>
<PARA> A survey carried out over a three-month period by one of my consultants in Western Australia demonstrated very clearly that the big chains simply do not compete on price. Every Wednesday there are full-page advertisements in the West Australian newspaper in which the big retail chains advertise their specials for the week. By careful checking and comparison my consultant discovered that in a three-month period there was not a single example of competition between the three chains on their special offers. Each chain had a different set of specials each week and at the end of each week the specials reverted to the usual high price. He found that the specials were quite regularly rotated from chain to chain so that what was a special in Coles at 44c this week would turn up as a special in Woolworths at 44c next week and would be the same price in Foodland the week after that. </PARA>
<PARA> After a few weeks of monitoring prices he found he was able to predict with a high level of accuracy which items would be on special in which chain in a given week. In recent months the matches are no longer so transparently obvious, but the overall position has not changed very much. It strains credibility to believe that no collusion and price fixing is involved. If these chains were involved in genuine competition by offering special prices to attract custom without reference to one another, they must at least occasionally offer the same item at reduced prices and non-identical prices in the same week. </PARA>
<PARA> Due partly to the very considerable profits that this system of collusion to maintain high prices and eliminate true competition generates, the chains are in a position to build more and more vast impersonal and monumentally ugly shopping centres. Each of these destroys a given number of small family businesses, reduces choice and removes almost any sort of service to the consumer since staffing levels are reduced to the absolute minimum and very young and inexperienced staff on minimum wages are usually employed. For the hapless consumer, the result of all this is exactly what would obtain if an organised cartel of retailers had formed an agreement to control prices to their own advantage and to the disadvantage of consumers. </PARA>
<PARA> The Trade Practices Act contains a definition of `special offers'. The Commission has, however, refused to accept that specials are, in effect, special offers and has refused to compel the chains to follow the requirements which apply to special offers when they market their so-called specials. This is a betrayal of the interests of the consumer. What is needed is a requirement for manufacturers to stipulate a recommended retail price on all their products. A better expression would, perhaps, be a normal price. This would create competition between manufacturers on price. Consumers would know then whether prices charged to them by retailers were high or low relative to the normal price, but the Commission insists that only the retailer may exercise any control over the retail selling price. This is a licence to print money from a cash trade characterised by a captive steady demand with consumers unable to do anything about price rises. In the end we all have to eat. </PARA>
<PARA> It is not at all unusual for so-called specials to be at a higher price than a comparable item in another district, and the Commission has the gall to talk about competition and benefits to the consumers. The Prices Surveillance Authority is supposed to act for the benefit of the consumer, but the Trade Practices Commission spikes its guns very effectively. The Prices Surveillance Authority can only monitor the cost prices of the producer, manufacturer, and supplier. It cannot pursue its investigations into the realm of retail pricing because the Commission has resolved that the cost of the article has no relevance to the retail selling price, which is the sole concern of the retailer. The latter need pay no attention to the cost of the article to the consumer other than the market profit which can be achieved. There is an interesting paragraph in the annual report of the Prices Surveillance Authority on coffee prices. It states:</PARA>
<PARA>Towards the end of 1988-89 there were substantial decreases in world prices for coffee beans. The Authority has reminded the companies concerned that, while having regard to large stock holdings, long term contracts and increases in other costs, it expects that these reductions in world coffee prices should flow through to the domestic instant coffee prices early in 1989-90. </PARA>
<PARA>Let us wait and see. The failure of the Commission is also a failure of this Government, because the wages and prices accord is regarded as the central achievement of the Hawke Government. But that accord is a fraud, because the Government has indeed succeeded to some extent in keeping increases in wages, salaries and benefits down, but has failed utterly to keep prices down. That is why more and more Australian families are sliding steadily into poverty and despair. It is a constant source of amazement to me that unions pay a great deal of attention to wage and salary levels, but appear to do nothing to compel the Government they have supported to keep its word on prices. Gains from wage increases and social security and other benefits are totally illusory while they can be creamed off in price increases as fast as they are delivered. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Opposition supports this Bill. This Bill is obviously concerned with the relationship between Australia and Taiwan and that relationship is, in our view, a severely and unnecessarily stunted one that requires urgent correction. In December 1972 Australia recognised the Government in Peking as the sole and legitimate Government of China and that political recognition has not changed. Nevertheless, short of political recognition, we believe that the relationship with Taiwan, covering such areas as commerce, trade, social, cultural and other areas, has been held back unnecessarily.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> During recent years Taiwan has developed and grown at a pace difficult to imagine a decade ago and regrettably Australia has had little part in that growth. Successive Hawke Ministers have tried to justify the poor level of contacts between Australia and Taiwan as somehow being a restraint accepted in the agreement of 1972. That is incorrect. I refer simply to the recent report of Dr Ross Garnaut, who was a former Australian ambassador to China:</PARA>
<PARA>Within this policy there are no barriers to the development of commercial and other private relations with Taiwan. </PARA>
<PARA>The Hawke Government has also sought to portray its reluctance to establish close ties with Taiwan as somehow being part of a global trend. Again, that is not so. It further has suggested that encouraging contacts with Taiwan would bring retribution from the People's Republic of China. The evidence is that for those that have developed a closer, particularly economic and trade, relationship such retribution has not been forthcoming. The Hawke Government has offered little assistance in the development of the commercial relationship. As recently as 28 April this year the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade (Senator Gareth Evans) reiterated in this chamber:</PARA>
<PARA>It has been necessary for us to tread carefully and sensitively in further developing the trading relationship in question. </PARA>
<PARA>It is that reluctance to encourage the trading opportunity that has been of particular concern to us. Australia's unofficial representation in Taiwan has been minimal. Until last year only one officer was posted. There are now two officers posted to the quasi-official Australian commerce and industry office (ACIO). The result of this avoidance of contacts is poor knowledge of local Taiwanese politics and powerplays. We saw it demonstrated earlier this year with the restrictions that were introduced by Taiwan on the Australian beef trade. The Australian Government had great difficulty in knowing how to address that challenge because of a lack of adequate local knowledge. </PARA>
<PARA> Companies interested in setting up in Taipei have also been hindered by a lack of information regarding commercial opportunities and contacts. There is neither adequate research nor promotion in Taiwan of Australian products. What is worse is evidence of active Hawke Government discouragement of some contracts. One remembers 1987 when the tender of the Snowy Mountains Engineering Corporation, which had won a $2.5 billion engineering contract in Taiwan against international competition, was cancelled by ministerial direction, reportedly because the former Foreign Minister feared that the deal could upset China. </PARA>
<PARA> What we have witnessed in recent years has, as I said, been incredible economic growth within Taiwan. It now, with no natural resources, has a $US75 billion foreign exchange reserve, second only to Japan. It was the thirteenth largest trading nation in the world in 1988 and is expected to be the twelfth this year. It had an average growth rate of nine per cent over the last two decades, had a trade surplus of $US12 billion in 1988 and has a per capita income of over $US6,000, which is rapidly rising. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to touch briefly on some of the commercial opportunities that are being missed. Taiwan's rapidly rising standard of living and high levels of disposable income present excellent opportunities for two-way investment with Australia. Taiwan's increasing domestic demand for social and economic infrastructure is one such opportunity. Considerable opportunities exist in the area of business migration, although already our migration from Taiwan is the second largest numerically in the region. If one looks at the figures, compared with Hong Kong it is still a long way behind. Banking and financial opportunities have been missed. Tourism opportunities particularly have been neglected. In 1988, 1.6m Taiwanese tourists went abroad spending over $US4 billion. Of that number, only 1.1 per cent came to Australia. Education opportunities also abound. An estimated 40,000 Taiwanese a year study overseas, most of them going to the United States. In 1988 only 335 Taiwanese were in Australia studying, which is only 0.9 per cent of our overseas students. So those figures indicate, I would suggest, a great market that is not being tapped. </PARA>
<PARA> There have been problems, and there are still problems, in the relationship. How to respond to the greater assertiveness on the part of Taiwan and its increasing use of economic strength to obtain political concessions provides a challenge for the Australian Government. How to develop soundly based ties with Taiwan rather than react in an emotional way to the events that have occurred in China this year is another problem. </PARA>
<PARA> There must be a recognition that Taiwan is not without its problems also: labour problems are growing and it is going through a phase of political transition that could lead to extra stresses. The Australian Government also, we accept, must develop the Taiwanese relationship without jeopardising the China relationship. But these obstacles can be overcome provided the Government has foresight and behaves with commonsense. </PARA>
<PARA> One piece of finally obtained evidence of commonsense comes in this piece of legislation before the chamber today. I refer to the fact that the legislation will provide some investment protection, which we support. Taiwanese Government assets, investments overseas, are questionably not protected against a claim from Beijing and arguably, under the 1972 agreement, there could be an action for Beijing to claim such assets. This legislation makes it clear that such a claim would be unsuccessful. It means that there is now an opportunity for Australia at least to compete for such projects as the China Steel project, although one should stress that we nevertheless are going to have to compete against strong competition from such countries as Canada and Malaysia. Therefore this legislation, in itself, is not going to achieve the objective of attracting greater investment, but at least it will facilitate that opportunity. </PARA>
<PARA> The other area that remains at a totally unsatisfactory state is that of direct air links. The need for direct air links is self-evident, I would suggest. Nineteen international passenger airlines already fly into Taipei. Cathay Pacific, in which the Chinese Government itself has a 12 per cent share, has the highest frequency at about 112 flights a week. But Australia of course does not have direct air links. Why? When the Australian Government sought to negotiate-it went to China in effect to seek permission, which was not necessary under the 1972 agreement-China indicated that through a subsidiary, Australian-Asia Airlines, we would be allowed to fly to Taipei provided that we did not accept a reciprocal right, that of China Airlines to fly to Australia. Taiwan, not surprisingly, is now claiming that reciprocal right and therefore an impasse has been reached, the irony of course being that permission from China, as I said, was not required in the first instance. The cost to Australia is a loss in economic opportunity. </PARA>
<PARA> I have not time to deal with the internal developments. I mentioned that they will provide new and additional challenges for Australia, as will what is commonly known as the China factor. But it is worth noting now that if one looks at the relationship between China and Taiwan and how that may have been seen as necessary to restrain our developing relationship with Taiwan, one sees that many restrictions between China and Taiwan have been progressively lifted. More than 800,000 Taiwanese visited China for family reunions alone. Two-way trade in 1988 was estimated at $2.6 billion. According to China, Taiwanese have invested more than $400m in China, predominantly in low wage, labour intensive industries. Taiwanese officials even attended an Asian Development Bank meeting in Beijing on 4 May and officials conducted direct negotiations over the fate of an aircraft hijacked from China to Taipei. So whilst on the one hand China has required of us considerable restrictions, it is interesting to note that on the other hand it has been developing in the meantime its relationship with Taiwan. </PARA>
<PARA> What is most likely to happen, and in some ways the best thing that could happen, is that the status quo in the relationship between Taiwan and China, which has existed for 40 years, should continue. The two countries should move to further reduce tensions with increased people-to-people contacts and greater economic interaction. </PARA>
<PARA> The future as I see it indicates that there is nothing to stop Australia from establishing a wide range of ties with Taiwan, short of political recognition. Provided that it does so sensibly and sensitively, it can have a mutually beneficial relationship with Taiwan, whatever Taiwan's political future. Hence we would suggest that it is important that the Australian Government-this Government whilst it remains in office and certainly us when we come to office-immediately review all facets of the long term Taiwan relationship and Australia's response to the challenge of greater practical interaction with Taiwan within present political constraints. </PARA>
<PARA> We can look at ways in which the Australian Government can facilitate documentation procedures greatly: it could allow the ACIO to process and issue visas in Taipei; it could allow it to give multi-entry business visas in Taiwan. We can look at, and should look at, the ministerial guidelines which cover the relationship, which are presently unduly bureaucratic and restrictive. We can look at ways in which there can be much more effort to disseminate information opportunities in Taiwan. We can look at the question of business immigration that I mentioned earlier and how to extend our opportunities in that regard, perhaps by placing an immigration officer with business migration experience in Taipei. We can look at perhaps giving Austrade, for the first time, a role in promoting business opportunities. We can look at putting a political officer in Taiwan-there are ways in which it could be done-so that the Australian Government could have a better understanding of the political changes that are occurring. We can look at other ways in which we can promote trade. We can look at ways in which the government departments concerned can better coordinate their contribution with the Australian Chamber of Commerce, tourism bodies and other relevant groups. As I said, we can make greater use of the education opportunities which present themselves and we can take a more realistic approach to resolving the direct air-link question, the importance of which cannot be over-emphasised. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There has long been a need to clarify the position and to remove any obstacles, or perceived obstacles, that there are between Australia and overseas countries as to the question of ownership of land. The Foreign Corporations (Application of Laws) Bill 1989 is particularly significant as far as Taiwan, the Republic of China, is concerned. It is on this aspect that I also wish to speak. Today is 21 December, which is particularly significant, because it was on 21 December 1972 that we signed an agreement with the People's Republic of China (PRC) which took back much of the relationship we had with the Republic of China, Taiwan since 1949. So it is fitting that on 21 December 1989 we should start restoring some of what we took away then.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Republic of China has been a first class neighbour, a substantial trading partner and a strong and stable influence in our area. Its progress since 1949 has been particularly spectacular. Its economic growth, trade growth, population growth and gross domestic product growth have been absolutely tremendous. In most of those respects Taiwan is an example to us. During this period we have developed trade which now amounts to approximately $3 3/4 billion a year. Taiwan is our sixth largest customer and our eighth largest supplier of goods. It is about half the size of Tasmania but it is the twelfth major trading nation of the world. </PARA>
<PARA> We must contemplate that, with all the effort we have put into it and all the money we have invested in trying to establish trade with the People's Republic of China, our trade with Taiwan still exceeds our trade with the PRC by more than 50 per cent, and this is in spite of the fact that we have no official recognition of the Republic of China, Taiwan, no tourist links, no direct air flights, no official visits, no guarantees of investment integrity and not even approval for Federal members of parliament to travel there on their official passports. </PARA>
<PARA> Although Taiwan rates as our fifth largest trading partner and although since 1949 we have had no problems or difficulties, we maintain these totally artificial and unnecessary barriers. The Senate may recall that on 15 June I gave a notice of motion along the following lines. I had hoped to get a much stronger reaction from the Government. My notice of motion reads:</PARA>
<PARA> That in view of the brutal massacre in the People's Republic of China, the Senate requests the Government to reconsider Australia's relationship with the Republic of China and Taiwan with a view to-</PARA>
<PARA> (a) recognising the strong business and cultural links already existing between the 2 countries;</PARA>
<PARA> (b) establishing direct Qantas and China Airlines flights between Australia and Taipei;</PARA>
<PARA> (c) upgrading the existing official agencies and allowing the Taiwanese to use their official names and titles as is currently allowed in the USA, Japan, and Canada;</PARA>
<PARA> (d) encouraging visits of Ministers to Taiwan to attract Taiwanese capital to develop Australia's natural resources;</PARA>
<PARA> (e) granting visas to Taiwanese Government Ministers to enable them to come to Australia and develop stronger economic and cultural relationships with the Australian-Chinese communities; and</PARA>
<PARA> (f) attracting Taiwanese undergraduates to complete their tertiary education and graduate students to pursue advanced studies in Australian universities. </PARA>
<PARA>This legislation is a start but let us go on with the job. Why do we single out Taiwan? Why must we have other countries telling us what we can and cannot do as far as our relationship with Taiwan is concerned? Surely we can make up our own minds. What is more, nothing in the 1972 manifesto conflicts with any of these issues. The pertinent clause reads:</PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Government recognises the Government of the People's Republic of China as the sole legal Government of China, acknowledges the position of the Chinese Government that Taiwan is a province of the People's Republic of China, and has decided to remove its official representation from Taiwan before 25 January 1973. </PARA>
<PARA>That is the only reference. There is nothing there that prevents Australia from doing any of the things that I have suggested or that were suggested by Senator Hill. Right now we need Taiwanese investment in Australia. We need to further increase the amount of trade between us. We need the Taiwanese to invest in Australia in steel mills, fishing plants, electrical goods manufacture, processed food factories and so on. Honourable senators should remember that at this stage Australia still has a foreign debt of about $130 billion, while Taiwan has a credit balance of about $US75 billion, second only to Japan in the world. We should also remember that Taiwan has had a gross domestic product growth of over 8 per cent for the past 15 years. Taiwan's GDP was $US300 in 1949; in 1989 it is now up to $US7,230. Its interest rates are about 9 per cent and the inflation level about 2 3/4 per cent. Taiwan's unemployment-or over-employment-has it with a deficit employment figure of about 6 per cent, so great is its economic expansion. I remind honourable senators that Taiwan is about half the size of Tasmania. </PARA>
<PARA> If we pursue higher education as an industry and as an arrangement with Taiwan we should be able to gather an extra $400m or $500m a year. If we encourage investment I believe it is possible that we could gain about $1 billion to $1 1/2 billion a year from Taiwan. If we encourage tourism we should be able to increase what we now have five or 10 times over. There are fewer than 20,000 people each way at the moment when each country has about two million tourists a year. We still process our visas in Hong Kong. It takes 10 or 12 days for anybody from Taiwan to come to Australia that way. As I said before, although we have no direct flights and no tourist offices, we are in this position with our trade; we want to be able to build further on it. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Hill mentioned the job done by Bill Mattingly and the Australian Chamber of Commerce in Taipei. I too would like to give enormous credit to the work that Mr Mattingly has done on behalf of Australian industry and in making the connections between Australia and Taiwan. It has been absolutely fantastic. I am aware that more and more senators, Government and Opposition alike, are going to Taiwan and every time I talk to them they seem to come back more and more impressed. </PARA>
<PARA> What surprises me is that I am now finding that in some respects it is far easier for people from Taiwan to deal with, go to and have various intercourse with the people on the mainland than it is for Australians. Why? We do, or do not do various things because of our perception that we might offend the People's Republic of China. The people from Taiwan can go to the mainland for bank meetings, sporting contests, family reunions, educational visits, to establish businesses and so on, yet we say we could not do that because it might upset the People's Republic of China. What an extraordinary thing! Why do we not get on and bring things up to date? This is now 1989. We are just about to verge on 1990. Let us please go back to where we were before 1972 and, without doing anything at this juncture contrary to the agreement that we have got, let us please start to bring things up to date in our relationship with Taiwan. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I just want to take this opportunity, in debating the Family Law Amendment Bill, to highlight a number of areas in which I believe the Family Law Act is not functioning as well as it should or might be. In doing so, I accept what this Bill is trying to do. I note that the Bill will amend the present Family Law Act of 1975 to implement recommendations from the Australian Law Reform Commission concerning enforcement of orders made under the Act and will provide additional facilities relating to sentencing alternatives. It will also permit courts to order the arrest of people who contravene access or custody orders and will strengthen injunctions made for the personal safety of people involved in family law proceedings. All these issues are vital to people presently experiencing enormous difficulties relating to family law matters.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> For those of us who have never experienced a marriage break-up such issues as access and custody are foreign. But the reality is that in Australia at the present time approximately one in three marriages will end in divorce and, of those who remarry, 50 per cent will seek another divorce. We are, therefore, talking about amendments that affect a very large number of people in the community. Probably the most vital aspects of family law are the provisions relating to access and custody. Understandably, these issues are the hardest to tackle and the most acrimonious debate is associated with these two particular problems. </PARA>
<PARA> Traditionally in the Western world, and certainly in the eyes of the Family Court, the mother is the carer of children and natural custodian. Yet I am told by the Lone Fathers Association that in fact there are in Australia at the present time 120,000 fathers looking after children on their own. As a community, we probably do not realise that there are many fathers out there looking after children. Certainly our work force and employment conditions make little acknowledgment of that particular fact. While child-care facilities and issues such as maternity leave are becoming more acceptable to employers, the issue of paternity leave is only just coming to the surface. </PARA>
<PARA> The Lone Fathers Association and other groups such as Parents Without Rights have fought for a long time to have society in general, and the courts in particular, acknowledge that fathers are also child carers and sole parents. Therefore, in light of the experience of their members this organisation has been a very strong advocate for revision of the Family Law Act. This group and dozens of others like it have to deal with the reality of marriage break-up every day of the year. They know the failings and weaknesses of the present legislation as well as any because they deal regularly with the administrative results. The Lone Fathers Association alone gets 3,000 calls from fathers with custody and access difficulties. </PARA>
<PARA> My involvement with family law and its administration has come about only since my election to the Senate-in fact, even more recently than that. Earlier this year the State conference of my Party passed a resolution calling for a thorough review of the Family Law Act and for a Senate or full parliamentary inquiry. As the only National Party Senator for New South Wales, I was approached and asked to facilitate such an inquiry. In the intervening months I have sought to do that, and on 17 October this year I gave notice of a motion which in part called for a full parliamentary inquiry into the Family Law Act and its present interpretation as soon as practicable after the commencement of the next Parliament, with particular attention being given to such issues as custody, access, maintenance and property disputes. I place on record the support that I have received from Government Ministers and senators and also the Australian Democrats on this issue. It is a matter of history that the National and Liberal parties' law and justice policy also supports such an inquiry. I quote from the relevant sections of that policy:</PARA>
<PARA> Review of Family Law-Community concerns about the Family Law Act will be addressed by a parliamentary committee which will review the operations of the Family Court and family law and some of the basic principles on which issues of great importance are determined. </PARA>
<PARA>As I said, I trust and hope that there will be a bipartisan approach to this Act by all parties after the next election. I believe that such a review is essential. Since I started my quest for this review I have heard some of the saddest stories I am ever likely to hear. One cannot imagine the pain and bitterness that are involved when a family separates. I do not believe that any piece of legislation can be perfect, particularly when it deals with such sensitive issues as children, access, custody and property. Equally, however, I do not believe that this Act and, more importantly, the interpretation and present administration of it, are fair. I believe that the present family law courts are failing the people who go to them seeking help. There are too many bizarre examples of justice for it to be accidental, but I will not go into detail on these today. </PARA>
<PARA> We need to get some sort of equity back into the system that deals with inequities. We do not have the wisdom of Solomon but I think we as law-makers must create a more effective justice than that which we have at present. I welcome the amendments contained in this legislation but they do not get right to the core of the problems that beset the family law. I accept that we can do little about establishing a parliamentary inquiry into this issue prior to the election, but, as I have already said, I intend to persist with and pursue this issue immediately the election is over. I repeat: I hope there is a bipartisan approach to this issue after the election. </PARA>
<PARA> The frustrations that people are experiencing need to be addressed. We cannot put them into the too hard basket and hope that they go away. We know what can happen when people go past their boiling point. Sadly, some family law judges have been killed and others are under 24-hour security, which indicates the seriousness of the problem. I am told that, in most cases of violence resulting from family law actions, it is lack of access to one's children that causes men, and presumably, women to become violent. Is access to be a privilege, or is to be a right? How do the courts assess custody and access? A large number of people in the community believe that these issues are judged very unfairly at the moment. The Family Law Act was hailed in 1975 as a breakthrough in the resolution of family disputes. The concept and, indeed, the legislation have many positive aspects. We need to examine these positive aspects and examine critically the down side of the law and realise that we have perhaps replaced one inexorable and unfair system with another. </PARA>
<PARA> The couples that are childless may both agree to divorce and where mutual agreement on property is reached, family law works well. It is a civilised and equitable system to end a marriage. If divorce cannot be painless then at least for those people the present family law system is the least painful. For those with children the present law clearly is not working. </PARA>
<PARA> I note that the recent Child Support (Assessment) Act has been criticised by the Law Council of Australia, which is concerned about the huge financial and social implications for second families that the implementations of the courts will increase as the Act applies to more and more families. This Act established a formula whereby set percentages are deemed an appropriate maintenance level for children. So a non-custodial parent with one child would pay 18 per cent of taxable income; two children, 27 per cent; three children, 32 per cent, and so on. The legislation has already placed enormous burdens on men with second families, yet this aspect appears not to have been considered by the draftsmen when this Act was drawn up. </PARA>
<PARA> Returning to this legislation, I accept that the amendments are a step in the right direction, but I do not believe that they get to the core of the problem. Even these amendments have some difficulties. I know that the Lone Fathers Association is concerned that State police, for example, should have the same powers in family law matters as Federal police. When access is denied there is little recourse for non-custodial parents and these amendments do not do much to streamline the procedure one needs to follow. It is at present necessary to develop a case of denied access and even then, in real terms, there is little that can be done. These amendments strengthen that a little but do not avoid the delays in having to go to court in the first place. That is a lengthy and potentially expensive exercise and it would seem more often than not that it is a waste of time. We must improve what we have.

<PARA>Dear Senator,</PARA>
<PARA> We the undersigned concerned citizens, wish to bring to your notice our dissatisfaction with the present legislation pertaining to the Family Law Act. Whilst the Act, as it stands might make divorce easier, child custody has become another ``possession'', along with property settlement on the matrimonial battleground. </PARA>
<PARA> The Family Law Act concerns all citizens, and society as a whole has a responsibility to ensure that children caught between this conflict are not socially deprived of equal access to both parents wherever possible, a human right necessary for normal childhood development. </PARA>
<PARA> We suggest that the Family Law Act as it stands, frustrates and antagonises many people into violence. Research suggests that as high as one quarter of all murder victims in Australia are killed by a family member. This fact alone is a telling sign of the inadequacies of the present enactment. Further to this, it is all too easy for one partner to make allegations that a child of the marriage has been sexually abused by the estranged partner. American studies have shown that a high percentage of these alleged abuses do not occur. </PARA>
<PARA> Accordingly, we request that representations be made on our behalf to bring to the notice of the legislature our dissatisfaction of the Family Law legislation and further request urgent action be taken to address a totally unacceptable situation. </PARA>

<PARA> Senator Hill was called out unexpectedly; I know he wanted to speak in this debate. For the benefit of time, I seek leave to have his notes incorporated in Hansard. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The notes read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA>One of the most significant changes introduced by this Bill, and one which the Opposition welcomes, is the addition of community service orders to the penalties available to the Court for breach of orders. This will fill the gap which currently exists between minor sanctions and the most serious penalty, imprisonment, which courts are understandably reluctant to use in any but the most serious cases. </PARA>
<PARA>The Government has also at last recognised the usefulness of stipulating a maximum length of imprisonment in matrimonial causes. The Bill provides for the current open-ended provision to be replaced with a 12-month maximum. </PARA>
<PARA>In this Bill, the definition of ``judge'' for the purposes of section 14 is extended to include Judicial Registrars and Registrars of the Family Court. This is to make it clear that they all have the same obligation to consider the possibility of reconciliation between the parties to proceedings under the Act, and to direct counselling where appropriate. The emphasis on reconciliation and counselling is of course one which the Opposition strongly supports. </PARA>
<PARA>This Bill also confers on the Court the power, where a section 64 search warrant has been issued for a child, to order a person having information about the whereabouts of the child to provide that information to the court. </PARA>
<PARA>A significant change introduced by this Bill is the provision for registration of child maintenance agreements in respect of ex-nuptial children. Such agreements can already be lodged in respect of children of a marriage, but the provision for children born outside marriage is a new one, and one which is welcomed by the Opposition. Of course, this would only apply in those four States which have referred the power to legislate with respect to ex-nuptial children to the Commonwealth. </PARA>
<PARA> Under this Bill, the provisions in the Act dealing with sanctions for contravention of custody and access orders and injunctions, and contempt of court will be unified. </PARA>
<PARA> The following sanctions will be available, and they may be used singly or in combination:</PARA>
<PARA> imprisonment for a maximum of 12 months, which can only be imposed if the court is satisfied that there is no other way of dealing with the contravention;</PARA>
<PARA> suspended sentences;</PARA>
<PARA> fines of up to $2000 for a natural person or $10000 for a body corporate;</PARA>
<PARA> recognizances to be of good behaviour for up to 2 years;</PARA>
<PARA> community-based options such as community service orders, with a maximum number of 500 hours;</PARA>
<PARA> sequestration;</PARA>
<PARA> requirement to deliver a document to the Registrar, such as a passport; and</PARA>
<PARA> compensatory access orders, which are a new sanction, designed to make up for access which is lost as a result of the breach of an access order. </PARA>
<PARA>Other changes include the transfer of the Australian Institute of Family Studies from the Attorney-General's Department to the Department of Social Security, purportedly because of the impact of A.I.F.S. reports on the social security system. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition is supporting this Bill, and in particular we welcome the broadening of the range of sentencing options available as sanctions against contravention of court orders, and the clear statement that imprisonment is the sanction of last resort. </PARA>
<PARA> The only other comment that I would like to make in relation to this Bill, is to reiterate the Coalition position that, in view of the widespread community dissatisfaction with many aspects of family law and the Family Court system, they should be referred to a Committee for thorough review. </PARA>

The Australian Broadcasting Tribunal is the independent body responsible for the administration of broadcasting standards, including the question of the amount of advertising time permitted on commercial stations. The Australian Broadcasting Tribunal has not concluded its inquiry into the matter and it would be, therefore, somewhat premature for the Minister to comment, if indeed he wished to comment at all, before the ABT finished its inquiry.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister representing the Prime Minister. I refer to the Government's submission to the Industrial Relations Commission to increase substantially the salary package of about 1,600 members of the Commonwealth Senior Executive Service (SES). Is it true that, if this submission is approved, some Senior Executive Service members at the top of the pay scale are set to receive increases in the order of 30 per cent, the same sort of rise sought by pilots and so bitterly opposed by the Government on the ground that it would wreck the wages system? I just say to the Minister in putting this question that I certainly acknowledge the need to retain talented senior public servants and to provide more market related packages to do so. But I ask: How does the Government propose to justify increases of this magnitude within the accord framework so that other employees in Australia will have some better idea of what the rules of the game actually are?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not have a great deal of information about this matter, but let me say that, as I understand it, the submission is considered by the Commonwealth to be consistent with the structural efficiency principles and with the current wage fixing guidelines in terms of the percentage payable to the work force generally. This decision also involves changes in work value. But my understanding is that members of the SES are in a somewhat anomalous position compared with the general work force in the sense that there has been no major review of salaries in this area for a very long time. I will try to obtain some further information for the honourable senator, but I think the submission was crafted to be in line with the structural efficiency principle.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr President, I have a supplementary question. I thank the Minister for that answer and note that he is going to seek further information. Again I stress that my view is that these changes are certainly warranted in view of the loss of very good senior managers from the Public Service. In getting that further information, will he seek confirmation that one of the major reasons for making the change is that in fact there is a serious risk of losing further senior officers simply because they are not getting comparable wage and salary packages with equivalent private sector managers and that, rather than changes in work value or any matters relating to structural efficiency, underlies this proposal by the Government? In that framework, will the Minister see that the reply covers the question of when demand for labour and the inability to maintain people in positions are relevant factors in determining wage increases? For example, staff who service aircraft have been in very short supply in Australia because the wages offered are simply not high enough to get the required number; so it is a matter of great practical importance. Will he examine that point in giving his further reply?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4F4">Senator BUTTON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I can answer that question. In respect of the first part of the question, let me say that for some two years at least that I can remember there has been concern about the relative level of SES salaries compared with salaries offered in the private sector and there has been considerable wastage from the public sector into the private sector because of those very substantial salary differentials, apart from other things. The proposal being put to the Industrial Relations Commission in respect of Public Service salaries will not in itself address that problem because the discrepancies or differences are considerably greater still than will be rectified by this proposal.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I think in the second part of the question, Senator Chaney referred to the problem, of which we have all been aware, of aircraft maintenance personnel and the particular problem which Qantas Airways Ltd has had in attracting and retaining highly skilled maintenance personnel for aircraft. That is a particularly dramatic example, in the Qantas case, of skill shortage in the labour market and that has exacerbated the already difficult problems of salary differentials in terms of pirating from firms such as Qantas and so on. I do not recall the exact figures but I think Qantas brought some 60 licensed aircraft engineers from overseas and lost about 40 of them in two months. I think that is a most dramatic case. I do not think one can solve skill shortage problems by application of salary increases in terms of looking at an aggregate industry picture.</PARA>

The Qantas pilots situation has turned out to be totally different from the domestic airline pilots situation, the domestic airline pilots having sought a 30 per cent increase which for a long time was not negotiable, in their terms. The Qantas pilots have, through their appropriate organisation, negotiated what was in fact a 13 or 14 per cent increase. It was regarded as consistent with the structural efficiency principle and was one which they, I think, worked hard at justifying in the Industrial Relations Commission, with undoubted success. One sees that difference in approach between the Qantas airline pilots and the domestic airline pilots.

Indeed, today, together with my colleague the Queensland Attorney-General Mr Deane Wells, we are announcing a $37m package to provide for the legal aid requirements of all Queenslanders. This follows more than a year of frustration and delay because of the refusal of the former National Party Government to genuinely negotiate. Indeed, I have to tell the Senate that, unfortunately, decisions taken by the outgoing National Party Attorney-General during the election campaign had the effect of preventing aid in family law matters and to social security beneficiaries, which was absolutely dastardly, particularly as it was done during the campaign.

<PARA> The new arrangements for the Queensland Legal Aid Commission provide for a 55:45 percentage split between the Commonwealth and the State in the provision of its net operating costs. This will help to ensure access to the legal system for all Queenslanders. It is important for them to be able to vindicate their rights and to be effectively represented, particularly when facing a criminal charge which may result, especially, in imprisonment. The change of government in Queensland heralds, I believe, a new era of constructive cooperation between our two governments. This is a particular instance of where the social justice strategies of both governments mesh and are effective for all Queenslanders. Essentially the agreement puts a floor under the level of funding based on a long term commitment by both governments to the maintenance of an effective legal aid system. There has been a recognition by both sides of the legitimate role of the Commonwealth and State governments in the provision of adequate legal aid. Every other State and the Northern Territory have already indicated agreement with the Commonwealth. The result of Mr Wells's constructive approach is that Queenslanders are now guaranteed the protection of legal aid which had previously been in jeopardy.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs. How many applications for permanent residence have been received by the Government since 4 June 1989 from Chinese students in Australia? Given the fact that almost certain reprisals face Chinese students currently in Australia upon their return to China, how quickly are these applications being dealt with and how many have so far been granted? How many of the Chinese students in Australia took part in pro-democracy demonstrations against the Government of the People's Republic of China (PRC)? Are these students, who are particularly vulnerable to reprisals, being given special and sympathetic consideration regarding their applications for permanent resident status?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="5027" SPEAKER="Ray Sen The Hon R.F." NAMEID="UI4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="VIC" MINISTERIAL="IMMIGRATION, LOCAL GOVERNMENT AND ETHNIC AFFAIRS" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="UI4">Senator ROBERT RAY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not have any figures immediately available, but I will fill in the background for Senator Haines's benefit so she can understand what the approach has been. On 16 June the Prime Minister announced that all PRC nationals in Australia could remain in Australia, irrespective of whether they were here illegally or legally, until 31 July 1990. One of the reasons for that extension was so that at some stage this Government could do an assessment of the position in China because one could not predict, immediately after those events, whether things would settle down or move in a particular direction. We were not anxious at that stage to encourage people to put in applications without knowing what the circumstances would be down the track.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Because we are now half way to that cut-off point, two weeks ago I announced that PRC nationals in Australia could extend their stay and that we would extend our protective umbrella to those people until 31 January 1991. I also said that it would be necessary for those in Australia to have valid temporary entry permits. Those who were here legally on 20 June may apply between 15 January 1990 and 31 March 1990 to stay here. Those who are here illegally may also apply for a temporary entry permit for the same period between 15 January and 31 March and they also will have protection until 31 January 1991.</PARA>
<PARA> I think that the time has now come for me to say that if PRC nationals in Australia believe they qualify for refugee status or whatever in this country, now is the time to apply. Whilst for the first six months after the Prime Minister's announcement we said that there was no need to hurry, we would like people to start applying-at least to apply before 31 July 1990. Normally any delay in people applying for refugee status could be taken by the relevant committee as people not being serious. We have made it quite clear in this case that that will not be a factor that intrudes in the assessment, but if people wait until after 31 July next year to apply for refugee status it may be considered that they are not serious.</PARA>
<PARA> Senator Haines asked me how many students participated in pro-democracy demonstrations in Australia. I do not know-I suspect 500 per cent more than actually did. But any one of these claims in the refugee area will be dealt with individually unless Cabinet, in its consideration of the overall Chinese position, decides otherwise. I will get Senator Haines the figures of how many people have applied so far. One thing she will notice is that more forms have gone out than there are PRC nationals in Australia, but many have not been filled in. I reiterate once again, even though it was part of Senator Haines's question, that recently we have made four grants-in-aid available to different Chinese organisations to give advice in this area. We have made money available to the refugee advisory case work service to advise Chinese students. Let us urge all that we know to use those services and not the shysters in the legal profession that have only one thing in mind-money.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;If I can take the last part of the question first, I am aware of the expressions of concern uttered by Ms Meredith Hellicar, who appears to be now the new Executive Director of the New South Wales Coal Association. They were reported in yesterday's Australian. Yes, Senator Faulkner has accurately quoted her anxiety that the New South Wales State Government could threaten the viability of the industry's recovery. The quote goes on:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>. . . Government charges-rail freight, port loaders and coal royalties-had all risen strongly in the last year.</PARA>
<PARA> Ms Hellicar said the industry's stronger position was largely due to extensive restructuring of the work force, recommended by the Coal Industry Tribunal in 1988.</PARA>
<PARA> However, she said it was still early days and the association regarded the profit as part of an embryonic recovery.</PARA>
<PARA> `The industry must continue to restructure the workforce, which goes hand in hand with reducing costs'. . . .</PARA>
<PARA>Thus it is we have a concern on behalf of the New South Wales coal industry about what State government taxes and charges are doing to a profitability margin that is creeping up because of the structural reforms that this Government has managed to put in place and because of the decision of the Coal Industry Tribunal.</PARA>
<PARA> If I can go back to the earlier part of Senator Faulkner's question, the Australian coal industry is at this stage, given the fortunes of wool, probably our largest single export earner. It shipped from mine production 150 million tonnes last year, 99.3 per cent of which went to overseas markets. It earned, in 1988-89, $4.7 billion and, since it shipped more in 1989-90 than it did the previous year, will earn more this financial year. It employs over 30,000 Australians.</PARA>
<PARA> The Commonwealth Government has tried to assist the development of the coal industry in three ways: firstly, through grants for research and development through the national energy, research, development and demonstration program. Yesterday we passed Bills to enable the establishment of a coal research and development corporation which we hope the industry will pick up. That will encourage further research and development into not only better mining techniques but also cleaner-burning technology to enhance the sales of our product.</PARA>
<PARA> The two other significant bodies that we have in place are one with the New South Wales Government-the Joint Coal Board-and one of our own, the Coal Marketing and Technology Council. The purpose of the Technology Council is to enhance our coal export trade and to do a number of things in the promotion of coal associated with improved technology. The Joint Coal Board is a joint body between the Commonwealth and the State and does a whole range of activities concerning improving the productivity of mining, better health and safety, better training, and so on. It is the intention, it would appear, of the Opposition-if its program as outlined in the Economic Action Plan were to be realised-to abolish both the Joint Coal Board and the Coal Marketing and Technology Council at a time when industry spokesmen are saying that the New South Wales Government is pinching their profit by higher taxes and charges and to abolish two of the three Federal mechanisms that we have in place to try to improve the fortunes of this industry. This is at a time when we all know that, given as well the abolition proposal for capital gains tax, the President of the Liberal Party is to obtain a windfall gain of $18m.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not recall seeing a petition from these particular locally engaged staff members in Hong Kong, most of whom have got a great track record in terms of serving this country. The overall policy, I think, rather than just the policy for those who work for the Australian Government, must be under consideration, although there are a lot of myths about, I must say, as to what some other countries are doing. By the time they reach Australia they tend to reach mammoth proportions and, on investigation with those home countries, then start to disappear.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We have been asked by different insurance companies who have staff there and others as to what the long term prospects for migration to Australia are. The general answer we give them is that, if they qualify, they may come to Australia and that, if they do not qualify, they are like anyone else. The more difficult question to solve is that, when they qualify to come, most of those companies do not want them to leave immediately. However, if they do not have some sort of long-term security and offer, they run the risk of being poached by another country. This raises a dilemma for us. Do we modify our very non-discriminatory policy and well-thought-out criteria for entry into this country in these circumstances? Of course, one of the answers long term is that many of these people who qualify under employer nomination could well come to Australia and then return short term to Hong Kong. That seems to have satisfied the Australian Chamber of Commerce in Hong Kong-to explore those possibilities.</PARA>
<PARA> Locally engaged staff traditionally have had, though, a degree of entitlement over and above others to come to Australia. Some, I believe-I say `believe' because I have not had this confirmed-may have already been visa'd to come to Australia. Others may not have at this stage. There would be also, I think, some provision under the special eligibility criteria for migration to Australia, which covers a wide range of things, for these people to qualify under that particular scheme as well.</PARA>
<PARA> We also have to be conscious, though, that we do not generally go out and recruit around the world. We do not have to; we have too many inquiries as it is. People in Hong Kong are suffering from the problem of brain drain; it is a problem to the authorities in Hong Kong and we do not want to be out there actively recruiting in this regard unless it is by way of employer nomination. Hence, that is the way the Qantas Airways Ltd engineers from Hong Kong have come to Australia. For most people, employer nomination is the best route in terms of people who have served Australia well overseas. They normally are given some possibility to migrate to the country, but they must come-I think Senator Archer would have to agree-within cooee of our normal immigration requirements.</PARA>

As I said, in certain cases some of these people will qualify to come to Australia in any event. Some may come to Australia and return to Hong Kong to work in any event. But do not talk to me about the generosity of the United Kingdom and its treatment of people in Hong Kong.

They will either get there at 6 o'clock in the morning or they will be out of a job the next day, because Hong Kong is a vibrant, energetic community that has made enormous strides over the last two or three decades.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Australian Conservation Foundation, joined by an applicant, Michael Stanley Harewood, took an application against me under the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act on the basis that I had misconducted myself in declaring, examining and arriving at a prudent and feasible alternative to logging in National Estate in the south-eastern forests of New South Wales. Mr Justice Davies yesterday delivered a decision in Sydney on that application. The best way of answering the question `what did the decision do' is to quote from the minutes of the order under the heading `The Court orders' on the facing page of that decision. It says that the application be dismissed and that the applicant pay the respondent's costs of the proceedings. On the basis of that I take the 49 pages of decision that follow those orders as a vindication of the process I entered into to discover whether there were prudent and feasible alternative to logging in the National Estate in the New South Wales south-eastern forests. I note that the court has ordered the applicants to pay the costs of the proceedings; that is a decision of the court. Given the length of the case, I have to observe, in passing, that that will indeed be a fairly weighty cost.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA> Going to the other questions from Senator Schacht, I do not believe that it was necessary for the ACF to take out this application. My door has always been open and I am always available to consult on matters of this nature. Indeed, I have put in the public domain all of the information which was, by the court process, adduced in court as well. With respect to the other parts of the question concerning implications, Professor Bryant Richards, who heads the study team into the flora and fauna properties of the south-east forests will report to me at three o'clock today on his interim findings as to the properties of the south-east forests in the study area, and I will release tomorrow his report for public consumption, again consistent with my policy of open and transparent activity in this area.</PARA>
<PARA> In the beginning of the year the Commonwealth Government was criticised by, among others, Ian Causley, the Minister for Natural Resources in New South Wales, for improperly calculating the resource necessary to sustain the industry for 12 months. We have come to the end of our calculations and I am pleased to advise the Senate that the Commonwealth calculations in that process have been proven to be right. The industry has been sustained at the proper levels for the whole of that year and we have kept faith with that undertaking. Thus, what was held to be a device by us to misrepresent our intention is in fact no longer viable. We have performed as we said we would.</PARA>
<PARA> Finally, if there is a Christmas message in all of this for anyone, I would like to say that the workers in the industry deserve some recognition because, while I in no way criticise the sincerity and the idealism of environmental protesters in the south-east forests, the ordinary Australian workers who have been subjected to those protests and who are carrying out the directions of their companies ought not in any circumstances to be the meat in the sandwich. Their cause needs some consideration and I wish to record my recognition of their restraint and discipline in those circumstances and say to them, through this question, that we will get our resource calculations right again next year and we will be able to deliver to them employment security within the terms of what we seek to achieve in that agreement and that the actions of the Commonwealth are equally balanced in protecting employment and achieving a proper and genuine environmental outcome.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4E4">Senator RICHARDSON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As Senator Dunn would be aware, from the time the Government announced the third runway decision it was determined that the environmental impact statement (EIS) would be rigorous. Given that the interests, and possibly the health and safety of several hundred thousand people-certainly is so far as it was perceived by them-were to suffer immediate effects, a number of community groups, some of which had been there for quite some time and some to which were new, sought to fight the decision. Certainly, all of them wanted to make sure that they had a proper input into the EIS process. I think they were entitled to that desire.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Both the Minister for Transport and Communications, Mr Willis, and I received quite a number of representations from community groups. I think what they were suggesting to us was that they wanted to be able to completely contribute to and review the technical issues which would be apparent in a draft EIS. They wanted to make sure that, when we reached the period for public comment, their comments were as educated as possible.</PARA>
<PARA> A number of groups presented proposals. Essentially they came from three groups: the Second Sydney Airport Coalition, the Airport Coordination Task Force and the Residents Opposition to the Third Runway. RORT, as the Residents Opposition to the Third Runway termed itself, and the SSAC-the Airport Coalition-had asked for money for noise studies. In particular they wanted those studies to be conducted by a Dr Bullen. The decision which Mr Willis and I came to was that provided Senator Walsh was in agreement-and that is an agreement that we have yet to secure formally-$100,000 could be transferred from Mr Willis's Department, which does not have any programs under which this sort of money can be paid, to mine, which does, so we could make money available for that purpose. As I understand it, Dr Bullen has already been sitting in on seminars that Kinhills have been conducting on the third runway and his expertise will be applied to noise studies over the coming months.</PARA>
<PARA> The group to which Senator Dunn referred as being dominated by ALP councils is a pretty broad group indeed. First off, it should be stated that around the airport there are quite a number of councils and they are pretty well all Labor. The fact that they are Labor councils does not mean that they are in some way prevented from contributing. The fact is that the people of those regions have voted for them in droves for all of their lives and the lives of their parents and grandparents, so why should they not be represented? I do not see that as hindering their capacity in any way. They are the elected representatives of the people. I might say that it is not just a Labor Party group, it is open to all councils. Councils such as Hunters Hill and Lane Cove have chosen not to be associated with the working class, and that is up to them. But now we face the situation where, even amongst those councils-from memory, at least two-they have independent mayors. The two councils are Leichhardt and Rockdale. My understanding is that they will continue to take part in the group. I certainly hope that is the case.</PARA>
<PARA> Associated with that group are quite a number of community groups such as Marrickville Airport Watch and a number of groups in the Rockdale and Botany area. So they are not all Labor Party groups: a whole range of groups are associated with that council-led group. On the basis that noise studies were to be well and truly covered by the applications made by the other two groups, they have sought to have money allocated for a number of other studies. These would involve hydrological studies in Botany Bay. Clearly, no matter where one stands on the third runway issue, there must be an effect on Botany Bay. Given that it provides a recreational amenity for hundreds of thousands of people in Sydney, there is no reason why studies should not be conducted on it. There are other health and safety aspects which concerned people there, not to mention studies on the economics of a third runway as against alternatives which must also be covered in the EIS.</PARA>
<PARA> What Mr Willis and I were faced with were, in our view, two entirely legitimate requests for funding, and we are meeting them. We are still to determine whether or not we will pay the money directly to the consultants who are being employed for the purpose of studying these things or whether we will pay it to the groups. But whatever happens, we will be absolutely certain that every dollar of it is accountable. I would hope that an agreement on exactly how the money can be paid, and an agreement with Senator Walsh, can be completed in the next few weeks. Then we will proceed to make sure the interests of Sydney residents-hundreds of thousands of them are involved-are properly covered. That, I would have thought, is the essence of good government and this is a good government.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;A Federal politician now faces great dangers; one could always have a casual shave at five minutes to eight in the morning without listening to local sawdust Caesars romp across the airwaves of the Australian Broadcasting Corporation. That is no longer possible-and I am one of those guilty of voting for self-government in the Australian Capital Territory! Mr Collaery, however, for the first time in my listening to him has got one thing right. One of the reasons we amended the Migration Act and the regulations was that we lost in the court all the time. We lost in the court all the time because of inadequate drafting of the Act and a desire by justices, at no matter what level, to delve into merit review rather than legal matters. To help them resist that temptation we have tightened up the Act so that it is very difficult for judges to go into merits review. We have set up an independent immigration review tribunal. We went before a particular Federal Court judge 16 times for 16 losses; but we won nine of the nine cases on which we appealed. Therefore, in any future such cases we will probably be able to resist merits review.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The second question concerned whether we are going back to the White Australia days. I really think that is the sort of rhetoric best left for the local Australian Capital Territory Legislative Assembly. Mr Collaery also went on to say that he is going to use officers of his own Department, because he is also Attorney-General, to look at our Federal regulations. I am sure Senator Reid and others would be interested in that misuse of resources. Mr Collaery is, or was-and his firm still is-active in the immigration area. It was of great regret to my Department that he went into politics because the only person we never had trouble winning a case against in court was Mr Collaery. I will put up my credibility against his any day. I want to make only two points with respect to credibility. I remember a classic quote from Senator Richardson; I just have to repeat it. On 6 March this year Mr Collaery said:</PARA>
<PARA>As far as we're concerned, we'll form a grouping with community based people who want to really work there outside political pyramids, outside political machines and the very fact that they were there, is because we reject the concept of political party machines, so we won't form a coalition with Liberal and Labor, they will have to come down to us and find a community base.</PARA>
<PARA>Mr Collaery's credibility! The other thing that I found amazing about Mr Collaery was that in an earnest appeal to get votes he said that by his going into politics his law firm would lose $50,000. He then put down his pecuniary interest statement which showed that even though he had a gross income of over $145,000 a year his net income was $3,000 a year. Maybe he was paid on performance; I am not sure.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is a real question without notice. I recall that some years ago when Senator Townley and some other colleagues circulated a menu of what we were to have on Christmas Day, giving various alternatives as to whether we wanted a Protestant or Catholic priest to give the grace, whether we wanted ham or turkey, et cetera. The only thing that disappointed me about that was that someone on my side filled it out seriously. That person is no longer here so I can at least say that. To get serious in terms of the date of Christmas Day, various biblical scholars and astrologers in the 1920s and 1930s did suggest that Christmas Day in fact was not 25 December but much later. I am sure that an erudite senator such as Senator Crichton-Browne has taken that into account. The only difficulty with that revisionist view of history is that later evidence now supports the original text in the Bible and therefore 25 December probably is the day. As everyone knows, the main reason for keeping honourable senators sitting so long is the travel allowance. Honourable senators are not only getting extra travel allowance; they cannot spend it on Christmas presents.</PARA></TALK.START>

Will the Minister please explain the lack of initiative by his Department to take steps to correct this abysmal situation, which in effect denies radiotherapy treatment to over 10,000 newly diagnosed cancer patients in Australia each year, not only increasing suffering but also jeopardising the chance of cure in significant numbers of patients?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA> The document read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA> Senator Coulter's question refers to the alleged shortage of equipment and facilities for radiotherapy services and the recent report for the Australian Health Ministers' Advisory Council on Radiation Oncology.</PARA>
<PARA> The report was considered by AHMAC on 20 October 1989 but remains confidential until AHMAC has made a formal decision to release it.</PARA>
<PARA> The figures quoted by Senator Coulter of patients being denied treatment are theoretical. They rest largely on comparisons with overseas countries and the relatively low proportion of cancer patients in Australia who receive radiation therapy (35% in Australia compared with 45-55% in comparable countries overseas).</PARA>
<PARA> However, in considering the working party's report AHMAC was not prepared to endorse any particular referral rate.</PARA>
<PARA>AHMAC's decision recognises that there is no available evidence to suggest that Australian referral rates should be the same as other countries; and</PARA>
<PARA>In particular that there is no evidence that survival rates of cancer patients in Australia are worse than elsewhere as a consequence of the lower rate of referrals.</PARA>
<PARA> The AHMAC working party report also makes it clear the availability of equipment is only one of many factors which can influence the availability of, and demand for, radiotherapy. Geographical factors, the availability of radiation oncologists and therapeutic radiographers and limited knowledge of the usage of radiotherapy by referring doctors are all important factors.</PARA>
<PARA> Claims that there are large numbers of Australians who would benefit from radiotherapy but who do not have access because of lack of facilities are not supported by information presented to AHMAC by the working party.</PARA>
<PARA>A survey conducted by the working party in December 1988 found that in general there were no significant waiting lists for radiotherapy services</PARA>
<PARA>This would indicate that those cancer patients not receiving radiotherapy services are being treated by the other cancer treatment modalities, chemotherapy and surgery.</PARA>
<PARA>There is also little evidence comparing the relative effectiveness of different types of cancer treatments.</PARA>
<PARA> The majority of radiotherapy services are provided in the public sector which is appropriate given the generally accepted view that radiation oncology services should be provided in comprehensive centres with strong links to other services.</PARA>
<PARA> Public hospital services are financed through the state/Commonwealth medicare agreements. These provide annual grants which do not specify in detail what services should be financed. Thus the actual amount of Commonwealth funding cannot be specified.</PARA>
<PARA> Priority for and the level of funding of radiotherapy services is essentially a matter for the States.</PARA>
<PARA>In responding to the AHMAC report most States indicated that they are addressing the needs for radiotherapy services to 1995 and have developed, or are currently developing, strategic plans for staff and equipment levels which are generally in line with the recommendations of the working party.</PARA>
<PARA>In addition the Commonwealth has also made $50m available under the hospital enhancement program to be matched by states to provide $75m in both 1989-90 and 1990-91 to enable states to improve the capital equipment in public hospitals.</PARA>
<PARA>This follows a similar program, the teaching hospitals capital equipment program, between 1985-86 and 1987-88 under which the Commonwealth provided $150m to assist States with capital acquisition.</PARA>
<PARA>States determine their own priorities for capital expenditure but some of these funds have already been used for improved radiation oncology services.</PARA>
<PARA>For example, commencement, from June this year, of radiotherapy services at Box Hill in Victoria at a cost of $1.9m.</PARA>
<PARA>The potential is there for States to use most of the funds for radiation oncology services if they chose.</PARA>
<PARA>Funding for radiotherapy treatment has also been available for many years through medical benefits for services to private patients.</PARA>
<PARA>In February 1988 the Commonwealth extended its financial support to cover computerised radiotherapy planning services for private patients.</PARA>
<PARA>In 1988-89 total Federal Government expenditure for radiotherapy services for private patients amounted to some $11m.</PARA>
<PARA>The Federal Government support for private radiation oncology services is not restricted to existing facilities and new facilities are free to commence operation at any time as long as they meet State requirements for such operations. Medicare benefits would automatically be payable for new private services.</PARA>
<PARA>But given the high capital costs involved there is a need for a coordinated approach between the public and private sector.</PARA>
<PARA>Discussions are currently underway between the Commonwealth Department of Community Services and Health and the Royal Australasian College of Radiologists (RACR) over the expansion of services provided by private sector radiation oncology practices and schedule fees for such services.</PARA>
<PARA>The Minister for Community Services and Health expects to make an announcement shortly on funding for private sector units and improved schedule fees.</PARA>
<PARA>It is also important to recognise however that opening new private centres is not a quick solution.</PARA>
<PARA>Owing to the lengthy periods involved in training new radiation oncologists and therapeutic radiographers immediate provision of additional facilities may simply drain staff from existing public facilities.</PARA>
<PARA>And would not lead to any additional treatments until such time as extra staff are available.</PARA>

At the same time, and particularly because of the initiative of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission inquiry, the Commonwealth announced in the 1989 Budget a package of measures aimed largely at assisting homeless youth.

This $100m is all new money and is additional to the funding increases in the specific programs in the Commonwealth-State Housing Agreement.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The $100m covers a wide ranging package of assistance across a number of portfolios. There is particular emphasis, however, on increased accommodation and support options; improved access to health, education, training, employment and income support provisions; and counselling and mediation assistance. The package is particularly designed to focus heavily on assistance for homeless and other disadvantaged youth in a community context, to achieve positive outcomes for youth, and to ensure coordination of planning and service delivery. It is essential that we maintain effective links between the Commonwealth, the community and the States in order to ensure the success of this essential program.</PARA>
<PARA> There are a number of other accommodation-housing programs which will also provide assistance to homeless youth. These include accommodation programs which will provide $5m in growth funds per annum, matched dollar for dollar with the States; upgraded assessment; and improved links with other services. The crisis accommodation program will also provide growth from $19.5m in 1988-89 to $39m in 1989-90: $7m of this increase is for youth. There will be an additional $10m if the States match recurrent funding.</PARA>
<PARA> The local government and community housing program will add to these programs through growth from $16m in 1988-89 to $24m in 1989-90: $8m of this increase is for youth. Under the Commonwealth-State Housing Agreement, there will be an additional $310m in 1989-90 to provide improved opportunities and access to public rental housing for disadvantaged people. The special Burdekin response will provide $17m over four years matched dollar for dollar with the States. All of this is a record of achievement of which we should be proud.</PARA>

<PARA>It seems to me, from what has just been said, that the Minister for Transport and Communications, Mr Willis, is not disputing the proposition that he has not received any communication from Mr Hill, despite the fact that the Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs (Senator Robert Ray), in answer to my question the other day, made it plain that he expected that Mr Hill would advise the Minister before he contemplated any such negotiations.

I think one could accept the proposition that there is nothing wrong with Mr Hill being approached. But the moment that Mr Hill does anything more than reject those approaches, then I think he is in a position of potential compromise. He should immediately have brought the matter to the attention of the Minister. To the extent that he has failed to do so now I think he has been derelict in his duty. For the Minister simply to proceed on the basis that it might be possible for Mr Hill to have some future arrangement with Channel 7 and yet remain in his position as Chairman of the ABC is, I would have thought, a clear ignoring of the facts. I ask the Minister now to clarify the nature of the correspondence that Mr Willis proposes to address to Mr Hill and to assure the Senate that, if there is any suggestion of Mr Hill's presently having an intention to enter into any contractual arrangements with Channel 7, or indeed to treat seriously approaches from any of the commercial networks with a view, at some later stage, to leaving the services of the ABC, he ought to be asked to stand down.</PARA>

Just because there is press speculation, it does not necessarily mean that one has to write a letter asking for confirmation or denial. As Mr Willis sees it, if a letter is to be written it would have to come, more likely, from me, pressing to get a complete answer for Senator Alston.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;To be fair to my colleague Senator Alston, the Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs (Senator Robert Ray) has dismissed rather too readily the question that has been raised. The Minister, when he re-considers this matter, will agree, I hope, that it would have been not merely possible but absolutely normal and indeed to be expected, this matter having been raised yesterday-as the Minister says, only on the basis of a press report; nevertheless it is a serious matter-that either the Minister personally or his Senior Private Secretary would contact Mr Hill's office to inquire whether there was any truth in the report. Surely the Minister would consider that that would be the first thing that one would expect. I would expect the Minister to do it if there were some similar report about some possible dereliction of propriety in his policy administration area. That normal method of procedure, so to speak, being available, surely the Minister will agree that it is a little strange for such a reply to be provided? I understand the Minister's position; he is here only as a mouthpiece-I do not use that word in any derogatory manner-for the Minister's office. He was provided with a reply-if I heard him correctly, and I am subject to correction-to the effect that he sought an assurance from Mr Hill that at no time in the future would any action of his put him in a position of conflict of interest, or something to that effect. I hope I am not misrepresenting the Minister.</PARA></TALK.START>

I hope the Minister will understand that that kind of letter incites almost as much curiosity as if no letter at all had been written.

Furthermore, I think it is important to know whether there is any clause in Mr Hill's contract with the Australian Broadcasting Corporation which would indeed preclude him from entering into such negotiations and whether that is the real reason why he is declining to make any comment at all.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Knowles yesterday asked me a question about a visit by Kodak employees to Disneyland. The question had a number of wrong assumptions in it. There is no proposal, and never has been, for Kodak employees to visit Disneyland and there are no such plans in the offing for Kodak employees to visit Disneyland at company expense. However, I should say that in respect of its sales staff, Kodak runs a performance bonus scheme known as the Top Flight Club. The scheme has been there for six years and it is designed to reward sales personnel who substantially exceed their sales performance target for the year. The allegation in the question was that all Kodak's Australian sales representatives would get an overseas trip. That is not true at all. Only those who are highly successful will get an overseas trip. I am told, for example, that in some States it is unlikely that sales personnel will get a trip this year because they have not exceeded their performance targets. In other places they will.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I make the point that such schemes are a very common form of reward in industry to sales staff. In Kodak's case the cost of the benefit is outweighed many times over by the increase in sales achieved as a result of increased motivation of the sales force. This year any successful sales personnel will be rewarded with a trip to Hawaii for one week in May next year. It is not yet possible to assess the cost to Kodak since with the sales year ending on 31 December, it is not yet known how many sales personnel will qualify for the performance incentive. As I said, the scheme has been operating at Kodak for six years. Kodak is a company with a turnover of something in the order of $450m and it is a complete red herring to try to link a practice which has been going on for six years to the Government's assistance to Kodak which will commence in January.

I repeat that Kodak is committed to use the bounty to invest in further export and productivity growth and, as I by implication said earlier, not one cent of taxpayers' money is being used to help Kodak employees enjoy themselves. It is a totally productivity related scheme. For example, Senator Knowles no doubt takes parliamentary trips at taxpayers' expense which are not necessarily productivity related. This is a productivity related scheme.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the paper. </PARA>
<PARA>In the time that has been available, and with the debate which has occurred this morning over the electoral Bill, I have not had the time to give this annual report of the Australian National Parks and Wildlife Service (ANPWS) the sorts of considerations that I would have liked to have given. Nevertheless, I simply take this opportunity to comment not so much upon the report as upon the Service itself and, in particular, the announcement which was made yesterday by the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories (Senator Richardson) of the appointment of Dr Peter Bridgewater to be the new Director of the ANPWS succeeding Professor Derek Ovington who has held that position for a considerable period, in fact since 1976, which really is an extremely long period to have given to service of governments of all persuasions in that very important role. I put on record that although Professor Ovington has from time to time been a very controversial Director of the ANPWS, I think that in many respects he has pioneered some new and important areas of activity for that Service. I have always found him a very cooperative and courteous officer of the Commonwealth in his assistance to me as shadow Minister and in previous positions which I have held in the Senate, and a very comprehensive supplier of information as requested on Senate Estimates committees. </PARA>
<PARA> Dr Bridgewater, who comes to succeed Professor Ovington, was formerly the Director of Australia's Bureau of Flora and Fauna. He left Australia in July this year to take up the position as the head of Britain's major nature conservation authority, the Nature Conservancy Council. Dr Bridgewater is a trained botanist with a degree from Durham University who has worked as an environmental consultant and administrator and in various academic activities. As I have said, he was Director of the Bureau of Flora and Fauna for six years from 1982 and subsequently headed the Department of the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories' natural environment division. He served on a wide range of committees including the International Union for Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources and the Australian Committee of the Man and the Biosphere Program for the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation. He is a person I have had the pleasure of meeting through the Department. He is an outstanding officer and I am more than pleased to see his return to Australia to take up a significant position as the Director of the ANPWS. </PARA>
<PARA> I referred the other day to the review of the ANPWS which had been undertaken by Mr Bruce McDonald. I have nothing further to add to the remarks which I made on that occasion other than to say, once again, that I am not attracted to the proposition to replace the ANPWS with a new statutory authority-the Australian National Conservation Authority, I think, is the proposed name for it. </PARA>
<PARA> I am glad to see that there is a continuing activity on the part of the Service and of the Customs officers to secure an adequate level of prosecutions of people committing breaches of the Wildlife Protection (Regulation of Exports and Imports) Act 1982. This is a very important piece of legislation and I am glad to see that there is in the report, on pages 46 through to 49, a considerable amount of detail about the activities of both the Service and of other Commonwealth departments in ensuring that prosecutions are brought before the courts. I am glad to say that the courts are now quite clearly imposing much harsher penalties for the breach of this Act, and that is something very much to be welcomed. </PARA>
<PARA> I welcome this report. As usual it appears to be a report providing plenty of very sound and useful information, and I am glad to see that once again we have it before us. The only point I make in conclusion is that reports such as this should be available to honourable senators before Estimates committees meet, not right at the end of the session after the Estimates committee and appropriation procedures have been fully dealt with. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We are discussing the Australian National Parks and Wildlife Service annual report. As an environmentalist, I am always relieved when I find that the Australian National Parks and Wildlife Service is involved in managing a resource rather than the State national parks bodies. I will talk more about that in a minute. I note that the role and structure of the Australian National Parks and Wildlife Service is spelled out on page 1. It reads:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>The Mission To protect and conserve the nature conservation values of the Australian natural environment and native wildlife, in cooperation with the States and Territories as appropriate. </PARA>
<PARA>That is a laudable goal but, in fact, because of the way Australia is organised it is not achievable. What we have here in Australia is not a collection of real national parks. In general, what we have are State preserves; they are called national parks, but are actually run by the States and are subject to the whim of the States. The State can, at the stroke of a pen, eliminate these national parks, as has happened in Tasmania. What we really need is a real national park system run by the Federal Government, as is the case in my native United States. The national parks system in the United States has as its mission to protect in perpetuity all those areas identified as important to the environment or to the historical aspects of the United States. There is a serious commitment there. In Australia, unfortunately, we still have the idea that national parks are a luxury and we allow the States to have control. </PARA>
<PARA> The other issue I would like to raise is the terrible situation which now exists in the south-east corner of Australia, having to do with the logging of the National Estate. National Estate areas are areas which have been identified by the Federal Government as of importance to the country. Unfortunately, there is no real control over the State activities. There is control over Federal activities in these areas but not State activities. What we need is firm Federal control, especially in areas like the south-east forests of New South Wales which at this very moment are being logged. Our National Estate areas are threatened. Other areas which should be on the National Estate and which have been left out are being logged. This is, of course, extending across the border into Victoria, in the Errinundra Plateau. A fact of life is that ecosystems do not follow the dotted lines of administrators put on maps in the last century. The ecosystems extend across the borders and what we need is an ecosystem approach to these areas. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like to see all the national parks in New South Wales and Victoria and all the National Estate areas linked together in the south-eastern part of this country as the greater escarpment south-east Australia national park. That is a mouthful; but it is a beautiful area; it is a massive area. If this were a national park it would be a tremendous tourist asset to this country. Many of my colleagues in the chamber have travelled around the world and know that Australia has something to offer which is not available in other parts of the world. It used to be, but it is not any more. We need to preserve what we have. A short term approach is to rip the trees out, sell the woodchips to Japan, or build a pulp mill to use the woodchips and reduce Australia to just another tree farm. In fact, what we have is a tremendously viable ecosystem, a living museum of life forms which are many millions of years old and which should be preserved. At present they are not being preserved simply because of the fractioned nature of the control over the areas and the fact that the Federal Government does not have the power to preserve these areas. The Federal Government can recommend, but it cannot act except in the case of woodchip export licences, and it does not seem to be willing to do anything there either. We need a firm resolve on the part of the Federal Government and a mechanism to save these areas. One such mechanism would be to establish a national park in the greater escarpment of south-eastern Australia. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I also rise to pass some brief remarks on the Australian National Parks and Wildlife Service annual report for 1988-89. The section on wildlife deals, among other things, with the smuggling of Australian protected fauna. There are reports of eight successful prosecutions and another 12 outstanding. Unfortunately, these cases are probably only the tip of the iceberg. It has been estimated that thousands of Australian animals and birds are smuggled out of Australia each year and that the illegal trade in 1986 was estimated to be worth some $40m per annum. It seems certain that tougher penalties are needed which will be a real deterrent.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Australian National Parks and Wildlife Service also needs better resourcing to enable it to detect more offenders and root out more of this pernicious trade. In my own state of Western Australia the Department of Conservation and Land Management has reported a very large number of offences against the Wildlife Conservation Act and its regulations. The 1987-88 report revealed that 103 cases were pending prosecution. The problems include the collection and smuggling of reptiles, large scale commercial flora exploitation on nature reserves, bird nest robbing and bird trapping. The loss of, and continuing threats to, native mammal and bird species is an ongoing tragedy in this country. An article in the Weekend Australian of 8-9 July appropriately entitled `Graveyard Australia' documented the disappearance of many mammals formerly widely distributed throughout the drier areas of inland Western Australia. It also detailed research involving older Aboriginal people which is attempting to ascertain their distribution before European impact eliminated them. </PARA>
<PARA> It is strange that Australians and people overseas quite justly agonise over the fate of the kangaroo, probably the most populous, large wild animal on earth. Yet the fate of so may other severely threatened species attracts very little attention. There are enormous problems resulting from the impact of feral animals, particularly foxes, rabbits and cats. Attempts to re-establish rock wallabies in the Western Australian wheat belt have run into severe problems with foxes. The western barred bandicoot, which was formerly well distributed on the mainland, is currently restricted to Bernier and Dorre Islands off Shark Bay. Conservationists are working to have Dirk Hartog Island protected so that these animals can be re-established there. The Western Australian Department of Conservation and Land Management is also conducting research with a view to reestablishing these animals on the mainland, but foxes, rabbits and feral cats are the big obstacles yet again. Land clearing, introduced plants and animals, hunting, fishing, collecting, erosion, salination and pollution all make life tenuous for Australia's threatened species. </PARA>
<PARA> Despite the assurances which are contained in this report about the management of the commercial kangaroo industry, there are concerns in Western Australia about the commercial exploitation of kangaroos. There is no freedom of information legislation in Western Australia and it is difficult to obtain detailed and accurate information on the industry which should be fully open to public scrutiny. Conservationists have tried to obtain accurate information on the numbers of shooters, processors, mobile chillers and the areas in which they operate, but without success. It would be excellent if the National Parks and Wildlife Service could supply this sort of information to the public. Western Australia has now approved the human consumption of kangaroo meat, but the more we allow the exploitation of animals, the more likely it is that the management program will come to reflect the requirements of the commercial industry rather than the interests of nature conservation. </PARA>
<PARA> I commend the work of the Australian National Parks and Wildlife Service and call for much more strenuous efforts on the part of governments and all Australians to protect our remaining wildlife. When the Europeans arrived in Australia it was a wonderland of species found nowhere else in the world. But many have already been lost with no opportunity even to study them, or name them in some cases. It will be the ultimate tragedy if, in conservation terms, the tendency to graveyard Australia is not reversed. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the paper. </PARA>
<PARA>I am sure the National Museum of Australia must have had tongue in cheek when it put, at the beginning of this report, a photograph of the Minister for the Arts, Tourism and Territories, the Hon. Clyde Holding, running a flag up a flagpole. If there is anything that distinguishes the history of the National Museum of Australia over the life of the Hawke Labor Government, it is the extraordinary neglect of the National Museum by the Labor Government. Let me make clear once again that the Liberal and National parties have a commitment to fund the National Museum of Australia over the next five years and, in particular, to take the opportunity to ensure that it plays a major and significant role in the preservation of Australia's Aboriginal heritage. </PARA>
<PARA> This museum has been starved of funds. It has been the target of an ongoing, vicious assault upon its integrity and its future by the Department of Finance which has not been resisted in any adequate sense by successive arts Ministers. For example, on page 50 of this report, under the appendix which deals with outward loans, I see that the former unlamented Minister for the Arts and Territories, the Hon. Gary Punch, had on loan from the museum Aboriginal objects and objects from the Hon. J. B. Chifley. We know what happened to some of the Aboriginal objects-he broke them. They were sent back to the museum in a damaged condition. But the Minister was quite happy to have objects on loan. He is the only member of parliament whose name appears in the appendix as having had material on loan from the National Museum. It would be interesting to know whether other honourable senators and honourable members were given the opportunity to have material on loan from the museum which, after all, cannot be displayed adequately because the museum has not been provided with the facilities to display it. Have the rest of us been given that opportunity? The answer is clearly no. But the Minister, who had no record of fighting for the National Museum, no track record in providing assistance for the National Museum and no proven desire actually to get additional money for the museum, was perfectly happy to have its objects on display. </PARA>
<PARA>National Maritime Museum</PARA>
<PARA>National Maritime Museum</PARA>
<PARA> The burden of supporting the museum has fallen very much to a group of dedicated people-friends of the National Museum-under the leadership of Jack Thompson. In fact, people such as Robyn Williams, John Williamson, Margaret Whitlam, Valerie Taylor, Vincent Serventy and others in the Friends of the National Museum of Australia organisation, have been active in trying to do something about raising additional funds for it. Cooperative activities have been undertaken in the Australian Capital Territory between the local business community and the local trade union movement. In fact, local unions in the Australian Capital Territory have made a considerable effort to try to rally to the support of the National Museum. The museum had a stunningly successful open day in May this year, which I attended. Many thousands of people saw what the museum was trying to do within the very limited resources made available to it. I take this opportunity to pay particular tribute to the inaugural Director, Dr Don McMichael, who has since retired and who, for the last 6 1/2 years, has fought a very valiant and uneven struggle against the Department of Finance in an attempt to secure assistance for the National Museum of Australia. </PARA>

<PARA> This annual report is probably the slickest thing that has come out of the museum. If we look at the annual report we think that this is a going concern and that something is really happening. I think the museum has done a wonderful job in preparing this report. For instance, on page 23, under the heading `The Gallery of Aboriginal Australia' and the subheading `Activities' it is stated:</PARA>
<PARA>The Gallery had only two full time staff during the year and this placed a ceiling on its activities. </PARA>
<PARA>It certainly did. Where is the commitment? The gallery of Aboriginal Australia should be a showplace in Australia for Aboriginal arts and activities. Instead, we have two full time staff. If we read the report closely we see that it represents a sad collection of a lack of money and lack of resources. It certainly shows the will and devotion of the people who work there, but it shows no commitment on the part of the Government to come up with the money. On page 2 of the report, under the heading `Future of the Museum' we find:</PARA>
<PARA> The 1988/89 financial year posed major difficulties for Council due to uncertainty surrounding the Museum's future. </PARA>
<PARA> In bringing down the Budget in August 1988 the Government announced that consideration of development of the Museum would be deferred for five years and arrangements would be put in place to exhibit elements of the national collection including through State museums. </PARA>
<PARA>So the Government is going to farm this stuff out to State museums. Why? We have a national museum. All it needs is a commitment from the Government to support it. I share Senator Puplick's concerns. </PARA>

Senator Puplick, as someone born in England, was in a very good position to appreciate the very things which Senator Sanders put out. So when he makes these comments and praises people not born in this country for being able to make comments, he was in fact paying a tribute to the person who led for the Opposition.

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the paper. </PARA>
<PARA>I would like to start by saying how much I have appreciated the courtesy of officers and staff of the Australian National Maritime Museum in facilitating arrangements for me to observe the growth and development of the museum and in particular pay tribute to Dr Kevin Fewster, who was appointed in December 1988 as the museum director. He comes to the museum with a very successful and distinguished record following his period with the South Australian Maritime Museum, which was the winner of the national tourism and museum award in 1988.</PARA>
<PARA> That having been said, I regret that I have to detain the Senate for a moment with the question of the cost of this particular institution. Honourable senators may have seen that the museum apparently is going to end up costing between $60m and $70m. It appears that it was originally believed that the cost of this museum would be $30m. The question of who is to find the additional $30m or $40m is now a matter of considerable dispute between the State of New South Wales and the Commonwealth. The facts, as I understand them, are as follows: In order to attempt to bolster the late and unlamented Premier Unsworth's re-election chances, some sort of written agreement was entered into between the Commonwealth and the then New South Wales State Government represented by Mr L. Brereton, then a Minister in the State Government and now a candidate for election to the Federal Parliament, providing the Commonwealth would assume responsibility for the first $30m worth of cost of this facility, and it is alleged that New South Wales would bear the responsibility for whatever the cost overruns were. </PARA>
<PARA> The land in question is owned by the State of New South Wales through the Darling Harbour Authority. We have a situation where the actual building at the moment and the land upon which it is built is owned by the State of New South Wales. The Commonwealth is now saying that the State of New South Wales is responsible for giving us the additional $30m or $40m to pay for the remaining costs of this building. The State of New South Wales is saying, quite rightly, `Just hang on a minute, this is a national museum, a Commonwealth museum, and you expect the taxpayers of New South Wales to pick up the tab for a Commonwealth facility. We are not going to pay the money and indeed unless you pay the money'-you being the Commonwealth-`we, the State of New South Wales, will not give you the museum because it is on our land', and so we have this Mexican stand-off. The Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories, Senator Richardson, in answer to a question I asked him the other day, said that he was going to ensure that New South Wales paid up. He was very macho about this. He was going to make sure that New South Wales paid. When I pressed him and asked whether he understood that Mr Brereton had signed a blank cheque and that the taxpayers of New South Wales would be stuck with the bill, he said that that was precisely his understanding-that Mr Brereton had signed a blank cheque and that the protestations, being very properly made by Mr David Hay, the Minister for Local Government in New South Wales about being stuck with this enormous bill, were, in Senator Richardson's words, either outrageous or irrelevant. </PARA>
<PARA> Whatever the facts of this matter are, I hope that the National Maritime Museum Bill-we have still not dealt with it despite the fact that it has been on the Notice Paper of the House of Representatives since 1985-will be referred to a senate committee in due course under Senator Hamer's newly developed proposals, so that we can have a look at this matter a bit further. However, at this stage the evidence discloses that the shabby deal done by the Unsworth Government in an attempt to buy its re-election, and the appalling lack of propriety by Mr Brereton as the then Minister, will potentially stick the taxpayers of New South Wales with a huge bill. Mr Brereton is the real culprit in this whole shabby exercise. I hope that people bear that fully in mind when they are judging his suitability to be transferred from the Parliament of New South Wales to the House of Representatives.</PARA>

<PARA>I have had a lot to do with pig producers, as I am a member of the Senate Select Committee on Animal Welfare and the Senate Select Committee on Agricultural and Veterinary Chemicals in Australia. The report talks about a review of the closer economic relations trade agreement with New Zealand. The most important part of the report refers to transmissible gastroenteritis and the importation of uncanned pig meat from Canada, which the industry is very concerned about. There is a degree of risk in bringing in this uncooked meat and the industry, quite rightly, is concerned about it. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the report. </PARA>
<PARA>Honourable senators will note that, in addition to the report which has been signed by some members of the Joint Standing Committee on the New Parliament House, there is a dissenting report from three or four other members of the Committee, which is attached to it. This matter has come before the Parliament previously. Last year the Senate voted to support the concept of the erection of a child-care centre in the grounds of the old Parliament House building. One might ask, `Why are we discussing it again? Why aren't we merely approving the construction of that building?'. The reason I believe the matter is still one that should be discussed and dealt with by the Senate is that since that time information has come before the Committee which was not previously available. In fact, it is my recollection that in November last year when the Committee looked at it, and the matter was current, we were told that there were no heritage implications in relation to the development of a child-care centre in the gardens of the old Parliament House. </PARA>
<PARA> We now have before us a letter written by the Australian Heritage Commission, signed by Gerard Early, the Acting Director, to Mr M. Grace, dated 19 December 1989, which clearly takes the debate in a different direction. For that reason I believe that this matter should be aired again. Last time it was debated the Government supported the Cabinet decision that, come what may, a child-care centre would be located on that site. The Australian Democrats were persuaded that the need for a child-care centre was a lot greater than the heritage value of that building and its environs. I appeal to them to re-examine the situation today, in the light of the fact that there is another site a very short distance away where the child-care centre could be placed, and at considerably less cost. </PARA>
<PARA> The building of the old Parliament House took place in about 1925 and it was opened in 1927. I shall not go over the history of the building. There were about 12 or 14 major renovations involving adding on wings and creating courtyards. Most of us here know the history of the development of that building. An integral part of the building, initially, was the rose garden and the gardens on either side. I wish to read from the letter of the Heritage Commission I just referred to. It states:</PARA>
<PARA> This study has confirmed the Commission's belief that the gardens of Old Parliament House are of considerable national estate significance for the way they reveal essential elements of the taste and style of their period, most particularly the international movement of landscape design for public settings. The close relationships of gardens to public buildings was an essential feature of Canberra in the 1920s. </PARA>
<PARA> The gardens were laid out in 1925 to relate to the plan of the House and provide quiet retreats for rest and recreation for members and Senators. The formality of the gardens and the placement of trees to complement the low scale of the House indicate the intention of the architect J. S. Murdoch to combine the building and gardens to form an entity, which he succeeded in doing. </PARA>
<PARA> The way the aesthetic appeal and evidence of the form layout of the gardens has been degraded by the construction of buildings within them is made clear in the Conservation Study . . . </PARA>
<PARA>It goes on. We are talking particularly of the House of Representatives garden, which has within it tennis courts and a bowling green which were part of the original 1925 design. Also within it are the squash courts which were not a part of the original 1925 design. They were put there, I think, in the 1950s or early 1960s, as a reasonable facility for senators and members who were then using the building. We are talking though about a building which is at present in mothballs and which ought to be restored and made available for Australians at large. I do not think there would be anybody here who would doubt that that is what should occur. </PARA>
<PARA> There is still debate as to what state it should be presented. Whether it should be restored to its 1927 configuration or whether it should be renovated and restored in some other fashion is still to be determined. Because the gardens are so much an integral part of the design it is my very firm view that they should be dealt with when the building is redeveloped. There is no doubt that the squash courts probably should go because they are not part of the original gardens. There is no doubt that the annex should go. In fact, it should have already gone because when the Parliament was asked to approve of the development of that annex so as to accommodate the additional members for the electorates which were created some four or five years ago one of the key things that was put to us was that the annex would not remain, it would be only temporary. It is a matter of regret and concern that it is still standing there and has not yet been removed. I think the Government should be condemned for failing to honour its commitment. It was this Government which made the commitment to remove the annex. The House of Representatives gardens would need to be renovated in some respects to fit in with the style of the building if it were to be presented to the community in the fashion that the subcommittee of the Joint Parliamentary Committee on the New Parliament House suggested. </PARA>
<PARA> It is the overwhelming view of Government members that come what may the child-care centre should be on those grounds. I honestly cannot understand why they are so committed to it. Certainly it seems that the child-care centre must be within the parliamentary triangle. Yet all of us know that just down the road a site is available next to the Hotel Kurrajong which could be used for a child-care centre. In fact, it would cost a great deal less to construct a child-care centre there than on this site. If it is to be built next to the provisional Parliament House there is no doubt that it will be a great deal more costly to make the design compatible, at least a little bit, with that building and the setting in which it is proposed to be put. There can be no doubt that on financial grounds the building should be, if it is to be erected, down near the Hotel Kurrajong. If one has even the slightest regard for the heritage value of the building and the gardens the child-care facility should not be built in the House of Representatives gardens. I doubt that anybody can argue with or counteract either of those views. There is, of course, the aspect of its being in the Australian Capital Territory and part of the Australian Capital Territory's funding and allocation for child-care centres. Whilst not wishing to take up too much of the Senate's time today, that is a matter that ought to be reviewed. </PARA>
<PARA> Canberra has quite an amount of child-care places and not all of the private centres are full at all times. There is no doubt though, as can be seen from the report of child-care services in the Australian Capital Territory prepared by Jean Gifford in December 1987, that there is still a need for child-care in Canberra. The question is: is this the place to put it? Is this the place that best serves the people of the Australian Capital Territory? Jean Gifford refers in her report on page 23 to Canberra, Belconnen and Tuggeranong as the areas with the largest number of children likely to need child-care. She goes on to state:</PARA>
<PARA> Demographic comparisons of regions extending beyond numbers of children reveal some differences, and many similarities. </PARA>
<PARA> Canberra regions have different age structures. Central Canberra has the oldest population-</PARA>
<PARA>let us remember, of course, that the area we are talking about is central Canberra-</PARA>
<PARA>Tuggeranong the youngest and each region has a distinctive age profile. </PARA>
<PARA> Central Canberra is more distinct than other regions in dimensions reflecting disadvantage: family income and relative numbers of single parent families, isolation of single parents and their likelihood of not working. Central North and Central South frequently show similar patterns, though Central South is a mix of disadvantaged and privileged to a greater extent than Central North. </PARA>
<PARA>She goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA> Looking only at numbers of children and child care places available in a given region, Tuggeranong and Western Creek are lagging behind the rest of Canberra. This ignores related child care issues. . . </PARA>
<PARA>She then goes on to other matters. If government child-care places are to be provided in Canberra, I seriously question whether this is the right place to put them. I know we will be told that the Government has approved them. Certainly only a short time ago the government approving it was this Federal Government, which is committed to this structure, in its capacity as the minder of the Australian Capital Territory. Since then we have had a Labor Government in the Australian Capital Territory, which I believe also endorsed it. But of course it would; it virtually had no choice. I do not know whether the Government now governing the Australian Capital Territory has had the opportunity to look at this. It is coming out of its funding. It is coming out of its allocation for places for child-care in the Australian Capital Territory. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Acting Deputy President, you will be astonished to know that this structure is to cost $400,000. Honourable senators should just think of how many child-care centres could be built in other parts of Australia, and indeed other parts of Canberra, with a sum of money as large as that. It is an enormous amount for some 40 children to be in full day care in the Australian Capital Territory. We could have a lot more places if the money were spent more wisely. Of course, I would take it one step further and say that none of the money should be spent on the capital cost of a child-care centre. The site should be made available for private development and the children who need care should be subsidised by the Government to go there. We would then probably increase tenfold the number of children for whom care could be given.</PARA>
<PARA> The Government has been very ambivalent about child-care. When it had the opportunity to put a child-care centre into the National Library it flatly refused to do so. The space was available and everybody expected it to be approved. But, although we lobbied as hard as we did, there was no way that this Government would agree to a child-care centre being placed in the National Library. Now it seems to have done a 180-degree turn and is totally committed to one being built on this particular site that we are discussing today, the subject of this report. When we think of the difference in cost of providing child-care in a government centre and in a private centre, it seems even more absurd that this money is being used for this purpose. I refer to the statements and admission of Senator Walsh in March of this year. He admitted that the cost per week for publicly funded child-care is $175. That figure arose out of a joint study conducted by the Department of Finance and the Department of Community Services and Health. That report was sent to Cabinet approximately 18 months ago and, to my knowledge, it has not been made public. However, in a television interview about 12 months ago, Senator Walsh cited that figure of $175 as the cost of keeping a child under two in public child-care. In private care that service can be obtained for a much lower sum.</PARA>
<PARA> A document produced by the Australian Bureau of Statistics dealing with commercial long day child-care in Australia, at November 1988, states:</PARA>
<PARA>The average fee rate charged for a week of full day care was $74, ranging from $92 in ACT to $63 in Queensland. </PARA>
<PARA>It is not true to say that that is for a shorter period than is available in government care, and it cannot be suggested that child-care in a government centre is of a different standard from private centres because of the legislation which-at least in the Australian Capital Territory, which is the area I particularly know-requires them to meet the same standards. In fact, if child-care can be provided in Canberra at the rate of $92 per week, one should be able to provide child-care for far more children than on the present basis of it costing not less than $100 and up to $175 per week. </PARA>
<PARA> There are a number of grounds on which to urge the Senate not to have anything to do with this proposition. There is the enormous waste of building at a cost of $400,000; if that money is to be spent on government child-care, it could be better spent in other parts of Canberra or Australia. Also, the cost of providing child-care in this centre will be a great deal more than if the same recurrent funding were used to subsidise children in need of child-care in private institutions. The overwhelming reason for not going ahead with this project is the fact that the Government has not determined what is to happen to the provisional Parliament House and its surrounds. It is outrageous to go ahead and construct this centre in the grounds of that building before that decision has been made, and I believe most Australians would see it that way. </PARA>
<PARA> I certainly urge the Australian Democrats to reconsider their position in the light of the document I have referred to-the report of the Australian Heritage Commission-which was not available when they made their decision in relation to this centre. This is a most important issue that Parliament ought to examine. The Senate should not make a decision which enables the centre to go ahead until the Australian Capital Territory Government has had a further opportunity to consider whether this is the best way of spending $400,000 and providing places. We have not had any evidence or suggestion as to who will be able to use it and whether it will be restricted to people financially in need of child-care. </PARA>
<PARA> The people I am particularly concerned about are mothers-single parents frequently-who want to get back into the work force and need child-care yet cannot get it because the money available for it is being spent in such an extravagant fashion. Is it certain that the people who get this subsidised child-care are those people in need and not people who are on substantial incomes working in the surrounding area? I have been given no indication in the past, when this has been discussed, that that will be the case. The money available should not be spent in this fashion for the reasons that I have given. I urge the Senate to vote against the adoption of this report. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable senator. I became a member of the Committee after the last election and have not participated in many of the decisions that it had to make leading up to the building of this new Parliament House. Now that much of the work related to this building has been completed, the Committee's main function is overseeing what happens within the parliamentary triangle. It is a very large Committee to deal with what, hopefully, in the long run will not be much business. Be that as it may, as a member of that Committee I have attempted to keep abreast of and catch up with the issues that the Committee has dealt with.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The more I have heard about the ongoing saga of the child-care centre-which goes way back long before I was a member of this Committee-it seems that if a sensible decision had been made several years ago, this debate today would not be taking place. A sensible decision would have been for a child-care facility to be built within this new Parliament House. It would have been available not only for the staff here, but also as a public facility for people in the immediate area and, importantly, for visitors from around Australia. Visitors to the major buildings in the Parliamentary Triangle-Parliament House, the Australian National Gallery, the National Library or the High Court of Australia-need a child-care facility while they inspect these national institutions which their taxes have helped to pay for over many years. By not making that decision several years ago, we have let ourselves in for the argument now going on. I think in those days members of the Committee were opposed to child-care being in Parliament House for so-called ideological reasons. Those ideological reasons escape me completely and I only wish, with the wisdom of hindsight, that those people had made a different decision. </PARA>
<PARA> This led yesterday to the Committee meeting to debate the recommendation in this report before the Senate. I abstained in the vote on that debate because I had not been able to participate in many of the earlier decisions. I felt that I was not fully aware of all the ramifications and I felt frustrated that the proper decision had not been made several years ago. If it ever comes to a debate here in the Senate I would support the Government's decision. I want to make it quite clear that I support the provision of child-care in the immediate vicinity of this building-in the parliamentary triangle-so that people working in the triangle who need child-care can have access to it, as well as visitors from elsewhere in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Reid, who is also a member of the Joint Standing Committee, has mentioned a number of reasons why it would be unwise to proceed, and there is a minority report from the Opposition as to why it should not proceed at this stage. Some of those arguments may have some validity as they deal with what is the best site. However, I only wish that the Liberal Party of Australia-which, I suspect, was then in government-had been much stronger in supporting a child-care facility in this building. If it had done so we would not now be in this position. The cost of $400,000 seems to be rather high when compared with the child-care facilities which have been built around the States. I, like a lot of people from the States, often get criticism from my constituents that taxpayers' money is providing a range of facilities in the Australian Capital Territory which is not available to the wider population in other States, and I think, in some senses, that is probably true. </PARA>
<PARA> I also say that in the general cost structure of the Australian Capital Territory $400,000 is probably not an unusual figure. With regard to some of the construction costs of this building-quotes from contractors and architects for what I, as a member of the Committee, considered to be minor alterations leading up to the commissioning of this building-it seems to me that the cost structure in the Australian Capital Territory building industry is much higher than in the States. That is one of the reasons why the quote of $400,000 appears to many of us from outlying States to be rather high. </PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Heritage Commission report, which referred to the heritage aspects of the site of the provisional Parliament House, what is going to happen to it, and so on, is mentioned in our report. That matter cannot be ignored, but I also say that when arguments are put up that one cannot build a child-care centre in the rose gardens because the children will be noisy and that this would affect the contemplative nature of the gardens, that is a pretty weak excuse. The gardens in the parliamentary triangle should be used by children, by the public, and if a bit of noise is generated from time to time, so be it. That sort of argument does not wash too well with me. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Reid raised the question of an alternative site. I do not know whether the alternative site proposition has been studied closely. I think she mentioned yesterday-and I do not think she would mind my mentioning this in the Senate-that there was a site near the old Kurrajong Hotel. I do not know what standing that site has, but if that is just another way of delaying the provision of child-care in this area, I do not support the proposal. I do not support an ongoing delay. We must provide child-care facilities in the Parliamentary Triangle as soon as possible. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not want to delay the Senate for much longer. I wanted to explain the reason why I abstained when the vote was taken yesterday. Some people took that as showing that I was not wholeheartedly in support of the majority decision of the Committee. My main reason for abstaining was that I had missed a number of the meetings of the Committee because I was not a member of the Committee during the time leading up to these decisions being taken, so I felt that it was not appropriate for me to vote either way. But if the Senate takes a vote today, I will vote for the majority report. If there is a possibility of delaying the provision of child-care, I will support the majority report. I think this issue has taken far too long to resolve, and the reason is that many years ago members of the Committee, for stupid reasons, decided not to put child-care facilities in this building, which is the most appropriate place for them to be located. </PARA>

I also agree with the previous speaker that if, in fact, the only site available in the entire Parliamentary Triangle were within the precincts of the old Parliament House, I would reluctantly agree with the proposal. In fact, there are plenty of alternatives.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Alternatives such as Casey House, the old headquarters of the Australian Heritage Commission, which is just across the street in Yarralumla, and which is available. There is a bus stop at the front door, adequate parking, and proximity to Parliament House. Another alternative is Forrest Primary School. There is vacant land adjacent to the Australian Heritage Commission offices in Brisbane Avenue. There is vacant land immediately adjacent to Casey House. It we must build a new centre, it could be located on other areas of vacant land which are available. I find it ludicrous that, with all these alternatives and with the given heritage value of the precincts of the provisional Parliament House, this Government, or the Joint Standing Committee on the New Parliament House, would consider going ahead with a plan to put a child-care centre in that area. In casting about, I have found no-one with any really good reasons for putting it there. The only reason seems to be inertia-the momentum of a decision which was once made and is continuing through bureaucratic inertia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Commonsense dictates that we should look at the situation as it exists and find the best possible solution-not a solution that was presented once and agreed to because the alternatives were not vetted or available, but a commonsense solution.

So I am here to inform the Senate that the Australian Democrats will not support the proposal. I went to Senator Richardson's office today and asked a staff member whether any legislation would be needed. The person thought that legislation would be needed to fund this project. If such legislation comes before the Senate, the Democrats will be strongly moved to vote against it because it will not solve the problems of child-care. It will be an expensive solution-there are other better ways of solving this problem-and it will take land which in fact is part of the national heritage. I will not speak longer on this except to say that in this instance the Democrats agree with the Opposition. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wonder whether I am hearing the right words from Senator Sanders. He has actually made a speech roughly akin to that which I would like to make, which causes me some concern. Perhaps he thinks that I have seen the light; I think that probably he has. I have no fundamental disagreement with the need for child-care. In fact, I agree entirely with the need for it. As Senator Schacht has pointed out in his speech, this has been a long-I will not say acrimonious-debate. It certainly has been a long and difficult one for the people who have been involved in it until this time. I, like Senator Schacht, am a new member of the Joint Standing Committee on the New Parliament House. I find that I have been given a choice between going ahead now and building a child-care centre in the House of Representatives gardens of the provisional Parliament House or finding an alternative site.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Government members have an absolute fixation with and determination to proceed now and put the child-care centre not only in the parliamentary triangle but in the gardens. That decision was made some time ago. As Senator Reid has pointed out, we now have some more information, which has not been addressed by Government speakers. The extra information we have comes from the Australian Heritage Commission and I will quote briefly from it. It firstly points out:</PARA>
<PARA> The Commission therefore strongly supports the proposal to remove the intrusive buildings-</PARA>
<PARA>that is, the provisional offices and the squash courts-</PARA>
<PARA>so that the entity of the Old Parliament House and its twin gardens will be seen and appreciated by great numbers of visitors following the opening of the complex as a major tourist attraction. </PARA>
<PARA>As Senator Reid pointed out, we do not know that the Government has made a decision to restore the old Parliament House in that way. Nonetheless, let us make the assumption that it has and that that is what is going to happen. The Heritage Commission says:</PARA>
<PARA> The proposed centre would compromise the spatial quality of the garden, destroy one of the rose gardens, and introduce an activity into the garden which is not in keeping with its historical function as a quiet place of retreat. </PARA>
<PARA>That seems reasonably sensible. In the executive summary to its report, it says:</PARA>
<PARA> The authors strongly believe that the integrity of the gardens in their 1927 form should be re-established and should then be protected in perpetuity. Most especially there should be no further development within these gardens. </PARA>
<PARA>If the message is not clear from those two quotations let me refer briefly to one final point. The Commission says that, in summary, it would strongly advise against the proposal for the following reasons:</PARA>
<PARA> 1. the addition of a feature for which there has been no historic precedent runs directly contrary to the principles of the Burra Charter and the guidelines adopted by the Australian ICOMOS Committee. </PARA>
<PARA> 2. it is contrary to the very idea for which the gardens were established . . . </PARA>
<PARA> 3. an essential aspect of the original Parliament House building was its relationship with the adjacent gardens. </PARA>
<PARA>The development of child-care facilities would jeopardise that. Taking the issue of historic precedent alone provides adequate reason for not implementing this scheme. </PARA>
<PARA> People who presumably know more about it than I do are saying that the gardens are an essential part of the old Parliament House and there should be no further development. I do not see why we cannot accept that report and find an alternative place for the child-care centre. It does not seem to me to be that difficult. I understand the frustration of those who have been arguing for a long time for such a child-care centre but will that frustration, that absolute desperation to get there at any cost, lead them to cross a bridge that we might not want to cross-in other words, to develop the old Parliament House gardens in a way that the Heritage Commission says would destroy their historical context? We can have our cake and eat it too; we can have a child-care centre in very close proximity to the old Parliament House. Senator Reid mentioned the Kurrajong Hotel site; Senator Sanders nominated a number of other sites. It is quite clear that this child-care centre could go in other places and that it would not be too difficult to find a suitable site. By finding an alternative site we would maintain the integrity of the old Parliament House. Should we want to and should we have the money to do so, we could then turn the old Parliament House into a museum that people could come and see in its original 1927 condition. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not make a speech against the provision of a child-care facility. Obviously I think there are alternatives to building one for $400,000 but that is not the point that I am making today or a charge that I want to take up. I am simply making the point that we can have our cake and eat it too. We can have the child-care centre and we can maintain the integrity of the old Parliament House and, in particular, the House of Representatives gardens. No reason has been advocated for not doing that. When I raised this in the Committee hearing and asked, `Well, could somebody please explain?', I was told that the Committee had decided this matter 18 months ago or 12 months ago. Senator Reid pointed out that we have new information now. We know what the Heritage Commission says. Its members have given qualified advice, specialist advice, as to the maintenance or otherwise of the gardens in their 1927 state. We now know that the Heritage Commission thinks that the siting of the child-care facility in the gardens is a very bad idea. What does the Committee say? The Committee says, `Well, we won't take any notice of that because we decided something some time ago and so now we're going to stick with it'. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The honourable senator opposite interjects `What would the Commission know about it?'. Perhaps he would like to write to the Commission, express his views and give its members his qualifications to make such comments. But I accept that members of the Commission have some qualifications in this regard, that they think the place should be preserved as nearly as possible in its 1927 state, and that no further development should take place. We can follow that advice and still have a child-care centre. To proceed with a child-care centre in the gardens is to proceed irrespective of the advice offered by the Heritage Commission. It shows a disregard of what the Commission has to say and a disregard for maintaining the old Parliament House in a particular state. More importantly, we would cross a bridge we could not then go back on. If we build a child-care facility in the gardens we are unlikely to knock it down two years or five years later when we have the money to restore the old Parliament House should we want to do that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is a final step; it is a bridge that we would cross. We would have turned around and ripped the bridge away; we could not go back. But if we maintained the gardens we could restore the old Parliament House and still have the child-care centre. I would be very interested to hear why that is an unsatisfactory way to proceed. By choosing an alternative site, everyone would get what he wants. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;No, I am not. Personally, I am not opposed to the concept, but I am interested that Senator Schacht, having given an inconsequential speech, now insists on interjecting. He did not deal with why this child-care centre must be constructed in this one location. The only location in Canberra capable, according to Government members, of handling such a child-care centre is the very area where the Heritage Commission said the centre must not be. The strength of the Heritage Commission advice is striking. It says, for example:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The formal rose gardens and the trees and the formal garden to the east-</PARA>
<PARA>that is, in the House of Representatives gardens-</PARA>
<PARA>offers a clear image of the style of design of the 1920s. Their loss as an element of the Parliament House development would be tragic. </PARA>
<PARA>It is not just an inconsequential objection, by the Heritage Commission. `Their loss would be tragic', the Commission says. It goes on:</PARA>
<PARA>While the nature of the child care facilities has not been identified-</PARA>
<PARA>at the time this report was provided-</PARA>
<PARA>they will thus provide further intrusion into the gardens. In summary, we would strongly advise against this. </PARA>
<PARA>I emphasise that it says it would strongly advise against this. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like to refer to some other elements of this report because the case does not rest, as I said, on whether there should or should not be a child-care centre, or on whether poor decisions were made in the past. Is the Government really saying that because it made a mess of the question of child-care previously, therefore, it can make another mess in trying to correct it? That is the logic, if there is any, in the statements of Senator Schacht. </PARA>
<PARA> What intrigues me is this: what are the motives of those people who insist that the centre should be erected in this location? I want to look at the double standards involved. Let us compare it, for example, to the situation at Jervis Bay-this matter is very minor, of course, compared to the multi-millions of dollars involved in Jervis Bay-where multi-millions of dollars of government money was involved. Here $400,000 is to be expended, which, as Senator Reid and other honourable senators have demonstrated, could be far better spent in alternative ways and in better and more readily available sites which do not impinge on Australia's heritage. But because the Jervis Bay matter was politically useful, because there were votes involved, the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) intervened and said, `We don't care if no report, no environmental impact study, has been completed yet; we will intervene and ban it'. The interesting difference in this case is that the advice from the Australian Heritage Commission is, for example, that it would be a tragedy if that particular part of the gardens were disturbed, disrupted and destroyed; yet the very same Labor Government is rushing to the defence of an environmental issue when a vote is involved, when it can buy a bit of electoral support. But in this case, because the Government deems it not to be an electorally attractive matter, the heritage aspect does not matter a damn. </PARA>
<PARA> What is Senator Richardson doing on this matter? We have not heard from him on this issue, yet it is clearly a major environmental issue concerning Canberra, the national capital, and the nation. What is Senator Richardson, who is allegedly the Minister in charge of this kind of issue, doing? Has he bowed down to the pressure from the sisterhood opposite who are determined to have at any price this child-care centre on this location? If only we could hear the justification for pushing aside the Heritage Commission's determination. I am appalled not only at the decision but at the manner in which this decision has been taken. I have attended the meetings of the Committee. This decision was railroaded through this Committee, which was stood over by Mr Speaker, who, quite frankly, in my view rode roughshod over members of the Committee in his determination to get this matter through. As I said, I believe the Committee was grossly misled as to the attitude of the Heritage Commission when past decisions were taken on this matter. </PARA>
<PARA> To conclude, I would like to underline a couple of points in the Heritage Commission report that other senators have not dealt with. The conclusion of the Heritage Commission is that the whole of the old Parliament House landscape and gardens is considered to be of national significance. No comparable landscapes of equal quality from their period have been identified in Australia. I stress that no other example has been identified, according to this report, and these people opposite are happy to destroy this landscape in order to gain their objective in the short term, no matter what the cost. The report says:</PARA>
<PARA>They are largely intact and offer an essential contribution to the character of the Canberra landscape and its historic style and the character and style of Parliament House. </PARA>
<PARA> This landscape and gardens should be nominated for highlighting as a place which is significant within the area in the Register of the National Estate and should be listed by the ACT Heritage Committee. </PARA>
<PARA> There should be no further development within these landscapes and gardens and intrusions should be removed. </PARA>
<PARA>It is not a half-baked recommendation; it is strong and determined. The report goes on:</PARA>
<PARA>Most particularly the formal rose garden in the south-eastern corner of the site can be re-established-</PARA>
<PARA>that is, by the removal of the intrusions that honourable senators have already spoken about-</PARA>
<PARA>and those formal gardens previously present to separate the tennis courts from the Bowling Green. </PARA>
<PARA> The most significant aspect of these gardens is that they illustrate the sophisticated elegant simplicity of the original garden lay-out, something too rarely seen in garden treatments. Indeed, I can think of no other landscape in Australia which has the potential to provide this elegance of the 1920's. </PARA>
<PARA>The report then goes on to deal with other elements of the proposal. But the important point is that this is a once-off situation which this Government and the Labor members of the Committee want to destroy without this chamber having been presented with one coherent argument about why the Heritage Commission report should be wiped aside and why the alternative sites-which are outside the triangle and, therefore, not subject to this kind of supervision-cannot be used. </PARA>
<PARA> I strongly support the dissenting minority report of the members of the Joint Standing Committee on the New Parliament House, and I urge the Senate to support that dissenting report and to vote against this proposal. I call on Government members to explain their position. We are now well into this debate. There have been plenty of speakers in this debate, but only one speaker from the Government. I take up Senator Colston's interjection and ask him, or whoever is going to be the next Government speaker, to justify this disgraceful decision which is aimed at damaging the environment in which the old Parliament House sits and which is in keeping with this Government's failure still to come to a decision about what to do with the old Parliament House. Do we judge from this that this is an attempt to pre-empt a decision about what is to happen about the old Parliament House, that it will not be kept in the manner in which the Australian Heritage Commission wants?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am going to make a few brief comments because, quite honestly, I am not quite sure what the situation is at the moment. The report of the Joint Standing Committee on the New Parliament House relating to a community based child-care centre in the parliamentary zone was presented on behalf of the President and a motion was moved that the Senate take note of the report. The report has been debated fairly extensively this afternoon, but the report contains the following recommendation:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Committee recommends approval of the following work in the Parliamentary Zone:</PARA>
<PARA> the establishment of a community based child care centre adjacent to the provisional Parliament House as shown in the attached location of site plans;</PARA>
<PARA>and further recommends</PARA>
<PARA> approval of the attached National Capital Planning Authority building plans. </PARA>
<PARA>I am not quite sure where we are if we do not take note of the paper. It seems that the recommendation is still there and probably has to be brought before the Parliament at some subsequent stage for debate. If that recommendation is brought forward for debate I will probably make a far greater contribution than I am going to make this afternoon. I just want to make a few comments about the report in the context of the motion that we have before us to take note of the report. </PARA>
<PARA> I have been a member of the Joint Standing Committee on the New Parliament House for quite some time. I cannot quite remember when I came on it but it was probably about 1980, so I have had about 10 years experience on the Committee. It was a very interesting committee to be part of because those of us who were on it for that time actually saw through the building of this place and had a very creative time in working with the architects. But this afternoon we are not talking about the building as such, we are talking about the child-care facilities and where they might be located. I just mention, though, that in the 10 years or so that I have been associated with the Committee there has been much talk but very little action about child-care facilities here, in the parliamentary zone or nearby. </PARA>
<PARA> As Senator Schacht mentioned, one of the first proposals was that there be child-care facilities in the Parliament House itself. When that proposal was put forward the new Parliament House was not built, we were still looking at plans, and there was a possibility, I suppose, that an area be set aside for child-care facilities. That did not seem to proceed in any way, and some suggestions were made yesterday, when we had our meeting, that it was probably because of one of the Presiding Officers not wanting to have child-care facilities in the Parliament House. That I cannot remember because it was some time ago. </PARA>
<PARA> Another proposal which came after that was that there should be some child-care facilities in the grounds. The first of those suggestions was that those child-care facilities, as far as I can recall, were to be in the western side of the building; in other words, on the Senate side, somewhere between here and the road to the west. That did not proceed. One of the other suggestions-perhaps it was the third suggestion-was that the child-care facilities be near the exhibition building to the east, or even the exhibition building could be converted when it was no longer needed. I am not quite sure of the total reasons why that did not proceed, but one was that a great deal of finance would have been needed to recast the exhibition building into a child-care facility. But there was also some suggestion that because so many motor vehicles pass that site there would be too much lead in the air. I do not think that that was ever tested, but it was a suggestion that was made, and that site fell into disrepute. </PARA>
<PARA> A further suggestion was-and it is the suggestion that we have before us at the moment-that a child-care facility be built in the gardens of the provisional Parliament House. That is the one that is before the Committee at the moment. It seems to me that this debate has probably gone on long enough. If we continue the debate then those young people who could be using a child-care facility would probably be here in about 30 years time still debating whether we are going to have a child-care facility and where it is going to be. I do not accept that the centre should not go in the gardens. I did not bring into the Parliament this afternoon my briefing papers from yesterday, so I do not have a copy of the report by the Australian Heritage Commission. I will not go into the Heritage Commission report in great detail but as far as I can recall, it stated that if the facility were to be built in the gardens it had certain suggestions about how it could be done. </PARA>
<PARA> I would just like to mention something about the gardens. They were established in about 1927. It was suggested to us yesterday that they might even have been started a little before the building was opened. But we can say they were established in about 1927. We should remember that in 1927 child-care facilities were not a high priority. In fact, they were not a high priority before the Second World War. There seems to be no reason now why the centre should not be located in the gardens. Perhaps by putting it in the gardens, or in the parliamentary triangle, we in the Parliament could show to the people of Australia that we have a commitment to child-care. Perhaps in the future-this might be drawing a long bow-historians will look at this child-care centre, if it is located in the gardens, as representing a commitment by the Australian Parliament, to providing child-care facilities and this might lead to the expansion of child-care facilities throughout the nation. I feel that the opposition to this proposal is nothing more than a delaying tactic to put off the decision and to put off the facility, perhaps even until the next century. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am hesitant to speak for any length on this issue which has been very thoroughly canvassed on several occasions. There is not a lot that I would want to add to the fairly comprehensive explanation that was made last time we discussed this matter in this chamber. What is intended is community-based child-care which will be operated by a community group which will take part in its management and that group will make decisions about who should be eligible for care, what charges should be made, and so forth. Capital funding has been available for some time-probably for about 18 months now-and the Department of Community Services and Health has endorsed the proposition that there should be a community-based centre. As I have said, it would be up to the committee which runs that centre to decide who the users should be.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> My involvement in this issue goes back to the time that I was first elected to the Senate 8 1/2 years ago. As Senator Colston has said, this issue has a very long history. I would have to agree with him that, time and again, we have been faced with a spoiling operation. We have put the matter off, we have put the issue off and we have put the decision off for one reason or another. We thought that we had won on a number of occasions only to find that somebody found another reason why the centre should not be built here, there or somewhere else. Having reached the point where we had decided that the site close to the provisional Parliament House would be suitable, we are now faced with another spoiling operation. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the reasons why I am reluctant to continue with the debate today is that we are hearing second-hand what the Australian Heritage Commission has actually said and I have a feeling that some of the quotes have been rather selective. I am not for a minute doubting the language that has been used by the Heritage Commission but I would very much like to see what weight the Commission has put on statements such as a `tragic loss', `intrusion', and so on. I am not doubting the historical and other value of the landscape and gardens. But why would an attractive, sensitively designed child-care centre, tucked in amongst the trees in the gardens, be any more intrusive than, for example, the High Court building? If there is talk of removing buildings, putting them elsewhere, changing their style or something like that, in my estimation that building would be a prime candidate for a change on the horizon. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Sanders's suggestions about renovating other buildings have been considered and rejected. For very good reasons renovations tend to be very expensive. One might finish up with something that would cost more than a new building. Its requirements might be less than adequate for a modern child-care centre that is purpose built. </PARA>
<PARA> From what I can see of the plan that is included in this report today, the architects have been very sensitive to the concerns that have been expressed, even those expressed by Senator Michael Baume, Senator Reid, and so forth. It seems to me that a centre of this nature would enhance what is a very beautiful area which currently does not get a great deal of use. It is a very strange experience to hear the word `degradation' being used in relation to the notion of using a piece of public land for such a purpose. Everybody who has spoken has acknowledged the need for children's services, even if those people are not quite wedded to the notion of community-based care, which is what this centre is intended to be. The decision about that piece of land was made relatively recently by the local authorities who were asked to come up with suggestions of the most appropriate land. I am really quite surprised to find now that the Opposition is saying that the suggestions for other locations are just as appropriate. I have a horrible feeling that, whichever piece of land is decided upon in this area, there will be objections of one sort or another on one ground or another and we will still be having this argument in years to come. </PARA>
<PARA> As I have said, a great deal can be included in a debate of this nature. I am wondering whether there is much point in continuing the debate this afternoon in view of the fact that many of us have not had the opportunity of seeing what the Heritage Commission has actually said. I seek leave to continue my remarks later. </PARA>

I am reminded of the conduct of a particular lady when Senator Tate was strolling on the lawns of the old Parliament House. It seems to me that, in a more sophisticated way, it is a repeat of that performance. Why are we setting out the territory? Why should we not have the centre somewhere else? Why does it have to be in the parliamentary precincts? Canberra is a big place; the facility could be put anywhere.

<PARA>. . . the Commission would favour the approach adopted by Denton Corker Marshall in their preliminary drawings. </PARA>
<PARA>In other words, it says that if all else fails the Commission would support the style that has been proposed. It is not a qualified objection; it is an unqualified objection. The Commission is very clear about its views. We are told in the executive summary:</PARA>
<PARA>The authors strongly believe that the integrity of the gardens in their 1927 form should be re-established and should then be protected in perpetuity. Most especially there should be no further development within these gardens. </PARA>
<PARA>It goes on to say that the significance of the old Parliament House landscapes and gardens cannot be assessed in isolation and that the gardens are an intrinsic and integral element of the old Parliament House building. It talks about the criteria it used in drawing its conclusions. It refers, for instance, to the possession of uncommon or endangered aspects of Australia's natural and cultural history. That is one of the qualifications that caused it to make the decision it did. </PARA>
<PARA> The Commission talks about a focal point of a place, the Parliament House vista, being entered on the Register of the National Estate. We are told by the Australian Heritage Commission that the Parliament House courtyards are considered to be of national significance because they are an integral element of a building entered in the Register of the National Estate and contribute in a positive way to its function and character. We are told further that they are considered to be of national significance because they provide an essential open space as a balance to the enclosed courtyards of the Parliament House building, reveal essential elements of the taste and style of a period, most particularly an international movement of landscape design for public settings. This is characterised by the use of the garden beds cut into the grass sward and the creation of formal garden patterns. It goes on to tell us all about the beauty of the design and the layout of the gardens. It states:</PARA>
<PARA> They form an essential element of the Canberra institutional landscape established in the 1920s and as such provide a setting contributing to many of Canberra's buildings entered in the Register of the National Estate, including the Hotel Canberra, Parliament House and the Albert Hall. </PARA>
<PARA>It makes us wonder, really, what the Register means to this Government. We are told in the summary:</PARA>
<PARA>The total Parliament House landscape and gardens is considered to be of national significance. No comparable landscapes of equal quality from their period have been identified in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA>My goodness gracious, they have no equal anywhere in Australia! If an animal, a wombat, or an Aboriginal carving were involved, there would be guards protecting it. But because it is what it is, part of a fundamental institution of Australia, we are to plop a building in the middle of it. </PARA>
<PARA> The landscape and gardens should be nominated for the Register of the National Estate for highlighting as a place which is significant within the area and should be listed by the Australian Heritage Commission in the Australian Capital Territory. There should be no further development within these landscapes and gardens, and intrusions should be removed. The Commission is not talking about putting new buildings in; it is talking about dismantling the buildings already there, intrusive as they are in the gardens. We are told in the same report:</PARA>
<PARA> The most significant aspect of these gardens is that they illustrate the sophisticated elegant simplicity of the original garden lay-out, something too rarely seen in garden treatments. Indeed I can think of no other landscape in Australia which has the potential to provide this elegance of the 1920's. </PARA>
<PARA>. . . </PARA>
<PARA> Their loss as an element of the Parliament House development would be tragic.</PARA>
<PARA>This is the objective, clinical assessment made by the Australian Heritage Commission in a report-not emotional wafflings but a clinical assessment. It uses the word `tragic'. It says:</PARA>
<PARA> In summary, we would strongly advise against this for the following reasons:</PARA>
<PARA>It gives a number of reasons which I choose not to read. It says in part:</PARA>
<PARA>an essential aspect of the original Parliament House building was its relationship with the adjacent gardens. </PARA>
<PARA>. . . </PARA>
<PARA> Taking the issue of historic precedent alone provides adequate reason for not implementing this scheme. </PARA>
<PARA>We are told in a very eloquent, and might I say elegant, way by the author of this document, the Australian Heritage Commission, that under no circumstances should this child-care building be located where it is proposed. </PARA>
<PARA> I challenge Senator Graham Richardson to come into this Parliament and lay out for us the arguments for and against the child-care centre being built where it is proposed and explain to the Senate what was the persuasive factor that ultimately caused Cabinet to decide to build the centre where it is proposed when it could equally have been built anywhere else in Canberra. As my colleague Senator Reid said, it could have been put inside the new Parliament House as I would have thought that it would serve primarily employees and workers from within this building. Yet that is too logical, too reasonable. We have to plonk it down in splendid isolation in the gardens of the old Parliament House. </PARA>
<PARA> It seems to me that every time Senator Richardson makes a decision in respect of the environment and in respect of our heritage all that is in the balance is the number of votes. We saw that in Kakadu. I have no doubt that there was a time when--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I was seeking to discover-perhaps I was soliloquising-how this decision was arrived at. To try to draw some logical threads together we must compare it with the decisions in respect of Kakadu or Jervis Bay. In the case of Kakadu, I have no doubt that there was a time when he was on the Committee when Senator Richardson shared my view, but now he has decided that the decisions on Kakadu and Jervis Bay involve votes for the Government. The test of the integrity of a Minister when making tough decisions is whether he is prepared to make a decision that costs votes. Every decision thus far made by Senator Richardson is designed and intended to win votes. I challenge him to make a decision in respect of our environment, in respect of our natural heritage, which is unpopular with the community but which is done on the basis of integrity, honesty and reasonableness. We will not find one. On this occasion, because the sisterhood got into the ear of the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke), and no doubt of Senator Richardson and the majority of Cabinet, we are finding that a report of the Australian Heritage Commission is being totally ignored. It has not even been challenged. There is no rebuttal of it; there is no argument against it. The Government could have come forward and at least proffered some pathetic excuse for disagreeing, but even that is more than it could cope with. So we have had absolutely no response at all. As I said, the building could be built anywhere in Canberra but we are told that we have to have it in the parliamentary zone. I challenge the integrity of the Government and ask it to explain to us how it chooses to ignore the Australian Heritage Commission's recommendation. It has ignored it for political reasons because the sisterhood has decided that it wants to put its stamp on the parliamentary triangle zone.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I am encouraged by the Australian Democrats' moment of enlightenment-a ray of knowledge, a flash of wisdom-and to discover that on this occasion they have at least been consistent. One of the qualifications of integrity is consistency, not pragmatism. The Democrats, at least on this occasion, have said that there are some heritage considerations that outweigh the consideration of the location of this building. </PARA>
<PARA> We are not arguing against a child-care centre or the intention of having child-care facilities which can be used by parents who are employed in this building or in nearby buildings. We are simply arguing against the degradation, the corruption, the destruction which will take place if this building is located as proposed. We are told that there are no similar gardens anywhere in Australia or which begin to compare with them. We are told it would be tragic if these gardens were damaged. We are told that they are an intrinsic and integral part of the old Parliament House, yet none of those arguments touches the conscience or the soul of this Government. Quite frankly, it is a crude, pragmatic, political decision, done for vested interest reasons. As I started to say, I am encouraged that on this occasion the Democrats have been consistent. I trust that they will join with us in ensuring that this proposal is ignominiously dumped, that the building is located where it deserves to be and that the gardens are preserved with the integrity they deserve. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Senate-</PARA>
<PARA> (a) endorses the findings contained in paragraph 25 of the report; and</PARA>
<PARA> (b) adopts the recommendations contained in paragraphs 26 and 32 of the report. </PARA>
<PARA>On 18 August 1989 the following matter was referred to the Committee of Privileges:</PARA>
<PARA>Whether there was an unauthorised disclosure of the report of the Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade on visiting nuclear powered or armed vessels, and whether a contempt was committed by a person who made such an unauthorised disclosure. </PARA>
<PARA>The Committee, having established through correspondence with the Chairman of the Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade Committee, and examination of the newspaper reports he provided, that unauthorised disclosure of the contents of the report had occurred, first investigated a possible source of the disclosure. </PARA>
<PARA> One member of the Standing Committee, Senator Irina Dunn, advised the Committee of Privileges that she had orally briefed media representatives about the report, which also included her dissenting report, on the day on which the report was due to be tabled. She also indicated that, while she did not distribute any documents to the media, extracts from the report and the dissent, and media releases, had been prepared in her office in anticipation of the report's tabling, and thus could have been available to the media representatives. </PARA>
<PARA> This Committee, in its report, draws attention to a number of circumstances which it took into account when addressing the question of whether a finding of contempt should be made. As indicated at paragraphs 22 to 24, these included the unexpected delays which occurred in the tabling of the report, and the declaration by Senator Dunn that she did not intend to obstruct the Committee or the Senate, as evidenced by her not taking advantage of opportunities to do so at any time throughout the inquiry. In particular, the Committee draws attention to Senator Dunn's apology, quoted at paragraph 23 of this report, and reminds the Senate that, in similar circumstances some years ago, when a comparable apology was made, the Senate took the matter no further. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee has therefore made the following findings in relation to the matter referred to it: Firstly, the Committee has concluded that, while it is open to the Committee and the Senate to find that a contempt has been committed, in the light of all the circumstances as outlined above such a finding should not be made. Secondly, although a premature briefing of media representatives was given, and the possibility of premature access to embargoed media releases and extracts of the report, including the dissenting report of the Senate Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade on visits to Australia by nuclear powered or armed vessels cannot be dismissed, under the circumstances of the present case no further action should be taken. In making these findings, it also reminds honourable senators of their obligations under the Privilege Resolution and Standing Order relating to unauthorised disclosure, and specifically recommends that the President draw the relevant provisions to the attention of all senators. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee has also taken the opportunity to address a number of other matters arising from its consideration of this reference. The Committee comments on the general question of contempt in relation to unauthorised disclosure, the role of the media in these matters, procedures for tabling reports, on which it has made a recommendation that the matter be referred to the Standing Committee on Procedure, and procedures that committees might follow if contemplating the reference of matters to the Committee of Privileges. I commend the report to the Senate and seek leave to continue my remarks. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the report. </PARA>
<PARA>On 7 March 1989 an election for the first self-governing Assembly of the ACT was held. Many features of the election were unique in Australian parliamentary electoral history. These features included the number of candidates-117; the size of the ballot paper-one metre long; the nomination of candidates from parties opposed to the principle of self-government; candidates from a relatively large number of nonsense parties-the Surprise Party and the Sun-Ripened Warm Tomato Party, to name just two; and, finally, the duration of the count, which took nine weeks and two days to complete. The electoral system which was used and which is known as modified d'Hondt is unique in international electoral history. The Australian Electoral Commission described it as an `electoral system unknown to man'. </PARA>
<PARA> Because of concerns that the length of time taken to count the votes and the complexity of the electoral system threatened the reputation and viability of self-government in the ACT, the Senate referred these matters to the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters in May this year. The terms of reference were: firstly, that the Committee review the electoral systems and the election process; secondly, that the Committee particularly examine whether the deposit required to be paid by candidates is adequate and, thirdly, whether the cut-off level for unsuccessful candidates is set at the most appropriate level. The Committee found that, given the circumstances of the election, the complexity of the electoral system and a prior agreement reached with the ACT Administration, criticism that the Australian Electoral Commission had been inefficient or dilatory in the conduct of the count and had failed in its education campaign to give voters sufficient understanding of the ACT electoral system to enable them to cast effective votes, was unwarranted. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee found that the level of candidate deposit was too low and the conditions for party registration in the ACT too loose to discourage the involvement of frivolous candidates and parties in ACT elections. Accordingly, it recommends the raising of the deposit from $100 to $250, the same as is required for the House of Representatives. It also recommends that, for the purpose of gaining registration for the ACT elections, political parties be required to demonstrate a minimum membership of 100. </PARA>
<PARA> The threshold or cutoff level of 5.56 per cent of the formal vote for unsuccessful candidates was strongly criticised as arbitrary and unfair in the evidence put to the Committee. Such a threshold represents what is known as a `droop' quota. It is the same concept as is used in the Senate and Hare-Clark systems, but it operates differently from these. First, it bears no relationship to the percentage of votes required for election under a d'Hondt system; secondly, candidates who do not achieve the threshold level on a count of first preference votes are simply excluded and are unable to benefit from the distribution of preferences. The Committee concluded that the threshold was arbitrary, but was reluctant to make any separate recommendation. The Committee has made recommendations to tidy up the arrangements for party registration and to provide for the grouping of independents on the ballot paper. </PARA>
<PARA> The main consideration of the Committee was directed to the first of its terms of reference, namely, the electoral system and the election process. The modified d'Hondt electoral system was strongly criticised in the evidence before the Committee. One of the features most criticised is the complexity of the deeming provisions which can easily result in a person's vote being interpreted and counted other than in the way intended. The Committee has recommended that where appropriate the Senate's formality rules and deeming provisions serve as a model for the ACT system. Very few of the submissions received by the Committee supported the retention of any sort of d'Hondt electoral system. All recommended at least some changes. </PARA>
<PARA>The pure d'Hondt system, which operates in some parts of Europe, is a party list system which is generally regarded as operating fairly and equitably in the allocation of seats to parties. However, it does not allow electors to vote for individual candidates within a party. The Committee considered at some length whether it was possible to find some version of a d'Hondt system which could now be considered acceptable. It concluded that it was not. Because the major parties remain divided over their preferred alternatives of single member electorates on the one hand-the Australian Labor Party's preference-and a proportional representation system with multi-member electorates on the other-the preference of the Liberal Party and the National Party, the Committee decided it would be preferable to allow the people of the ACT to choose between three alternatives in a referendum, and has recommended accordingly. The Committee has also recommended that the Commonwealth fund a referendum offering these two alternatives. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I shall be very brief. I would like to echo the remarks made by Senator James Short in congratulating the Chairman of the subcommittee of the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters, Dr Wooldridge, and the members of the subcommittee. Those of us on the full Committee had the responsibility of going through the report that was presented to us by the subcommittee. It is not unusual for members of the various committees of this chamber to be engaged in matters that seem to have very little relevance at all to their own constituency. This was a case in point given its relevance to most, if not all, of the members of the subcommittee and most, if not all, members of the full Joint Committee. Yet members of that Committee, and particularly members of the subcommittee, were prepared to spend long hours in examining a problem which affects the Australian Capital Territory (ACT). They undertook that task admirably, having received a substantial number of submissions, and brought forward this report.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is an interesting report and no doubt will be considered by a gaggle of political scientists and commentators. I feel that it is essential to make a point that was not stated by Senator Short, that in fact the majority of members on the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters supported the Hare-Clark system for the ACT. </PARA>

It is important that that point be made. The modified d'Hondt system got a run over the course. It is a little unfair to wipe out the modified d'Hondt system completely because in my view it has some merits. But overall the Committee felt that it was not an appropriate system for ACT. In the back of the Committee's report there is a little folder which contains, for the benefit of those who receive and read the report, a copy of the ballot paper. I am unfolding the ballot paper. I do not know how long it is, but--</PARA></TALK.START>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="6H4">Senator HARRADINE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;One metre, is it? Yes, it is about a metre long. It is an indication of the difficulty, or the daunting task, that was presented to electors in the national capital when faced with an election under the modified d'Hondt system which was obviously a little too onerous for not only the electors but also the people who were counting the votes.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I will conclude by indicating that if the system is unworkable for the Australian Capital Territory Legislative Assembly, the appropriate system to my mind would be the Tasmanian system, the Hare-Clark system, which has worked and receives the support of all parties, as I understand it, in the State of Tasmania. It is a system which should attract a good deal of support, but we did not feel it was our right to impose such a system on the Australian Capital Territory. There are arguments for and against the system; there are arguments for and against the single member constituency. In effect, we say to the Australian Capital Territory electors that they should, at some stage, have a choice as to what voting system should operate for the Legislative Assembly, and that is recommended in the report. </PARA>
<PARA> It may well be that the Legislative Assembly will come up with a recommendation. The Legislative Assembly may consider that it is the body elected by the people in Canberra to represent them and it may well be that the Legislative Assembly could consider this report and say, `Well, we think that a particular system is the one that should go forward. On behalf of the people of the Australian Capital Territory, we consider that a particular system is the most desirable, and recommend to the Government, and therefore to this Parliament, a system of election which could then form the basis of legislation to be passed through both Houses of Parliament'. That is a possibility. It may, indeed, be a less expensive possibility than the one we are recommending-namely, a referendum. It may well be that if some sort of agreement or majority support is received that might be the way to go. The Committee has recommended certain aspects and I invite honourable senators to study the Committee's report. </PARA>

<PARA> The preferred system of the Labor Party members remains single member electorates . . . namely, that it is a simple, trusted system, giving an unrivalled degree of local representation and most likely to result in stable government. The preferred system of the Coalition and of the Democrat representative, Senator Jenkins and of the independent, Senator Harradine, is a Hare-Clark system with multi-member electorates, on the grounds that: proportional systems are inherently fairer; can also provide local representation; would be ideally suited to the circumstances of the ACT and a system of proportional representation was overwhelmingly supported by the majority of groups giving evidence to the inquiry. </PARA>
<PARA>The Committee could foresee that neither systems could secure a passage through both Houses of Parliament. For that reason the Committee came to the conclusion that it would let the people of the ACT decide which of the two systems they would prefer. </PARA>
<PARA> I could canvass the pros and cons at length, but I believe that with all the legislation we have before us that would not be at all appropriate. However, I will make a few comments on the modified d'Hondt system. I do not believe that it is a system which is inherently fair. Because candidates who do not obtain 5.5 per cent of first preference votes are excluded, the final result is that some candidates who actually obtain a percentage lower than 5.5 per cent of first preference votes are elected. It is also not a fully preferential system. The surplus votes after election are not necessarily passed on because they cannot go beyond the party list. </PARA>
<PARA> In conclusion we should note that on page xxiii the report describes the modified d'Hondt electoral system as hopelessly ill conceived and irredeemable. I would like it on record that during the negotiations on self-government and the form of electoral system for the ACT my advisers and I pointed out to the Minister the problems that were inevitable should the Government persist with the modified d'Hondt system. I recommended, and even went so far as to introduce, alternative legislation proposing a system of proportional representation with multi-member electorates modelled on the Tasmanian Hare-Clarke voting system with special modification to suit the population, the geography and the growth patterns of the ACT. That was the discrete communities plan. I further proposed the holding of a referendum to allow the people of the ACT to chose their own electoral system. When the Government's legislation was debated, I also proposed numerous amendments, all of which were rejected by the familiar, unholy alliance of Liberal, Labor and National party senators voting together. I am not sure where Senator Harradine stood there. </PARA>
<PARA> The report recommends the holding of a referendum of ACT voters to choose between the single-member electorates and the Hare-Clarke system. It saddens me that the d'Hondt system was introduced for the ACT in its first election for its substantial Legislative Assembly because it has brought the never popular concept of self-government in the ACT into further disrepute, which is a matter to be regretted. Now that this report has been tabled, and after the ACT Legislative Assembly brings down its report very shortly, I hope that the matter can be resolved sensibly. In conclusion, the report is a good report and a full report. It makes good reading, and I would certainly recommend that people should read it. I would like to place on record here my personal thanks to the Committee as a whole, which was a very good committee to work with, and also to the Secretary, Mr Allan Kelly, the subcommittee Secretary, Dr Robyn Seth-Purdie, and the staff of the Committee. </PARA>

<PARA>I seek leave to incorporate in Hansard a statement by the leader of the delegation, Mr Ronald Edwards, MP, and to continue my remarks. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The document read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA> I present the report of the visit by the Australian parliamentary delegation to the European Parliamentary Institutions, the North Atlantic Assembly, Cyprus and Portugal in September and October of this year. </PARA>
<PARA> At the outset I should say that I was honoured to lead a delegation that was characterised by the bipartisan and disciplined approach of all members. There is no doubt that the success of the visit was due to the effective and harmonious working relationship that we all agreed was necessary at a pre-departure meeting, and which developed to a level which should become the standard for all parliamentary delegations. In this regard, I would like to pay a particular tribute to Senator David Hamer, the deputy delegation leader, for his assistance and unfailing co-operation. In addition, I must thank the other members who worked so diligently to guarantee the success of the visit and they are:</PARA>
<PARA>Senator Graham Maguire;</PARA>
<PARA>Senator Terry Aulich;</PARA>
<PARA>the honourable member for Calwell, Dr Andrew Theophanous;</PARA>
<PARA>the honourable member for Wannon, Mr David Hawker, and</PARA>
<PARA>the honourable member for Kennedy, the Honourable Bob Katter. </PARA>
<PARA> It was unfortunate that because of urgent and unforeseen circumstances it became necessary for Senator Hamer and me to return to Australia at the conclusion of the visit to the European Institutions. For the official visits to Cyprus and Portugal, Dr Theophanous was the delegation leader and he was ably assisted by Mr Hawker as deputy delegation leader. Therefore, my remarks will be confined to the period for which I was leader. I trust that there will be sufficient time for the honourable member for Calwell to address that part of the report that deals with the official visits to Cyprus and Portugal. </PARA>
<PARA> Before proceeding further it is necessary for me to acknowledge the assistance of those support staff who laid the foundations for the success of the visit. The staff of the Parliamentary Relations Office maintained the high standard of support which perhaps we sometimes take for granted. Our particular thanks go to Kieran Schneemann, Siobhan Ni Fhaolain and Cheryl Samuels. Excellent briefing material and assistance given by Dennis Argall and Frank Frost and his team of the Parliamentary Library allowed us to leave Australia confident in the knowledge that we were well briefed on current issues. The officers of our foreign service also provided briefing material and support that was of a consistently high standard. Our thanks also go to the staff of the House of Representatives printing unit for the professional printing of this report, which was completed in record time, and to Sue Cox who typed all the drafts and the final of this report. I particularly wish to acknowledge the exceptional work of Bertha Williamson and her quite efficiency and excellent support during the course of the visit. </PARA>
<PARA> The delegation visited Europe at a time of intense debate about the future of the European Community, the implications of the single market after 1992 and major developments in eastern Europe. Before departure the delegation set quite optimistic and extensive aims which are detailed in the report and which we modestly believe were achieved. However, the three major objectives of the visit were to adopt a high profile in presenting the Australian Government's position on issues of importance to Australia within the scope of the organisations, and countries to be visited; to assess the implications of a single market concept in the European Community as it is likely to affect Australia, and to assess political and commercial attitudes towards free trade, post 1992, and the Common Agricultural Policy in particular. At the Council of Europe we were able to gain acceptance for a number of significant changes to the draft resolution of the Committee on Economic Affairs and Development relating to the annual report on activities of the OECD. </PARA>
<PARA> During the course of our visit we had the opportunity to meet with Commissioner MacSharry and Commissioner Andriessen, as well as other senior officers of the European Community. Unfortunately, these meetings confirmed that it would be unrealistic for Australia to expect any further substantial changes to be made to the Common Agricultural Policy in the short term. Indeed, nations such as Portugal, Spain, Greece and Ireland, which need rural development, are seeking to maximise the benefits afforded by the CAP. However, the delegation considers that the best strategy for assaulting the CAP is to attempt to convince those responsible for financing it, of the costly and inefficient practice that they are funding. </PARA>
<PARA> Before concluding, I wish to state that it is our view that the annual visit to the European Parliamentary Institutions is absolutely essential as it provides opportunities for regular contact with European parliamentarians and officials, as well as forums, to present the Australian view on a wide range of issues. </PARA>
<PARA> Because the delegation was absent from Australia for a period of about four weeks and visited several European Institutions, the North Atlantic Assembly, Portugal and Cyprus, the report is quite comprehensive and, of necessity, is longer than is usual. However, I urge honourable members to read it in its entirety as it will give them a better appreciation of many issues that are currently of critical importance to Australia. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This evening we are finally debating the Privacy Amendment Bill 1989 which would probably represent the biggest slaughter of small business that we have seen if it were to be passed without amendment. This Bill has come before the Parliament without much consultation with industry and, I presume, as a vote buying measure by the Government. The second reading speech presented on behalf of the Minister for Consumer Affairs (Senator Bolkus) states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Privacy Amendment Bill 1989 is the next step in the Government's program to introduce comprehensive privacy protection for the Australian community. The principal purpose of this Bill is to provide privacy protection for individuals in relation to their consumer credit records. </PARA>
<PARA>They are very noble words indeed but small businesses are being slaughtered down the line. The use of credit is a very familiar and everyday practice in Australia. What may not be known is the vast database on the users of credit that is built up in Australia, and other places no doubt. This may not be generally known, but those who provide information before obtaining credit should know that their circumstances will be recorded for each lending institution. The centralisation of such data is only an expected outcome of that system. This could be for rationalisation of resources or exchange of information between lenders. After all, lenders want to have some idea of the past performance of borrowers. Finance companies are generally lending the money they have borrowed from smaller depositors in the first place. </PARA>
<PARA> For some time now there has been concern as to the use of the information held, but my prime concern is whether the information held is correct. To this end the borrower should always have access to his or her file to check that information is correct. I believe also that adequate protection should be afforded to credit consumers if wrong information is deliberately used against them. </PARA>
<PARA> There are various credit reporting agencies in Australia, by far the biggest being the Credit Reference Association of Australia Ltd (CRAA). CRAA holds information on 11 million Australians and organisations. Last year it handled 7 million inquiries from its 4,800 members. The main users of the CRAA database are public utilities, banks, finance companies, stores, credit unions, building societies, insurance companies, and real estate and mercantile agents. Information is held in relation to name and address, marital status, spouse, date of birth, driver's licence, employer and address, if any, directorships, default information, date of default, nature of default, repossessor in case of default, which CRAA member is inquiring, amount, court information, any bankruptcies or bankruptcy proceedings, records of inquiries made even if one is not asking for credit, whether by cheque or by cash. The CRAA sets up the file when the consumer asks for credit in the first place. </PARA>
<PARA> These reports are used for monitoring ongoing accounts, whether for goods, overdrafts or whatever. They are used by mercantile agents, who do a lot of the collecting of overdue debts, and by shire councils and other local government bodies. The reports are used by insurance companies to ascertain whether the person looking for insurance will be a good risk, and are also used sometimes when there is a claim on insurance. They are used when people are looking for a tenancy, to check whether they are a good bet before renting them a unit. They are even used by government. One may ask why government should use them. But there are times when even government departments will want to see how people are set up financially and whether their situation is sustainable. The immediate examples that I can think of are when one is taking out or taking over a taxi licence or when one is taking over a fishing licence. My State of Western Australia has a big fishing industry. The crayfishing industry especially is a limited access industry. If the fishing department were to receive an application for transfer of a licence-in the case of a crayfish licence it is a big figure-it would want to ensure that the person taking over is a worthy person. </PARA>
<PARA> Governments also like to inquire into the credit rating of someone taking out a legal gambling licence. Legal gambling is a bit of a misnomer but there are casinos and other gambling institutions around the place that are legal. These are not like some of the illegal ones that have been mentioned around the Australian Capital Territory lately. Organisations and individuals need to use these credit reporting agencies. I agree that there could be a problem with this system which has been set up for credit reporting. There is always a problem with the privacy of the information that is held. The Federal legislation seems to have been written on the basis of the report of the New South Wales Privacy Commission of recent date. It states, in part:</PARA>
<PARA> The Committee acknowledges that credit bureaux provide valuable information to credit providers on the advisability of offering credit to individual consumers. </PARA>
<PARA>It recognises that they provide valuable information. It continues:</PARA>
<PARA> A consumer's credit history is often a relevant factor to be taken into account when considering whether to provide credit to that person. </PARA>
<PARA>I certainly hope that it is taken into account when credit providers are using a lot of small investors' funds for loan purposes. I presume that it is. The report continues:</PARA>
<PARA> At the same time it is important to consider the legitimate interest of individuals in ensuring that information about them is collected fairly, maintained securely and is not open to misuse or improper disclosure. </PARA>
<PARA>I totally agree. It continues:</PARA>
<PARA> The conflict between values of personal privacy and those of economic efficiency is not a new dilemma for those concerned with protecting personal autonomy in an age of computerisation. </PARA>
<PARA> The problem is not a new one. I believe that the Credit Reference Association of Australia (CRAA) and other similar organisations around Australia have in the past acted honourably and with integrity. </PARA>
<PARA> As I have said, the conflict lies between personal privacy and economic efficiency-economic efficiency for the consumer's own good. Consumers should be advised, of course, of the existence of the record and of their rights to look into the accuracy of the information. I have already said that people should know that these records are kept. But there are some naive people so people should be advised. It should be their right to be advised. The problems that can arise-they have happened-with the CRAA and other organisations include careless reporting or deliberate misreporting. Whoever deliberately misreports should be locked up in gaol. I know of one famous case where an ex-brother-in-law of someone applying for credit was stitched up as retribution for what happened in the family. Disputed debts could cause a problem. There could be problems with failure to report on the financial position of the people who have credit with spouse debts or ex-spouse debts and with access to correction. I believe that people applying for credit, or people who receive credit, should have a right at all times to have access for correction of the records. This has been a problem sometimes. </PARA>
<PARA> I will now move to the provisions of the Bill. The report of the Standing Committee for the Scrutiny of Bills outlines the definition of the Bill. It states:</PARA>
<PARA> The Bill defines a credit provider as:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) a bank; or</PARA>
<PARA> (b) a corporation (other than an agency)</PARA>
<PARA> (i) that is a building society; or</PARA>
<PARA> (ii) that is a credit union; or</PARA>
<PARA> (iii) whose sole or principal business or undertaking is the provision of loans (including . . . credit cards) intended to be used wholly or primarily for domestic, family or household purposes;-</PARA>
<PARA>I will go back to that one. Again, it states:</PARA>
<PARA>a corporation . . . whose sole or principal business or undertaking is the provision of loans . . . intended to be used wholly or primarily for domestic, family or household purposes. </PARA>
<PARA>I would like to know where the stock firms as we know them-suppliers of merchandise who sell and buy stock and provide finance; in other words, Elders Pastoral, Wesfarmers, Rural and the ones in the eastern States, such as Dalgety Australia Operations Ltd-fit into the definitions. They are probably the biggest suppliers of credit to the rural industry of Australia, mainly to woolgrowers and the ones that run stock, not so much to wheatgrowers. I would like to know where they are defined. The definition in the report continues:</PARA>
<PARA> (iv) that carries on a retail business in the course of which it issues credit cards . . . </PARA>
<PARA>It goes on. That is the definition. The comment of the Scrutiny of Bills Committee goes on to state:</PARA>
<PARA> Section 11b, when interpreted-</PARA>
<PARA>that is the first section I have mentioned-</PARA>
<PARA>in conjunction with section 18k, would appear to have the potential to exclude a very large range of business organisations, who currently have access to credit reports on individuals. These organisations include, but are not limited to:</PARA>
<PARA>Let me read out some of those organisations:</PARA>
<PARA> many finance companies (including members of the Australian Finance Conference)</PARA>
<PARA> most retailers</PARA>
<PARA> television and video rental companies</PARA>
<PARA> electrical retailers who hire equipment</PARA>
<PARA> plant and equipment hire companies</PARA>
<PARA> furniture hire companies</PARA>
<PARA> car rental companies</PARA>
<PARA> accountants</PARA>
<PARA> solicitors . . . </PARA>
<PARA>In some cases, a few uncharitable people would consider that that was a wise decision. The report continues:</PARA>
<PARA> all insurance companies; including mortgage insurance and trade credit insurance underwriters</PARA>
<PARA> advertising agents</PARA>
<PARA> newspapers and magazines (classified advertisements)</PARA>
<PARA> factoring organisations</PARA>
<PARA> mercantile agents</PARA>
<PARA> all public utilities and boards . . . </PARA>
<PARA>I have already told honourable senators about shire councils and boards. The report also lists:</PARA>
<PARA> doctors</PARA>
<PARA> hospitals and clinics</PARA>
<PARA> builders and home service suppliers</PARA>
<PARA> real estate agents</PARA>
<PARA>Real estate agents are very important. Private developers in Australia supply a lot of flats and units for rental. If the Australian Democrats are interested in this Bill I would like to hear what they have to say about this. The owners of these units, the landlords, will be at great risk if they do not know what sort of tenant they are likely to get. It will mean only one thing: increased housing and rental costs. As I have said, the report lists mercantile agents. It also lists:</PARA>
<PARA> motor vehicle dealers</PARA>
<PARA> hotels</PARA>
<PARA> suppliers of goods</PARA>
<PARA> manufacturers</PARA>
<PARA> travel and entertainment cards . . . </PARA>
<PARA>The thing that concerns me about this legislation-the Scrutiny of Bills Committee has pointed this out-is that this clause, coupled with proposed section 11b, gives wide-ranging powers to a public official, that is, the Privacy Commissioner, effectively to determine whether a particular organisation, which grants credit in the marketplace anyhow, is to be allowed access to credit reporting records, including the major source of consumer credit information. So the Scrutiny of Bills Committee has deduced, and the Minister has probably admitted, that organisations which they admit are providers of credit are being excluded because a public official, by regulation, has put them in that category. This is certainly something that we cannot put up with. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn now to positive reporting. Positive reporting is a reporting of what is going on in respect of existing credit contracts. One has to report on how a credit contract is going, especially if one's financial position is deteriorating. That is to be banned. It is certainly not in the best interests of consumers or providers of credit. What did the Government have to say about this? Senator Bolkus said in his second reading speech, amongst other things:</PARA>
<PARA> The Government and the community must continue to focus on education, appropriate counselling and most importantly on responsible lending practices.</PARA>
<PARA>This is what the Government has said it must do to overcome these problems. Obviously, this has nothing to do with credit providers having the right to get some information as to how people are going. </PARA>
<PARA> I have a summary of the Opposition's objections to the Bill and I seek leave to have it incorporated in Hansard. I have already cleared it with the Minister. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The document read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA>SUMMARY OF OBJECTIONS TO THE BILL</PARA>
<PARA> The definition of `credit' and `credit provider' are so narrow as to exclude several thousand trading enterprises from access to credit reports on individuals. </PARA>
<PARA> Those still allowed access to credit reports will be severely restricted in their use of the information they receive. </PARA>
<PARA> Companies may not draw a credit report to review the status of an existing customer, even when that customer may be in financial difficulties. </PARA>
<PARA> Debtors who have left their address to avoid their creditors (clearouts) may not be reported to a credit reporting agency until they are more than 90 days overdue. This restriction will encourage fraud. </PARA>
<PARA> A credit reporting agency may not advise a creditor of the new address of a missing debtor. </PARA>
<PARA> Suppliers of consumer credit are denied access to any information about an applicant's commercial credit debts-even when the applicant is personally liable for those debts. </PARA>
<PARA> Commercial credit providers may not be told about an individual applicant's consumer credit debts-even when the applicant is clearly overcommitted. </PARA>
<PARA> Credit providers will be prevented from reporting credit default on millions of existing accounts. </PARA>
<PARA> Trading and credit organisations are banned from exchanging credit references, without the prior permission of their customers. </PARA>
<PARA> Insurance companies are banned from all access to personal information when assessing insurance claims. </PARA>
<PARA> Property owners are denied the right to inquire about the payment history of prospective tenants. </PARA>
<PARA> A creditor, seeking to recover a written off debt, may not pass on credit reporting information to a collection agent. </PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="JI4">Senator PANIZZA</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the Senate. How will we deal with this in government if this Bill is enacted as it reads now? We will certainly make some changes when we are in government. The main changes will be as follows: we will legislate to allow credit reference reports to be supplied to real estate agents and property owners to assist them in their decision as to whether to accept a tenant, and other decisions they have to make about tenancies. We will legislate for access to the records of debt collectors, or creditors actually engaged in collecting a debt, but not private investigators. We will also legislate in relation to firms selling goods or services on hire purchase credit or terms, underwriters of mortgages, firms engaged in leasing, renting, hire purchase, and similar activities.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I have a few questions to ask the Minister, Senator Bolkus, which he can think about when he is contemplating further changes to this Bill. I will read these questions into Hansard. Why, in June, did Senator Bolkus advise the Senate that the cost to the community of this legislation would be minimal, when in May his own proponents of the Bill told him that consumers would pay higher charges and higher interest rates because of it? Why does Senator Bolkus continue to disparage the only economic impact study of the Bill when, even after his many changes, the independent consultants have confirmed that a conservative estimate of its cost to the community is in the order of $1.25 billion to $2.4 billion per year? Why is the Parliament being rushed into protecting frauds and cheats at the expense of the less well-off? Those are just a couple of simple questions that I would like the Minister to mull over in the course of this debate. </PARA>
<PARA> This Bill will not further protect consumers of credit to any great extent; it will simply help some Australians to dodge their responsibility, which will be paid for by others. These shortfalls will be picked up by others by way of extra costs and interest rates. Anyone who reads the Canberra Times, while they are in Canberra or at any other time, would have seen a full page advertisement the other day depicting what can happen under this legislation. What amazed me--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator McKiernan would not want me to incorporate this advertisement in Hansard so that he can read it. I do not think it would fit. But the number of organisations it represents is astounding. I come back to the question that I asked earlier: What will the increased cost to Australians be? The legislation will cost between $1.3 billion and $2.4 billion a year. This will lead to interest rate rises of up to 1.5 per cent. This Government is saying that it is attempting to cut interest rates. All Australians want to see interest rates cut, yet here we have a measure which will cost so much and which will cause interest rates to rise. I believe that the Government is certainly going down the wrong track.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As I said earlier, this is the biggest slaughter of small business that I have seen while I have been in this Parliament. For a small business to carry on, it must be able, with a limited amount of finance in the bank-it is mostly finance that is borrowed-to know who are the most reasonable people to deal with. Small businesses must have the right to collect the money owing to them by being able to extend credit to their customers. Small businesses must have this right. I think it is an inherent right for all Australians, and this Bill flies in the face of that principle. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Privacy Amendment Bill 1989 is a very good example of a problem within an industry, if the industry takes the problem to the Government, very soon becoming a crisis. The Government, fundamentally, is here to protect our privacy, not to invade it with such things as the Australia Card, and the pharmacy card that is proposed to be introduced. This Bill is a typical example of the way the Government has gone about its legislation recently. There has been improper and inadequate consultation with the industry concerned, inadequate investigation of the issues involved and incongruous conclusions derived from the meagre evidence that it has gleaned, producing inadequate legislation with many intended and unintended consequences requiring massive amendments. The Government itself has had to put up 40-odd amendments to its own Bill. The Bill is going to put insupportable controls and restrictions on business and people at increased cost and with no discernible benefit. I am pleased to see that the Minister for Consumer Affairs (Senator Bolkus) is in the chamber. I think the Minister thought he was on to a winner, but he has been conned into the precipitate introduction of this Bill by some sort of ideological claptrap of support for some of his civil libertarian sycophants. That is how it appears to me.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There are undoubtedly some genuine complaints about the Bill, but most of them are about the reporting standards of government commercial operations-such as Telecom Australia, for example. I heard about one complaint just the other night where a married chap applied for a loan but was refused. His wife happened to work for one of the credit reference agencies and had an access number she was able to ring in order to find out why he had been refused. He was refused because he was having an argument with Telecom over his telephone bill which he had not paid. So Telecom notified the credit reference people that he had a bad debt and he was refused a loan. Subsequently, his telephone bill was rectified, but Telecom did not rectify the entry that had gone to the credit reference agency. So, undoubtedly, there are bad reporting procedures that should be got rid of but, as I say, mostly they come from government agencies, and the Government ought to fix up its own act rather than put restrictions on private business. </PARA>
<PARA> The whole attitude of the Australian people, I think, has been undermined by their access to credit cards. Banks and lending agencies have issued credit cards to people without asking for adequate security or without checking on their ability to repay. That has led to a plastic money society, and I think that situation has to be rectified so that people can take some responsibility for themselves without having the responsibility taken from them. I do not see this Bill as being at all urgent. The Bill is being debated in the Senate as an urgent Bill, but there is no need for the unseemly haste that has been urged upon the Senate by the Minister. </PARA>
<PARA> Any credit reference operation should work on the basic twin principles of reliability of the financial information stored for its members and then a mechanism for consumers to be advised that commercial enterprises will have access to this information about them. There should also be an opportunity for them to obtain redress for improper use of that information. Individuals and businesses wishing to do business with other businesses and individuals often have the need to establish the creditworthiness of the other party. To satisfy this need, credit references bodies have arisen and, in general, they operate on sound principles with regard to both accuracy and privacy. </PARA>
<PARA> The creditworthiness of individuals and businesses is often required to be looked into by banks and financial institutions, vehicle hiring firms, equipment hiring firms and real estate agents-and I understand that real estate agents were not covered by the first amendments that we saw, although another two swatches of amendments were circulated today which I have not yet had time to read. These thick bands of amendments were delivered to my office at about quarter-to-five this afternoon. The sellers of goods and services have to check the creditworthiness of people as do debt collectors and insurance companies in order to prevent fraud, for example. So credit checking is widespread, is done on a regular basis and is essential in today's business world. </PARA>
<PARA> In Australia, 98 per cent of credit referencing for individuals is done by the Credit Reference Association of Australia Limited (CRAA), which is owned by its 4,800 members, those being the major government utilities, banks, finance companies, department stores, credit unions, building societies, insurance companies, credit card companies and many manufacturing and trading companies. Enormous use is made of credit referencing by people in their trading arrangements, and it has grown from originally a card index system into a sophisticated computer network. The database now holds records of over 10 million individuals and businesses and members of CRAA make about 7 million inquiries a year-not only about lending money but also about extending credit. Credit reference is, therefore, widespread and its business is increasing and many commercial undertakings in Australia are dependent upon it. </PARA>
<PARA> The database files, which produce printouts, are based on information on defaults sent in from members of CRAA and from public records-for example, bankruptcy orders and judgments, company records and insurance claims. In addition to that information, inquiries made by members of CRAA are recorded for their own purposes. All of this information enables members to make a better informed decision on whether or not to lend money or to extend credit-for example, whether or not a business or an individual is a good credit risk. But, conversely, access to this information acts in the interests of the borrower to prevent an individual or a business overextending their repayment capacity. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course, just who has access to this database is important and has been the subject of much debate, particularly in recent times. Members of the CRAA, of course, have access to the database, which is gained by telephone, by computer to computer links or by personal computers via the telephone network. Most access is by computer. The CRAA operator brings up the file, gives the member a printout and the member then has to make his own commercial judgment on any future business arrangements he may make. Any member making improper use of the information, or not complying with the secrecy rules faces expulsion, and that is a very important prohibition on misuse of the information. Consumers who have been refused credit also have access to their own files, free of charge, to assess the reason why they have been refused. Also, any person on whom records are kept can have access to his own files at any time for a payment of a fee-I think it is currently $5. </PARA>
<PARA> The CRAA also operates an insurance information service and holds information on approximately three million insurance claims. Its function is to give insurers information about previous claims, together with other credit information, thus reducing the possibility of future fraudulent claims. Naturally, this keeps insurance premiums down. I notice huge full page advertisements in the Canberra Times listing the hostility there is to the Bill and warning people of the increased costs that they will be up for, should the Bill go through as it is today, not only with interest rates but also with an increase in insurance premiums. </PARA>
<PARA> The CRAA maintains responsible security by strictly limiting access to its database, and it has an extensive system of verification of the data stored. For example, it examines applicants for membership closely and monitors the way in which its members use the service. As I have mentioned before, the ultimate penalty for breaches is expulsion of the member. Just what information is stored is important. The CRAA has its own rules on what information it will store and what information it will not store, and it keeps only financial matters relevant to credit extension or other relevant commercial decision. It does not keep information on race or national origins; political, social or religious beliefs; lifestyle or sexual practices or preferences. It does not allow its data to be used for private investigation purposes, pre-employment checks or to generate direct mailing lists. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister placed great stress on the CRAA's accent on negative reporting-as opposed to positive reporting-and used this as the basis for urging the urgency of the Bill, which is ridiculous. There is widespread discussion in progress right now about the prospects of positive reporting-that is, the reporting of an individual's cash flow payments-so that the good news can accompany the bad news, if there is any. Credit providers would be able to make a more perspicacious decision on whether to extend credit. This extension would require the CRAA to keep records of almost all transactions in Australia, and that would require an enormous expansion of the databank. It would resemble the databank that was proposed for the Australia Card, for example, and the one that will be needed for the pharmacy card, should that come in. I remember the problems that raised before. The important thing about the Australia Card was that the number on that card related to the person, as opposed to the numbers that are on Bankcards and other credit cards which belong to the card. With the Australia Card an audit trail could be established on a person and follow them around. If a married man bought a set of ladies' underclothes that was not the same size as those of his wife, he would be able to be picked up on that. There are enormous concerns and implications for recording every transaction in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> Clearly, if information from the databank is stolen or improperly used, there could be a massive invasion of personal or business privacy and it is this concern which led to this Bill in the first place. But, the Bill does not allow for positive reporting, which was supposed to be one of the objects of the Bill, and even restricts negative reporting, which is the whole aim and object of credit reference reporting. Nobody is arguing that we do not need legislation to protect our privacy but this Bill is not the way to go. In fact, this Bill has become a hotchpotch of random prohibitions principally to restrict access to the files and then to restrict credit reporting itself. This is ridiculous when it is obvious from all the evidence that we need a more liberal use of credit reference reporting in order to do better business and prevent bad business and fraud. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government is trying to establish rules on such things as what information may be kept, how long it may be kept, its accuracy and security; access to the data base; alterations of incorrect information; disclosure of information on file; the uses the information can be put to; the penalties for including false or misleading information on the files; a code of conduct for the detailed operation of the system and enforcement by the Privacy Commissioner. This all sounds good, but the Bill is heavily slanted against business and commerce. It severely limits the use of credit referencing and it prohibits some of the uses that are both necessary and legitimate. The CRAA itself has estimated that if this Bill goes through over 90 per cent of its members will no longer be able to use its services, even with the foreshadowed amendments. I am not sure about the amendments that came around late this afternoon-there may have been later additions, but they merely go to show just how inadequate the Bill was in the first place. No wonder there has been a massive outcry from many people in the industry. I point again to the huge advertisements that have appeared in the newspapers today, and the hostility has been demonstrated in the Senate this afternoon. </PARA>
<PARA> Virtually the whole of the industry has ranged against the Government because of this Bill. It will force many credit referencing companies to close and severely restrict others. Business costs will escalate and insurance premiums will rise because of it. Interest rates will rise even further than they are today-and, heaven knows, they are exorbitant now. Borrowers will sometimes overcommit, and other borrowers will be hurt as decisions on advances to them will not be made on reasonable and objective information. In other words, sometimes to stop people borrowing is just as important as to allow them to borrow. </PARA>
<PARA> The exclusion of insurance companies and real estate agents from credit information is commercially unrealistic-and even Labor Ministers around Australia are objecting. The Bill's definitions are incomplete and inadequate. For example, credit is defined as a loan for domestic, family or household purposes. The Bill restricts provision of information to a credit provider. So how could a real estate agent check the standing of his client, because he is not providing a loan? How could a company collect a debt, because it is not providing a loan? How could a creditor locate a debtor, because a loan is not involved in that? How could a business sell goods on terms or credit? No loan is involved there. How could an underwriter back a mortgage? How could a company hire out goods or equipment? How could a credit provider review his slow payers or locate a missing debtor? No loans are involved in any of those operations. If insurance companies are prohibited from checking the credit default record of claimants, obviously this will increase fraud and cause a rise in premiums. </PARA>
<PARA> Bad debts are dealt with unrealistically as the Bill prohibits their recording unless they are 90 days overdue. It was 90 days overdue, I think it then went to 60 days overdue, and it may have been altered again in the subsequent amendments that were produced late this afternoon. The Bill also severely restricts the amount of default information that may be kept. The distinction between personal, domestic and business credit is unrealistic, as access to credit reference on personal files for business finance is effectively prohibited, because an agency will be permitted only to disclose information concerning domestic, family or household loans. For all its pretences this Bill does little to protect privacy. It does not reflect the information privacy principles set out in the Government's own Privacy Act 1988. The Bill stops credit providers from passing on information concerning defaulters to other credit providers without their consent. How do credit providers get this consent when they do not know where the defaulter is or if the debtor refuses consent until after the default has occurred? The Bill is not urgent; it should be withdrawn and put to the industry and the people concerned and then redrafted. I support the Opposition's amendment to this effect and seek leave to continue my remarks. </PARA>

I believe that the Government would indicate the date that it has framed for the proposal. The Senate and the House of Representatives can count back the days to make sure that the Government complies with the 15 days.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think that putting 15 sitting days into this is very interesting in view of the rumours in relation to an election and the possibility of our not sitting until well into next year. I understand that the Minister for Housing and Aged Care, Mr Staples, is hoping to have the charter ready some time in March. Supposing there were an election, 15 sitting days might take it well on into April or even into May. The charter would then be laid before each House for a further 15 sitting days. I recognise that the Government is keen that the whole of this period be completed before 1 July because it wants a a 1 July start-up date. The Opposition and the Australian Democrats also want the process to be expedited as far as possible, but allowing an adequate time for review. This may be a difficult question, but I wonder whether the Minister for Resources (Senator Cook) could indicate whether there is any chance of an earlier formulation of the charter?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am answering a question directly, and as straightforwardly as I can. Senator Coulter asked me to give a specific indication to the Committee on whether this matter can be expedited so that we can complete this 15-day lying on the table period as soon as possible in the new year. I think that was his question. If the honourable senator will just give me a moment, I will ask my adviser if he can shed some light on that. We are caught in the bind that the sooner we put it down the shorter the period for consultation. We obviously want to exhaust the prospects of consultation so that no-one can say that this is a dictatorial government trying to give the groups with whom it is consulting something that they may not want or that it did not give them sufficient time to respond. That is a constraint on my answering the question directly. I understand and sympathise with the honourable senator's point of view. We will try, as well as we humanly can, to expedite the process at the earliest possible date but, if that means that we are running into problems on the consultative front by cramping the time for the agencies and bodies to reply, we will have to fulfil our consultative commitment before putting down a statement.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Privacy Amendment Bill 1989 is a very important Bill. It was introduced in the dying hours of the autumn session of Parliament this year. It has various purposes and provisions but two of the main provisions are to insert a new part IIIA into the Privacy Act 1988, providing for regulation of the practices of credit reporting agencies and credit providers in relation to personal credit information. It also provides for the development of a code of conduct for the collection and handling of personal credit information by the Privacy Commissioner in consultation with the credit industry, government, consumer and privacy groups and other relevant bodies. There are other important provisions as well, but they are encapsulated in those two main provisions.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Since the Bill was introduced in the dying stages of the autumn session there has been no action other than the Government's announcement on 5 October-not in this Parliament but through a press release-that it would be making 41 amendments to its still undebated Bill necessitated because of major deficiencies of both a conceptual and a drafting nature in the original version. This is typical of the sloppy thinking and administration of this Government. Rarely nowadays in the Parliament do we have a Bill introduced which is not required to be subsequently amended because the Government got it wrong in the first place. To me that is the mark of a very sloppy and lax government administration. </PARA>
<PARA> We are now being asked to debate and pass this Bill in the dying hours of this session. Obviously with the pressures on the Parliament-we are working right up until this Bill is passed; we are right on the knocker of Christmas-there is totally inadequate time for proper debate and deliberation. The Opposition cannot understand the rush with this Bill. It sat there for months right through this session and now it is being debated in the last two days of the session. Why the urgency? Why must this Bill be passed this session? It is a very important Bill, but it is not an urgent Bill so far as its contents are concerned. It is a contentious, controversial and a much criticised Bill. Why not give it the consideration that it deserves? That consideration is quite impossible in this frenetic time scale. </PARA>
<PARA> What is the reason for the rush? What is the deal? There must be a deal in this somewhere, otherwise we would not be conducting ourselves in this unseemly way. Who is the deal with? What is the hidden agenda? I urge the Government and presumably the Minister for Consumer Affairs, Senator Bolkus, who will be taking this Bill through-it is his Bill-to give us answers to those questions and to come clean with the Parliament and the electorate. Then we may have more sympathy for the Government's actions. Until it does come clean we are forced to regard this Bill with the greatest suspicion indeed. </PARA>
<PARA> There is very considerable opposition to this Bill. Not opposition to appropriate legislation per se-most of the parties to the consideration of this matter, the industry itself and this side of politics, recognise that appropriate legislation is desirable-but to this Bill because it does not constitute appropriate legislation. It is a fundamentally flawed Bill. The Liberal and National Parties are not alone in this view. There are no less than 44 business and industry associations which have publicly criticised the Government's proposals. In addition, thousands of individual companies, particularly small businesses, have done likewise. These associations are not small beer; they represent thousands of member companies. They also indirectly represent the interests of millions of Australian consumers. Members of these associations together have responsibility for the handling of literally tens of billions of dollars each year. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me name just a few of them: the Australian Finance Conference; the Life Insurance Federation of Australia; the Insurance Council of Australia Ltd; the Credit Reference Association of Australia Ltd (CRAA); the Institute of Mercantile Agents Ltd; huge insurance companies like the National Mutual Life Association of Australia Ltd; the Real Estate Institute of Australia; the credit union movement; banks like the Challenge Bank Ltd; organisations such as the Advertising Federation of Australia Ltd, the Australian Association of Co-operatives Ltd, the Australian Association of Permanent Building Societies, the Australian Chamber of Commerce, the Australian Chamber of Manufacturers, the Australian Retailers Association, the Business Council of Australia, the Confederation of Australian Industry, the Institute of Directors of Australia, the Victorian Credit Co-operative Association Ltd and many others. </PARA>
<PARA> These are big names, they are responsible names, they are associations and companies with very high reputations when it comes to their dealing with money and credit and the putting of views to Government on necessary policy issues. They are the associations and organisations which this Government would normally consult and try to reach agreement with before bringing in major pieces of legislation. I am amazed that the Government is rushing this Bill through in the way that it is in the face of that opposition. Again I ask the Government to tell us why there is the need for this unseemly haste. </PARA>
<PARA> I will come back to the content of some of the concerns of these organisations a little later in my remarks. As well as private sector organisations, concern has been expressed by several of the States, and it is a pretty mixed bag. For example, the South Australian Minister for Consumer Affairs, Mr Sumner, in a press release, last month, said:</PARA>
<PARA> I support the need to ensure that safeguards for positive reporting exist, but this should not be at the expense of overturning the balance between consumer rights to privacy and industry rights to information. </PARA>
<PARA>The Victorian Minister for Consumer Affairs, Mr Tom Roper, in a press release on 22 October, said:</PARA>
<PARA> The Federal Privacy Bill will not help to stop people becoming financially over-committed. </PARA>
<PARA>Indeed, Mr Roper wrote publicly to the Real Estate Institute of Victoria earlier this year as follows:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . I wrote to Senator Nick Bolkus, the Federal Minister for Consumer Affairs, expressing my concern about the proposed Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> I outlined in that letter my view that insurance companies and estate agents be allowed to retain their membership of CRAA and suggested that the Bill's focus might be expanded to regulate the collection and handling of personal credit information across the three industries. </PARA>
<PARA>That is a political input from Victoria. In a press release on 25 October the Chairman of the Queensland Privacy Committee said:</PARA>
<PARA> There is little point in introducing legislation which does not significantly contribute to protecting individual privacy if it also introduces barriers to long established business practices and huge costs to the Australian community. </PARA>
<PARA>He was also referring to the legislation we are now debating. Mr Gerry Peacocke, the New South Wales Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs, wrote to the Minister on 20 September saying that he strongly opposed the legislation and requested the Minister to withdraw it. The New South Wales Privacy Committee itself has expressed concern about the Bill on the grounds that it is inappropriate and impractical, and has criticised the focus of the credit reporting legislation for a variety of reasons, particularly those of a practical nature. </PARA>
<PARA> There is a formidable array of opposition to this Bill. And what does the Minister think about this? A spokesman for Senator Bolkus was reported in the Bulletin of 24 October as saying:</PARA>
<PARA>The lobbying against it-</PARA>
<PARA>that is, the Bill-</PARA>
<PARA>is a bit of a giggle. </PARA>
<PARA>Now there are not too many people in the industry, and people who have had a look at this Bill, who are giggling. It is not a laughing matter. It is a very serious matter indeed. It is a matter which poses major problems for a wide range of not only the companies involved in the industries which rely on credit reporting, but also the millions of consumers who will be adversely affected by this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Bolkus has accused the Opposition of having an anti-privacy stance because of our opposition to this Bill. Let us be clear about who has the anti-privacy stance in this place. It was this Hawke Labor Government which tried to introduce the intrusive and un-Australian ID card-the Australia Card. It was this Government that tried to introduce an anti-rights bill of rights. It was this Government which introduced referendum changes which were fundamentally flawed on individual rights grounds, and which were roundly rejected by Australians. Let us have no more cant about who is concerned about the whole question of privacy in this country. </PARA>
<PARA> We are opposed to this Bill because it is a bad bill. It is a fundamentally flawed Bill. In his second reading speech, Senator Bolkus said:</PARA>
<PARA> The . . . Bill is the next step in the Government's program to introduce comprehensive privacy protection for the Australian community. The principal purpose of this Bill is to provide privacy protection for individuals in relation to their consumer credit records. </PARA>
<PARA>The Bill is really the Government's response to the problems that a modern democratic capitalist society has in relation to privacy and the provision of consumer credit. Specifically, it aims to establish a privacy framework for the regulation of the consumer credit reporting industry. </PARA>
<PARA> The coalition agrees with the principle underlying the Bill in the sense that personal and individual privacy is central to our whole value system. The Liberal and National parties, as I have said, have a proud record of protecting individual privacy and campaigning strongly against Orwellian Big Brother policies. Like the Government, we subscribe to the guidelines on personal privacy of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). I remind the Senate that those guidelines include that there should be limits to the collection of personal data and that that personal data should be relevant to the purposes for which it is to be used and it should be accurate. The purpose for which personal data is collected should be specified at the time of collection and subsequent use should be limited to the fulfilment of these purposes. Personal data should not be disclosed for other purposes except with the consent of the data subject or where required by law. Personal data should be protected by security safeguards. Individuals should be aware of who hold their personal data. Individuals should have a right of access to, and correction of, their personal data. The final OECD guideline is that data controllers should be accountable for complying with measures to give effect to these principles. </PARA>
<PARA> Despite our agreement with those guidelines, however, we have major concerns about the Government's proposals. We do not believe that this so called Privacy Amendment Bill can meet the laudable intentions which its name suggests in the consumer credit area. Rather than improve the lot of Australians, it will stifle business confidence and activity. It will result in more red tape and higher prices for consumers. </PARA>
<PARA> As I said earlier, since the introduction of the original Bill the Government has proposed no less than 41 amendments to its original draft. But those amendments do not reflect adequate consultation with organisations, companies and agencies that will be directly affected by the Bill. Apparently, Senator Bolkus is reported as having told the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) that industry has no problems with this Bill. That is simply not so. Senator Bolkus ought by now to be very well aware of that. </PARA>
<PARA> The simple fact is that, despite those recent amendments, this Bill is still essentially flawed. Many of the objectionable anti-business and anti-consumer elements are still contained in it. There has been an expansion of the definition of credit transactions to include hire purchase, credit contracts, leases and rental agreements for goods and services, which will enable the relevant credit providers to have access to credit reporting agency files. However, many important transactions are excluded. Many existing members of the Credit Reference Association of Australia, or the CRAA, will continue to be denied access to credit files and many organisations reliant on credit rating agencies will also be deprived of essential information on creditworthiness. </PARA>
<PARA> In its original form, Australia's primary credit association, the CRAA, estimated that over 90 per cent of its members would no longer be able to use its services. The amendments that the Government has introduced have changed that situation to an important degree but, even with the Government's amendments, 25 per cent of CRAA's members will still be precluded from using its services. That 25 per cent, amounting to 1,200 former users, includes all mercantile agents, real estate agents, loss assessors insurance companies and brokers. It also excludes government departments, even where they offer credit. Collectively, those organisations deal with billions of dollars annually, and accurate credit information is of prime importance. Also adversely affected will be that huge range of other small businesses that depend on the creditworthiness of suppliers, customers and other clients. Businesses, including real estate agents, debt collectors and small business, have every right to do these credit checks. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="DJ4">Senator SHORT</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As my colleague Senator Archer has quite rightly pointed out, business is charged with a duty to its shareholders and its enterprise to do so. Only through such checks can business discharge its responsibilities towards it shareholders and clients. It is a legitimate and necessary function of business.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Then there are the responsibilities that business has towards consumers. One of the biggest problems in the credit area is that people can get in over their heads. They take out loans and purchase goods on credit which they cannot afford to repay. Over recent years, particularly with the staggering increase in interest rates, that has become an increasing problem. </PARA>
<PARA> The problem with the Bill which is now before the Senate is that it will exacerbate the consumer debt problem. The ability of business to perform credit checks through the credit reference agencies is essential on two counts: first, it mitigates the prospect of consumers getting in over their heads; and, second, it enables businesses to represent the interests of their clients and shareholders in a reasonable and just way. Under the Bill, real estate agents will not be allowed to check the solvency of a tenant. When it is realised that real estate agents are charged with looking after an asset-in today's terms worth on average well over $100,000-it is ridiculous that they are not allowed to take measures to protect themselves and their clients against bad debtors. </PARA>
<PARA> Under this Bill, members of the Mercantile Agents Association will be precluded from obtaining credit reports from credit agencies like the CRAA. The implications of this for many Australian small businesses are far-reaching. The builder, tradesman, importer-in fact, anyone who has to outlay money in providing a service and who, therefore, runs the risk of bad debts-are all precluded from being able to chase up the bad debtor in an effective manner because debt collectors, under the legislation, are excluded from using the services of a credit reference agency. Small businesses will have no-one to turn to in the event of bad debts. If defaulters change their addresses or skip the State, there is no way the small businessman can find out. Such businesses are too small to become members of the CRAA; it is expensive-and, in any case, the Hawke Government now proposes that most of them would be ineligible to join. </PARA>
<PARA> Credit reporting in Australia is widespread. Most of it is done through CRAA, which is the largest credit reporting agency in the country. My understanding is that there is a code of conduct for the industry and that members who break this code are liable to expulsion from the Association, and other penalties as well. So the only people who have anything to fear from credit reporting are those who have broken the law by failing to pay their debts. </PARA>
<PARA> A key assumption of the Bill is that everyone has the right to have their privacy protected regardless of circumstances. I think that is a very debatable proposition. There is a strong argument to be made that, when people break the law-in this case they fail to pay their debts-they lose some of their rights. Businesses considering whether to loan such people money, rent them a property, and so on, have a right to discover the credit history of their potential clients. Businesses who have suffered at the hands of bad debtors have a right to be able to chase them up in the most effective way. This Bill imposes a new regulatory framework on Australian business which is flawed and which will ultimately cost the innocent consumers through rising prices. The 90 per cent of innocent, totally credit worthy consumers will bear the burden. </PARA>
<PARA> I repeat that the legislation as it stands is fundamentally flawed. It is so flawed that the Minister was forced to flag his intention to move 41 amendments in an attempt to improve it. It adds to the growing list of changes. Not far down the track are the class action and product liability proposals and others-a growing list of changes that this Minister is foisting on Australian business that will inevitably and ultimately hurt ordinary consumers. This anti-business agenda of the responsible Minister-and he is doing it on behalf of the Government-can only hurt Australian consumers. It will lead to higher compliance costs and, therefore, prices. There must be a better approach to the privacy and consumer credit issue and such an approach is readily available. </PARA>
<PARA> The principles on which I believe legislation in this area should be based should be clearly stated. There are two basic principles which should underly such legislation. Firstly, commercial organisations should have access to appropriate information that enables them, on the basis of that information, to make sensible, commercial decisions. Secondly, consumers should be given reasonable notice that commercial organisations have had access to this information about them, should be able to obtain redress for improper use of that information and should be able to verify the accuracy of that information. This legislation satisfies neither of those principles. It will result in more red tape. Like the invidious class action and product liability proposals that are around, it is totally at odds with the commitment of the Government and of the Prime Minister personally to reduce costs and eliminate red tape for business. </PARA>
<PARA> The problems with the Bill go much deeper. They go to basic principles about the whole role of government in relation to business. I fear that, if the anti-business stance of this government, as exampled in this Bill and the way it is drafted, continues unabated it will ultimately destroy the Australian economy. I support very strongly, as do all members of the Opposition, the stand announced on our behalf by Senator Hill in opposing this Bill. We have a large number of amendments to move in the committee stage of the Bill. We also have a major second reading amendment which reads:</PARA>
<PARA> the Senate declines to give this bill a second reading as the Senate is of the opinion that the bill:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) imposes excessive and unjustified prohibitions and restrictions on the collection and use of personal financial information;</PARA>
<PARA> (b) fails to provide that credit reference agencies be able to give commercial organisations reasonable access to appropriate financial information they have collected provided that the information is reasonably required by a commercial organisation to assist it in making commercial decisions;</PARA>
<PARA> (c) will place obstacles in the way of the detection of fraud-</PARA>
<PARA>that is particularly important; it has been raised several times by the major insurance industry associations-</PARA>
<PARA> add to the cost of insurance, goods and services, increase interests rates and impose additional costs and inefficiencies on business, its customers and the community;</PARA>
<PARA> (d) falls short of the Information Privacy Principles contained in the Privacy Act 1988, particularly those Principles designed to ensure that individuals are made aware that information concerning them has been disclosed;</PARA>
<PARA> (e) will have many unintended consequences to the detriment of consumers, credit providers, credit reference agencies and the community as a whole; and</PARA>
<PARA> (f) has been introduced without adequate consultation. </PARA>
<PARA>The amendments that the Opposition will be moving in the committee stage of this debate are intended to include publicly available information in the provisions of the Act and to eliminate the split between consumer and commercial credit information-a totally artificial and impracticable split, which is not possible to be compiled with according to the Credit Reference Association of Australia Ltd. Therefore, the CRAA will be permanently in a state of illegality in its operations and will face at least potentially huge financial penalties. Our amendments will also allow general insurers and real estate agents access to credit information files and will ensure that such access is regulated. Our amendments will broaden the definition of credit provider to allow genuine trading organisations to have access to credit information files. Our amendments will remove the Commissioner's power to determine that an organisation that operates commercially as a credit provider is not a credit provider for the purposes of the Act. We will also correct the many anomalies and contradictions presently found in the Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> I hope very much, on behalf of industry, commerce and business and this country, and also the millions of Australian consumers who will be adversely affected by the Bill as presently drafted, that the Government will take the committee stage debate very seriously and will look at the Opposition's amendments very carefully. They have been very carefully drafted and they are in the interests of all concerned. This Bill is fundamentally flawed; it cannot be allowed to proceed unamended. </PARA>

It is a waste of time, money and resources for the Senate to be debating the Privacy Amendment Bill, replete with amendments to the amendment Bill. If this Bill was not in a satisfactory form when it was first introduced and Senator Bolkus wanted to make alterations, he should have withdrawn the Bill so that it could have been redrafted. Better still, he should have consulted the Credit Reference Association of Australia Ltd and its members before drafting the Bill in the first place.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There has been an outcry from a majority of the business sector to the Privacy Amendment Bill as originally proposed, and rightly so. It has achieved very little of what it set out to accomplish, neither improving privacy protection for individuals in relation to their consumer credit records, nor clarifying the rules with regard to access to the consumer credit reporting system. This being the case, I join with my fellow coalition senators in requesting that the proposed legislation be withdrawn and that the Government sort out what it wants in the area of privacy and introduce into the chamber one Bill which would cover the matters that it wishes to cover and which the chamber can then debate. In its present form of a 19-page Bill to amend the Privacy Act 1988-with a further nine-page document containing 41 amendments including one new definition, three altered definitions, 20 deletions and replacements, 16 new insertions and one deletion-the Bill is not in a state suitable for debate in this chamber. The procedures of the Senate are such that constructive debate is not possible when a Bill has such a large number of amendments. Thus I reiterate the call of my colleague Senator Hill that the Bill be withdrawn, redrafted and then presented to the Senate for debate. </PARA>

The Bill was long awaited and we have consulted widely about the implications for business and individuals. There are undoubtedly serious problems and serious defects. It prohibits many legitimate uses of credit checks by such people as real estate agents, mortgage underwriters, businesses selling good in terms or credit, insurance companies and companies renting out or leasing goods or equipment. The absurdity of preventing business such as these from having access to credit information is patent. Even the Government ought to be able to see this if it were not so blinded by its ideology.

Under this Bill credit providers cannot pass on information of actual defaults to other credit providers without debtors' consent. It is ridiculous when a credit provider of a business loan is not entitled to take account of the creditworthiness of the applicant in relation to personal credit and vice versa. The absurdity of that belies description, and I hope that the Minister for Consumer Affairs (Senator Bolkus) will attempt to give some explanation of the reason for it when he responds at the end of the debate at this second reading stage.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is lunacy. The coalition has expressed its clear opposition to this very biased legislation, which has raised very legitimate concerns in the business community. Earlier I mentioned real estate agents. I shall not go through the letters that I have received of the hardships that are perceived in that area for landlords and tenants, very particularly, because they will be the ones who will actually suffer. I and others have received letters from the Real Estate Institute of Australia which make it very clear that that organisation is not in the least reassured by the Minister's claims that the legislation will affect only a very small number of real estate agents. The Institute rejects the Minister's assertion that credit reporting facilities are used by only a few agents. One wonders where on earth he got that astounding piece of information from.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The letter from the Institute states that real estate agents have been accessing credit reporting files for over 18 years and that in the first 11 months of the 1988-89 financial year they did so over 100,000 times. The Real Estate Institute estimates that over 1.5 million inquiries have been made on behalf of property owners since the late 1960s, mostly in capital cities. The Minister states that consumer credit records do not contain tenancy information. The Institute refutes this. Real estate agents making a credit inquiry look for a history of non-payment of rent and clear-outs by tenants-those people who just take off and leave without paying their rent. They also look for non-payment of other debts. There is no doubt that there is a close correlation between non-payment of items purchased on credit, running out on paying Telecom Australia accounts and non-payment of rent. Anybody who has had any experience knows that. The Real Estate Institute believes that the Bill, if passed, would result in increasing rental defaults and an increasing incidence of fraud when dishonest tenants learn that they can move from one property to another without any details of non-payment being recorded on the file. </PARA>
<PARA> The Institute is concerned about privacy, but it is also concerned about the rights of property owners-something that the Government rejects totally. The Institute is concerned about the rights of honest tenants who may miss out on getting a house or flat because their creditworthiness cannot be checked. Tenants will, as a consequence, face increased rents and higher bonds as property owners seek to hedge against prospective defaults. This will greatly disadvantage low income earners, most of whom are forced into rental accommodation. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister has brought in some 40 or so amendments to this Bill, which gives some indication of how flawed it was in the first instance; but these amendments have done nothing to change the situation. Real estate agents, insurance companies and companies which rent or lease goods or equipment are still excluded from using credit referencing facilities. The amendment to reduce from 90 days to 60 days the period which must elapse before a creditor can list a debtor as a credit risk is no concession. It merely highlights the absurdity of the 90-day provision in the first place. It ignores the fact that by the time 60 days has passed a defaulter may well have chalked up a series of other transactions and defaults. Creditors need to be able to act much more quickly for the protection of other credit providers and, significantly-this seems to have escaped the Minister's attention-for the benefit of the defaulter himself or herself. Allowing people to compound their credit defaults does them no favour at all, yet the Government seems to be intent on allowing this to happen. </PARA>
<PARA> Many of the other defects in the Bill are not addressed by the latest bunch of changes that the Minister has managed to cobble together. The legislation demonstrates a complete lack of understanding of commercial realities and, on the other side of the equation, is defective in respect of the protection which it is supposed to provide for consumers. If the Bill is passed, it will cause a great deal of hardship to many of those it was intended to protect. The Bill will cause many it was intended to protect to have to pay much higher rates for the things that they are getting than they would otherwise have done. We will be opposing the Bill. We are moving a second reading amendment to the Bill, which I shall not read out again but which I commend to the Senate, which I hope honourable senators will support when voting upon it. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Privacy Amendment Bill is a very special Bill because it is easily the most stupid Bill that has been introduced since I became a member of this Parliament-and I have seen more doozeys put up at various times by various Ministers opposite. Clearly, it is to be the Bill by which Senator Bolkus will be remembered for his time in the Parliament, because it is absolutely the greatest load of philosophical garbage that we have had since I have been a member of the Senate. So all I would say is-and I regret that Senator Bolkus is not present in the chamber-good luck to Senator Bolkus; he must wear it. I will not speak for long, and I will deal with only two items. As other honourable senators have covered many of the other areas of the Bill, I will not say too much about them. As I have had a particular connection with both the insurance and property areas, both before and since I became a senator, I wish to concentrate on these areas.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I do not think that I have ever had so many letters, calls, phone calls, lettergrams, deputations and petitions on any other issue. In fact, I have received between 3,000 and 4,000 petitions, irrespective of what other senators have received.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Reid, Senator Teague and Senator Stone also have not received such a request. Who is this legislation supposed to support and why do they not come out and say that they want support? The Government talks about privacy, but this is the disreputable Government that wanted to have us all numbered. It wanted us to have an Australia card, a pharmacy card and a Bill of Rights, and now it talks about privacy. What absolute bunkum! This is the Government that wants no-one to have the right to select their own health insurance, superannuation and other things like that. It is a miserable stunt and it can only protect crooks at the expense of honest people. I do not know why this Government wants to bestow special rights on crooks. That is the first question that I ask the Minister for Consumer Affairs (Senator Bolkus) to answer in due course. Why should honest people be lumbered by the misdeeds of those that this Government seems dedicated to support?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I start with the matter of insurance. I guess both Senator Bolkus and Senator Cook could readily tell us the figure that is placed on insurance fraud per year, mainly on arson, third party and vehicle theft. As they know, it is millions and millions of dollars. In fact, in Australia arson alone is listed as costing $1,000m per year. Who pays? It is not the crooks that pay; it is the honest people that pay. All sorts of inquiries, seminars and committees have been set up to deal with arson, and they have done a great job. I have one of the reports here, Arson: Action not Words. I recommend to the Minister for Resources (Senator Cook), who is present, and the Minister for Consumer Affairs, whose crummy legislation we are dealing with, that they look at something like that to get a better understanding of the matter. Why do we want to tear up all the good work that has been done by introducing a stupid Bill like this?</PARA>
<PARA> I hope that Senator Bolkus found the masses of documented cases of insurance fraud amusing or at least interesting. I wonder whether he saw a recent public affairs television program on the subject which would have given him a bit of background to the matter. I am not sure whether he believes it is funny, clever, or just business, or whether he is one of those people who brushes it off and says, `Oh, well, it doesn't matter; it's all covered by insurance'. Just to cover fraud, every insured person in Australia is currently paying for their insurance twice as high a premium as they otherwise might. They pay twice as much as they should do just to cover fraud. It is not only the actual amount of insurance loss that we are talking about; think of the lawyers, the police, the fire services, the loss assessors, the various committees, the law reformers, the courts and the insurance clerks that are part of the cost of fraud. </PARA>
<PARA> The privacy of crooks involved in insurance fraud is given paramount status by Senator Bolkus and his Government. Why? Does it extend to all crooks or is it selective? Do we also look after the people who pinch milk money or crack the cases in telephone boxes? If not, why not? Is it not the job of this Government, or any government, to do all that is possible to protect the interests of the honest people? Why is the effort to protect the privacy of the crooks at the expense of the honest people?</PARA>
<PARA> I have spent years involved with people concerned about insurance fraud. One secure way of combating it is through adequate sophisticated record keeping and checking. Even Senator Bolkus, maybe even Senator Cook, would concede that that is the case. Insurance fraud, as Senator Bolkus well knows, is commonly a repetitive crime. Once people do it, they do it over and over again. Difficult economic times cause an increase in the crime, and we are facing very difficult economic times. I say categorically that we are facing a period of increased insurance fraud unless we do something more about making the system work. </PARA>
<PARA> Recourse to central records can allow us to catch up with many of the crooks involved in insurance fraud-if Senator Bolkus and his colleagues want to catch up with them. With all the imagination that I can muster, I cannot imagine whose crazy idea this legislation could be or why any Minister of this Government should be so stupid as to go along with it. With all the rising costs, how has the National Roads and Motorists Association (NRMA) been able to cut compulsory third party premiums two years in a row? It is not because there have been fewer accidents or less serious ones; it is totally due to the organisation using better checking mechanisms and catching more crooks. </PARA>
<PARA> The insurance information service speaks for itself. It has worked well and it is working well, and that is what the Government is about to stop. What a maniacal action this is. The NRMA's action has been proved to be successful; because of that we are going to wipe it out. Every crook in Australia will drink to Senator Cook and Senator Bolkus on the night this appalling travesty of legislation is passed into law, should that ever happen-and God spare us. I really despair that we could be faced with such an awful law. </PARA>
<PARA> What about the people involved in house rentals? I wonder who convinced this Government that the crooks who do not pay the rent, who tear the place to pieces and then quit or have to be evicted, deserve more consideration than those tenants who look after their house and pay the rent, or, if it comes to that, than the owners of the house itself. I wonder whether Senator Bolkus has ever owned a rental property that provides a home to somebody who otherwise may not have had one. If so, I wonder whether he has had the sorts of problems I am talking about of non-payment of rent, considerable damage, eviction problems and things like that. I wonder whether he has found how difficult it is to evict such people from a house in the first place, probably with no chance of ever recovering the loss of rent. These days when one starts to look at 90 days rent for a unit or a house that is worth, say, $150 a week, one is up for $2,000 before one knows where one is. That is before one tries to get the cost of recovery and before one then has to go back, try to restore the damage and look for another tenant. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not know whether Senator Bolkus has ever been in that sort of position, but if he has not I can tell him that it is not much fun. I do not know whether, as a result of not being able to tell people about the credit or standing of his tenants, he would be happy if one of those tenants moved into a house of, say, a friend of his and repeated the dose, maybe for the tenth time, as he has done elsewhere. Why should people who cannot behave in a social way be protected by this Government? If those things happen simply because people are unable to get recourse to records that exist, it is too jolly bad. </PARA>
<PARA> Besides the individual loss, tenants are going to find it much more difficult to get housing. People will be less inclined to own rental housing; the rents will have to increase. I am pleased to see Senator Bolkus enter the chamber because he might need to know some of these things before he makes decisions on them. Agents and owners will have to be more selective. Bonds will have to be much higher. Is that what this legislation is all about? Are we trying to provide less accommodation at higher rates with greater bonds as a means of solving a problem? Is that what we are trying to do? We will be able to put every one of these results fairly and squarely at the feet of Senator Bolkus. Is this the best that this disintegrating Government can do? Is this why we have been kept in Canberra until Christmas? Is this the Government's demonstration of the sorts of priorities that it is putting before the people preparatory to going to an election? The cost of this legislation to the public will be huge. It is absolutely ridiculous. If there is any sanity amongst those opposite, they should scrap the Bill now. In the meantime I support the Opposition amendment and I object strongly to the Bill. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We are debating the Privacy Amendment Bill 1989. Having heard some of the recent contributions from honourable senators it is worth having a look at the actual provisions of this Bill. An outline of what the Bill is designed to do includes the following functions it is designed to provide:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> . . . regulation of the practices of credit reporting agencies and credit providers in relation to personal credit information;</PARA>
<PARA>. . . </PARA>
<PARA> provide for the development of a Code of Conduct for the collection and handling of personal credit information by the Privacy Commissioner in consultation with the credit industry, government, consumer and privacy groups and other relevant bodies;</PARA>
<PARA> provide individuals with an enforceable right of access to, correction of, their personal credit records;</PARA>
<PARA> limit the types of information which a credit reporting agency may hold;</PARA>
<PARA> provide that credit providers cannot disclose personal credit information about individuals without the express agreement of those individuals unless such a disclosure is necessary to prevent fraudulent practices by individuals to obtain credit . . . </PARA>
<PARA>And the list goes on. Since this Bill was introduced specifically within a timeframe to allow for comments and amendment, the Australian Democrats, as usual, have engaged in an intensive range of consultations with all relevant industry groups. The concerns which were raised during these discussions pointed to an obvious need to improve the Bill, which was brought before the Parliament in time to do that. A number of amendments are proposed to the Bill that is in front of us, which this chamber hopefully will get around to passing. The Australian Democrats see themselves as playing an important role in this exercise. This has provided a useful example of that particular role. Having determined where problems existed, and being guided by our consultations with a whole range of groups, I have consulted with the Minister for Consumer Affairs (Senator Bolkus) several times and we are very pleased to see that he has acceded to the matters we raised as per the Government's schedule of amendments. We have that enormous schedule of amendments before us. It is testimony to the work that has gone on since this Bill was first introduced. </PARA>
<PARA> I will take the opportunity to remind this chamber that the Democrats are the only party to remain consistent on the issue of privacy protection. A vote earlier today on the Electoral and Referendum Amendment Bill demonstrated that. Last year during the debate on the Privacy Bill we sought to strengthen the legislation and apply that Bill to the private sector. The major parties-the Labor Party and the Liberal and National parties-joined together to defeat the improvements which we had put up by way of amendment, including the ludicrous situation of the Opposition voting against its own amendments when the Bill came back from the House. I remind honourable senators of Senator Haines's words when we were debating the Privacy Bill last year, which is now embodied in the Acts which we are currently amending. On 8 December last year, Senator Haines stated:</PARA>
<PARA> Privacy legislation is something that the Democrats have been seeking since my colleagues came into this chamber in 1978. Australia has never had privacy legislation, unlike a number of other countries, and it sorely needs it. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the areas that we all need protection from is the release of information about us from the private sector. </PARA>
<PARA>. . . </PARA>
<PARA>we introduced privacy legislation of our own. We have always argued that the private sector should be covered by privacy legislation. </PARA>
<PARA>Of course we can see why the heckling is coming from the Opposition benches at the moment. The Bill before us addresses part of the problem by extending privacy protection to at least one sector of private industry; that is, the credit reporting sector. The Opposition's lack of commitment to privacy protection is evident here tonight as is its double standards. It seems that government departments must be obliged to comply with privacy obligations, but the private sector can be trusted to regulate itself. According to the Opposition, the credit reporting segment of the private sector is perfectly able, and we should trust it, to look after itself. The Government has had to wait for the threat of positive reporting and massive, unregulated, centralised databanks, before acting. Honourable senators should remember that the threat, the spectre of positive reporting, has actually finally motivated the Government to bring some legislation on privacy in the private sector before the Parliament. I was present at a conference in Sydney convened by the New South Wales Privacy Committee. Many groups which have subsequently strongly opposed this legislation said, `Yes, we believe in privacy legislation. No, we do not want positive reporting', and have done everything they can since to destroy this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> This legislation is vitally important and long overdue. It behoves us to make it as workable and effective a piece of legislation as we can in the interests of both consumers and industry. The need for privacy protection should not need to be recounted here, but I will mention a few, significant aspects of that particular need. Apart from a range of international human rights instruments which point to the importance of privacy as a human right, Australia has lagged well behind the United States, for example, that great bastion of free enterprise, in developing protections under the law for privacy. The situation has been compounded in recent years by rapid developments in information technology and the enormous potential for the compilation of centrally held, but easily accessible, personal and other information on people. In fact, `potential' is probably the wrong word because, indeed, the actuality of massive computer data is with us already. That fact became apparent in the Australia Card debate, as it has in the context of the Privacy Amendment Bill. It is interesting to note the position of the Opposition on two pieces of legislation-the Australia Card Bill and the Privacy Amendment Bill, which we are debating. As I said, this points to the fact that the Australian Democrats is the only party to remain consistent on this issue. In the particular area addressed by this Bill, credit reporting-it does address only one area of the private sector; however, one has to begin somewhere and, as I said, the spectre of positive reporting is an obvious motivation of the Government which, of course, we welcome-it has become quite clear that the existence of these millions of files was unknown to most of the people who were subject of them. They were not aware, except in the vaguest imaginable way, that a consumer credit reporting industry operates nationwide-I am not talking about people in the business and industry sector, but ordinary consumers-or that the use of information about their creditworthiness had a direct and significant impact on their financial affairs. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="O14">Senator POWELL</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thank you, Mr Acting Deputy President. I will just digress momentarily and make the point that this whole debate has actually been extremely useful in drawing people's attention to the existence of these files and the fact that the consumers actually have rights of access and correction in relation to them. As is certainly true, at least in the case of the Credit Reference Association of Australia (CRAA), people have always been able to get copies of their files, at a small price in some circumstances. But people can exercise their rights only if they know about them and if they know about the information in relation to which those rights exist. Apart from the rights of individual consumers, privacy legislation is most important in terms of educating the public, record keepers, and those using the files, about the importance of privacy protection. Under the Act passed in 1988 and moving through the legislation the role of the Privacy Commissioner is crucial in the whole process, because he is responsible for the development of the code of conduct in consultation with the industry.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Although we will deal in detail with this Bill in the committee stage, I want to mention a couple of aspects now. I am referring here to areas where sections of industry consider that denial or limitation of access to CRAA files will have serious effects on our economy, among other things. This point has been made in the debate. To illustrate my point I will use real estate agents who have hitherto had access to the files-or at least those who chose to be members of the Credit Reference Association had access. It is worth noting that, as the Bill stands, real estate agents will be excluded, and much has been said already about that. For the information of honourable senators only 655 of Australia's 9,000 real estate agents belong to CRAA-that figure includes those managing commercial properties-and real estate agents' inquiries constitute less than 3 per cent of annual usage. </PARA>
<PARA> Property owners and agents will continue to be able to seek information on a prospective tenant's employment details, income, previous tenancy history and require references and then check with the relevant independent third parties. This legislation does not affect those rights at all. They could, of course, seek more information from the prospective tenant, including his or her CRAA report. If they start collecting credit information for the purposes of providing that information to others, they would come within the ambit of this legislation as a credit reporting business and be bound by the obligations of this legislation accordingly. If we look at the matter logically and rationally, which I fear has not happened in this debate so far, we note that comprehensive tenancy legislation exists in all States. Landlords are well protected under it. This includes the payment of rent in advance, bonds, enforceable rights of entry and inspection, statutory rights of eviction, a lien against the property and the protection of courts and tribunals. </PARA>
<PARA> The experience of the New South Wales Privacy Committee is that credit checks by real estate agents are often a pretext for excluding certain tenants-those very tenants over whom many crocodile tears have been shed in this debate and in some of the representations during the progress of this legislation. In fact, tenants' unions are very strongly in favour of this legislation. I noted earlier that we were told that nobody was coming forward in favour of this legislation. Tenants' unions and other such advocates in the community are interested in protection for their clientele; protection which they know can be gained only through this sort of legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> The Tenants Union of Victoria, my home State, has surveyed 32 real estate agencies in the inner Melbourne area in order to find out what sort of information the agents require of prospective tenants. It found that, in relation to a tenant's identity, the agents asked a total of 246 questions over 22 categories of information-more than the Department of Social Security and the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade together require of applicants for benefits or passports. In comparison to the wealth of information which agents can obtain from a prospective tenant, a credit reference, with its few details, would appear to be of relatively little significance. </PARA>
<PARA> I also make reference to other means of control in this area and their adequacy or otherwise. First, there is State legislation. Three States-Queensland, South Australia and Victoria-have credit reporting legislation of an essentially similar nature to this. Apart from the fact that the legislation does not cover the whole nation, it was drafted in the 1970s and, therefore, is seriously deficient in particular with respect to the sophisticated information technology of the late 1980s and, of course, the coming decade, the 1990s. The CRAA operates under a self-regulatory code of conduct and it has been argued that this is an adequate basis for control. While it is admirable that the CRAA instituted the code, I certainly differ from those who assert that it is adequate. It deals only with disputed accuracy records and not other aspects which might give cause for concern; for example, splitting the files of married couples. The categories of the information are expressed in terms of those which must not be collected, rather than a definitive list of those which may be collected, thereby leaving lots of room for expansion. Sanctions and remedies are very limited indeed and it seems to the Democrats that a more formal, clear, nationally applied set of obligations and guidelines is warranted. </PARA>
<PARA> I note in passing that some opponents of this Bill seem to have a very strange idea of respect for privacy. I have here one of the many faxed letters forwarded to our office as part of the lobbying campaign against this Bill, and I will say more about that later. This letter gives an example in support of its claim and it attaches a CRAA file. The letter carefully notes:</PARA>
<PARA>The member's name has been deleted to respect his privacy. </PARA>
<PARA>For obvious reasons, I will not table this letter. However, the file still contains-this is clearly readable-the person's address, employer, previous address, name of brother-in-law, the name of a cross reference, car registration number and other identifying information. It is quite astounding that the person who wrote this letter to our office believes that adequate protection has been given to this person's privacy just by deleting the name and that, therefore, we do not need the legislation. This letter was sent to our office as a demonstration that we do not need this legislation. This is perhaps one of the strongest pieces of evidence that we have that this legislation is necessary, because after the passage of this Bill the sending of such a document will be entirely and utterly illegal in the interests of the privacy of the individual whose file I have in my hand and whose name it would be very easy for me to find out. </PARA>
<PARA> I wish now to make a few general points on the subject of lobbying, although given the lateness of the hour and the session I can scarcely give it the time that I would like to. I note that one Minister is looking at the question of junk faxes. We would have a pretty massive submission to give to that inquiry. It seems that the people from the private sector who are involved-I see a Government backbencher nodding vigorously in agreement-believe that the people in this Parliament, the back bench of the Government, and the Democrats in particular, make their decisions based on the weight of paper which comes into their offices. One can hardly get into Senator Jenkins's office these days, and the mail from the west has been incredible. That is not the way we make our decisions; we make them on the basis of the substance of the issue. </PARA>
<PARA> We have heard misleading claims that the Democrats have done a deal with the Government to gag this legislation. One of this morning's newspapers-and just hold your sides, folks, because really this is the most laughable thing that I have seen for a long time-states that debate on this Bill has been accelerated. If Senator Bolkus were in the chamber right now he would be crying at the thought of that. Mind you, I also have received letters which say that the debate on this Bill has been pushed forward. Pushed forward to 21 December? In the whole of this lobbying campaign it would be interesting to speculate what sorts of briefing papers these people have been given before they have sent their junk faxes to us. In that advertisement in the newspaper this morning, we see that question 5 asks:</PARA>
<PARA> What is wrong with the industry sponsored alternatives?</PARA>
<PARA>If honourable senators want to look at my diary-if there were time to make a personal explanation I would make one about Senator Stone's earlier interjection `Rubbish' when I said I had consulted widely with the industry-it will show them how widely I and the limited staff available to the Australian Democrats have consulted with individuals and groups on this legislation. Yet in all that time we have not seen one single industry sponsored alternative. So I suppose that the answer to question No. 5, `What is wrong with the industry sponsored alternatives?' is that they do not exist. Every time the industry put to us a series of problems and we went to the Minister, discussed them and went through them, the industry then tossed up yet another set of problems. To date, although we are moving an amendment to quarantine the old files as against new files, which was put to us as the problem which would put the industry out of business, we have not heard from the industry, `Thank you for moving that amendment. Thank you for meeting the ultimate problem'. I am quite sure that we will get some more junk faxes telling us what else is wrong with this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> What worries me more than anything is that bona fide groups in our community have had the wool pulled over their eyes by the lobbyists in this exercise. In particular, the credit cooperatives which are writing to us and faxing letters to us are desperate about this legislation, believing that they are not included. They are included. We have negotiated with the Minister over this period and we now have an expanded definition of credit providers and credit reporting agencies. As a result, those credit cooperatives are included in the legislation. They have wasted their money and their time-and presumably their members' money-in an enormous lobbying campaign which is a fraud. This lobby group has misled people and, obviously, members of Opposition have swallowed it hook, line and sinker. </PARA>
<PARA> Sadly, all of this has occurred despite what in many respects has really been a constructive consultative process. As I said, I have spent a lot of time on this matter. I have also spent a lot of time with the Minister discussing this. The Bill before us tonight shows how much the original Bill which was put down for discussion and amendment has been changed. A much improved Bill is before us tonight, reflected in these Government amendments, many of which are amendments which we pressed for following submissions and representations from the industry. As I said, one outstanding matter that concerned us-it was pressed upon us by the people met with-was the inability of the CRAA to comply with the legislation with respect to its existing files. I will move an amendment to allow those files to be quarantined. </PARA>
<PARA> I conclude by reiterating the Democrats' commitment to privacy protection and the need to balance that with commercial reality. In supporting this Bill in its form, I remind the chamber that this country's foremost privacy body, the New South Wales Privacy Committee, supports the Bill. Privacy, particularly in the private sector, has remained unprotected for too long. We welcome this long overdue legislation. We regret the delay which has meant that it is the second last Bill on the list for consideration this year. We regret the Opposition's obvious filibuster. On the basis of both of those factors we question the commitment to privacy, particularly of the Opposition, and wish that the Government's commitment to privacy had been sufficiently strong enough for us to have taken these sorts of measures when we passed the original Bill in 1988. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I express my strong support for the second reading amendment that the Opposition has moved. It states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>. . . the Senate declines to give this Bill a second reading as the Senate is of the opinion that the Bill:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) imposes excessive and unjustified prohibitions and restrictions on the collection and use of personal financial information;</PARA>
<PARA> (b) fails to provide that credit reference agencies should be able to give commercial organisations reasonable access to financial information they have collected provided the information is reasonably required by the commercial organisation to assist it in making commercial decisions;</PARA>

<PARA> (e) will have many unintended consequences to the detriment of consumers, credit providers, credit reference agencies and the community as a whole; and</PARA>
<PARA> (f) has been introduced without adequate consultation. </PARA>
<PARA>The fact that the Bill has been introduced without adequate consultation is self-evident from the volume of amendments proposed by the Government, let alone by the Opposition. If this Bill had been even half thought out it would have been in a coherent form, even if offensive. It would have been in a coherent form before it came into this chamber. As for Senator Powell's suggestion that it has not been rushed ahead, for heaven's sake, if it had not been rushed ahead, why was it brought in needing massive amendment? Why was it not drafted properly the first time? That is the simple, uncomplicated answer. The Bill has been brought into this chamber in a state of total disarray by an incompetent government being pushed into a stupid Bill by a Minister who is obsessive about this subject. Quite frankly, it is fascinating to see the intellectual gymnastics going on from the other side, and of course from the Australian Democrats, about questions of principle. Let us recognise that it was the Opposition which, in a very clear and determined way, established a real concern for privacy in this place at the time of the tax file number debate. It was the Opposition that insisted on and corrected the Government's incompetent legislation in that area. There is no doubt that in the Opposition ranks there is clear concern about the need for privacy and for appropriate legislation to protect people. We have to come to a coherent, intelligent balance between the two pressures that are evident here-a pressure for a need for privacy and a real need to protect Australians from the fraud of dishonest people who are adding multi-billions of dollars to the bills having to be paid by ordinary, decent Australians. </PARA>
<PARA> It intrigues me that at the time of the tax file number debate, the Australian Labor Party said exactly that about the need for a tax file number and the Australia Card. Now, magically, it says, `No, we can't be concerned'. Maybe it cannot be concerned about it because it is the private sector which is losing a lot of money. After all, apparently this Government does not care much about the private sector and what happens in the private sector. What we were saying, and we say it now, is that we must seek a proper balance between these conflicting pressures-that is, the pressure for proper privacy and the pressure for proper protection of honest people trying to do honest business in Australia. On almost all grounds this Bill fails dismally to come anywhere near meeting any kind of coherent balance. </PARA>
<PARA> There are a whole range of matters I want to raise. I want to deal firstly with a couple of the points in the letter from the Australian Finance Conference which Senator Powell did not deal with. She wanted to know what was wrong with the industry sponsored alternatives and so on, but she did not answer this question: Why have several Labor and coalition State governments, plus over 50 national and State industry and professional bodies, as well as the government departments responsible, urged that this Bill be withdrawn? It would be nice to have an answer to that. </PARA>

Why does Senator Bolkus continue to disparage the only economic impact study of the Bill, when even after his many changes independent consultants have confirmed that a conservative estimate of its cost to the community is in order of between $1,250m and $2,400m a year? Other questions include: why was the original Bill rushed into the Senate in the last days of the autumn session and why is debate on the latest version, with 40-plus amendments already, being pushed through in the last days of the Budget session?

<PARA> The Insurance Council of Australia represents the interests of 92 private sector general insurance companies which together account for approximately $5 billion in premium income. Of this amount $4 billion is paid out in claims, and expenses total approximately $1.5 billion. Significantly, it is estimated that claims which are the result of fraudulent activity amount to around $1.5 billion each year. The industry's responsibility, therefore, on behalf of the honest majority of policyholders, is to do as much as is possible to combat this problem. As I said, the conflict between what is required in terms of protecting privacy and the massive and real cost to the people of Australia of having this kind of legislation has to be resolved. </PARA>

<PARA>OVERSEAS STUDENTS CHARGE COLLECTION AMENDMENT BILL 1989</PARA>
<PARA> The purpose of this Bill is to amend the Overseas Students Charge Collection Act 1979 to enable payment of the Overseas Students Charge to be made in two equal instalments each year from the beginning of the 1990 academic year. The charge is payable by overseas students enrolled in Australian education institutions under the subsidised program to which the Act relates. </PARA>
<PARA> The Overseas Students Charge was expected to raise $51.449m in 1989-90 based on the full payment being made by 1 May 1990. With the second of the two instalments due for payment after 30 June 1990, revenue in 1989-90 is expected to be reduced by up to half. </PARA>
<PARA> In addition, administrative costs associated with the collection of the charge may increase by up to $30,000. </PARA>
<PARA> I present the explanatory memorandum to this Bill and commend the Bill to the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA>OVERSEAS STUDENTS (INSTALMENT PAYMENTS) CHARGE BILL 1989</PARA>
<PARA> The purpose of this Bill is to provide for an instalment payment fee which will be incurred where the Overseas Students Charge is paid by two instalments each year from the beginning of the 1990 academic year, as provided for in the Overseas Students Charge Collection Amendment Bill 1989 which is being considered cognately with this Bill. The Charge is payable by overseas students enrolled in Australian education institutions under the subsidised program to which the Bill relates. </PARA>
<PARA>The amount of the instalment payment which will be payable at the time of the second instalment of the Charge will be calculated pro rata on the basis of the three year indicator Commonwealth Bond rate for the period between the two instalment payments. The instalment payment will cover the public debt interest revenue forgone as a result of the introduction of arrangements for the Charge to be paid by instalments. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We have before us, taken together for their remaining stages, the Overseas Students Charge Collection Amendment Bill and two related Bills. On 13 December-as appears on page 4415 of the Senate Hansard-at the committee stage we reported progress on a Bill which had passed the second reading stage, that is, the Overseas Students Charge Amendment Bill. This Bill seeks to raise the overseas student charge by about 10 per cent for each category. We determined that we would come back to the committee stage of that Bill only when we had before us legislation that would fulfil the promise made by the Minister for Employment, Education and Training, Mr Dawkins, in December 1988, when the education package was being debated in the Senate, that from 1 January 1990 there would be legislative provision for the overseas student charge to be paid in two instalments.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We now have before us, transmitted from the House of Representatives a few minutes ago, the two Bills which will enable the overseas student charge to be paid in two instalments. The first Bill, the Overseas Students Charge Collection Amendment Bill, essentially provides the framework for the two equal instalments to commence from the beginning of next month. The actual payment dates are to be specified in a determination made by the Minister. The Bill provides that in the event that the first instalment is not paid on the due date, the right to pay by instalments would be forfeited. The Bill also makes provision for exemptions and for the granting of visas and temporary entry permits to overseas students at appropriate times. There has been this need to change the singular to the plural in the existing Act to follow through repercussions with regard to visas and temporary entry permits because there will be two payments rather than just the one, as has been the case for the last seven or eight years in which we have had an overseas student charge.</PARA>
<PARA> The second Bill, the Overseas Students (Instalment Payments) Charge Bill, imposes a charge which amounts to interest accrued on the half of the annual fee for the period for which the second instalment is now deferred. The formula set out in the second Bill relates to the days that have elapsed between the two instalment payments, and the interest applied is the three-year average Commonwealth bond rate as of February of the year of the charge. This is a reasonable provision, as is the provision that the ability to pay by two instalments is available only if the first instalment is paid on time. </PARA>
<PARA> These Bills bring the overseas student charge into line with the contribution provisions in other legislation for all other students. Full fee students already have the ability to pay the charge for their studies in at least two instalments a year. In the case of the higher education contribution scheme (HECS)-the graduate tax-students have the ability to make, as a minimum, the two instalments a year, one each six-monthly semester. With the election in a few months time of a coalition government and the abolition of HECS, the tuition fee that we will introduce at two-thirds the rate of HECS will be able to be paid direct to the institutions on a semester basis-that is, in two instalments. Therefore, this legislation brings the overseas student charge into a two-instalment approach, parallel with that which applies, or will apply, for all other students. </PARA>
<PARA> I have only one other comment to make, and that is that the passing of this legislation enabling a second instalment to be made lawfully in the latter part of the 1990 calendar year means that some $51m of moneys that are in the present Budget, calculated to be received by Commonwealth revenue, will be deferred until the next financial year and, to that extent, will lower the surplus in this financial year by $51m. That is the estimate set out in the documents provided by the Government in association with the Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> In conclusion, I refer to my speech at the second reading stage of the education package on 12 December where in Hansard, at pages 4364 and 4365, I set out the letters from the Minister for Employment, Education and Training, Mr Dawkins, to me on 7 December and 12 December. The letters are self-explanatory and are a foundation for the legislation before us. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition supports the two new Bills, and the Senate should acknowledge that had the Australian Democrats not supported the Opposition in making an issue of this matter 12 months ago, and had the Democrats not indicated their support for the Opposition's proposal that there be in place a two-instalment approach, to be fair and to be equitable to overseas students facing this charge, assuredly we would not have had the response that is set out in the Minister's letters of 7 and 12 December to me and which I have incorporated in Hansard on the pages that I have indicated. It is, therefore, at the Opposition's request that the Government has made this legislation available and that we have it before us now, having been passed by the House of Representatives. The Opposition supports the Bills. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We have before us the Overseas Students Charge Collection Amendment Bill which was promised by the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Dawkins) the last time we debated-I think it was on 12 and 13 December-the education package of six or seven Bills. This issue, as Senator Teague has said, goes back quite some time. In fact, the original proposition was an amendment moved by me to enable students to pay their fees by four instalments in a year-indeed, not in the manner set out here but in a simplified way. The Government, however, has chosen a more complicated method. That is the Government's right if it wishes to do that, but I think there are far simpler ways.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There are some good reasons as to why we would seek to amend the Bill, not least of which, of course, is that it would assist students who are paying a fairly significant fee and their families to be able to spread the cost over a whole year rather than pay it at one point in the year; but, in addition, the massive embarrassment to Australia that has been occasioned by deporting overseas students, hopefully, would be lessened by this exercise. If it is not possible for a student to meet the first of the payments, obviously it will not be possible to meet the second, and hence there is a much larger timeframe in which students can be convinced that the best that they can do is quit the course and return home. Deportation is an exercise that overseas students, and certainly the Australian education industry, does not want to see occurring again. </PARA>
<PARA> Quite significant problems still exist for overseas students over the payment of fees. In other circumstances, I would move amendments yet again with regard to these items. Since the Opposition has not supported the amendments in the past, I presume it will not support them now. However, I think that they ought to be mentioned again. The Australian-American Education Foundation operates, at least by the terms of its charter, as a result of a 50 : 50 cooperative arrangement between Australia and the United States. The Bicentennial has raised Australia's profile in the eyes of the world, and certainly within the United States, and there is massive competition for the types of scholarships and the like that are available to overseas students. </PARA>
<PARA> While the Australian-American Education Foundation has raised in excess of an additional $120,000 from private funds and has done its work well, as a government and as a community we have not kept our part of the bargain by funding that exercise on a 50-50 basis. That is to be deplored. If we are to continue with this exercise, the least we can do is keep our part of the bargain and put in 50 per cent of the cost, as we are pledged to do, considering that the studying is done in Australia and that through the whole period the United States has contributed more than its share. </PARA>
<PARA> During 1989, 24 postgraduate scholarships were awarded to developing countries through schemes administered by the Department of Employment, Education and Training. The annual living allowance, which is non-taxable, is just over $10,000. Eight scholarships, which provide for a minimum study period of two years, were awarded under the Commonwealth scholarship and fellowship plan administered by the Australian International Development Assistance Bureau. Sixteen scholarships were awarded for the Australian-European awards program, which provides for a one-year postgraduate study course in Australia. The difficulty is that all those scholarships have again been affected by the way we are administering the operations in Australia. We are in fact depriving many of these students from coming to Australia to pursue those courses of study. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the things that people do not seem to realise is that in our educational institutions it is principally overseas postgraduate students who comprise the bulk of our tutors and demonstrators for our undergraduate courses. After all, where else are we going to find people who will work odd hours and for a mere pittance at such a high level? The only place where we can get those people is from the ranks of the postgraduate students. </PARA>
<PARA> Our engineering and science courses are in a great deal of trouble as a result of our mean-fisted approach to the postgraduate study programs offered overseas. I have raised this in the past. No action has been taken. I believe that it is an indictment on this Government that it has not seen fit to honour the obligations under the Australian-American Education Foundation agreement, or to exempt those students who are undertaking or have a postgraduate scholarship awarded either by an Australian institution or by a Commonwealth authority. It is ludicrous when one considers this exercise. Students believe that they are getting a stipend at a particular level and it is being taken away from them. I hope that these items will be addressed before we discuss these Bills again next year. </PARA>

I foreshadow that I shall be raising no objection to the amendments but I think the Minister does owe the chamber the courtesy of telling it, either directly or through incorporation, the nature of the changes that have been made in the House of Representatives and why they have been made.</PARA></TALK.START>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="TJ4">Senator WALSH</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have explanatory notes which have been supplied by the Australian Taxation Office. In summary, they state that the intentions of the Senate amendments have been incorporated in the substitute amendments passed by the House of Representatives but that they are technically more sound and, in particular, more precise. The notes are not formal explanatory memoranda but explanations supplied by the Australian Taxation Office regarding the Sales Tax Laws (Computer Programs) Amendment Bill and the Sales Tax (Exemptions and Classifications) Amendments Bill (No. 2) 1989. I seek leave to incorporate the two documents.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The documents read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA>SALES TAX LAWS (COMPUTER PROGRAMS) AMENDMENT BILL 1989</PARA>
<PARA>The Sales Tax Laws (Computer Programs) Amendment Bill, as introduced, would have resulted in sales tax continuing to apply to games and educational programs on microchips which are placed inside cartridges that are for use with basic personal computers, or with games consoles such as the Atari Video Computer System and the Nintendo Home Entertainment System. In some cases, however, the same program is also available on floppy disc, and the amendment of the Bill made by the Senate removes this distortion. </PARA>
<PARA>Since the passing of the Senate amendment, the Government has received suggestions for improving the amendment and has had time to give it more detailed consideration. The substituted amendment brought forward in the House of Representatives is the result of that. </PARA>
<PARA>The new amendment differs from that made by the Senate in a number of significant ways. Firstly, the nature of the programs that qualify for sales tax exemption has been extended to included those marketed as being exclusively for both educational and entertainment use. Secondly, a similar change has been made to the cartridges affected, extending the range of cartridges to those marketed as being exclusively for use with either a personal computer or an acceptable home electronic device. </PARA>
<PARA>The third significant change made is to replace the term ``visual display unit'' with the description ``a computer monitor or a television screen''. This will remove any uncertainty as to what is a visual display unit. It is possible that a television screen falls outside the current conception of a visual display unit, although the Government intended that such a screen be included. On the other hand, the term ``visual display unit'' in the Bill could have resulted in any LCO or LED display no matter how small or how limited its display capabilities being classed as a ``visual display unit''-contrary to the Government's intention. </PARA>
<PARA>The inclusion test in the Senate amendment could have opened up the exemption sought to be granted to a wider range of devices than the Government intended. A further change will, therefore, ensure that home electronic devices that include a computer monitor or television screen are excluded from the range of acceptable devices. However, personal computers that include a screen will remain acceptable. </PARA>
<PARA>Finally, the substituted amendment, in specifying what are unacceptable home electronic devices, includes articles that are a combination of a number of devices and that include one or more of the devices specified. This will reduce the frequency with which regulations might otherwise need to be made to extend the list of specified devices. </PARA>
<PARA>SALES TAX (EXEMPTIONS AND CLASSIFICATIONS) AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 2) 1989</PARA>
<PARA>Honourable senators will recall that the object of the first and third amendments of this Bill that were made by the Senate was, first, to make clear that the proposed exemption for certain paper products applies to goods only if all the paper in the goods is wholly recycled paper and, second, to define what is meant by the term ``recycled'' in relation to recycled paper and cardboard. The second amendment made by the Senate was intended to extend the proposed exemption so that the use of recycled fibre, and not just recycled paper, would qualify. </PARA>
<PARA>The House of Representatives, in not accepting the second and third amendments made by the Senate, did not disagree with the principles behind those amendments. The amendment the House made to replace those two amendments re-expresses the Senate amendments and, in so doing, and consistent with the definition of ``recycled'' in relation to recycled paper and cardboard accepted by the Senate, extends that definition to fibre. </PARA>
<PARA>This new definition specifies that, for the purposes for the proposed exemption, the recycled test will be satisfied only where all the fibre in the cardboard or paper has previously been used, as fibre, in the manufacture of other goods-for example, cotton lint from shirting material and hemp fibre from rope. </PARA>

<PARA> I repeat that the Minister did me the courtesy earlier in the evening-I think very shortly after he himself was advised that these Bills would be dealt with tonight-of showing me the advice that he had received from the Australian Taxation Office. I have considered that advice and I am satisfied that the amendments that have been made in the House of Representatives to the amendments that were made here originally achieve the objectives which were sought here originally, and do so in a manner which is technically better and which do not open up, in one case at least, opportunities for an extension, an unintended consequence. I do not propose to detain the Committee further. The Opposition will agree to the motion originally moved by the Minister. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As I was saying, people who are being affected by this include many in lower socioeconomic parts of our society who the Bill purports to protect but who are, in fact, inevitably suffering because of the severe restriction on bodies such as credit unions in working class areas such as mine, the Illawarra region. By restricting their ability to assess members' capacity to service a loan debt this will affect those people who are in the heartland, as I said, of the Australian Labor Party. It makes one wonder who is protecting whom from what in this legislation. That is the essence of this matter. It does seem that there is a greater determination to protect the guilty than there is to protect the community, the innocent. It is a curious trend. It seems to me that we have not yet seen any empirical evidence on the need for this legislation. We have certainly seen none about its effects or its costs-nothing that is coherent, anyway.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There is no doubt that the Bill facilitates fraud. The costs of fraud in insurance, finance and government is borne by the community, not by companies. That cost, of course, has risen enormously in recent times. The community's perception is that fraud is a major problem and that something should be done about it. The Commonwealth's anti-business pro-fraud stance reflected in this and other legislation, such as the Insurance Contracts Act, contrasts starkly with its own tough anti-fraud stance and its own business. That is the intriguing thing. There is a clear, uncomplicated double standard involved on the part of this Government. We have seen how the Commonwealth heavily penalises fraud in government business. The Proceeds of Crime Act, which was enacted at about the same time as the Insurance Contracts Act, displays a much more muscular attitude to fraud, providing that a person who engages in organised fraud, if a natural person, is liable to a fine not exceeding $250,000, or imprisonment for a period not exceeding 25 years, or both. </PARA>
<PARA> There is no doubt that this Government-and I am not quite certain what its motives are-appears to be much more highly excited about the prospect of protecting itself from fraud than allowing the private sector to protect itself. That is the essential point. It is limiting the capacity of the private sector to protect its customers, the ordinary people of Australia, from the impact of fraud. That is what this legislation is all about. I must say that I am astounded at the sort of bunkum that the Minister for Consumer Affairs, Senator Bolkus, writes to people in significant positions about this sort of legislation. I have a copy of a letter he wrote on 18 December to NRMA Insurance Ltd in which he says:</PARA>
<PARA> However, the Government is not prepared to treat general insurers as credit providers in order to enable them to access credit data. The principle that information should be used in a manner appropriate to the purpose for which it was provided has been central to the Government's deliberations in connection with this Bill. </PARA>
<PARA>It is not a central principle to assist the people of Australia by limiting the capacity for fraud. The Government is not concerned about that. Its concern is an esoteric and very expensive principle. As I have said, it has not balanced these two principles of the need for privacy and the need to protect the innocent in this community from the activities of the fraudulent. Senator Bolkus went on:</PARA>
<PARA> Information I have received from the Insurance Council of Australia does not indicate that overcommitment is a major cause of insurance fraud. </PARA>
<PARA>That is one of the most curious statements that even this Minister could come out with. I would be very grateful if the Minister would release that information to the Senate because I note the very careful wording of that statement. Does the honourable senator mean that he has received information from the Insurance Council of Australia which indicates that overcommitment is not a major cause of insurance fraud? He does not say that. He just does not indicate that it is. I wonder why he used the negative. No doubt because the positive is not so. The fact is that it is part of the accepted wisdom of the insurance industry that financial difficulties of the insured are often found to be the motivation for insurance fraud. That accords with experience of almost every major operator in this industry. It seems to me that the letter from Senator Bolkus to Mr Willing is deliberately misleading. Unless the honourable senator produces the information and advice that he has received from the Insurance Council, then the honourable senator is exposed as playing with words, deliberately seeking to mislead. He then goes on:</PARA>
<PARA> ICA figures-</PARA>
<PARA>that is, the Insurance Council of Australia figures-</PARA>
<PARA>further indicate that only 39 insurance companies out of some 170 licensed insurers in Australia are members of CRAA. </PARA>
<PARA>That is a disgraceful statement because it deliberately seeks to mislead this chamber. It certainly seeks to mislead the person to whom it was addressed and who, frankly, refuses to be misled. I could be generous and say that perhaps the Minister simply does not know that these 39 insurance companies include the largest insurers operating in the personal loans market in Australia, where most fraud activity occurs. It would be much more honourable if the Minister were to concede that the 39 operate at the coalface where the problem exists. That kind of nonsensical statement, the implication that it is inconsequential because the figure is only 39 out of 170, is just the sort of cant that we have been hearing throughout this debate from the Government. </PARA>
<PARA> As I mentioned earlier, this Government has taken a strong, very muscular view about fraud attacking itself, but the insurance industry is now being blocked in its endeavours to protect not only itself, but also its customers from fraud. In its 1988 brochure analysing fraud, the Munich Reinsurance Group expressed a commonly held view. It has this to say about the development of fraud to epidemic proportions in insurance:</PARA>
<PARA>The frequent and favourable argument put forward mainly in non-insurance circles, namely that this development-</PARA>
<PARA>that is, the development of fraud-</PARA>
<PARA>ought not to worry insurers who have only to raise their premiums accordingly, can now no longer stand unchallenged. Indeed, the concept of risk management, correctly understood, requires that insurers take countermeasures in their own interests. Honest policyholders have a right to demand that their insurers reject unjustified claims for compensation and combat fraud in connection with insurance business. </PARA>
<PARA>There is no doubt then that it is necessary, both from the point of view of the insurance industry and in the interests of the individual policyholder, that effective countermeasures be introduced as soon as possible. That is very sound, very sensible and universally accepted as true, but this legislation now before the Parliament moves in exactly the opposite direction. This Bill proposes that insurers be debarred from access to information concerning individuals' financial dealings. It makes substantial changes to the nature of personal information which may be retained, and by whom. Credit reporting agencies will not be permitted to retain records of insurance fraud or default in payment of claims or premiums. After representations, some amendments to the Bill have been made allowing for some information to be entered in a separate central claims register, probably at mind-boggling cost. Most of the problems which the Bill gratuitously creates have not been addressed. It is a matter of conjecture as to whether some of these credit reporting agencies will be able to function effectively under this legislation. I am referring to large insurance companies. </PARA>
<PARA> As I mentioned earlier, the Illawarra Credit Union Ltd has written to me. The people who have signed this advertisement, to which Senator Powell referred so disparagingly, are not simply the big retail trading groups, major employers, insurance organisations or the Confederation of Australian Industry. The Australian Association of Cooperatives Ltd is not a big business bandit, which the Government seems to charge as being everyone who has a profit motive. There is also the Australian Association of Permanent Building Societies. Are these organisations all big multinationals? Not on your life. The Australian Federation of Credit Unions is the poor man's bank. These are the people being hit by this legislation, the very people that this Government has pretended to represent for so long. There is the small business people's movement-small business. Do honourable senators know how to become a small business under Labor-start off as a big business and it will soon become a small business. </PARA>
<PARA> This widespread group of people have all expressed major concerns about this legislation. My concerns at this stage are mainly to do with the effect on the insurance industry. The Commonwealth Government has created further problems for the insurance industry in combating fraud, despite undisputed evidence, much of it from the Commonwealth itself, that the community is paying a heavy price for fraud, and the community expects the Government to do something about it. Fraud is a major problem in all areas of business in which benefits are paid to people on production of proof that an event entitling payment has occurred. There is the same problem in social security as there is in third party insurance; yet the Government is cracking down heavily on social security but will not let the private sector protect itself. If a person can satisfy certain criteria, usually solely by the production of an appropriate document, payment is made. As I said, in its own affairs, the Commonwealth Government zealously provides itself with increasingly powerful solutions to confront fraud. On the other hand in private business the Commonwealth places little value on the eradication of fraud. In legislation such as the Insurance Contracts Act and the Privacy Amendment Bill, the Commonwealth goes way beyond what is required to protect legitimate interests and in the final analysis protects the fraudulent at the cost of the honest consumer. </PARA>
<PARA> It is intriguing that this Bill covers what was dealt with over a period of seven years or so by the Australian Law Reform Commission. Senator Bolkus, in his second reading speech, relied on the findings of a public opinion poll conducted by the Commission some time before 1983 as evidence of current public concern about the credit reference bureau and privacy. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="LE4">Senator MICHAEL BAUME</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This lack of Government understanding of the genuine concern in the community about the impact and the cost of fraud, is in disgraceful contrast to the protection of its own activities, its own areas of potential fraud, such as social security. In particular I want to deal with the consequences of fraud in terms of the cost to the individual.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I have a lawyer friend who was involved in a lot of motor vehicle cases in which the plaintiff sued for damages for personal injuries allegedly sustained in collisions. The insurer, which was the defendant, contended that no accidents had, in fact, occurred. The defendant succeeded in its claim. I do not want to go into the nature of the cases, except to say that it was clearly self-evident that as most of the people seemed to be members of the same family, from the same racial group and the same country town in their country of origin, it was established to be quite clearly a fraud. This occurred in the Australian Capital Territory. As a result of this successful legal activity, the volume of fraudulent claims in the Australian Capital Territory has diminished massively. My lawyer friend has presented me with a table showing that back in 1984 compulsory third party insurance in the Australian Capital Territory cost $206 as against $150 in New South Wales. It mounted then in the Australian Capital Territory to $243 in 1986, still well ahead of New South Wales with $213. Since then in 1989 it has fallen from $243 to $155 in the Australian Capital Territory. In New South Wales it has gone up to $350, more than double the rate of 1984, while the Australian Capital Territory is $50 less than it was in 1984. </PARA>
<PARA> I am just dramatising what the impact of uncontrolled fraud basically has on an insurance premium of that order. This is so self-evident that it is depressing to see that this Government is making it harder and harder for insurance companies to protect themselves from the very clear evidence of widespread fraudulent activity which will proceed apace under this legislation without providing an effective counter to the insurance companies involved. For example, at common law an insurer was not obliged to meet fraudulent claims and the making of such a claim entitled the insurer to avoid the contract. That remains the position in other branches of contract law. Fraud in contract amounts at law to repudiation enabling the other party to treat the contract as being at an end, or at his election to continue to keep the contract on foot and sue for damages. </PARA>
<PARA> That principle, which extends to every other contract, has been overturned in this legislation in relation to these activities. This legislation further permits the courts to forgive the fraudulent claimant and allow him to recover against the insurer. What is the motive in this? Have we seen a justification for the overturning of this principle? The answer is, `No, we have not'. There has been no coherent argument to establish the need to turn such a principle on its head and the Government wonders why the Opposition is unhappy about this legislation. The Government wonders why almost every organisation that will have any contact with this legislation is enraged, disturbed and prompted to advertise in the paper to try to generate public concern about the way in which this Government, in its doctrinaire way, is proceeding with this matter. I find it fascinating that the Privacy Commissioner, in his annual report which was delivered to this place today, deals with this legislation by saying:</PARA>
<PARA> This development is significant for privacy protection in Australia in that it involves the first possible extension of the Privacy Act to cover a major private sector industry. </PARA>
<PARA>In other words, the Commissioner is saying that this is a very significant step. If it is such a significant step, why was the industry not properly consulted? Why have we got 40 last-minute amendments from the Government? Why is the whole industry objecting? It is objecting because this Government has botched it once again. It has not, in fact, established clearly any coherent case to overturn the traditions of the law. It has not established any coherent case for protecting the guilty at the expense of the innocent. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Tonight we are debating the Privacy Amendment Bill. This Hawke Labor Government, having tried only three years ago to inflict on us the Australian Card with its national database, is now trying to restore its civil liberties credentials with the Privacy Amendment Bill. That is a Bill that worries me greatly because of all the down sides that will affect not only business but also private individuals in Australia. This legislation can be described neither as a reform that will enhance privacy, nor even as a bit of meaningless pre-election window dressing; rather, it is a savage, ignorant attack on legitimate business practice, having an impact upon both business and the consumer. The only conclusion we can draw is that the Hawke Labor Government believes on the one hand that it is fine for governments and bureaucrats to amass data on Australians. Who can forget the outburst of the Minister for Community Services and Health (Dr Blewett) when he declared that privacy was not really important because it was a bourgeois right concerned with private property? On the other hand, the Government dismissed the right of business to protect its property and assets by checking and monitoring the creditworthiness of those Australians who choose to apply for credit, goods, insurance and accommodation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Once again this Labor Government demonstrated its lack of appreciation of business reality and its arrogance by holding minimal consultations with business prior to the introduction of the Bill in June. It is worth remembering that this Bill was introduced in the dying hours of the autumn session in June and here it is being debated on 21 December in the dying hours of the Budget session. It is a great tragedy that this Bill will not receive the due consideration that it is worthy of and it will be zoomed through the Senate because now, with undiminished arrogance, the Minister for Consumer Affairs (Senator Bolkus) tells the business community that his belated damage control of 41 amendments is as good as it is going to get. I think that is very sad because the business community and the people of Australia deserve better. An awful lot of patch-up work has been done that will not serve the community well. </PARA>
