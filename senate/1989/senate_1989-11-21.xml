<TITLE>X-rated and Violent Video Material</TITLE>
<PARA>To the Honourable the President and members of the Senate assembled in Parliament: The petition of citizens of Australia points out:</PARA>
<PARA> That all State Governments, States Attorneys-General, most women's groups and the majority of men in Australia, including significant numbers of Members of Parliament, are totally opposed to the importation and distribution of `X' and excessively violent `R'-rated video pornography in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA> That most `X'-rated material available in Australia is imported.</PARA>
<PARA> That the Federal Government, by its Customs power under the Constitution, and not the A.C.T. Government, is solely responsible for controlling the importation of this pornographic material.</PARA>
<PARA> That by continuing to allow the importation of such pornographic material, the Federal Government is neglecting its responsibility to the women, children and families of Australia.</PARA>
<PARA> Your petitioners, therefore, request the Senate to:</PARA>
<PARA> 1. Ban `X'-rated pornographic material at the point of entry into Australia.</PARA>
<PARA> 2. Exclude from the `R'-rating all gratuitously violent material.</PARA>
<PARA> And your petitioners as in duty bound will ever pray.</PARA>

<PARA>Dear Sir,</PARA>
<PARA>With regard to the above, introduced into Federal Parliament by Senator Janet Powell, we, the under-signed, wish to make known our strong support.</PARA>
<PARA> The colossal cost to this nation in man-hours of work lost, and enormous hospital expenses due to illness directly due to this bad habit, especially these days when our economy is struggling, makes this issue of maximum importance. For the Government and medical profession to discourage this scourge to humanity on one hand then allow freedom of advertising of this abnoxious weed is an absurd paradox. Especially damaging are the glamorous advertisments that are slanted to appeal to the young who will perpetuate this evil habit if no consistent attempt is made to deter them.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="EF4">Senator CHANEY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I direct my question to the Minister representing the Minister for Industrial Relations. I refer to the indictment of the Government's accord with the Australian Council of Trade Unions (ACTU) which is contained in the current monthly bulletin of the Business Council of Australia (BCA), and in particular to these comments in the conclusion of that article:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The increasingly obvious failure of the Accord, however, is that Australia has failed to pull down growth in nominal wages and our productivity growth has been stifled.</PARA>
<PARA>Has the Minister noted the BCA conclusion that the price of the Government's special relationship with the trade union movement is that it has allowed the ACTU to `determine the nature and pace of labour market reform'? Has the Government any intention of heeding the Business Council's advice to wrest the initiative from the unions in this vital area of macro-economic reform; and if so, what is proposed?</PARA>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="2865" SPEAKER="Button Sen The Hon J.N." NAMEID="4F4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="VIC" MINISTERIAL="INDUSTRY, TECHNOLOGY AND COMMERCE" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4F4">Senator BUTTON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I did see in a newspaper a headline to the article in question which clearly reflected the view of the BCA and Senator Chaney has elaborated on what that view is. Government and people concerned about economic issues in Australia at the present time are bombarded with advice from all sources.</PARA></TALK.START>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4F4">Senator BUTTON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In that process of bombardment of advice, the Opposition's Foster's package got a fair backhander from most of the economic commentators. Senator Stone knows that full well. If Senator Stone can find a serious economic commentator to support the Opposition's package as a solution to any of these things, he should bring him forward, because Senator Stone has caught himself up in this debate, and I thought that his interjection from that point of view was slightly misplaced. In relation to the BCA comment, in terms of the general advice which the Government has been given on this issue, the Macquarie Bank, for example, in its statement, goes out of the way to make a point about the importance of the accord to Australian industry and to the economy generally in the last few years. It has apparently a different view from the BCA on this particular issue.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator Chaney singled out the question of nominal wage rates. The Government has never suggested that nominal unit labour costs are irrelevant to economic policy or that they are not important to a country's competitiveness. But nominal unit labour costs are not the only factor determining competitiveness. Competitiveness measures based on nominal unit labour costs are misleading. Other factors, including the exchange rate, flexible labour and management practices, investment in new capital equipment and so on, and quality and reliability issues, are also important.</PARA>
<PARA> One sees this reflected, if I might say so, in an address by the Leader of the Opposition to the New South Wales Chamber of Commerce and Industry Conference in Sydney on 13 November of this year. Mr Peacock enlightened that august body with this view:</PARA>
<PARA>Using figures on manufacturing unit labour costs from the OECD . . . the competitiveness of Australian manufacturing will have declined by 49 percent between 1982 and 1990.</PARA>
<PARA>That may be true, using that measure alone, but of course there are numerous other measures, and if Mr Peacock has been wandering around this country, where we have had the highest level of productive activity in manufacturing for years, where we have had the highest growth in investment for years, and in particular where we have had a much improved export performance by the manufacturing--</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4F4">Senator BUTTON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;No. Senator Chaney raised this issue, and if he does not like the answer I suggest that he get out of the kitchen. Senator Chaney raised this question of nominal wage rates, and he is going to have to cop the answer whether he likes it or not. Mr Peacock says this to the New South Wales Chamber of Commerce and Industry. It does leave a slightly glib taste in the mouth, as does everything Mr Peacock says. He has not had his eyes open if he can make a statement like that, except perhaps when he is looking in a mirror, which is probably the only time he has his eyes fully open. The Leader of the Opposition is going around the country talking this sort of stuff which he knows to be rubbish, because the preferred measure in relation to competitiveness of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development in fact indicates a 12 per cent improvement in the competitiveness of Australian manufacturing over the period from 1982 to 1990.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is addressed to the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade. Since the Senate last met, many people have been killed in El Salvador. Six Jesuits, their cook and her daughter have been murdered in San Salvador. These events arise out of a long running conflict in El Salvador. Does the Government see the move towards harmony elsewhere in the world reaching that country? Is there anything the Government can do to help bring a just peace to El Salvador?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator GARETH EVANS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The situation in El Salvador as it has developed in recent days is a distressing one. On 11 November the insurgent forces of the FMLN-the Farabundi Marti National Liberation Front-launched a major offensive in El Salvador breaking a cease-fire in what has been a 10-year civil war in which war some 70,000 people, mostly civilians, have been killed. The FMLN cancelled negotiations with the Government of El Salvador, claiming that the rightist administration had not been serious about peace negotiations and that the Government was behind recent bombings in San Salvador in which 10 people, including a union leader, were killed. Estimated casualties to date in the most recent action are over 1,000 dead and as many injured, including many civilians.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> One of the most brutal incidents, as Senator Cooney has adverted to, occurred on 16 November when six Jesuit priests, including the rector, the vice-rector, the sociology professor and the head of the human rights research unit of the University of Central America, and also two other people, were brutally murdered in San Salvador, reportedly after being badly beaten. The Government and the insurgent forces have each accused the other of the murder of the six Jesuits. The killings have been condemned by President Cristiani and an investigation into the murder apparently will be undertaken. There is considerable speculation, however, that the priests, who were known to be sympathetic to the rebel cause and were active in defending human rights, were in fact the victims of a rightist military death squad.</PARA>
<PARA> Whoever is responsible, I want to make it clear that Australia absolutely deplores and condemns this atrocity, which feeds the appalling cycle of violence against unarmed civilians which, as I said, has affected El Salvador over the past 10 years. The President, army spokesman and spokesmen for the United States Embassy in El Salvador have all declared that the situation is slowly coming under control. Latest reports indicate that the level of fighting has diminished, but the situation certainly remains fluid at present. An Organisation of American States mission is visiting El Salvador in an attempt to negotiate a ceasefire but prospects for renewed peace talks are bleak. Yesterday I took the opportunity to discuss the situation at some length with the Mexican Under-Secretary of Foreign Affairs, Ambassador Rozental, in Canberra. I indicated that we would do anything we could, although it has to be acknowledged that we are not a major player in El Salvador or in Central American affairs generally.</PARA>
<PARA> Nevertheless, I say again that we call on both sides to resume peace negotiations without delay in order to find a lasting settlement to the conflict. We appeal to both the Government and the FMLN forces to respect internationally accepted standards of human rights and to refrain from violence against unarmed civilians. We also express the hope that all countries in the region will work to diminish tension within El Salvador and avoid actions which could further escalate the violence in that country.</PARA>

That is why the 1988 industrial relations legislation which passed through this Senate provides for agreements certified by the Industrial Relations Commission which allow flexibility in negotiations at the enterprise level. A number of firms have taken advantage of that. Firms such as ICI Australia, Comalco Ltd and its partners at Bell Bay and the southern aluminium refinery and so on have taken advantage of that procedure to negotiate enterprise level agreements which have been put to the Australian Industrial Relations Commission for certification. I believe that that process should be encouraged. As distinct from the Opposition, this Government has been concerned throughout its period in office about aggregate wage outcomes.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade. Following the recent major changes in Eastern Europe and the general moves towards a more democratic system, what is the Government's assessment of the current dramatic situation in Eastern Europe and what are the implications for Australia?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="2868" SPEAKER="Evans Sen The Hon G.J." NAMEID="VD4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="VIC" MINISTERIAL="FOREIGN AFFAIRS AND TRADE" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator GARETH EVANS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The events in Europe of recent weeks have been, as we can all appreciate, quite tumultuous in their pace and breathtaking in their scope. Certainly they are wholly to be welcomed and hold out the prospect of a quite fundamental transformation in East-West relations, albeit one that will take quite some time to work through. They also hold out the prospect of quite fundamental changes in the shape of the world economic map which presumably will, in due course, match the political and geostrategic ones we are witnessing at the moment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The process has been led by the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR), where the current leadership has acknowledged quite frankly the fundamental problems of the communist command economy system and the political system that goes with it, where that leadership has accepted the intrinsic link between economic and political reform, where it has admitted serious specific errors in previous domestic and foreign policies, and where it has vowed that future policies will be based on what we in the West regard as more moral considerations.</PARA>
<PARA> Following that lead by the USSR, we have seen quite striking changes in a number of other Eastern European countries: Poland has a popularly elected government led by Solidarity; Hungary is attempting to transform itself into a multi-party democracy with a market economy; and now, in the German Democratic Republic (GDR) the Government is at last allowing its people freedom of travel and has promised to hold open elections. It would appear that a process of quite fundamental revision of the political and economic system in the GDR is now under way.</PARA>
<PARA> That response in the same positive manner has not been evident in a number of other Eastern European countries. The Government of Czechoslovakia has made changes only at the margin and has so far resisted fundamental change. The use of force against demonstrators calling for reform is an act quite contrary to the spirit of the times. Certainly we hold out the hope and the growing expectation that the Government in Prague will follow the lead of its neighbours and take into account the wishes of its own people. The process of reform has only just begun in Bulgaria, following the resignation of the longest serving communist leader in Eastern Europe. Of course, it has not begun at all in Romania, where the dismal human rights record in that country has earned it virtual universal condemnation.</PARA>
<PARA> Western countries have not been slow in reacting positively to this new course of events. A group of 24 Western countries-of which Australia was of course one-formed following the G7 summit have been working together to coordinate efforts to assist the reform process. The Prime Minister announced on 15 October a significant package of Australian assistance to Poland and Hungary, which consists not only of $5m worth of food aid but also of measures to assist these two countries to improve their economic performance. All of the developments we are witnessing are seen by us and other like-minded governments as marking the commencement rather than the conclusion in what will, I think, still be a long and fragile process. I repeat that the blurring of the very sharp division that has existed hitherto between East and West is a process that offers a quite historic opportunity for lasting improvements in East-West relations and global security and is of vital concern to us as well as to everybody else in the world.</PARA>
<PARA> Australia has been closely following and monitoring the events that have been occurring in Eastern Europe, as would be expected, and we have been particularly closely involved at a personal political leadership level as a result of the Prime Minister's visits to the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics to meet President Gorbachev and, more recently in July, to Hungary. The exact implications for Australia are difficult to determine at this stage. With that in mind, the Prime Minister and I have agreed that I should visit Europe next month to make some first-hand assessment of these developments and their implications for Europe. I will do so from the middle of next month.</PARA>
<PARA> The first objective of that visit is to attend in Brussels the proposed ministerial meeting of the Group of 24 and to discuss with Western ministerial colleagues their current thinking about the strategic and economic implications of the course of events in East Europe generally. The objective also, to the extent possible in the circumstances, is to make higher level contact with the new reform leadership emerging in Eastern Europe with a view to making some better informed judgments about the likely pace and direction of future political and economic change and also to try to make some first-hand assessment of the implications for the world trading system of the freeing up of the Eastern Europe economies that we are seeing and in that context to assist potential in trading and investment opportunities for Australia. On my return to Canberra I propose to put some recommendations to the Government on further steps Australia may take and any further response that might be appropriate to this quite breathtaking situation that we are now witnessing.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I refer the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade to undertakings given by the previous Foreign Minister, Mr Hayden, that a Labor government would resume aid to Vietnam after the withdrawal of its troops from Cambodia. First, does the Government agree with the British assessment that Vietnamese troops have withdrawn from Cambodia? If so, why has the Government made the provision of bilateral aid to Vietnam conditional on internal Cambodian factors, such as the achievement of a comprehensive settlement between the still warring factions, including the notorious Khmer Rouge? Secondly, does the Government support the decision of the United States Administration to offer aid in the form of medical supplies to Vietnam? If so, will Australia provide similar urgently needed equipment? Thirdly, given the decision by the Australian Trade Commission to open its first office in Vietnam in the next few months, does this mean that the Government sees the potential for better economic relations between the countries, but is unwilling to speed up this process through the provision of official bilateral development assistance?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;No government, let alone that of the United Kingdom, is in a position to assess with any confidence the precise situation on the ground so far as the withdrawal of Vietnamese troops is concerned in the absence of a properly and internationally supervised monitoring exercise of the kind that we, among others, have been seeking to put in place as part of a comprehensive settlement. There is no doubt that formed military units have completely withdrawn from Vietnam; they no longer exist as single entities. It is simply not possible to make any informed judgment about the situation with respect to individual advisers or perhaps even individual or small groups of troops that might be attached to other Cambodian units. Until it is possible to make such an informed judgment, our position will remain as it was originally stated by Mr Hayden.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Beyond that, we take the view that Vietnam, among others, is certainly still capable of influencing the final outcome in Cambodia politically and in other ways and that as a result it is appropriate that the rest of the world maintain some appropriate pressure on Vietnam together with appropriate pressure on all the other countries that are capable of influencing outcome. I instance among them China, particularly, because of its very crucial role in continuing to supply the Khmer Rouge. It is appropriate, I repeat, to maintain some stance of this kind in order to bring about the situation that we all very much hope for, an end to the killing in Cambodia once and for all and a settlement which will prove to be genuinely durable.</PARA>
<PARA> The situation with respect to aid to Vietnam is, as I have stated, based on being satisfied both that there has been a complete withdrawal of the Vietnamese troops and that as settlement of the Cambodian situation is either in place or at least on track. That will remain our policy position.</PARA>
<PARA> The situation concerning aid more generally, however, is not concluded by that. I have been talking so far only about the resumption of formal bilateral aid between the two countries, which was withdrawn by Australia following the invasion of Cambodia in 1979 by Vietnam. Australia does, of course, continue to provide quite a large sum of aid through multilateral institutions and non-government organisations. My recollection is that that is of the order of magnitude of some $21m in the last financial year, about $14m of which was in the form of food aid. The rest was provided through a variety of other projects, through a variety of other multilateral and non-government organisation channels.</PARA>
<PARA> Similarly, in the case of Cambodia itself, I think that about $6m of Australian aid is going in there-not on the basis of any bilateral intergovernmental process but through multilateral agencies and non-government organisations. We certainly propose to continue that aid in the interests both of humanitarian considerations and of the development of the country. I should make it clear also that we have taken the view, so far as Vietnam is concerned, that it is entirely appropriate that Vietnam should have access to funds from international financial institutions, the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank. In that respect we take a rather different view from some of our allies or like-minded countries in relation to the Indo-China dispute who have been unwilling to accept that particular principle.</PARA>
<PARA> So far as the question of trade with Vietnam is concerned, equally Australia has imposed no inhibitions on trade with Vietnam at any stage, unlike, again, the position of the United States in particular and some other allied countries which have dragged their feet in this respect. We have seen it as important to assist as best we can in the commercial and economic recovery of the country, and we are taking steps accordingly to upgrade our presence in Vietnam at a trade representation level to ensure that that occurs. There is a consistency about our position in this respect. We are trying in a number of ways to ensure that enough of an environment is created where there is still pressure to proceed towards a settlement of the unresolved questions in Cambodia, but we do not believe that that should be taken to the point of inhibiting the flow of very badly needed aid and trade with the countries in question.</PARA>

<PARA>Does the Minister now realise that the figure he cited relates to charging by pharmacists for pharmaceutical benefits scheme (PBS) medications below the price of $11? Is it not a fact that as these prescriptions make up only 20 to 25 per cent of total prescriptions dispensed, the claimed overcharging relates to only about 16 to 20 per cent of all prescriptions, not the 83.7 per cent put by the Minister? In view of the fact that on the previous day Mr Staples had accurately stated the position in the House of Representatives, will the Minister now confirm that he made a mistake? Will he not also apologise to Senator Knowles for describing her attempt to put the record straight, in a question to him on 2 November, as a `fairly tawdry and shabby effort'?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Lewis is continuing a line of questioning that Senator Knowles started on 2 November. In my answer on 2 November I advised Senator Knowles that she would do well to read all of the documentation associated with the answer. Perhaps I should go a little further and say that if one selects a line from an answer, it is possible to make a case based on the meaning of that line, standing alone. If one takes the answer as a complete unit and reads all of the points and references made within that answer, it is possible to see that the inference that one may draw from a particular line, standing alone, is not the correct inference. Let me make this point very clear: if it is correct to take the meaning of a line standing alone, then the allegation that Senator Knowles made of me is an allegation which is equally true of her. Once again I refer Senator Lewis to the whole of the answer and the whole of the question.</PARA></TALK.START>

In relation to this, I ask the Minister whether the Australian Government was told whether this order applied to Battle Group Alpha, which was then in Fremantle and two other Western Australian ports, as it applied to other ships in this group which are homeported at Yokosuka in Japan. What form did the safety review take? Were all naval personnel recalled from shore leave to participate in the review? If not, why not? Was a check of all weaponry included, and was the review conducted while the vessels were in port? What is the Government's response to this dramatic and unprecedented admission from the United States Navy that its safety record is far from good? Considering that there have been at least three accidents involving United States naval vessels in Australian ports-Stirling in 1981, Brisbane in 1987 and Cairns in 1988-will the Minister revise his grandiose claim made on the Australian Broadcasting Corporation's 7.30 Report during the Bicentennial Naval Review that accidents will not happen in Australian ports?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="UI4">Senator ROBERT RAY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will take the last part of the question first. I am not aware that a Minister has recently reissued guidelines in regard to this particular matter, but normally, from time to time, the attention of senators and members is drawn to a whole range of guidelines as to their entitlements. As to what guidelines there are on Ministers using stamps, postage entitlements come in a variety of forms, both franked and credit card, plus an allowance of, I think, $900 a quarter in physical stamps. I assume that is what the honourable senator is referring to. In regard to that, it is usually left to the judgment of senators and members concerned. In a technical aspect, I think they are for use generally only from Canberra, because members and senators do not have their franking machines in Canberra. I do not want to have a `hands up' exercise of who has ever taken their stamps home from here because I am afraid we would get a fairly meagre response and I would doubt the veracity of those who would put up their hands, because they tend to be used both at home and here. I think that was the Remuneration Tribunal's thinking-to issue stamps so that they could be used in Canberra rather than in the home electorate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The honourable senator has asked me to give a judgment on whether stamps should be used for community purposes, for internal union ballots, or for anything else. My response to that is that usually the main rule in governing the behaviour of members of parliament is commonsense. We do have arguments from time to time whether in fact postage allowances across the board are always used correctly. I have noticed a press release from Senator Short criticising Mr Cleeland for doing something when I got a letter from Senator Short in exactly the same terms as the letter Mr Cleeland sent out. I think there is a fair bit of hypocrisy here, but commonsense should apply.</PARA>

<PARA> As I say, when I was Minister for Home Affairs-and I am sure Mr West takes the same approach-usually I took the approach that those stamps were for official government use. It is true that out of an electoral allowance a member of parliament may want to buy stamps and give them to community organisations. Within the spirit of the decision of the Remuneration Tribunal, I think one is allowed to use one's electoral allowance to help community groups. Where one draws the line should be left to the commonsense of the honourable member or honourable senator concerned. I guess that where that line is drawn is up to the public to eventually decide, but we generally expect people to show some commonsense in that regard. I cannot give Senator Vanstone a precise definition because everyone has different needs and uses.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am aware of Mr McGauran's claims. I follow him with a great deal of interest because, of all the cowboys on the Opposition benches, he is the greatest high-rider, I think, in the outrageous claims which he makes. Mr McGauran's claims are based on a submission, based on figures prepared by my Department some 18 months ago, made to an Australian Science and Technology Council (ASTEC) inquiry by some officers of CSIRO. It was one of a hundred being considered by ASTEC. The information in Mr McGauran's statement is out of date. It is particularly out of date because in May this year the Government announced a whole package of science funding which benefited both CSIRO and other research bodies which are funded in part or in whole by the Commonwealth Budget.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The whole thing, as with most Liberal Opposition members, is yesterday's show. It is one of the last 1985 shows from Mr McGauran and is out of date. I do not know why he keeps on saying these silly things. The statement does not take account of the significant sums made available in the May statement. Nor does it take account of the range of government and private sector bodies which are looking at environmental problems. The most pressing environmental problem is soil degradation. Research into that is presently being conducted by the Department of Primary Industries and Energy. I thought that Mr McGauran would have known about that.</PARA>
<PARA> While CSIRO's contribution to research into the environment is considerable and, I might say, often world-class, that organisation has by no means a monopoly or a necessary monopoly of excellence in this field. The Australian National Parks and Wildlife Service and its State counterparts conduct research into these issues, as do various government departments, including the Department of Primary Industries and Energy, the Department of the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories and the Department of Local Government, the various State pollution control authorities, the Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation, Australian universities, which conduct much of the long term basic research in this field, and industry, which is developing better and cleaner production processes, and so on.</PARA>
<PARA> Apart from that, because of the Government's commitment to environmental research, it has made funds available for a number of specific purposes in environmental research, not all of which have been given to CSIRO. For example, this year an additional $13m was allocated for soil research and $5m for forestry research. Funding for rural research and water resources increased by $31m; $10m was allocated for the national reafforestation program, and so on. There are many activities such as those which go beyond CSIRO and which are relevant to research into the environment. Mr McGauran, if he wants one, can have from me a full list on what the projects are that are conducting research into environmental matters.</PARA>
<PARA> As I have said, the statement on CSIRO is out of date. A number of things have happened since then. Ultimately the management of CSIRO research activity is in the hands of the board and senior management of that organisation. It is their job to determine priorities within the organisation as much as they can.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-Mr President, I claim to have been misrepresented. On 9 November 1989 a Tonight program on Special Broadcasting Service (SBS) television, by a process of misrepresentation, selection of material and juxtaposition of opposing interviews, conveyed a misleading, inaccurate and unfair representation of my views on population and immigration. The misrepresentation occurred in four areas. Firstly, the program represented me as a vice-president of the Australian Conservation Foundation. I am not an office holder of the Australian Conservation Foundation. Secondly, when inviting me to the interview, the interviewer, Mr Mark Corcoran, led me to believe that the interview would last for about 12 minutes and that the whole of the interview would be shown. In fact, only a few selected excerpts were televised.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Thirdly, in a lengthy discussion before filming of the interview began, I made it abundantly clear to Mark Corcoran that, whatever the level of immigration, I would not support selection which was based on any consideration of race, religion, sex or ethnic origin. I stressed that it was most important to include this in the broadcast interview. The same point was stressed again during the filmed part of the discussion and again during a long discussion which followed. This important point made by me was completely eliminated in the broadcast program. On the contrary, each part of my interview was surrounded by others protesting the need for a non-racially based immigration program, giving the clear impression that my argument was racist. I and the Australian Democrats support a non-racially based immigration program with emphasis on humanitarian considerations, a program of family reunion and an expanded refugee program. </PARA>
<PARA> Fourthly, one part of the interview dealt with the economics of immigration. I made the point that the studies done so far of the economics of immigration had failed to show any economic benefit to Australia of a continuing high rate of immigration. Economics was mentioned twice during the selected part of the interview which was broadcast and on each occasion it was stated that I claimed that immigration conferred no benefit on Australia. The adjective `economic', an important qualifier, was removed. The word `economic' as a qualifier actually appeared on the screen on one occasion while the voice-over spoke only of `no benefit'. It would appear that someone in SBS, with the same zeal with which fundamentalist Moslems have dealt with the Salman Rushdie book Satanic Verses, is intent on crushing any sane rational debate on the size of Australia's population or the economics of the immigration program by smearing as racist those who raise these issues, however unfair or unjustifiable that may be. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the paper. </PARA>
<PARA>The Industries Assistance Commission (IAC) 1988-89 annual report was tabled in the House of Representatives a couple of weeks ago and has received extensive coverage since that time. The Minister at the table, the Leader of the Government in the Senate (Senator Button), commented during Question Time that the Government was being bombarded with advice on the economy. That is scarcely surprising, given the very significant difficulties Australia faces in terms of international debt and the fact that in four of the last six years Australian wage and salary earners have seen their real incomes decline. If the current Budget figures are any indication, it seems likely that in five of Labor's seven years in office real incomes in Australia will have been reduced. </PARA>
<PARA> Some economists cheer at that sort of thing. That is understandable if reductions in real wages are part of a program for economic recovery but when, over the same seven-year period, there has been an explosion of foreign debt and a total failure to do anything about productivity, which is the key to getting ourselves out of this morass of debt and poverty, it is not surprising that many people are rallying forward with advice for the Government. </PARA>
<PARA> The advice which comes from politicians, whether they be from the Government itself or the Opposition, tends to be regarded with some suspicion in the electorate. Certainly there is some doubt that the process of political debate very often is focused on the substance of issues. For that reason, the contributions of people, whether they be from the Macquarie Bank or the IAC, are welcomed by the public and do help to throw some light on matters which are of some concern to the whole community. </PARA>
<PARA> In the case of this report, however, the Opposition would say that there is a very substantial bearing out of the views which we have been expressing for a long time and which were again brought together in the Economic Action Plan produced recently by Mr Andrew Peacock on behalf of the Opposition. The fact that there is support for issues such as privatisation and for a far more active approach to reform of things such as coastal shipping-and the Industries Assistance Commission points out how that process could be improved and accelerated by the introduction of foreign competition, which is of course completely consistent with the Opposition's policy on this matter-does I think give greater weight to the views which have been put forward by us. </PARA>
<PARA> In the very brief time available to me, I wish to point out to the Minister at the table, Senator Button, that once again this report suggests that there is a fundamental need for labour market reform in Australia. It is probably fair to say that Senator Button, in about the sixth response to matters raised with him in Question Time, did make some reference to the debate being about the rate of change which can be achieved. I draw his attention to the fact that the IAC, on page 28 of its report, refers to the point that the success of many of the reforms which are put forward by the IAC as being fundamental is predicated on a degree of labour market reform, and it refers to greater wage flexibility having a role to play in two respects in that it can provide signals for redevelopment and provide a means by which retraining can be financed. </PARA>
<PARA> From the point of view of the Australian people, however, the simple fact is that the IAC report is talking about how we can make Australia a wealthier country. It is fundamental that we do make Australia a wealthier country if we are to do away with the twin plagues of debt and declining living standards. What the IAC puts forward in this document is an estimate that reforms in areas such as transport, postal service, telecommunications and the electricity sector and reductions in rural and manufacturing assistance-all of which have been targeted by the Opposition as needing a far more rapid rate of change than the Government is promoting-could, over the long term, increase the gross domestic product in Australia by about 4.7 per cent of $16 billion a year, could increase real wages by 8 per cent, and could mean a fall in the consumer price index of 6.3 per cent. Production would increase in all sectors of the economy but by far the biggest winner would be the mining sector, where output could increase by 24 per cent. The report makes the point that the key to achieving these outcomes is increased competition. The report is critical of many of the Government's reforms, including that of coastal shipping. </PARA>
<PARA> I ask the Minister at the table to consider this report carefully. I believe that it is yet another condemnation of the inactivity of the Government in many vital areas. The fact is that the Government is pursuing change in most of them but in almost all it is a case of too little too late and I do not think that Australia has a lot more time to play around. </PARA>

I have heard Senator Button repeatedly make statements about micro-economic reform and changes which should take place in the economy of this nation over a period of many years and, as I have said repeatedly, I have admired his words. I have not admired his actions because he and his Government frankly have failed to fulfil the rhetoric that they have used in relation to micro-economic reform. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is so. What has it done since 1987? All it has worried about is trying to getting itself re-elected for a fourth term in office and it has abandoned this nation and abandoned reform of this nation. The result is pointed out in the Macquarie Bank report. It points out how far down the drain this country looks like going unless and until we start to implement the significant reforms set out in this report. The IAC draws attention to means whereby the gross domestic product could be increased by $16 billion, and average household income by more than $1,600 each year. These broadly-based reforms do not include the large gains which could be expected from greater efficiency in other major services sector activity such as health, education and construction.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This report goes on in its own quiet way to tear this Government apart. In particular, it makes great criticism of the Treasurer (Mr Keating), who took over responsibility for the Industries Assistance Commission from Senator Button. The Treasurer ripped that responsibility from Senator Button after the last election. The Industries Assistance Commission had to sit on its tail waiting for the Treasurer and his office to get around to giving it the references. At least Senator Button was giving the Industries Assistance Commission a reference and then issuing the press release; the Treasurer went the other way around it. He issued the press release and then four or five months later got around to making the reference. </PARA>

There is one other matter I wish to mention in the last 30 seconds or so of this speech. The IAC points out that alternative assistance measures are not the answer. It is very interesting that Senator Button, despite his rhetoric, has finally started to look for alternative assistance measures. The report refers to the offsets arrangements, the partnerships for development agreements and export market development schemes. It says that they are not the answer. Senator Button now has a report that is costing the Australian Manufacturing Council over $1m and to which the Government has made a substantial contribution. It is to come up with alternative assistance measures, notwithstanding the fact that the Commission, which Senator Button used to hold in high regard, says that these measures are not the answer.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The 1988-89 annual report of the Industries Assistance Commission (IAC) will be the last report of the Commission, as it is to be restructured. Under the title of the Industry Commission, it is sought to amalgamate the functions of the IAC, the Inter-State Commission and the Business Regulation Review Unit. However, I understand that in the restructuring serious consideration needs to be given to the constitutionally intended distinctive role of the Inter-State Commission in advising on issues in the area of Federal-State relations. Over the last financial year the IAC reports that its inquiry program has focused on the services sector. To this end, it has reported on domestic barriers and impediments to international trade in services. The IAC's report on the service industries has revealed some major inefficiencies within that sector and, as services account for three-quarters of economic activity, it is considered essential that removal of these inefficiencies be given high priority. I concur with the comments made by my colleagues Senator Chaney and Senator Lewis.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In addition to the services industry, action in other areas, such as the passenger motor vehicle, textiles, clothing, footwear, agricultural and manufacturing industries, I understand will also continue. The Industries Assistance Commission is keen to drive the message home that there is an urgency for micro-economic reform. Micro-economic reform entails getting rid of the obstacles raised by excessive and intrusive regulation-I adhere to that need-the inefficiencies of government enterprise, government-sponsored monopolies, like Telecom Australia, the various State electricity commissions, the restrictive work practices. In effect, to create what is often referred to as a level playing field. </PARA>
<PARA> Actually, comment by the Australian Manufacturing Council suggests that micro-economic reform in the form of the low-protection open market model, as espoused by both Labor and the coalition, will not result in the non-resource traded manufacturing sector providing an answer to Australia's trade problems, and that is where my sympathies lie. Whilst some manufacturing industries may use this as an argument for continued assistance, whether in the form of tariffs or tax breaks, I believe it raises an interesting point. The point is that the potential for greater exports lies in the area of raw materials processing; that is, trying to build upon our existing comparative advantages, rather than focus on areas where we are unlikely to succeed. </PARA>
<PARA> Australian manufacturers are caught in a pincer of small local markets and an inability to easily supply large export markets. In addition, the existence of brands, consumer franchises, tied distribution arrangements, closeness to markets, economies of scale, proprietary technology and superior purchasing power within the world means Australian companies are unlikely to compete on an equal or level playing field. So, resources dominate our export trade, but we process a relatively small part of these raw materials. The same story applies to wool, hides and cotton exports, woodchips and foods. It is here that great scope exists to boost export revenue. For example, aluminium exports alone are worth $5 billion, and this could rise three times to $15 billion if all bauxite and alumina were transformed to metal. </PARA>
<PARA> Perhaps the IAC in its restructured form would be best to look at the tariffs that raise the input costs for export processing, high shipping costs and poor management and labour practices which form other barriers to trade. In addition, the Government should look at the impediments it places on industry in the form of the twice-monthly payment of the pay as you earn tax and the payment of 85 per cent of a tax bill within 15 days of the close of the accounting year. This is quite intolerable so far as companies are concerned. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the paper. </PARA>
<PARA>I rise to speak on the corrigendum to the annual report of Telecom Australia which happens to be an amendment to correct a figure of 98 per cent stated to be the achievement rate for the rural and remote areas program for Telecom to a mere 96 per cent. The significance of that figure may escape the populace at first blush, but I regard it as particularly significant for the following reason: the rural and remote areas program, which costs some $530m, was instituted in 1984-85. Remarkable progress has been made to date although, as I understand it, the installations in remote areas now cost in excess of $30,000 per home. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="LD4">Senator ALSTON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Well, it could even get as high as that for the remainder of the program. The significance is that this is a classic example of the claim that Telecom needs to make its monopoly profits in order to cross-subsidise the costs of these activities. What we are talking about in this particular area is very small bickies by this stage. Last year some 5,000 new and modernised services were provided. It is very instructive that Telecom does not even bother to insert the real cost in its annual report; so it must be fairly small. In the same way, of course, it does not publish, and refuses to provide to the public, material on which one could calculate the cost of its community service obligations (CSOs).</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That is something that Senator Button and his colleagues have been handballing for months. About 2 1/2 months ago Mr Willis promised to release in the near future the report from the Bureau of Transport and Communications Economics, which would give us a real insight into whether Telecom CSOs were affordable in an open and competitive environment or whether Telecom continues to need the vast monopoly protection that is responsible for something in excess of 75 per cent of its monopoly profits, which last year amounted to $973m. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="LD4">Senator ALSTON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That old bogey used to be trotted out with monotonous regularity when everyone thought that the true cost in today's terms was probably $600m or $800m, but the reality is that the Bureau's figure is probably not much more than $100m. I can well understand why Senator Button and his colleagues will sit on that figure until the election: it is dynamite for them; it pulls the rug out from under any justification for Telecom's continued monopoly in this area.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> One thing that I find particularly disappointing is the reference in this context to remote Aboriginal communities. It is said that special attention is being paid to the needs of people residing within the Aboriginal and Islander communities. The fact of the matter is that Telecom is deliberately stalling and frustrating the proposals to extend radiotelephone services to 13 remote Aboriginal communities in the Northern Territory, even to the point that it is contesting a court case that has been brought on the basis that it is part of its community service obligations to provide these services. </PARA>
<PARA> The fact of the matter is that these services could be delivered much more cheaply and quickly by Aussat, but Telecom is determined to maintain its own rate of slow-moving progress and to install much more expensive equipment. Those communities will have to wait another 12 months or more before they are connected to the service when, by use of the satellite, it could have been in place in a matter of weeks. I regard this figure that has been corrected today as yet another indication that the rural and remote areas program is coming to its conclusion. It is not costing very much at all. It is simply one further example of there being no continuing need for Telecom's monopoly to be maintained. I just wish the Government would have the courage to face up to the issue. </PARA>
<PARA> A failed and discredited Minister like Rip van Willis is clearly out of control in this area. I just wish the Government would step in and face up to the competitive consequences that were supposed to be part of the rhetoric of that third term micro-economic reform agenda. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thank you, Mr Deputy President, and that is eminently possible especially in the context of the view held by the Australian Democrats in relation to all reports, corrigenda and other items of information from Telecom. When one looks at the country division aspect of the report-and this is a subject of the corrigendum-one is reminded of the role of Telecom and its place in our community. As an example, it produces 2.6 per cent of our gross domestic product which represents the largest contribution to the GDP from a single commercial enterprise in Australia. As Senator Alston pointed out, Telecom Australia has almost completed the provision of telephone services virtually to all Australians and it has done that as part of fulfilling its community service obligations. It has been able to do it by virtue of its ability to cross-subsidise.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is important to look at the task that faces Telecom. Australia has a low density population distribution, being only one-twelfth of that of the United States of America, which has a privatised telephone system; one-one hundred and twenty-fifth of that of the United Kingdom; and one-one hundred and fiftieth of that of Japan. In this context productivity and efficiency is often demonstrated by this organisation which, while being the major single enterprise contributor to our GDP, at the same time provides a service to those people who live in remote areas. It has kept its tariffs well below consumer price index increases and compares favourably particularly with other government services provided over the same period. Telecom's costs for residential services to all Australians, even to those people in remote areas where provision of services can be costly and difficult, are ahead of costs in only the United States of America, Sweden and Canada. Many other nations with similar economies have much higher residential service costs. </PARA>
<PARA> In that context, the Australian Democrats believe it is important that we do not undermine the position of this enterprise which, after all, belongs to and serves the whole community-clearly something with which the Opposition does not agree. </PARA>

<PARA>SALES TAX (EXEMPTIONS AND CLASSIFICATIONS) AMENDMENT BILL (No. 2) 1989</PARA>
<PARA> Mr President, this Bill will make a number of amendments to the Sales Tax (Exemptions and Classifications) Act to give effect to sales tax changes announced in the Environment Statement of 20 July 1989, in the 1989-90 Budget and in a statement by the Minister Assisting the Treasurer when moving an amendment to the Bill in another place on 31 October 1989. </PARA>
<PARA>Certain recycled paper products</PARA>
<PARA> The Bill will ensure that certain paper products are exempt from sales tax, if all the paper in the goods has been manufactured from recycled paper. </PARA>
<PARA> This proposal was announced by the Prime Minister in his Environment Statement on 20 July 1989. </PARA>
<PARA> The revenue effect of the amendment, which will operate with effect from 5 October 1989, is estimated to be less than $500,000 in a full year. </PARA>
<PARA> Honourable Senators will recall that when this initiative was announced the Prime Minister foreshadowed a further review to determine the practicability of expanding the range of goods made of recycled paper that are to be exempt from sales tax. </PARA>
<PARA> An announcement about the outcome of the review will be made shortly. </PARA>
<PARA>Goods for use by sub-contractors in carrying out activities of a manufacturing nature</PARA>
<PARA> The Bill gives effect to the proposal announced in the 1989-90 Budget to extend the range of goods to be exempt from sales tax where those goods are for use by a sub-contractor exclusively in carrying out activities on behalf of one or more manufacturers. </PARA>
<PARA> In addition, following an amendment moved by the Minister Assisting the Treasurer in the Committee stage in another place on 31 October 1989, the proposal has been extended to also allow exemption where the persons engaging the sub-contractors are not technically manufacturers for sales tax purposes. </PARA>
<PARA> The exemption is to be available only if each of the persons engaging the sub-contractors could have obtained exemption for the goods under the existing `aids to manufacture' provisions of the sales tax law had that person acquired and used the goods to carry out the contracted activities. </PARA>
<PARA> This change will operate from 4 October 1989 and is estimated to cost $3.5 million in 1989-90 and $6 million in 1990-91. </PARA>
<PARA>Small manufacturers</PARA>
<PARA> The Bill will increase the small manufacturer exemption thresholds. </PARA>
<PARA> From 4 October 1989, sales of goods by a small manufacturer with average annual sales of $50,000 or less may qualify for exemption from sales tax. </PARA>
<PARA> Similarly, goods manufactured by a manufacturer may be exempt if the sales tax that would have been payable by the manufacturer does not exceed $1000 per annum. </PARA>
<PARA> Manufacturers who qualify for exemption in respect of goods they sell are unable to obtain free of tax inputs to the manufacture of those goods such as raw materials and aids to manufacture. </PARA>
<PARA> The net cost to revenue of increasing these thresholds is estimated to be $8 million in 1989-90 and $11 million in a full year. </PARA>
<PARA>Flavoured milk</PARA>
<PARA> Finally, the sales tax law is being amended so that, effective from 16 August 1989, flavoured milk drinks that contain at least 90 per cent milk are subject to tax at the concessional rate of 10 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> This reduction from the earlier 95 per cent content requirement was announced in the 1989-90 Budget. </PARA>
<PARA> I commend the Bill to the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA>SALES TAX (EXEMPTIONS AND CLASSIFICATIONS) (COMPUTER PROGRAMS) AMENDMENT BILL 1989</PARA>
<PARA> This Bill complements one of the main measures in the Sales Tax Laws (Computer Programs) Amendment Bill 1989, about which I have just spoken. </PARA>
<PARA> By that Bill, sales tax is to be removed on all computer programs other than those on microchips. </PARA>
<PARA> A general principle of the sales tax law is that, where goods are subject to sales tax, goods for use exclusively or principally in manufacturing the taxable goods are exempt from sales tax. </PARA>
<PARA> Without such an exemption there would be an element of double taxation of the manufactured goods. </PARA>
<PARA> On this basis, under the present law, goods for use exclusively, or primarily and principally in embodying computer programs in goods are free from sales tax as ``aids to manufacture''. </PARA>
<PARA> Consistent with the removal of sales tax on computer programs proposed by the other Bill, this Bill will remove in part-and allow regulations to be made to remove the rest of-the ``aids to manufacture'' exemption in relation to computer programs that I have just described, except where the goods are for use exclusively or principally in embodying programs in microchips. </PARA>
<PARA> Changes to the Sales Tax Regulations to narrow the definition of ``aids to manufacture'' in those regulations will be submitted to the Executive Council as soon as practicable. </PARA>
<PARA> The changes will apply from 23 December 1988, as announced by the Treasurer. </PARA>
<PARA> Their revenue impact will be negligible. </PARA>
<PARA> I commend the Bill to the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA>SALES TAX LAWS (COMPUTER PROGRAMS) AMENDMENT BILL 1989</PARA>
<PARA> This is the first of 2 Bills to amend the sales tax law to give effect to the Treasurer's announcement on 22 December 1988 that sales tax liability for all computer software other than firmware would be removed. </PARA>
<PARA> At present under the sales tax law, computer programs as such, because they are not goods, are not subject to sales tax. </PARA>
<PARA> However, the sale value of tangible carrying media for programs (such as floppy disks) include the value of the programs when calculating the amount of sales tax payable on the goods. </PARA>
<PARA> This Bill will reduce the sale value of goods containing computer programs by the amount of that value attributable to the programs. </PARA>
<PARA> In addition, the sale value will be further reduced by the amount of that value attributable to an instruction manual that forms part of the goods. </PARA>
<PARA> The carrying medium for programs and the packaging will, however, continue to be taxable. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill treats as firmware computer programs on microchips. </PARA>
<PARA> In accordance with the Treasurer's announcement that the sales tax exemption for software would not extend to firmware, there will be no reduction in the sale value for programs on microchips-typically, programs permanently built into appliances. Where the only programs in the goods are on microchips, there will also be no reduction in the sale value for an instruction manual. </PARA>
<PARA> The cost to revenue of this measure is estimated to be $10 million in 1988-89, $30 million in 1989-90 and $35 million in 1990-91. </PARA>
<PARA> The changes will apply, as announced by the Treasurer, from 23 December 1988.</PARA>
<PARA> In developing this Bill it has come to attention that a number of taxpayers may have acted on the basis of a view of the Treasurer's announcement under which their sales tax liability on goods containing computer programs would be less than that proposed by this Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> The Commissioner of Taxation has assured me that, given the uncertainty that existed in this area and as sales tax is a tax ultimately borne by the consumer from whom it would be impracticable for a taxpayer to recover any further tax on goods already sold, he will not be seeking to increase any taxpayer's liability beyond that which the taxpayer could reasonably have expected. </PARA>
<PARA> The opportunity is also being taken in this Bill to make a number of other amendments to the sales tax law. </PARA>
<PARA> One is an amendment of a concessional nature to correct a deficiency in the present law. </PARA>
<PARA> This amendment will ensure that, where goods containing sounds or visual images (records, videos and the like) or goods containing computer programs on microchips are subject to sales tax when sold by retail or treated as stock for sale by retail, any licence fee for the right to use the sounds, images or programs is included in the sale value of the carrying medium on the fee's wholesale value not its retail value. </PARA>
<PARA> The amendment, which will have a negligible financial impact (if any), will apply from tomorrow. </PARA>
<PARA> Another change to be made by this Bill has become necessary because extensions of the sales tax base or increases in rates of sales tax commonly take effect earlier than the date of enactment of the amending legislation-for example, from the date of introduction of the amending legislation into the Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> Consequently, because sales tax is a tax payable monthly, persons technically may be required, on a basis that is effectively retrospective to do or not to do certain things-such as to register for sales tax purposes and to pay sales tax-before the amending legislation becomes law. </PARA>
<PARA> On enactment, a person who has failed to register or to pay sales tax on transactions since the date of introduction technically, and retrospectively, becomes guilty of an offence or liable to additional tax by way of penalty. </PARA>
<PARA> This Bill will ensure that any amendments made by it or any future sales tax Bills will not result in a person being guilty of an offence or liable to additional tax by way of penalty for acts or omissions before the 28th day after the day on which the amending legislation concerned receives Royal Assent. </PARA>
<PARA> Consistent with that, any obligations arising from such amendments that presently should be met before the 27th day after Royal Assent is given to the amending legislation will in future not formally have to be met before that day. </PARA>
<PARA> In practice, this amendment is unlikely to change much of the past. </PARA>
<PARA> It has been longstanding Taxation Office practice to encourage registration, payment of tax and so on in the period before enactment of new sales tax changes-in recognition of the impracticability of a taxpayer recovering sales tax from retailers and consumers after the latter have already bought goods affected by the changes-but not to penalise taxpayers who decline to do so. </PARA>
<PARA> The revenue impact, if any, will therefore be negligible. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, the Bill will alter a number of incorrect cross-references in the sales tax law, also with effect from tomorrow. </PARA>
<PARA> In closing, I would like to express my thanks to the Australian Information Industry Association, the Software and Services Industry Federation of Australia and the National Sales Tax Liaison Committee for the constructive comments they gave in the short time made available to them to examine a draft of this Bill and the other Bill in this package. </PARA>

<PARA>PRIMARY INDUSTRIES AND ENERGY LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (No. 3) 1989</PARA>
<PARA> This Bill is an omnibus Bill for legislation administered within the Primary Industries and Energy portfolio. The Bill covers amendments to the Wool Marketing Act 1987, Australian Meat and Live-stock Research and Development Act 1985, Honey Levy Collection Act 1962, Honey Marketing Act 1988, Soil Conservation (Financial Assistance) Act 1985, Barley Research Levy Collection Act 1980, Oilseeds Levy Collection Act 1977, Oilseeds Levy Act 1977, Rural Industries Research Act 1985 and Wheat Marketing Act 1989 and repeals the Bass Strait Freight Adjustment Levy Act 1984, Bass Strait Freight Adjustment Levy Collection Act 1984, Bass Strait Freight Adjustment Trust Fund Act 1984 and Customs Tariff (Stand-by) Duty Act 1985. </PARA>
<PARA> I wish to cover the more significant amendments to be made by the Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> There are a number of amendments to be made to the Wool Marketing Act 1987. The most important amendment to that Act relates to the statutory arrangements for Wool Research and Development. </PARA>
<PARA> Wool remains our most important commodity export, worth around $6 billion in 1988-89. In a world context, although less than 15 per cent of the world's sheep flock is in Australia, we produce around three-quarters of the apparel wool traded internationally. Australia's wool industry is, therefore, at the forefront internationally, but we must continue to make improvements if the industry is to remain competitive on world markets. The key to further productivity gains, both on and off the farm, lies in effective research and development and efforts. </PARA>
<PARA> The Wool Research and Development Fund is by far the largest fund established under the Government's rural industry research policies with a $56 million expenditure program planned for 1989-90. If these funds are to be used most efficiently and effectively we need to ensure that the administrative arrangements are of the highest calibre. To this end, extensive discussions have been held between the Wool Council of Australia, the representative body of the woolgrowers, and myself and agreement has been reached on several changes to the Wool Research and Development arrangements. In making these changes, the Government has taken into account the established domestic and international links between research, promotion and marketing in the wool industry. </PARA>
<PARA> The purposes of the changes are to increase industry involvement in the determination of long-term R &amp; D strategies and to facilitate the commercial exploitation of the results of R &amp; D efforts. Changes will be made to the constitution of the Wool Research and Development Council, and to the selection procedures for its members. Accountability of the Council to the industry and the Minister will also be strengthened. </PARA>
<PARA> The membership of the Council is to consist of a Chairperson selected by the Minister, in consultation with the Australian Wool Corporation Chairperson; a government member selected by the Minister; an Executive Director selected jointly by the Wool Corporation Managing Director and the Council Chairperson; and 7 other members selected by the Australian Wool Industry Selection Committee. All members, except the Executive Director, will be part-time members and will hold office for up to three years (except the government member who is appointed at the Minister's pleasure), and are eligible for re-appointment. </PARA>
<PARA> The composition, functions and powers of the Australian Wool Industry Selection Committee for the purposes of selection of members of the Council, is to be the same as for the selection of Wool Corporation Directors. Selections made by the Committee for the Council will be against specific areas of expertise listed in the Act, and will put forward those persons who will best ensure the members of the Council collectively possess the listed areas of expertise. These arrangements should provide the Council with a broader range of expertise amongst its members than has been the case in the past. </PARA>
<PARA> The Selection Committee will invite the Wool Corporation and the Wool Council to nominate persons to it for consideration. To ensure that an effective linkage between the Corporation and Council is maintained, the nominations forwarded to the Minister by the Selection Committee shall contain up to 3 persons from those nominated by the Corporation. </PARA>
<PARA> The Selection Committee will also be able to advertise nationally for applications and will be able to engage the services of an executive search consultant in the selection process. </PARA>
<PARA> In order to ensure that there are no undue disruptions during the period between the passage of the legislation and the appointment of a new Council, transitional provisions have been included in this Bill. Those persons who currently hold office shall continue to do so; in the case of the Chairperson for the remainder of his appointment, or in the case of the remaining members until the end of their appointment or until the Minister terminates the appointment. It is my intention that the new selection arrangements for the Council will be activated early in the new year, with a view to appointments of these seven members being made by April 1990. </PARA>
<PARA> Consultation between the Council and the industry and accountability to the industry is an important element of the new arrangements. In the preparation of the R &amp; D plan and annual program, the Council is to consult with the Wool Council and other departments/agencies and to take into consideration any comments these bodies may have. R &amp; D plans and programs are to be submitted by Council Chairperson, through the Wool Corporation, to the Minister for agreement. The five year R &amp; D plans will also be `rolling' plans to enable adjustments to be made during the period specified in the plan. The Council will report in a separate annual report to the Minister, which will be tabled in Parliament, and to the industry. </PARA>
<PARA> The final important alteration to the wool R &amp; D arrangements relates to the commercial exploitation of the results of research. Through amendments in this Bill, the Wool Corporation will be able to carry out activities relating to the commercial exploitation of results using Wool R &amp; D Fund monies upon the recommendation of the Council. </PARA>
<PARA> In conjunction with this innovation, the Wool Corporation, subject to Ministerial approval under section 11 of the Act, will be able to establish a technology adoption company to commercialise the results of research supported by the Fund. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill also makes amendments relating to refunds of the Market Support Fund portion of wool tax to clarify the timing of the payment of the refund and to provide a means of making inspections to ensure that the provisions of the Act relating to refunds are being complied with. </PARA>
<PARA> Additionally, the Bill provides for inspections to be made for registration purposes of wool sampling sites, showfloors or testing laboratories involved in the export wool trade. The registrations, which are effected under the Wool Marketing Regulations, assist in ensuring that wool which is exported meets certain quality standards. </PARA>
<PARA> The final amendments to the Wool Marketing Act covered by this Bill relate to the consequential amendments arising from the repeal of the Commonwealth Functions (Statutes Review) Act 1981 under the schedule of the Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> Turning to the Bass Strait Freight Adjustment Levy Act 1984, the Bass Strait Freight Adjustment Levy Collection Act 1984, the Bass Strait Freight Adjustment Trust Fund Act 1984 and the Customs Tariff (Stand-by) Duty Act 1985. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill will repeal these Acts which gave effect to the import parity pricing policy and the Bass Strait Coastal Freight Adjustment Scheme which were terminated in 1987. The Acts were not terminated immediately to ensure that the oil companies discharged their obligations under the Bass Strait crude oil allocation scheme, which previously prescribed the amount of crude oil produced in the Bass Strait that Australia's oil companies were obliged to buy. The scheme has now been successfully concluded, and the Acts can be duly repealed. </PARA>
<PARA> There are three amendments to the Australian Meat and Live-stock Research and Development Corporation Act 1985. The first, to section 7, implements the original intention of the Act in relation to investment in that the Corporation will be empowered to invest surplus funds in specified classes of securities without the requirement to obtain prior Ministerial approval for each transaction. </PARA>
<PARA> Sub-paragraph 24 (1) (a) (ii) of the Act, relating to lodgment of notices of motion to be put before the Annual General Meeting, is amended to remove an inconsistency in the Act which resulted from amendments made in 1987. </PARA>
<PARA> The effect of the other amendments is to bring the provisions contained in the Act in respect of the remuneration and allowances paid to the Executive Director and staff of that organisation into line with those to apply to similar organisations under the Primary Industries and Energy Research and Development Bill. The amendments, which are being made at the request of the Australian Meat and Live-stock Research and Development Corporation, will provide greater flexibility for that organisation to recruit suitable senior staff. The terms and conditions of employment of the Executive Director will require the approval of the Minister. </PARA>
<PARA> The amendment of the Honey Levy Collection Act 1962 is aimed at simplifying procedures and reducing the cost to industry of collecting levies. Proceeds of the levies fund the operations of the Australian Honey Board and provide industry contributions to honey research programs. </PARA>
<PARA> The proposed amendments provide for monthly levy payers who believe that their liability in a particular year will be less than $100 a month for at least 7 months or $1200 for the full year to apply for exemption and instead pay annually. </PARA>
<PARA> These amendments are being introduced with the concurrence of industry. They will impose no additional cost to the Government but are expected to reduce the cost to industry of Levy collections. </PARA>
<PARA> The amendments to the Honey Marketing Act 1988, which establishes the Australian Honey Board; correct a spelling error and clarify the sunset provision of the Act. Subsection 62 (1) at present provides for the Act to cease to apply 6 years after its commencement. As some provisions of the Act commenced with Royal Assent on 11 May 1988 and the remainder become operative upon proclamation 1 January 1989, there is ambiguity as to cessation date. The amendment will clarify the Act by specifying 6 years from the date of Royal Assent. </PARA>
<PARA> The Soil Conservation (Financial Assistance) Act 1985 currently provides for a Committee with a maximum membership of seven, to make recommendations to the Minister with respect to priorities and strategies for activities by the Commonwealth relating to Soil Conservation and for matters relevant to the operation of the Act. </PARA>
<PARA> An increase in the membership of the Committee is required to successfully implement the change in operation of the National Soil Conservation program from a project to program based approach and also retain the range of expertise on the Committee at times when some members are unable to attend meetings. </PARA>
<PARA> The National Soil Conservation program has recently had its budget increased by more than 100 per cent to $23.4 million in 1989-90 with a commitment by the Government to provide a total of $260 million over the next ten years to the program. The program itself has been restructured so that funding is now provided under four sub-programs; community landcare support, research, major support and public awareness, education and training. </PARA>
<PARA> It is intended that the Committee will become more proactive in recommending projects for funding under the various sub-programs and accordingly an expansion to a twelve member Committee drawn from State Government, conservation, farmer, academic and local Government interests is proposed to replace the original seven member body. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn now to the Barley Research Levy Collection Act 1980, the Oilseeds Levy Collection Act 1977 and the Oilseeds Levy Act 1977. </PARA>
<PARA> The aim of the amendments is to standardise collection periods, and enable consolidation of return forms for levies collected under the various grain Levy legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> The Grains Council of Australia has indicated full support for the amendments, which should lead to savings in administrative effort for some Levy payers. These savings would arise by removing confusion caused by the present variations in collecting periods, and by reducing the number of returns to be submitted from a maximum of 20 to 4 per year. </PARA>
<PARA> The Wheat Marketing Act 1989 is being amended to correct an anomaly in regard to the Australian Wheat Board's borrowing powers. </PARA>
<PARA> As the Act now stands, the Wheat Board can fund advance payments to wheat growers only by borrowing money, whereas it can raise finance for any other purpose by either borrowing or by dealing with securities. </PARA>
<PARA> The Board raises the bulk of its monies for advance payments by dealing with securities under facilities which in some cases have been in place for a number of years. </PARA>
<PARA> There was never any intention to limit the Board's access to the full range of funding mechanisms offered by the market by having different wording in the relevant sections of the Act which relate to these separate financing activities. </PARA>
<PARA> The amendment also makes it clear that since a proportion of the finance raised to fund advance payments is underwritten by the Commonwealth, any payment to the Board to meet that liability must be used to repay those outstanding borrowings. </PARA>
<PARA> In addition, the amendments enable the research component of funds raised under the Wheat Industry Fund Levy Act 1989 to be transferred to the Wheat Research Trust Fund. </PARA>
<PARA> Under the Wheat Marketing Act 1989, the Grains Council of Australia determines an operative Levy rate each year for the purposes of the Wheat Research Trust Fund and the Wheat Industry Fund. </PARA>
<PARA> On the recommendation of the Grains Council regulations have been made setting the wheat Levy at 2.5 per cent for the 1989/90 season apportioning it such that 2 per cent will be used for the Wheat Industry Fund and 0.5 per cent will be used for the Wheat Research Trust Fund. </PARA>
<PARA> Amendments to the Rural Industries Research Act 1985 are now required to enable the portion of the Levy intended for research to be directed to the Wheat Research Trust Fund. In the absence of these amendments, funds levied from the wheat industry for the purposes of research are unavailable for use by the State research committees. This money will remain in consolidated revenue until a mechanism for its release is enacted. These amendments provide the necessary mechanism. </PARA>
<PARA> As the 1989-90 wheat harvest will not begin in earnest until October, very little money has been levied under the new arrangements. Only old season crop delivered after 1 July this year has so far been subject to the Levy. Nevertheless, to ensure that those funds which have already been levied under the new arrangements are made available for their intended purpose, the amendments will be effective from 1 July 1989. </PARA>
<PARA> This is not a retrospective tax. The money in question has already been raised. The amendment is only retrospective in that it will ensure that money which has already been levied for wheat research will be made available to the State Wheat Research Committees. </PARA>
<PARA> None of the proposed amendments have any significant financial impact. </PARA>
<PARA> I commend the Bill to honourable senators, and present the explanatory memorandum to this Bill. </PARA>
<PARA>PRIMARY INDUSTRIES AND ENERGY RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT BILL 1989</PARA>
<PARA> The purpose of this Bill is to provide for the establishment of Research and Development Corporations in the Primary Industries and Energy portfolio to replace the present Research Councils and Committees which administer the allocation of R&amp;D program funds. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill recognises the need for closer involvement of industry in determining the objectives of research and development. It will bring about improvements in the organisation and administration of research and development. These improvements will enable the expenditure of research funds to be conducted in a more autonomous and flexible manner. </PARA>
<PARA> As part of its overall review of science and technology policies, the Government has recognised the need for a more integrated approach to research policy across the primary and energy industries. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government proposes to make research and development in this area more efficient and effective while continuing to produce results relevant to industry needs. </PARA>
<PARA> The changes proposed are in three major areas-funding, co-ordination and evaluation of research efforts. The Government considers that there is a need for more research/industry interaction and the arrangements proposed in this Bill are designed to address this need. </PARA>
<PARA> This Bill builds on the outstanding record of this Government in encouraging research in the primary and energy industries. In May 1989, the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy and I made a statement entitled ``Research, Innovation and Competitiveness''. In this statement the Government reaffirmed its commitment to continued matching of industry levies for funding of R&amp;D in the rural industries up to 0.5 per cent of gross value of production. </PARA>
<PARA> This follows the proposals, contained in the Government's 1988 `Policies for Growth' Statement, that all rural industries participating in the arrangements should aim for a levy of 0.5 per cent of gross value of production by 1992. </PARA>
<PARA> The current Commonwealth contribution averages around 0.29 per cent of gross value of production over all industries currently receiving Commonwealth funds. In 1989-90, the combined value of Government/industry funding for rural industry research will be approximately $141m. Under the new arrangements, this amount should increase in 1990-91. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government will continue to fund soil, water and energy R&amp;D from appropriations. In 1989-90 funding in this area was approximately $25 million. The Government will also continue the coal research levy and introduce new arrangements for forestry R&amp;D. </PARA>
<PARA> The new arrangements contained in this Bill will enhance the capacity of Australia's primary and energy industries to innovate and adjust. In particular, the Bill sets out arrangements for the establishment of research and development corporations and the preferred structure for the administration of R&amp;D program funds. The Government considers that the corporate form of administration will give the best results because of the operating and financial flexibility it will bring. </PARA>
<PARA> The proposed R&amp;D corporations will provide strategic leadership to industry R&amp;D and act as a catalyst to stimulate R&amp;D interest within industry. They will take a pro-active role in identifying and filling gaps in the research effort. It is expected that the R&amp;D corporations, operating on a more commercial basis, will be able to expand the level of resources available for R&amp;D, improve the efficiency with which R&amp;D monies are spent and bring a focus to funding R&amp;D in high payoff areas. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government expects the new corporations to improve the adoption of research results. This should demonstrate the benefits of increased R&amp;D funding. In turn this should encourage industry to increase levies beyond the level which attracts matched grants from the Commonwealth. </PARA>
<PARA> Commonwealth contributions should ideally be seen as seed money to encourage industry contributions. The new R&amp;D corporations will have a key role in generating, as well as allocating, money for R&amp;D. </PARA>
<PARA> The objectives for R&amp;D corporations set out in the Bill are:</PARA>
<PARA>* increasing the economic, environmental and social benefits to the rural and wider community;</PARA>
<PARA>* promoting the sustainable use and management of natural resources;</PARA>
<PARA>* making more effective use of the community's resources and of the skills of the scientific community; and</PARA>
<PARA>* improving accountability for expenditure on primary industries R&amp;D. </PARA>
<PARA> In the Bill, the definition of research which R&amp;D corporations fund is deliberately wide. It covers any experimentation in science, technology or economics which is carried out with a view to improving production, processing, storage, transport and marketing in these industries. </PARA>
<PARA> It is envisaged that R&amp;D Corporations will initially be established in the dairy, grain, coal, natural resources and energy industries and in those existing Rural Industry Research Councils where the industry decides on an independent R&amp;D corporation. </PARA>
<PARA> Additionally, a Rural Industries Research and Development Corporation will be established to cover the present Australian Special Rural Research Council. This corporation will also cover those industries which decide not to form an R&amp;D corporation in their own right nor to merge with another R&amp;D corporation. </PARA>
<PARA> It is expected that most R&amp;D corporations will be established from 1 July 1990 under regulations in accordance with the provisions of this Bill, although a start before that date would be possible if an industry were willing to make the necessary arrangements. The Bill also contains provisions to cover the transitional period. The Minister seeks a contribution from those involved in the present administrative structures to ensure that there will be a smooth transition to incorporation. </PARA>
<PARA> The proposed R&amp;D corporations will be bodies corporate. They will have the power to:</PARA>
<PARA>* apply for patents or otherwise manage intellectual property;</PARA>
<PARA>* set up their own committees;</PARA>
<PARA>* employ staff and set terms and conditions for their employment;</PARA>
<PARA>* charge for services and information;</PARA>
<PARA>* enter into agreements or joint ventures for R&amp;D activities;</PARA>
<PARA>* act as trustee for money or property;</PARA>
<PARA>* accept gifts or bequests;</PARA>
<PARA>* acquire real or personal property; and</PARA>
<PARA>* form companies. </PARA>
<PARA> The corporations will also be able to borrow or raise money with the written approval of the Minister. </PARA>
<PARA> The corporations will be required to prepare R&amp;D plans in consultation with their industries or constituent groups. Each Board will establish the priorities and focus of its corporation's operations. The resultant plans will outline their objectives for a five year period and the strategies and policies they intend to adopt. </PARA>
<PARA> In addition, R&amp;D corporations will be required to prepare an operational plan for each financial year, consistent with the five year R&amp;D plan. This annual plan will specify the broad groupings of R&amp;D activities the corporation proposes to fund in that year, the likely administrative expenses and the expected receipts. The plans will be submitted to the Minister, who examines their consistency with the overall strategic direction proposed in the five year R&amp;D plans and approves them. </PARA>
<PARA> The R&amp;D corporations will be responsible to the Minister for carrying out these plans. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government considers that this process should enhance the corporations' capacity to direct research and development towards achieving industry-endorsed objectives. </PARA>
<PARA> In addition to co-ordinating and funding R&amp;D activities consistent with their annual operational plans, the corporations will monitor and evaluate those activities. They will not simply play a passive role in allocating money. Evaluation of projects will be done against an assessment of industry needs and objectives as embodied in the strategic plans. </PARA>
<PARA> The corporations are also charged with facilitating the dissemination, adoption and commercialisation of research results. This is a very important part of their function. It is through technology transfer that research results can be put into practice, and progress can be made towards greater innovation and commercialisation in industry. The Government expects these new arrangements to maximise the returns on the money spent. </PARA>
<PARA> Research and development is vital to the profitability of the primary and energy industries and increased concentration is needed to ensure that research results are not wasted. </PARA>
<PARA> The effective use of networking will play a major role in assisting R&amp;D corporations to increase their effectiveness and to encourage greater investment. </PARA>
<PARA> R&amp;D corporations will be responsible for developing close liaison with each other. This will do much to ensure informed decision making and collaboration between corporations. It will assist in reducing unnecessary duplication and provide flexibility. It may also result in joint funding of projects and sharing of results. </PARA>
<PARA> Although the R&amp;D corporations are designed to be autonomous, the Government also proposes that they should be accountable to the providers of the funds. </PARA>
<PARA> In addition to the five year strategic plans and annual operational plans, the corporations will be required to provide an Annual Report to be tabled in the Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> The corporations will be subject to the requirements of the Audit Act. </PARA>
<PARA> Annual Reports will address performance against the key elements identified in the strategic plans. Corporations will also be accountable to the industry, which supplies a significant proportion of their funds, through the presentation of Annual Reports or by way of an Annual General Meeting. Annual Reports should contain enough information to allow the industry to make a comprehensive assessment of the value of the R&amp;D activities undertaken. </PARA>
<PARA> Amendments to the Bill agreed in the other place allow for the Governor-General to consider the recommendations of industry representative organisations prior to determining through the regulations that the provisions regarding Annual General Meetings will apply to a particular R&amp;D corporation. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that there is a case for direct accountability to stakeholders in Annual General Meetings as the principal means of accountability for specific industries. However, I recognise that with other industries, accountability to the executive of organisations which represent stakeholders may be more appropriate. The Government will determine the particular accountability mechanism to apply for each R&amp;D corporation in agreement with the relevant industry. It does not intend to impose Annual General Meetings on industries. </PARA>
<PARA> Corporations will consist of nine directors, comprising a Chairperson, a government-nominated director, six directors nominated by an independent selection committee and an Executive Director. </PARA>
<PARA> The Chairperson will be selected by the Minister, as will the government director. The Minister will be looking for Chairpersons with strong leadership and strategic skills, experience in commercial management and an appreciation of the vital role of R&amp;D in enhancing industry performance. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government director will also be selected on the basis of expertise in R&amp;D management and experience and knowledge of Government policy processes. The continued Government involvement in these appointments reflects our desire to play a role commensurate with the Commonwealth financial contribution. </PARA>
<PARA> The Executive Director will be selected by the corporations. This person has a key role, being an ex officio director of the Board as well as the day-to-day manager of a corporation's operations. Corporations will also be empowered to employ professional staff on terms and conditions determined by the Boards. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill sets out arrangements for the constitution of independent selection committees designed to ensure the best available people are selected for appointment as directors, also on the basis of their expertise. This is a change from the previous arrangement where there was a common selection committee for all research councils. Separate selection committees for each industry will allow the relevant industry to have a greater influence in the selection process. </PARA>
<PARA> These selection committees will be set up on an ``ad hoc'' basis. The Minister will appoint the Presiding Member and he/she will have the responsibility of establishing a committee when a selection task arises. The committee will be disbanded when the selection process has been completed. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee will comprise three to six persons nominated by the dominant industry organisations. In those cases where the corporation is funded predominantly from appropriations, the Minister will have the opportunity to appoint persons of his/her choosing to the selection committee. </PARA>
<PARA> One advantage of ad hoc selection committees is that they can be tailored to suit immediate needs, both in numbers and expertise. A specific example is scientific expertise which will be of importance to Selection Committees for all corporations. The Minister will write to the industries concerned about the importance of scientific representation on the Selection Committees and the need to take this into account in making their nominations. </PARA>
<PARA> Since selection committees will be formed only when required, it is considered appropriate that members of selection committees should themselves be eligible for consideration as Board directors in any subsequent selection process. </PARA>
<PARA> To safeguard against conflicts of interests, however, members of the Executives of industry bodies will not be eligible for nomination as Board directors. </PARA>
<PARA> Selection committees will be required to nominate persons for appointment to R&amp;D corporations on the basis of expertise in one or more of the fields of:</PARA>
<PARA>* commodity production;</PARA>
<PARA>* processing or marketing;</PARA>
<PARA>* natural resource conservation or management;</PARA>
<PARA>* science, technology and technology transfer;</PARA>
<PARA>* environmental and ecological matters;</PARA>
<PARA>* economics;</PARA>
<PARA>* administration of R&amp;D; and</PARA>
<PARA>* finance or business management. </PARA>
<PARA> While it is expected that Boards should be nominated on the basis of achieving a balance of skills it is not expected that all criteria must be met for every Board. I do, however, see that in striking a balance Selection Committees will maintain the need for certain specific expertise areas to be covered such as scientific expertise. </PARA>
<PARA> I now turn to the Rural Industries R&amp;D Corporation which will operate under different arrangements. </PARA>
<PARA> The Rural Industries R&amp;D Corporation will incorporate the present Australian Special Rural Research Fund which funds small industry, multi-industry and national interest R&amp;D for rural industries. The Rural Industries R&amp;D Corporation will essentially be established on the same footing as other corporations under the legislation. In addition, it will provide a facility for incorporating Councils for those industries which have decided not to opt for a separate R&amp;D corporation nor to merge with another corporation. </PARA>
<PARA> Where this occurs, special arrangements will be introduced to ensure that those councils and their industries are not disadvantaged by incorporation as an R&amp;D Council within the Rural Industries R&amp;D Corporation. </PARA>
<PARA> The R&amp;D Councils established under the Rural Industries R&amp;D Corporation will control their own funds, continue to have a separate selection process and be responsible for their own strategic plans and annual reports. </PARA>
<PARA> Specifically, R&amp;D Councils' responsibilities will include, as for corporations, the preparation of five year strategic R&amp;D plans in consultation with their industries, and annual operational plans designed to focus their activities around industry-endorsed objectives. Again, as for corporations, they will be required to fund and monitor research, facilitate the dissemination, adoption and commercialisation of results of research and report annually to the Minister on their activities. </PARA>
<PARA> R&amp;D Councils will be subject to the requirements of the Audit Act and will be accountable to their representative organisations. The Chairperson will be required to meet with the Executive of representative organisations on an annual basis. </PARA>
<PARA> Councils, however, will not be bodies corporate and will not be empowered to borrow funds, enter into agreements, take out patents, form companies and so on. But they will, as part of the Rural Industries R&amp;D Corporation, be able to call on it to perform such functions on their behalf. </PARA>
<PARA> R&amp;D councils will not be required to contribute to the Rural Industries R&amp;D Corporation overheads and costs associated with the Board of the corporation. They will only have to meet the cost, on a user pays basis for services requested by them for the corporation to perform or which they have a statutory obligation to meet, that is, entering into agreements and paying their audit fees. </PARA>
<PARA> R&amp;D Councils will be established on the same basis as research councils under the present Rural Industries Research Act. They will consist of up to nine members: a Chairperson, a government member and three to seven other members. The Chairpersons and government members will be selected by the Minister and the other members will be selected by an independent selection committee. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister will appoint the Chairperson and one member, on the basis of scientific expertise, as a core group to the selection committee. When selections are to be made for the Rural Industry R&amp;D Corporation or the Councils, three nominees from the representative organisation will be appointed to join the core group. </PARA>
<PARA> The measures set out in this Bill will involve Commonwealth outlays of a one-off nature at the time of establishment of each corporation. This relates to the need to transfer reserves of present funds to the new R&amp;D corporations. On present indications amounts of approximately $3.5m-4m in 1989/90 and approximately $76m in future years are indicated. The Minister for Finance, in consultation with the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, will determine the exact timing of the transfer of these reserves. Costs for establishing new R&amp;D corporations will be met from current program funds. </PARA>
<PARA> Administration matters will be transferred from the Department of Primary Industries and Energy to the R&amp;D corporations, but it is not expected that this will result in higher costs to industry, as administrative costs are already cost-recovered from Research Council funds. </PARA>
<PARA> There may, in fact, be cost savings to industry in that the corporations will be free to share staff and premises, if they consider this appropriate, and can locate in whatever part of the country they consider most beneficial. </PARA>
<PARA> The ability to undertake fund raising beyond the levy collection process will also increase their capacity to offset such costs. The Commonwealth will, of course, continue to contribute to a proportion of administrative costs in the rural sector by virtue of the 50 per cent matching of levies. </PARA>
<PARA> The major impact of the Bill will be in providing flexibility and autonomy to the administration of research and development and in providing industry with a greater influence on the objectives towards which research and development expenditure is directed. The Government considers that this is necessary if industry is to recognise the value of research and development expenditure and invest more in this area. This is vital if our primary and energy industries are to remain competitive and profitable in a rapidly changing world. </PARA>
<PARA> I commend the Bill to Honourable Senators and present the Explanatory Memorandum. </PARA>

<PARA> That these Bills be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>I seek leave to have the second reading speeches incorporated in Hansard. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The speeches read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA>STATES GRANTS (SCHOOLS ASSISTANCE) AMENDMENT BILL (No. 2) 1989</PARA>
<PARA> The main purposes of this Bill are to amend the States Grants (Schools Assistance) Act 1988 to implement decisions in the recent Budget on Commonwealth programs for schools in 1990 and to supplement for cost increases grants already appropriated for schools programs for 1989. </PARA>
<PARA> As foreshadowed in the Governments Rural Statement in April 1989, there are also changes to improve the educational access of rural students. This Bill provides for government and non-government organisations operating hostels providing accommodation for rural students to apply for funding under the general element of the Capital Grants Program. It also provides for the establishment of a Rural Hostels Program to provide assistance to such hostels with an initial allocation in 1990 of $1 million. </PARA>
<PARA> Eligibility under the New Arrivals Element of the English as a Second Language Program is also being broadened. This Bill provides that students enrolling in the first formal year of primary school will be eligible for New Arrivals funding where they arrived in Australia up to eighteen months previously. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill also amends the definition of full fee paying overseas student so that it applies to primary as well as secondary students. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill appropriates an estimated $2,212 million for schools programs in 1990, and provides for additional funds for 1989 programs in line with cost supplementation arrangements to bring total funding for 1989 programs to an estimated $2,055 million. </PARA>
<PARA> I commend the Bill to the Senate and present the explanatory memorandum to this Bill. </PARA>
<PARA>HIGHER EDUCATION FUNDING AMENDMENT BILL (No. 2) 1989</PARA>
<PARA> The purpose of the Bill is to amend the Higher Education Funding Act which provides funding for 1989-91 triennium. The Bill provides funding for higher education institutions for 1992 amounting to $2865 million in accordance with the rolling triennial funding arrangements. It takes account of the Government decision to provide funding of $34 million for an additional 4000 intakes in 1992 and additional funding for capital projects in 1992 to bring the total annual funding for major works in 1992 to $198 million. These measures honour the Government's commitment announced in the White Paper for the continued expansion of higher education to provide for a more highly skilled and educated Australian community. </PARA>
<PARA> These funds will allow the Government to make early decisions on new capital projects to commence in 1992 in order to facilitate the proper planning of these developments. Many of these capital projects will take into account mergers which have occurred or are occurring in many parts of the country. </PARA>
<PARA> In relation to one of those mergers, that between the University of Western Australia and Murdoch University, I take the opportunity to announce a major new development which will become possible should the merger be given legislative effect. Agriculture is a vital area of study for Western Australia but the facilities at the Crawley campus have for some time been inadequate. The merger provides the opportunity for agriculture to be relocated to the Murdoch campus which already offers veterinary science as well as having developed a very strong capacity in the physical and biological sciences. This is one of the earliest examples of the advantages which can arise from mergers. To assist with the planning for this development the Government will fund the relocation of agriculture, currently estimated to cost $17 million, commencing in 1992 and will also fund other capital projects consistent with the new university's priorities. </PARA>
<PARA> Increased funding is being provided for 1990 and 1991 amounting to some $13 million in accordance with the Government's cost supplementation arrangements. The Bill also provides for the incorporation of Australian Research Council programs into the Act in line with the Government's decision to fund these programs on a rolling triennial basis. It includes additional amounts for new research initiatives of $150 million over the 1990-92 triennium announced by the Government in its Science and Technology statement in May 1989. </PARA>
<PARA> I present the Explanatory Memorandum and commend the Bill to the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA>STUDENT ASSISTANCE AMENDMENT (No. 2) BILL 1989</PARA>
<PARA> The Student Assistance Amendment (No. 2) Bill seeks to amend the Student Assistance Act 1973, which provides the legislative basis for AUSTUDY and the Postgraduate Awards Scheme, to enhance the debt recovery regime for outstanding student assistance debts. It contains two main measures. </PARA>
<PARA> First, it will extend the application of existing provisions of the Student Assistance Act relating to the prevention of fraud and the recovery of overpayments; the provisions concern matters such as garnishee action to recover debts incurred under the Act and the penalties for false statements in connection with applications made under the Act. The provisions will be extended to apply to the non-legislated student assistance schemes, namely the Assistance for Isolated Children, ABSTUDY and Aboriginal Overseas Study Awards Schemes. To further streamline processing debts under these schemes, action to waive or write off such debts will be taken under the Student Assistance Act, rather than by the exercise of a delegation under the Audit Act as is currently the case. </PARA>
<PARA> Second, the Bill provides that interest is to become payable on outstanding debts, whether incurred under AUSTUDY or Postgraduate Awards or under one of the non-legislated schemes. Interest will commence three months after a debtor has been advised of the debt. However, provision is made for the Department to approve an interest-free period in cases of financial hardship, particularly where the debtor has come to an arrangement to repay the debt by instalments. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill would apply simple interest accruing on a daily basis. The regulations will specify a formula giving a commercially comparable rate of interest. </PARA>
<PARA> The intention is that the recovery of student assistance debts should proceed in a manner comparable to normal commercial practice. This must include the application of a commercially comparable rate of interest so that debtors do not effectively have an interest-free loan from the public purse. Having said this, I should perhaps add that the introduction of an interest provision will affect only recalcitrant debtors who do not settle their debts or come to some arrangement with the Department within three months of having been advised of the debt. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill will also enable Ministerial guidelines to be set giving guidance in the exercise of various administrative powers under the Student Assistance Act. Action will be taken as soon as possible to set guidelines relating to the waiver, writing off and recovery by instalments of overpayments, and to the approval of interest-free periods. In view of the proposed guidelines, the Bill seeks to extend the range of officers to whom Ministerial powers under the Act may be delegated. </PARA>
<PARA> A significant number of amendments have been made to the Student Assistance Act since its enactment over sixteen years ago, and the Bill therefore proposes to renumber the Act so that all provisions will now be numbered sequentially. </PARA>
<PARA> I have referred to the Postgraduate Awards Scheme as coming under the Student Assistance Act. The Government is significantly improving the research component of this scheme by injecting more money and devolving the administration of research awards to individual institutions. As a result of the devolution, Postgraduate Research Awards are ceasing to be administered under the Student Assistance Act. </PARA>
<PARA> I come now to the financial impact of the proposed measures. It is estimated that the Bill will result in increased debt recovery of approximately $5m over the two years 1990-91 and 1991-92. The effect may then lessen, reflecting the resolution of existing debts and the introduction of more effective fraud control. </PARA>
<PARA> I would add that the significance of the interest provision is essentially as a deterrent. The actual amount to be collected by way of interest on outstanding debts is estimated to be of the order of $100 000 a year. </PARA>
<PARA> In conclusion, I would emphasise that the changes contained in this Bill are an integral part of an overall package of measures addressing the question of student assistance fraud. This package also includes front-end controls and other administrative measures. An important effect of the package will be an increased awareness of the Commonwealth's determination to address the problems of fraud and debt recovery in the area of student assistance. </PARA>
<PARA> I present the explanatory memorandum to this Bill and commend the Bill to the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA>STATES GRANTS (TAFE ASSISTANCE) BILL 1989</PARA>
<PARA> The States Grants (TAFE Assistance) Bill 1989 gives effect to the Government's Budget decisions on Commonwealth assistance for technical and further education, as announced in TAFE 1990 Commonwealth Programs and Priorities which Mr Dawkins released in August 1989. </PARA>
<PARA> The purpose of the Bill is to provide the legislative basis for the distribution of Commonwealth funds for technical and further education in the States and Territories for 1990. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill provides $328.896 million for technical and further education for 1990. </PARA>
<PARA> I present the explanatory memorandum to this Bill and commend the Bill to the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA>OVERSEAS STUDENTS CHARGE AMENDMENT BILL 1989</PARA>
<PARA> The purpose of this Bill is to amend the Overseas Students Charge Act 1979 to fix the amounts of the charges payable under the Act for the 1990 academic year. The amounts are shown in the Bill. The charges are payable by overseas students enrolled in Australian education institutions under the subsidised program to which the Act relates. </PARA>
<PARA> I present the explanatory memorandum to this Bill and commend the Bill to the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA>ABORIGINAL EDUCATION (SUPPLEMENTARY ASSISTANCE) BILL 1989</PARA>
<PARA> The Aboriginal Education (Supplementary Assistance) Bill 1989 gives effect to the Government's Budget decision to endorse a National Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Education Policy. The Policy is a long-term commitment towards the attainment of equity for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people in access to, participation in and outcomes from education. </PARA>
<PARA> The National Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Education Policy is a concerted effort to address the educational needs of Aboriginal people, by cooperatively directing the strategies of the Commonwealth, the States and Territories, non-government education authorities and educational institutions, to achieving:</PARA>
<PARA>* involvement of Aboriginal people in educational decision making</PARA>
<PARA>* equality of access to educational services</PARA>
<PARA>* equitable and appropriate educational outcomes</PARA>
<PARA> The purpose of the Bill is to enable the Minister for Employment, Education and Training to enter into bilateral agreements with State and Territory governments, higher education institutions, non-government school systems and other institutions over objectives, strategies, resources and joint monitoring arrangements consistent with the National Policy. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill will provide a legislative basis for a consolidated program and funding approach that is supplementary to mainstream Commonwealth education funding through an Aboriginal Education Strategic Initiatives Program. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has allocated a total of $266.0 million as its commitment to the National Policy over the next 3 years. Through standing appropriations, the Bill provides $236.3 million of the above amount for the Aboriginal education over the three year period 1990-92. </PARA>
<PARA> I commend the Bill to the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The speeches read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA>CRIMES LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (No. 2) 1989</PARA>
<PARA> The primary purpose of this Bill is to review the Commonwealth sentencing legislation and the laws governing federal offenders found unfit to be tried or not guilty on the grounds of mental illness. In addition, the Bill makes minor amendments to the Cash Transaction Reports Act 1988, the National Crime Authority Act 1984 and Part VIIC of the Crimes Act 1914 (spent convictions). </PARA>
<PARA> Although the Crimes Act 1914 was amended in 1982 following the Australian Law Reform Commission's Interim Report on Sentencing (ALRC 15) to require that imprisonment be the punishment of last resort, (except for serious federal offences) and make State and Territory alternatives to imprisonment, such as community service orders, available to federal offenders for the first time, this Bill represents the first significant change to Commonwealth sentencing law since the Commonwealth Prisoners Act 1967 was enacted over 20 years ago. </PARA>
<PARA> The number of federal offenders in custody has been steadily growing from 244 out of a total prison population of 10,621 on 1 May 1985 to 517 out of 12,429 on 1 July 1989. These offenders serve their sentences in State gaols by virtue of s.120 of the Constitution and are subject to the same prison regime as State or Territory prisoners. This system can only operate effectively because of the significant assistance and cooperation that I and my Department receive from the officers of the State and Territory Corrective Services Departments or Commissions, on a range of matters including the calculation of sentences and the preparation of parole reports and such like. That assistance is greatly appreciated. </PARA>
<PARA> Because of the close association of federal and State/Territory prisoners, it has been the policy of successive Commonwealth Governments to maintain intra-State parity of treatment for federal offenders. The current Commonwealth legislation applies State and Territory laws relating to the fixing of non-parole periods to federal sentences. However, the increasing divergence of, and frequent changes, both administrative and statutory, to State and Territory legislation, have resulted in increasing use of administrative measures to ensure that federal offenders are not disadvantaged. </PARA>
<PARA> In late 1988, the final Report of the Australian Law Reform Commission on Sentencing (ALRC 44) was tabled in Parliament. It is therefore timely that further and more significant amendments be made. </PARA>
<PARA> The reform and review of the sentencing legislation to ensure its fairness, effectiveness and to ensure community confidence in the ability of the criminal justice system to deal with offenders, is an important part of the Government's fight against crime particularly organised crime. The new sentencing proposals are intended to complement the other major legislative initiatives by the Government in this area, including the Proceeds of Crime Act 1987, the Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters Act 1987, the Extradition Act 1988, the Cash Transaction Reports Act 1988, the 1989 amendments to the Australian Federal Police Act 1979 to enable superannuation to be forfeited where a police officer is convicted of a corruption offence and the Crimes (Superannuation Benefits) Bill 1989. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government believes that there is a need for a separate Commonwealth sentencing regime, to ensure that federal offenders are not disadvantaged because of the complex legal problems that may arise in a federal system. This Bill provides a sentencing regime for federal offenders which pursues the aims of certainty and fairness. </PARA>
<PARA> The requirement that imprisonment be the punishment of last resort has been strengthened. But, where a court determines that a sentence of imprisonment is the appropriate penalty, that sentence will be certain. The Bill provides that where a federal offender is sentenced to imprisonment, if the court fixes a non-parole period or makes an order for release on recognizance (a form of bond), this is the period that the person will actually serve in custody before parole eligibility arises, or the person becomes eligible to be released on recognizance. Such periods will not be reduced by remissions from the non-parole or pre-release periods. </PARA>
<PARA> Great care has been taken to ensure that establishing certainty in sentencing does not result in harsher or longer prison terms. In those States where remissions reduce State non-parole periods, the Bill specifically provides that a federal offender is to have his or her non-parole adjusted to take into account that it will not be reduced by remissions. The Bill requires that the court explain to the person that the sentence of imprisonment is made up of a period to be served in custody, and a period in the community, subject to conditions either on parole or on recognizance. </PARA>
<PARA> As federal offenders are persons who have been convicted of offences against Commonwealth law, for example, the importation of narcotic drugs, money laundering and fraud on the Commonwealth, they will include principals in large scale operations as well as persons who have played minor roles in such offences or persons who have committed relatively minor offences. Federal sentencing legislation therefore needs to provide a range of sanctions to enable the sentencing court to choose the sentence that is appropriate and proportionate to the offence. Although this Bill deals mainly with federal offenders who are sentenced to imprisonment it also ensures that a greater range of alternatives to imprisonment is available to persons convicted of federal offences. </PARA>
<PARA> In addition to these important matters, this Bill also provides an innovative and humanitarian regime to deal with the difficult and frequently overlooked problem of mentally ill and intellectually disabled persons who come into contact with the criminal justice system. The existing legislation only provides limited options to deal with a person who has been charged with an indictable federal offence where there is a finding of unfitness to be tried or not guilty on the grounds of mental illness. One of the most serious criticisms of the existing law is that a person may be kept in custody indefinitely, without any statutory requirement that his/her case be reviewed. Moreover, a person found unfit to be tried is kept in custody indefinitely without even a prima facie case being established that he/she committed the alleged offence. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill provides a new regime for dealing with persons who are found unfit to plead, or unfit to be tried or not guilty on the grounds of mental illness. Sentencing courts are also being given additional options for persons who are mentally ill or intellectually disabled. The Bill gives magistrates courts greatly increased options when dealing with cases summarily. Hospital orders will be available in lieu of imprisonment, where mental illness has contributed to the commission of serious offences. Special bonds will also be available-psychiatric probation orders (for mentally ill offenders) and program probation orders for intellectually disabled offenders. The new sentencing options of hospital orders and bonds give effect to the Australian Law Reform Commission's recommendations. </PARA>
<PARA>Contents of Bill</PARA>
<PARA> A detailed explanation of the contents of the Bill is contained in the Explanatory Memorandum. Accordingly, Mr President, I wish only to refer to the more important features of the Bill:</PARA>
<PARA>- The Bill repeals the Commonwealth Prisoners Act 1967 and amends the Crimes Act 1914 to consolidate all the general sentencing legislation in that Act. </PARA>
<PARA>- Remissions that currently reduce the non-parole periods of federal sentences in some States will not apply to sentences imposed after commencement (except remissions granted for prison warders's strikes). In those States where remissions off the non-parole period apply, the courts are specifically instructed to take account of the fact that they will not apply to federal offenders and to adjust the non-parole period accordingly. </PARA>
<PARA>- Remissions that reduce the total (head) sentence will continue to apply, if available under State law. In those States where remissions on the head sentence are not available (only NSW at present), the courts are specifically required to take this into account, so that federal offenders are not serving longer sentences because of the abolition of remission for State prisoners. </PARA>
<PARA>- Federal offenders sentenced to imprisonment prior to the commencement of the Bill, will continue to have their non-parole periods reduced by remissions available under State or Territory legislation. </PARA>
<PARA>- The new legislation provides for a federal scheme for setting non-parole periods (instead of relying on State/Territory law). A non-parole period may only be set where the sentence is greater than 3 years. </PARA>
<PARA>- Where the sentence is 3 years or less, and the court considers that the person should be released from prison subject to the conditions then, at the time of sentencing, the court may make an order for the person's release on recognizance (a bond subject to court imposed conditions relating to good behaviour and supervision, etc). </PARA>
<PARA>- Consistent with the Government's view that there should be certainty in sentencing, the Bill provides that a court sentencing a federal offender to a life sentence, may fix a non-parole period. A federal offender serving a life sentence with no non-parole period at the time this legislation comes into force, may apply to a court to have a non-parole period fixed. It is not mandatory that a court fix a non-parole period for a life sentence. </PARA>
<PARA>- Where the sentence is greater than 3 years but less than 10 years and a non-parole period is specified, release on parole is to be automatic on completion of the imprisonment period with the Attorney-General setting conditions, where appropriate. </PARA>
<PARA>- If the sentence is greater than 10 years (including a life sentence where a non-parole period is set), there is a presumption in favour of release on parole upon completion of the non-parole period. However, in these cases the Attorney-General has a discretion to defer release on parole. Where release on parole is deferred the Attorney-General must provide the prisoner with reasons for the deferral. </PARA>
<PARA>- The Bill retains the ``release on licence'' mechanism to permit early release where a prisoner establishes exceptional circumstances. </PARA>
<PARA>- The releasing authority for parolees and licencees will be the Attorney-General (instead of the Governor-General). </PARA>
<PARA>- Procedures for the revocation of parole orders and licences have been revised. </PARA>
<PARA>- The Bill provides that State or Territory pre-release schemes may be prescribed, subject to eligibility conditions. These schemes enable select State or Territory prisoners to be released shortly before a non-parole period is served or a sentence has been served. Prisoners are subject to strict conditions and supervision while on these schemes. Any regulations prescribing a scheme will, of course, be subject to s.48 of the Acts Interpretation Act 1901, which permits a regulation to be disallowed by either House of Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA>- The Bill provides a new regime where a person, charged on indictment with a federal offence, is found unfit to plead or be tried, or is found not guilty on the grounds of mental illness. </PARA>
<PARA>- These changes, for persons found unfit to be tried, include procedures for determining whether the prosecution has established a prima facie case, and for establishing the person's likely fitness to stand trial within 12 months. Where a court finds the person will not become fit to be tried the person may be released on a bond or placed in custody for a period not exceeding the maximum penalty for the offence</PARA>
<PARA>- If a jury finds a person not guilty on the grounds of mental illness the court may either release the person with or without conditions or make an order for his/her detention in custody for a period not exceeding the maximum penalty for the offence</PARA>
<PARA>- In cases where a person is ordered to be held in custody either because he/she is not fit to be tried or has been found not guilty on the grounds of mental illness, the Bill, provides regular review of the detention and for his/her release by the Attorney-General. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill also contains a number of minor amendments to the Cash Transaction Reports Act 1988, the National Crime Authority Act 1984, and the Crimes Act 1914. </PARA>
<PARA> The substantive thrust of the Cash Transaction Reports Act is contained in provisions of the Act that are not yet in force. Members will no doubt appreciate that it has taken time to establish the Cash Transaction Reports Agency, which is pivotal to the operation of the legislation. I am pleased to inform the House that the Agency is now in place and the substantive provisions of the Act are to come into force progressively from 1 January 1990. The staff of the Agency have been involved in extensive liaison and consultation with financial institutions, other cash dealers affected by the Act and law enforcement agencies. As a result of this process it became clear that the Act required fine tuning. The amendments contained in this Bill will greatly enhance the implementation process and the effectiveness of the legislation. Certain amendments, such as that removing the requirement for an identification reference to be a statutory declaration, and the amendments to the account verification provisions, have been made following representations from financial institutions. </PARA>
<PARA> The present requirements of the CTR Act in relation to account verification are contained in sections 18 to 21 of the CTR Act. Briefly, these sections require that a signatory shall produce a verification statement including an identification reference from an acceptable referee. The amendments will supplement this procedure by enabling a further, alternative procedure to be used, in place of the identification reference, to verify the identity of the signatory to an account with certain cash dealers. The structure of the amendments to implement this change is as follows:</PARA>
<PARA>- Firstly, provision is made for the designation of certain cash dealers as ``identifying cash dealers''. Cash dealers will be able to apply to the Director of the Cash Transaction Reports Agency for approval as an identifying cash dealer upon giving an undertaking to comply with stringent verification procedures;</PARA>
<PARA>- Secondly, where a person wishes to become a signatory to an account with an identifying cash dealer a verification statement in relation to an account need not be accompanied by an identification reference under section 21. Where no identification reference is produced the cash dealer must verify the identity of the signatory by using the new prescribed identification method under subsection 20 (8);</PARA>
<PARA>- Thirdly, the proposed alternative system of account verification, which will require the cash dealer to conduct certain inquiries to verify the signatory's identity, will be detailed in regulations to be made under subsection 20 (8). Those regulations will be prepared in consultation with cash dealers and law enforcement agencies, as well as the Cash Transaction Reports Agency. Also, the Attorney-General has undertaken to provide the Shadow Attorney-General with a draft of the regulations under subsection 20 (8) before they are made. </PARA>
<PARA> It is envisaged that the regulations will prescribe twelve or so separate checks to be undertaken by the cash dealer. It is anticipated that the checks will include, for example, the examination of a primary identification document, an electoral roll search and an employer check. These checks will be directed at verifying the name, address and date of birth of the signatory. The identifying cash dealer will be required to carry out a certain minimum number of checks. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course it may occur that anomalies will be detected by this verification process. If the anomaly is such as to give the cash dealer reasonable grounds to suspect that information held by the cash dealer concerning the transaction may be relevant to the investigation of tax evasion, or one of the other matters mentioned at paragraph 16 (1) (b) of the CTR Act, eg opening or operating an account in a false name, then the cash dealer will be obliged to report the anomaly as a suspect transaction under section 16. </PARA>
<PARA> The verification may, on balance, verify the identity of the signatory whilst also giving rise to the sort of suspicion referred to in section 16. For example, the process may well verify that the signatory is in fact who he or she claims to be but the circumstances as a whole may also indicate that the person may be evading taxation or engaging in other unlawful activity. In such a case the account would be unblocked but a suspect transaction report under section 16 would also be lodged with the Cash Transaction Reports Agency. </PARA>
<PARA> The major difference between the existing requirement that a signatory produce an identification reference, and the proposed alternative system, is that the existing requirement places the responsibility for the verification of identity upon the signatory whereas the new system will place that responsibility upon the cash dealer. This will introduce a beneficial degree of flexibility into the critical process of account verification, particularly for those cash dealers who do not have an extensive branch network throughout Australia to facilitate access by customers. </PARA>
<PARA> In conclusion I would say that the amendments to the CTR Act meet the concerns of many cash dealers about the possible unintended market effects of the existing requirements by offering flexibility both to cash dealers and to the signatories of accounts, whilst at the same time maintaining or enhancing the integrity of the verification process from the law enforcement perspective. </PARA>
<PARA> The balance of the amendments to the Act, and those to the other Acts, are minor and self-explanatory. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr President, those are the major features of the Crimes Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1989. </PARA>
<PARA>Financial Impact Statement</PARA>
<PARA> There is not expected to be any significant increase in costs or expenditure from the measures proposed in this Bill. In fact, savings in administration costs are anticipated from the abolition of remissions on non-parole periods and the introduction of automatic parole. </PARA>
<PARA> I commend the Bill to the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA>UNIVERSITY OF CANBERRA BILL 1989</PARA>
<PARA> The purpose of the University of Canberra Bill is to establish a University of Canberra under the sponsorship of Monash University to replace the Canberra College of Advanced Education. </PARA>
<PARA> Following the release of the White Paper in July 1988 which provided the blue print for wide-ranging reforms in higher education, a Steering Committee chaired by the former Chairman of the Commonwealth Tertiary Education Commission, Mr Hudson, was established to advise on the amalgamation of the three Canberra higher education institutions. Acting on the recommendations of the Steering Committee, the Government introduced the Australian National University Bill 1988 into Parliament in November 1988. Subsequently, the Government agreed to a request from the incoming ACT government to defer consideration of the Bill to enable the new Assembly to provide advice on the structure of higher education in the Territory. A select committee of the ACT Assembly reported in July 1989 recommending that the amalgamation of the three institutions not proceed at this stage but that a University of Canberra be established to replace the Canberra College of Advanced Education. </PARA>
<PARA> The University will be established under the sponsorship of Monash University in accordance with an agreement between the two institutions. The Report of the Task Force on Amalgamations in Higher Education chaired by the Chairman of the Higher Education Council, Dr Ramsey, released in April 1989 proposed that the sponsorship of former institutions in the advanced education sector by existing universities is an appropriate model for the development of these institutions as full members of the Unified National System. Institutions in other States have adopted this model. The Government recognises that there is no single model that is applicable for achieving its objectives of a stronger and more viable higher education system. The establishment of the University of Canberra represents a positive step in the development of higher education in the ACT. </PARA>
<PARA> The agreement provides for the participation of Monash University in a wide range of activities undertaken by the new University. The sponsoring institution will be represented on the Council and the Academic Board as well as on various committees of the University. Development of graduate programs and appointment of professorial and equivalent staff will be subject to approval by Monash University during the sponsorship period. The two institutions will promote academic articulation across a range of activities, including student and staff exchanges, integrated professional awards, joint doctoral supervision and joint research projects. Particular consideration will be given to the needs of the ACT community. The agreement will operate for an initial period of three years. It is envisaged that the sponsorship arrangements will be subject to external review at the end of this period. The funding for the University of Canberra will be assessed on the same basis as all higher education institutions. The Government will provide funding of $300 000 to Monash University over the next three years to contribute towards the costs incurred in the sponsorship arrangement. </PARA>
<PARA> I present the Explanatory Memorandum and commend the Bill to the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA>TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT BILL (No. 4) 1989</PARA>
<PARA> Mr President, this Bill amends the taxation laws in a number of respects. </PARA>
<PARA> It will significantly broaden the income tax concession for research and development project expenditure incurred after 20 November 1987, and extend its availability for a further four years with deductions being allowed at the 150 per cent rate to 30 June 1993 and at 125 per cent until 30 June 1995. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill will also modify the imputation provisions as they relate to 1988-89 assessments received by companies after 18 January 1989 and before 1 July 1989. </PARA>
<PARA> Also included in the Bill is an exemption from income tax for the pay and allowances of Australian Defence Force personnel while on duty in Namibia. </PARA>
<PARA> The capital gains provisions will be amended to enable a taxpayer to elect that the grant of an eligible long term lease or sublease of land will be treated as a disposal of the underlying freehold or leasehold interest in the land. </PARA>
<PARA> An income tax deduction is being provided for expenses incurred in contesting an election for membership of the Legislative Assembly for the Australian Capital Territory. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill will terminate, with effect from 1 July 1991, the deduction for certain subscription monies paid in respect of initial shares in licensed Management and Investment Companies. </PARA>
<PARA> Some modifications are being made to the substantiation rules that apply where an employee receives transport allowances under an industrial award. </PARA>
<PARA> Minor amendments to the employer provisions of the tax file number arrangements are also proposed. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill will also amend the sales tax law to exempt shipping containers of a kind used in containerised cargo transportation systems. </PARA>
<PARA> The prosecution provisions of the taxation laws will be amended to permit the Commissioner of Taxation to apply to a court of summary jurisdiction to have a conviction or order set aside and the matter reheard to correct situations of hardship affecting taxpayers. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, the Bill makes some minor technical amendments to the tax laws. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn now to a more detailed discussion of these measures. </PARA>
<PARA>Research and Development Activities</PARA>
<PARA> As an integral part of the strategy contained in the Government's Science Statement that was tabled in the Parliament on 8 May 1989, the company tax concession for industry investment in research and development activities is to be extended by this Bill for a further period of four years. Already in place until 1991, the 150 per cent deduction scheme will be extended to 30 June 1993, and a 125 per cent scheme will operate until 30 June 1995. The cost of the extension is estimated at $640 million over the years concerned. </PARA>
<PARA> Consistent with this extension, the present deduction for expenditure on scientific research will now terminate in 1995, instead of 1991. The Bill will also give effect to a number of measures which will in the interim significantly broaden the scope of the concession. These measures, which flow from a technical review of the concession, were announced on 20 November 1987 and will generally apply after that date. </PARA>
<PARA> A company that receives a government grant or recoupment in respect of expenditure on a research and development project will no longer suffer a total loss of the deduction entitlements. Instead, a formula is being introduced to reduce the deduction otherwise allowable by reference to the grant or recoupment. </PARA>
<PARA> A further widening of the concession will allow a company to share with others plant and equipment used exclusively for research and development activities without putting the deduction in jeopardy which is the position under the present law. </PARA>
<PARA> Instead, where consideration such as a lease payment, is received for the use of the plant, the owner's entitlement to the accelerated write-off allowances will be reduced by one-half of the consideration. </PARA>
<PARA> Other broadening measures will extend access to the research and development concession to partnerships of eligible companies and, from 1 July 1988, to public trading trusts that are taxed as companies. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill will also authorise the write off of expenditure on buildings used for research and development activities on a similar basis to expenditure on buildings used for specified income-producing purposes-typically at the rate of 2 1/2 per cent per annum. </PARA>
<PARA> It will also amend the Industry Research and Development Act 1986 to broaden certification powers of the Industry Research and Development Board so that it can issue certificates about the activities of all taxpayers affected by the wider concessions being made available. </PARA>
<PARA> In the course of finalising these measures, the Government has decided not to proceed at this stage with changes announced on 20 November 1987 in the areas of capital gains and intra group research and development activities, but proposes to keep those matters under review. </PARA>
<PARA>Imputation</PARA>
<PARA> On 18 January 1989 the Government announced that the law would be amended to provide that franking credits arising from the service of an assessment during the income year to which the assessment relates would be calculated on the basis of the company rate of tax rate for the financial year during which it was received. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill provides that a company receiving an early 1988-89 assessment (that is, an assessment received before 1 July 1989) will be required to calculate the franking credits it receives from that assessment at the 49 per cent tax rate. </PARA>
<PARA> It will apply to 1988-89 assessments that are received after 18 January 1989 (when the measure was announced) and before 1 July 1989 and will result in a revenue gain of $1.3 million in 1989-90. </PARA>
<PARA>Exemption of pay and allowances of members of Defence Force Personnel serving in Namibia</PARA>
<PARA> As announced by the Prime Minister on 6 March 1989, the Bill will exempt from income tax the pay and allowances earned by Defence Force personnel while allotted for duty in Namibia as part of the United Nations Transitional Assistance Group. </PARA>
<PARA> The exemption is to apply from 18 February 1989 when the first member of the Defence Force Group left Australia and is estimated to cost $2.75 million in a full year. </PARA>
<PARA>Long term leases of land</PARA>
<PARA> In terms of a proposal announced on 16 November 1988, a new right of election will be made available for capital gains purposes to a taxpayer who grants a very long term lease or sublease of land after 16 November 1988. </PARA>
<PARA> The amendment will enable a taxpayer to elect to have the grant of the new lease or sublease treated as a disposal of the underlying freehold or leasehold interest in land. </PARA>
<PARA> The election will only be available where a lease or sublease of land is granted for more than 50 years. </PARA>
<PARA> The effect of the election for a taxpayer who acquired the freehold or leasehold interest in the land before 20 September 1985 will generally mean that the grant of the long term lease or sublease will not result in a capital gain or a capital loss for tax purposes. </PARA>
<PARA> Where the lessor or sublessor was entitled to any deductions in respect of building depreciation allowances for buildings on the land concerned, the entitlement to those deductions during the life of the new lease will be transferred by the election to the lessee or sublessee. </PARA>
<PARA> Because of the nature of this measure it is not possible to make a reliable estimate of its cost to the revenue. </PARA>
<PARA>Election Expenses</PARA>
<PARA> An income tax deduction is to be authorised for expenditure incurred by candidates in an election for membership of the Legislative Assembly for the Australian Capital Territory. </PARA>
<PARA> Deductions are, of course, already available for similar expenditures incurred by candidates for election to the Commonwealth and State Parliaments and the Legislative Assembly of the Northern Territory. </PARA>
<PARA> This amendment is to apply for expenditure incurred in the 1988-89 and subsequent income years and is estimated to cost $100,000 in 1989-90. </PARA>
<PARA>Licensed Management and Investment Companies</PARA>
<PARA> This Bill gives effect to the proposal announced in the 1988 May Economic Statement to terminate, from 1 July 1991, the 100 per cent taxation deduction for certain subscription monies paid in respect of initial shares in licensed Management Investment Companies. </PARA>
<PARA> Subscription monies paid after 30 June 1991 for initial shares in licensed Management and Investment Companies will no longer qualify for that deduction.</PARA>
<PARA> The Bill will also ensure that certain subscription monies, which attract a 100 per cent deduction if paid before a Management and Investment Company's licence is granted, are not deductible where the licence is granted after 30 June 1991. </PARA>
<PARA> These changes will not alter the existing claw-back arrangements that reduce the deduction allowed or allowable where the shares or the licence are not retained for four years from the date of the last payment on the shares. </PARA>
<PARA> The revenue saving from this measure is estimated at $2 million in 1991-92 and $20 million per annum thereafter. </PARA>
<PARA>Substantiation</PARA>
<PARA> This Bill gives effect to the proposal announced by the Treasurer on 28 April 1989 to modify the requirement for employees to substantiate certain claims for income tax deductions. </PARA>
<PARA> Under the existing law taxpayers claiming relevant deductions are subject to substantiation requirements if transport allowances paid under an award increase after 29 October 1986. </PARA>
<PARA> Taxpayers receiving allowances that have increased after that date will remain outside the substantiation requirements-provided they do not claim a relevant income tax deduction in excess of the amount of the allowance payable under the award as at 29 October 1986. </PARA>
<PARA> These modifications to the substantiation requirements will be at an annual revenue cost of less than $100,000. </PARA>
<PARA>Tax file numbers</PARA>
<PARA> Amendments contained in the Bill will require a copy of an employment declaration to be retained by an employer until the close of the income year after the income year during which the declaration ceases to have effect. </PARA>
<PARA> Amendments are also to be made to ensure that tax file numbers are recorded on group certificates and tax check sheets issued for eligible termination payments where the numbers are quoted to the payer on a form provided for that purpose. </PARA>
<PARA> These changes will have negligible affect on revenue. </PARA>
<PARA>Shipping containers</PARA>
<PARA> The sales tax laws are to be amended to exempt certain shipping containers from sales tax. </PARA>
<PARA> This measure, which was announced on 25 January 1989, is part of this Government's ongoing commitment to reducing industry costs and removing non-essential industry regulation. </PARA>
<PARA> A shipping container will be exempt from tax where it is for repeated use on ships to transport cargo. A shipping container for use for other purposes, for example as a building site shed, will not be exempt from tax unless it has previously gone into use or consumption in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA>Rehearing procedures</PARA>
<PARA> An amendment to the Taxation Administration Act will enable the Commissioner of Taxation, in appropriate circumstances, to apply to a court of summary jurisdiction to set aside a conviction or order in relation to a prescribed taxation offence. </PARA>
<PARA> The right to apply to a court will be restricted to situations where the defendant was not present in court at the original proceedings. </PARA>
<PARA> State and Territory court procedures usually apply to enable a court of summary jurisdiction to rehear a case and rectify any anomalies which may have arisen at the original proceedings because the defendant was absent. </PARA>
<PARA> However, relevant State legislation does not sufficiently provide procedures to correct all anomalies involving offences under Commonwealth taxation law. </PARA>
<PARA> This amendment will remove the need for the Governor-General to be asked in each case to exercise the Royal Prerogative of Mercy to rectify an administrative anomaly or misunderstanding, or to deal with hardship cases, where rehearing provisions under State or Territory law do not provide a satisfactory procedure for rectifying or dealing with these matters. </PARA>
<PARA> This measure will not result in any cost to the revenue. </PARA>
<PARA> I commend the Bill to the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA> Debate (on motion by Senator Knowles) adjourned. </PARA>
<PARA> Motion (by Senator Bolkus) agreed to:</PARA>
<PARA> That these Bills be listed on the Notice Paper as separate Orders of the Day.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to raise only one matter today relating to trade which is causing great concern. It is the issue of live sheep exports to Saudi Arabia, about which we learnt very recently that the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) had written a letter to the King, as I understand it. When this crisis developed some months ago we suggested that the Prime Minister should intervene and take personal action because of the significance of the loss of trade and our concern that the position could become entrenched, which would be at enormous cost to this industry at a time when Australia could least afford another loss in export revenue. The Government refused to accept our advice at that time and said that it was unnecessary. It was also suggested that nothing further could be done until a particular Minister of the Saudi Government returned from holidays. Then we understood, particularly through the press, that Australia's Ambassador was going to make representations, and the industry had its expectations lifted, again it seems with no positive result. Finally, the Prime Minister decided to write a letter.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Why did the Government not accept the invitation of the Australia-Saudi Arabia Business Council and the Australia-Arab Chamber of Commerce and Industry to use their good offices to assist in the resolution of this problem early when the offers were made and when it did not seem to be such an intractable position? When the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade (Senator Gareth Evans) received advice from Dr Mahsoud of the Arab League in New York-reference to which he made in answer to a question recently-that the use of these business organisations was a very sensible way in which to progress, why did he not accept that advice and, in turn, ask those two organisations to assist the Australian Government? Why did he at that time believe that the Australian Government could better achieve the goal without the assistance of such organisations?</PARA>
<PARA> What is the current state of play in relation to this dispute? I would be interested to know what has been the cost of the dispute to Australia's export revenue. Does the Minister believe that it can be resolved in the reasonably near future? What is the Government now doing to resolve it?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As I said in my answer to Senator Hill on this matter on 24 October, to which he has already referred, the Government welcomes and continues to welcome the offers by the Australia-Saudi Arabia Business Council and the Australia-Arab Chamber of Commerce and Industry to use their good offices to help in the dispute. My Department has been in touch with both organisations. There has been very substantial and lengthy conversations, as I understand it as recently as a few days ago, on how the matter might be progressed, in the course of which a full explanation was given, as I understand it, of the approach that the Government has been adopting to this matter from the outset.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As I understand it, that approach as spelt out by our officials on that occasion was fully understood by the Australian representatives of the organisation concerned, in that there is no sense of hostility, as I again understand it, about the way in which this dispute has been carried forward. We have certainly encouraged them to use their own contacts now in parallel with Government efforts to help resolve the dispute. The difficulty now, as it has always been, is that issues of very great delicacy and sensitivity are involved. It is very difficult and undesirable, I think, in the interests of getting a speedy resolution to this matter, to speak about the issues on the public record. </PARA>
<PARA> The truth is that it will have to be resolved through very careful diplomacy with the Saudi royal house. That is proceeding as best it can in all the circumstances. We are taking such advice as we can from a variety of sources and are simply trying to move the thing forward. There can be no question that our concerns have been made known to the Saudi authorities. I quickly list the things that have been done. A high level delegation visited Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman and the United Arab Emirates in August. Mr Duffy wrote to the Saudi Arabian Commerce Minister on 23 August noting that Australia regarded the dispute as a major trade policy matter with potentially serious adverse implications for the bilateral trade relationship. I took the opportunity of my presence at the non-aligned movement foreign Ministers meeting in Belgrade to clearly highlight the concerns of the Australian Government in a conversation I had with the Saudi Arabian Deputy Foreign Minister on 4 September. I did, as Senator Hill has indicated, have a helpful conversation with the Arab League Ambassador to the United Nations, Dr Clovis Maksoud, on 4 October, and which I reported back to the Department here. Such follow-up as has been thought appropriate has occurred in response to that, including the recent conversation I have described. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, Mr Kerin, who along with Mr Duffy has had the primary carriage of this matter, has written twice to the Saudi Arabian Minister for Agriculture and Water, most recently on 7 September, in which he proposed a range of cooperative technical measures to resolve Saudi concerns about the health of our live sheep exports. The response received from the Saudi Minister for Agriculture and Water, Dr Al Shaikh, which was received on 27 October, did appear to indicate some misunderstanding of those proposals as put forward by Mr Kerin. Mr Kerin discussed the matter again with the Saudi Ambassador on 30 October, and that matter has been the subject of further discussion within the Government. Industry representatives and Government officials met on 31 October to discuss further action. </PARA>
<PARA> The Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) has written to King Fahd. The letter was handed to the Saudi Foreign Minister on 12 November. It is obviously not appropriate to disclose the contents of that letter. All I can say is that it is a problem the dimensions of which, although I am not in a position to quantify them at this stage-I am not sure that anyone is-the Government is very concerned about. We are doing everything we possibly can within the constraints of the situation to move it forward. We certainly hope that the sound commercial relations that Australia and Saudi Arabia have enjoyed in the past will continue in the future. Beyond that, I really cannot be more specific in any of the matters that Senator Hill has raised. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade (Senator Gareth Evans) is fully aware of the events that led up to the dispute. They have already been pointed out by Senator Hill. I fully understand the difficulties of dealing with Saudi Arabia-in fact, with any country in the Arabian Gulf area. The matter has now been around for at least three months. It started off in August. A vast amount of damage has been caused to the trade. I can only speak for the western side of the continent about how much damage has been done to the trade. I base that on the amount of stock that has been held on farms. We all know that the holding paddocks of the shipping companies or the buying companies have been cleared. I do not know whether the sheep were eventually all shipped off or whether they were sold back to graziers. There are at least 300,000 to 400,000 export wethers in Western Australia locked up on farms waiting for a market to be found for them.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> What has alleviated the situation to a certain extent has been a very good feed season in Western Australia. In addition, of course, now that we have a downturn in the wool market, the industry is being made a lot more jittery. If the industry is hanging on to the sheep, at least the sheep are growing a fleece. But with the state of the wool market the situation is now getting a bit worrying. I know that the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade has played a great part in the matter, and we are indebted to him, but three months have now passed and, with respect, it seems to me that very little has been achieved. I mean by that that we are no closer to resolving the matter; nor are we any closer to finding out whether any Australian sheep were diseased when they left Australia. There is a need for urgency from the industry in order to bring the matter to a conclusion one way or another. The industry has to plan for next year. The industry has to plan what sort of markets it will have. That is how one sets up one's breeding program, or stocking program, for that matter. If this market is to be lost-and I do not want to see it lost-then so be it. Let it come to a head so that we can start looking for somewhere else to go. </PARA>
<PARA> The situation has also been slightly alleviated by a strong inquiry from the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics for frozen beef. The wethers going to the Arabian Gulf are three-year-olds, if I am right, and still reasonably suited as mutton for the rest of the world, whereas a few years ago the Gulf states used to take up to five-year-olds or whatever. So there is a bit of a let go there. But considering that the new season is fast approaching, the industry would certainly like to see some movement in bringing the matter to a head one way or the other. </PARA>
<PARA> A few other things worry me. Since the sheep movements have been stopped, the animal liberation organisation, especially in the western part of the continent, has been getting more active. It is a lot easier to stop something which has been stopped for some other reason. These organisations are getting more active in order to make sure that the movements of live sheep do not start again. It is easy to say, as I heard Senator Jean Jenkins say in the last week in Western Australia, that we should be selling more frozen beef. She does not understand that the live sheep go to the Gulf states for religious reasons, because the sheep are killed how and when the states themselves dictate. </PARA>
<PARA> Another matter of concern-I suppose it was an accident-is that there has been a fire in a live sheep carrier lying off Adelaide. It will take a while to put the fire out. That is another thing that gives the detractors of the live sheep trade reason to fight hard in order to make sure that the trade does not start again. It is for those reasons that I consider the Government should make renewed efforts to bring this matter, hopefully, to a successful conclusion and thus get the trade going again. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I understand Senator Panizza's frustration, which I and the Government share. We are genuinely doing everything we can. We are very conscious of the damages concerned and of the point which Senator Panizza makes about the need for forward planning. We are conscious of the absence of effective alternatives for the sale of those sheep at the moment, although if a frozen meat market could be developed, in many ways, from a number of points of view, not least that of the animal liberation movement, it would be a more satisfactory way of conducting that trade. But none of that is leading us to lessen our efforts in any way to resolve the Saudi problem.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I accept that the Government is doing everything possible, as the Minister has stated. The Minister recognises, by his own example, the importance of travel and the importance sometimes of making an effort to move to the area of a problem and doing something through personal negotiation. Mr Duffy wrote a letter and the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) wrote a letter. Might it not have been of some value if one of the Government's Ministers-including Senator Evans, who is about to head off to Europe because, as he said to us in Question Time, it is important to go there to learn at first hand what is happening in Eastern Europe-had gone to Saudi Arabia and tried to resolve the issue personally?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As Senator Panizza says, he could even go there on his way to Europe, so it would not be necessary for him to make a one-off trip. We suggested some time ago that a Minister should have intervened personally to try to resolve the problem before it got too bad. That did not occur and it still has not occurred. I still do not understand why it has taken so long for the Minister to embrace the invitation of the private business organisations, which we are both led to understand are so highly regarded in Saudi Arabia and which we have both been told could have played a unique and useful role in helping to resolve the matter early on. My two questions are: Why will a Minister not visit Saudi Arabia and try to sort out the problem, and why were the business organisations' invitations not accepted much earlier in the hope that the problem could have been resolved?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am touched by Senator Hill's confidence in the diplomatic capacity of my fellow Ministers and me to resolve complex problems of this kind. All I can say in that respect is that I will raise the matter with my colleagues-the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) and Ministers Kerin and Duffy, who have had the direct carriage of this-to see whether they want to take that course at this stage. But here, as elsewhere, it is a matter for judgment about how best to advance the process of negotiation. The best advice that we had from inside the Saudi system was to handle it in the way that it has been handled to date. That has not produced results, but it is a somewhat complex and difficult system for governments such as ours to deal with on sensitive matters of this kind. We have to take such advice as we can, weigh it, juggle it and balance it and then see what we can do.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I am not sure of the precise sequence of events so far as the response to the overtures of the chambers of commerce are concerned. All I can repeat is that, as I understand it, the tactics for utilising that parallel track were discussed fully with the senior executive members of the Australian arm of this organisation just a few days ago. I am told that there was no disagreement as to either the way in which the matter had been handled or the way it should be handled in future to move it forward. I do not have full knowledge of those exchanges. It may be that that answer will need to be supplemented. However, for the moment I cannot add anything to what I have said previously. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to touch on some matters which I suspect Senator Hill will mention this afternoon when he moves his motion in respect of events taking place in Eastern Europe. I am sorry that the Australian Democrats and Senator Vallentine have not come in here during this debate to make their useful contributions. In my view, one of the fundamental reasons that we are seeing changes now in Eastern Europe is a result of the attitude-perhaps I am pedantically stating the obvious-of the Soviet Union, Gorbachev's fundamental approach to perestroika and glasnost and the fact that they disavowed the Brezhnev doctrine.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This has come about because of the incapacity of the Soviet Union, in many respects, to deal with the problems because of its own domestic economic problems. Gorbachev has acknowledged that the problem for the Soviet Union is that it is a first world defence power but a Third World economy and one could not continue to support the other. When Reagan and Weinberger dramatically increased the level of United States defence expenditure they sent fear and shivers through the spine of the Soviet Union. Their enormous financial commitment to the strategic defence initiative (SDI) made it very apparent to the Soviet Union that it could not afford to keep pace with the United States and its Western allies in terms of modernising its defence capacity and expanding the technology of that capacity. </PARA>
<PARA> As a result, perhaps the first fundamental step that we saw was the intermediate-range nuclear force (INF) agreement. It might be argued that the INF agreement was the result of the West's deployment of its missiles. I suspect that that was only the beginning of the Soviet's recognition that they could not continue to maintain the level of funding necessary to be competitive. We saw some significant changes in attitude to foreign policy in the Soviet Union, including its withdrawal from Kampuchea and Mongolia, the release of troops from the Sino-Soviet border and the INF agreement. The Soviet Union was haemorrhaging economically because of its attempts to maintain the enormous defence budget which it was required to undertake. </PARA>
<PARA> Anybody who has been to the Soviet Union or has bothered to look superficially at its economy understands the major problems that it has. Having to move so much of its top technology from civil activities and the economy into its defence forces and defence research has very much depleted its capacity in terms of its being a strong economic force. I give the simple example of Uzbekistan, an area in the south of the Soviet Union, which produces fresh fruit and vegetables, but when one travels a comparatively short distance to Moscow or Leningrad one finds vast queues in the streets. People queue up simply to buy rotten vegetables and fruit. They are rotten because they do not have a fundamental and simple capacity to transport goods and services. In addition, there are all the inevitable problems that go with having 158 million civil servants trying to run the economy. </PARA>
<PARA> Much of what we are seeing now has come about because of the levels of expenditure outlaid by the United States and its allies which ultimately, notwithstanding what the Democrats, Senator Vallentine and others say, have the capacity to provide stability, peace and the prospect of long term peace to the world and which in many other respects have led to a fundamental change in the political system in Eastern Europe. That will have enormous implications not only for those economies but also for the Soviet Union because of the intrinsic and compulsory commercial relationship between those countries and because of the contrasting difference between the composition of the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation and the Warsaw Pact countries. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I can do that, but I want to make it clear, certainly in the presence of those who are advising the Minister, that these documents are provided for debate in the chamber in the committee stage and we would normally be entitled to conduct the debate and have further questioning on the basis of information which makes some sense. To have these sorts of oblique references and cryptic descriptions of what would otherwise appear to be self-evident parameters seems to me to be particularly unhelpful.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I move to another section in relation to a question asked by Senator Panizza on the cost of establishing a UHF communications network from Port Hedland with a line running straight east to the Northern Territory border. The answer states that this could not be achieved without extraordinary cost and it goes on to point out that it would be necessary to provide a series of repeater stations, et cetera. I suppose that we all have a general idea of what might be meant by `extraordinary cost', but again I would have thought it would have been possible to be a little more precise than that and to give a quantitative rather than a qualitative assessment. I simply ask, on notice, that the Minister make a further endeavour to come up with a meaningful, quantitative figure. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will pass on that request. There is a point at which something is so obviously beyond the range of that which is affordable that it is self-evident to the merest passing spectator, and the kind of effort involved in pulling out a detailed quantitative analysis is simply not justified, even in the interests of freedom of information, public debate and everything else. That is a judgment that has to be made periodically when Ministers are responding to questions on notice. I would ask Senator Alston, if he wants to keep Telecom a lean and taut organisation and not misusing its resources in going on goose chases of one kind or another, whether he would be prepared to waive that particular request rather than require Telecom to debate resources to prove something which will not make a halfpennyworth of difference to any policy outcome.</PARA></TALK.START>

I am not suggesting that a division of Telecom officers be sent off for a month to push some buttons on their machines. I am simply asking what figure, in ballpark terms, they had in mind when the term `extraordinary' was used. Does it mean more than $10m? Does it mean roughly more than $100m? We should be given some general idea, and that does not involve any more than going back to the figure that presumably generated the assessment of `extraordinary'.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I should like to raise a point regarding Telecom, although not Telecom's record profits. It seems that Telecom has a good deal of switching gear that is slightly out of date. I remember receiving a circular letter the other day advising that, firstly, it cannot get parts for this switching gear and, secondly, it is not able to train the younger technicians in repairing this switching gear that has been around for a day or two. I am talking about equipment that has been around for only 10 or 15 years at the very most. I believe that this is beyond all reason.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Telecom supplies very sophisticated gear and, for many applications, I believe it is too sophisticated-not in its use but because it is very expensive. For instance, a small business may want a main telephone and two extensions. It is impossible these days to get such simple switching gear. The business would have to have the three telephones in parallel, which is totally unsatisfactory, or it would have to use as a minimum the Commander system and would be up for thousands of dollars. If it wanted five lines, the cost would be astronomical. Of course, equipment can be leased from Telecom but it is capitalised at about 33 per cent a year, so the total cost would be written off in three years. </PARA>
<PARA> Can the Minister comment on whether there is good, workable, cheaper gear available that could be used to phase out these switchboards? Although they have been around for 10 or 12 years, they are quite functional, but obviously Telecom does not want to operate them any more. Could Telecom supply cheaper equipment rather than the sophisticated equipment?</PARA>

Senator Panizza will realise that the matters he is talking about are essentially matters for the commercial and managerial judgment of Telecom. For better or worse, it is running as a government business enterprise entirely within its own parameters and discretions in that kind of judgment.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I return to the community service obligations (CSOs). A question asked what figure Telecom put on the cost of its CSOs and the answer was that Telecom had provided figures to the Minister as part of the overall study and that the timing of any announcement was a matter for the Minister. That relates to the outcome of the Bureau's investigations and presumably any government response. I ask the Minister why it is that the Telecom input figure should be so sensitive? I can understand the delay, accompanied by Government anguish, over the consequences of the level of the figure that the Government might accept from the Bureau, but I do not understand the sensitivity about the mere Telecom input figure.</PARA></TALK.START>

I remind the Minister that a little less than two years ago Telecom put out a press release claiming that the cost of its CSOs-cross-subsidies as they were called then-was of the order of $1 billion. In the context of the Government's May 1988 statement, the Telecom figure was said publicly to be $670m. Why is it now regarded as sensitive and confidential to the point where even that starting figure cannot be disclosed publicly? Is it that Telecom is reluctant to put it on the record or is the Government simply putting its foot on Telecom?</PARA></TALK.START>

The answer states that the study was a complex exercise and involved a wide range of staff in answering questionnaires and collecting data and that it was not possible to estimate the cost of Telecom's involvement. I would regard that as a priceless response but it seems to me that it is also an extraordinary concession either that Telecom's accounting practices are inadequate or that a strategic policy decision has been made not to enable quantification of the cost of Telecom's involvement. Why on earth is this so and why cannot we be given a figure that would at least show the extent of Telecom's involvement in the Bureau study?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This is another example of the phenomenon to which I referred earlier when sometimes the time, effort and cost involved in pulling out and quantifying, albeit according to well established accounting standards, the inputs from a variety of people in a number of different divisions and areas is simply not justified by the conceivable utility of the information thus described, even to Senator Alston, in order to grind on in chamber debates of this kind. It is a familiar response and one that Senator Alston would have had from Ministers in answer to some of his more extravagant questions on notice; it is also one that I am not disposed to try to second guess in this instance.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;At the hearing of Estimates Committee B, some questions were placed on notice on 3 October-I point out that it is now 21 November-which related to the continuing saga of the construction of Darwin Airport. The particular questions sought information that could very properly have been provided well in advance of this date, particularly as in the interim period since 3 October media releases in Darwin have been made by the airport manager of the Federal Airports Corporation in Darwin, Mr Bruno Santalucia, on both 9 October 1989 and 24 October 1989 which related to issues that were asked in the questions that were put on notice on 3 October. The annual report of the Federal Airports Corporation for 1988-89 was subsequently tabled in this Parliament and a number of issues were at least alluded to in that report.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Additionally, as all honourable senators would be well aware, on 30 October 1989 the report of the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works was tabled in this chamber. The report, entitled Northside Development of Civil Aviation Facilities, Darwin Airport, Northern Territory, contained a number of conclusions and recommendations and, in particular, drew the Parliament's attention to five very specific recommendations. As an aside, it is interesting to note that the report tabled here on 30 October contained only five recommendations and a total budget proposal for the Darwin Airport of $72m at May 1989 prices, whereas by comparison the seventh report of 1984 of the Public Works Committee at that time had very similar recommendations but included nine specific recommendations and in 1984 dollar terms had an airport estimate at that time of $95m. The Government, as usual, has prevaricated and procrastinated continually in this particular area. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like to know very specifically why the questions that were addressed on 3 October have not yet been attended to and answers provided to the Senate, despite continual requests through the Committee secretariat on a daily basis for at least the last fortnight. The questions related to the design and timetables, the funding expenditure and the source of loan funds, the timetable for the letting, the cost implications, the financial status of the FAC and some of the implications arising from the current pilots dispute and the implications of a loss of income to the FAC.

For example, I mention the Australian Telecommunications Corporation. I was unable to attend that meeting of the Senate Estimates Committee B of 3 October, but I understand that the annual report of the Australian Telecommunications Corporation was not available to the Estimates Committee on that date, although in fact the Chairman's report to the Minister was dated 13 September 1989.

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="LE4">Senator MICHAEL BAUME</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I make the general point that the absence of such a report is grossly unsatisfactory. It is a disgrace that a Senate committee-which is the only surveillance mechanism available to this Parliament for the corporations which have this enormous power and this modicum, this minute amount, of apparent responsibility-does not have such a report. It seems to me that it is the only occasion that we have any chance to really test the matter of the responsibility of corporations which do not appear to share the same obligation to face up to their shareholders, who are the people of Australia represented by us, as do, for example, public companies.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I tend to look at Senate Estimates committees as something like the annual general meeting of a corporation and it would seem to me that every effort should be made to provide reports. I might say many government organisations have made every effort. Many government organisations did the right thing and provided us with draft reports, even though it was ahead of the maximum time requirement for the presentation of annual reports. </PARA>
<PARA> I am interested in looking at the Australian Telecommunications Corporation to see whether there are some matters which presumably could have received some attention in a Senate Estimates committee. For example, it is interesting to note that one of the charges against operating profit was research and development costs of $36.2m. This might be a situation where one could in fact commend Telecom for undertaking considerable expenditure on research and development. I do not know of many other companies, either public or private, with a turnover of $7.7 billion who were spending as much money as that. Perhaps it is a comment on all of Australia that it is noteworthy that $36m, or 0.5 per cent of turnover, has been spent on research and development. Apparently that is a commendable figure when compared to the rest of Australia. Figures like this should be available to Senate Estimates committees to discuss. </PARA>
<PARA> I am intrigued to note that, although the bad debts written off total about $70m, the provision for bad debts has been cut by $21m. Is this because Telecom expects to have a far better bad debt situation in the coming year? I do not know. I do know that Telecom has had a fair bit of trouble-I suppose I gave it a fair bit of trouble-concerning its appointment of a new collection agency for its bad debts in New South Wales. I understand that the new agency involved is the subject of some police action. I do not know what the results have been. In the end I must commend Telecom for cooperating as fully as it did with the police in this matter after Telecom was nagged about it in this chamber by me. </PARA>
<PARA> There are concerns about Telecom's bad debts. I know that with such a huge turnover the writing off of $70m may not be awfully bad in relative terms, but certainly there are many people who appear to be abusing Telecom's services by changing names, disappearing and so on. I do not know how a group like Telecom can get the figure down even smaller than $70m, but that underlines my query about why on earth the bad debt provision has been cut by $21m. Perhaps the Minister may have some suitable answers, but if we had this information at Senate Estimates we would not have to ask the question now. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the Minister and acknowledge that, but perhaps Telecom should be reminded that all its shares are owned by the people of Australia, and we provide the people of Australia with their only opportunity of asking questions about their company. It seems to me that this halfway house that the Government is pushing so many business corporations into, having them as separate structures and in fact answerable only to the Government, is the worst of all worlds. The management is not subject to the pressures of the marketplace in the sense that there is a public shareholding who can vote them out or express their views about poor performance or poor service, particularly when they are a monopoly like this. It seems there is an added burden on Telecom to meet this obligation to report fully and openly. That is another reason why I share the concern of one of my colleagues in the House of Representatives and that of Senator Alston, who has been talking about the institutional advertising of Telecom costing large amounts of money. From looking at the report, one would certainly get no view about how much it is spending on advertising.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In other words, what has happened in this area is that by corporatising structures like Telecom, the amount of information required to be provided is limited. We go cap in hand, as the Minister appeared to indicate, to Telecom asking, `Pretty please, with sugar on top, could we have an answer?'. We face the prospect of getting a response that it is commercial in confidence and that basically Telecom, in the great bulk of its operations, is acting as a state monopoly. This underlies the need to get rid of this uncomfortable halfway house and to privatise these public corporations, which are at present in the worst of all possible worlds for both the users and the owners. I take the Minister's point that all he can do is ask for a response, and I will keep my fingers crossed and hope that I shall get a sensible answer. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I understand that in June the CAA made a determination which was gazetted and which set out the charges to be levied by the Authority and which included other clauses. I draw the Minister's attention to clause 29, which gives the Authority a power to remit or refund charges, and clause 22, which gives the airlines the entitlement to assign any liability they might have under the charges to another person. Having drawn the Minister's attention to those two clauses, I would also suggest to him that both of those clauses are beyond the power of the Authority to so determine. Under the terms of its Act, it is wide of its powers.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I am concerned that the authority, having obtained advice from the Attorney-General's Department, only part of which was made available to the Committee, appears to have ignored those two clauses which, as I claim, are beyond the power. If, as I assume from what the Minister has just said, the Commonwealth has paid those cheques to the Authority on the basis of those determinations, am I right in assuming that under clause 22 of the June determination of the CAA-namely, that the airlines may assign any liability to another person-they have assigned their liability for charges to the Commonwealth and the Commonwealth has now paid the dues to the Authority?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Not only is it not the occasion for a detailed bush lawyer's dialogue on possible legal foundations of these matters, but also my understanding is that the authority to waive the charges in question was ministerial direction, which is provided for under the legislation. The reimbursement of the authorities to compensate them for the amount lost as a result of such waiver is a reimbursement that has been paid by the Government in the ordinary course of public accounting procedures-in this instance, I presume through payment from the Advance to the Minister for Finance, which obviously will have to be the subject of a top-up appropriation at the right time because at the time that the Budget went to bed obviously the expenditure was unforeseen.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As I understand it, there has been no question of assignment using the formal provisions of the legislation to which Senator Newman refers; rather, it has involved the legal processes as I have described them. However, I repeat that in relation to this matter, I do not think it is very edifying or helpful, quite apart from contravening Standing Orders, to try to give legal opinions on the run. Senator Newman seeks a series of legal opinions about the authority for various things which, presumably, may be the subject of some legal discussion. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would now like to address generally the question of the Estimates Committee B report to the Senate. I draw the Committee's attention to the fact that the report covers only about eight points, all of which are technical, relating to the administration of the hearing and none of which go to the very important substantive issues that were raised during the Estimates Committee hearings covering two or three days. During a time as important as the airline dispute-which, as we know, is now over-I, for one, was very disappointed to note that the officers of the Authority who appeared before the Senate Estimates Committee were so ill-prepared for answering questions of detail on a matter that was, and has continued since to be, of such importance to the nation. Anybody who is interested in the subject would have expected that officers of the Department would have come prepared with a great deal more material than they did. It was almost as if the Estimates Committee caught them by surprise. Certainly, I would have expected that the question of compensation and the questions that were raised at the Estimates Committee hearing on 3 October would have been at least referred to in the Estimates Committee report. I was disappointed to find that there was no reference to them at all.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> On 11 October there was a hearing of a quite different nature and one which I have never experienced in my 3 1/2 years in Parliament. That Estimates Committee hearing on 11 October was called in response to a request by the Opposition for a Senate select committee to be established to deal with questions relating to the airline dispute and questions of safety. This was an extremely important matter which was causing great concern in the country. As a compromise measure, instead of establishing a Senate select committee, it was agreed by all parties that the Estimates Committee be recalled. As the chamber has already heard in previous debate, that committee meeting was a most appalling exercise in prevention of information being made available to senators. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not wish to dwell upon that matter now because my colleague Senator Chaney has made it very clear in the past that that Estimates Committee hearing was a travesty. Serious matters and questions were raised at that hearing which were stifled. The behaviour of Government members at that hearing defies belief. As a result of that, the Senate was so appalled by what took place that there was then support for the establishment of a select committee to look not only at the question of safety and compensation aspects but also at the economic impact of the airline dispute on the country. I am glad to say that that committee has now been formed. </PARA>
<PARA> I want now, in a somewhat conciliatory mood, to raise a matter which I believe should have been included in the report of Senate Estimates Committee B but which I found missing-that is, the question of the ruling by the Chairman of the Committee, Senator Coates, during the hearing on 11 October, with regard to the sub judice rule. Documentary evidence was available to that Committee and officers were present who could have answered questions about those documents. However, Committee members were informed that we would not be able to ask a range of questions that we wished to ask because they may have related to matters which may be the subject of hearings before courts. This occurred at the time when the airlines were issuing writs at the drop of a hat against anybody who said anything about the airline dispute. Matters of great importance could have been tested at that hearing, but honourable senators were prevented from doing so by the Chairman's ruling that these matters would be going before a court and the Senate could not inquire into them. </PARA>
<PARA> I draw the attention of honourable senators to the fact that since that date I have put two notices of motion before the Senate relating to the question of the use of the sub judice rule. Senator Coates said that he was a new chairman and he was concerned that he should not do the wrong thing. Therefore, he chose to err on the side of safety. I felt that he was wrong and I tried to persuade him to overturn his ruling. I produced examples from Hansard and advice from the Clerk, but I was unable to use these effectively to change the Chairman's mind. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that this is something which cannot be allowed to continue. If it does, we will have a situation in the Senate where we will not be able to perform our duty of inquiring into matters of national importance. Frequently, matters which are to go before the courts also come before the Parliament. There have been rulings down the years by Presidents and by other parliaments.</PARA>
<PARA> I draw the attention of honourable senators to some recent rulings in this chamber. On 10 May 1988 the President referred to a suggestion that writs had been issued in relation to a matter brought forward for debate. He drew attention to the lack of significance of the issuing of writs and to the basis of the sub judice principle-that is, that proceedings on foot must not be prejudiced. On 30 May 1989 Senator Dunn was allowed to continue a speech referring to a person then charged with a criminal offence, following a notable exposition of the sub judice principle by the Minister for Justice, Senator Tate. On 27 September 1989, Senator Dunn was restrained from continuing a speech on the basis of the possibility that the matter could be before a jury in the near future. At the suggestion of Senator Evans-the Minister who is in the chamber today-she postponed her speech until the matters to which she proposed to refer could be examined to assess the danger of prejudice to a trial then in prospect. Erskine May sets out the rules of the House of Commons which, of course, are also significant for the emphasis which they give as to where the legal action is at the time that the matter comes before the Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> What is quite clear and has not been in doubt in this Parliament is that until a matter is about to go to trial or to a hearing, the Senate must not be prevented from pursuing its lawful purpose. In this case, Estimates Committee B was so prevented, despite my protests. We must not allow this situation to continue or to be in any doubt. Therefore, I draw the Committee's attention to the request which I have made in the motion of which I gave notice on 2 November, that the President make a formal statement to the Senate as to whether previous Presidents' rulings should be regarded as defining the limits of the sub judice rule and prescribing the approach to be adopted by all chairmen of committees. It is not good enough for chairmen of committees to say that they are new and they want to err on the side of safety. The role of the Parliament is too important to have it thwarted by somebody for good reason, or even for malicious reason, which I am not ascribing to Senator Coates. We must make sure that senators who take up the important job of chairing our committees fully understand their responsibility in relation to the sub judice rule. </PARA>
<PARA> I am disappointed not only at the ruling that Senator Coates made and the fact that he was obviously not prepared to follow the advice which the Committee received and the precedents which I tried to show him on that occasion, but also that the matter was not raised in some appropriate way in the report of Estimates Committee B. I urge the President to lay down a ruling very soon and give directions to chairmen of committees so that the application of the sub judice rule in this chamber and in its committees is always consistent. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;If that is an example of Senator Newman in conciliatory mode, I would hate to listen to her when she is feeling a little on the peppery side. I take the point about what she said in regard to the sub judice rule. It is always a matter of delicate judgment for anyone in the position of chairing a committee. I would not want to say anything that would be construed as expressing any lack of support for my colleague Senator Coates who, I know, had a very hard row to hoe on that day. Here, as elsewhere, the kind of questions which Senator Newman obviously wants to pursue-or is lamenting the previous lack of opportunity to pursue-about the airlines affair, are perhaps better dealt with by the Committee that has been established, rather than by trying to deal across the chamber now with further matters of detail. On the subject which she has addressed in regard to getting answers on matters of detail, I refer her to the fact that the current Department of Finance guidelines which cover the attendance of departmental officials at Estimates committee hearings state:</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA> (e) supports measures that will actively encourage genuine reform processes in Eastern Europe in a way consistent with Western security and economic interests. </PARA>
<PARA>I thank the Senate for its cooperation in allowing this matter to be dealt with this afternoon. Every day history is created, but some facets of history are more dramatic, more exciting, more hopeful and more challenging than others. What is happening at an astonishing pace in eastern Europe meets all of those descriptions. The wonderful sight of East Germans crossing the wall, of East and West Germans greeting each other with open arms, was brought to our living rooms in recent days. We have moved this motion to allow the Australian parliamentary representatives to record their support for the extension of freedom but also to recognise that many of the hurdles remain to be jumped before a new order of security and freedom can be assured. </PARA>
<PARA> The extraordinary developments in East Germany, Czechoslovakia and now Bulgaria over recent weeks have been further confirmation that the post-war order in Europe is undergoing rapid and fundamental change. Taken together with the reform processes under way in Hungary and Poland-and within the Soviet Union itself-a whole new era for the people of Europe is emerging. In recent times we have seen Lech Walesa before the Congress in Washington; most of the old guard in Romania, except for the President, has been swept away; President Gorbachev is soon to meet the Pope in the Vatican; and, as we have indicated in the terms of this motion, the Berlin Wall is being chiselled away. No-one would have said a few years ago that any of these events would have been possible, and some of these events would not have been foreshadowed even a matter of months ago. </PARA>
<PARA> What is happening in the Soviet Union and eastern Europe has to be understood in terms of the bankruptcy of communism as an ideology. The mass rallies in Prague, Dresden, Leipzig, Riga, Vilnius and Tallinn show that political and economic freedom has an attraction that no repressive government can forever stifle. Their actions have demonstrated that centralised economic control is a discredited system. The resurgence of democracy has been a triumph for basic political and economic freedoms. Economic failure, I suggest, is the key to what has been occurring. Food queues, housing shortages and the absence of basic products essential for reasonable life have brought enormous pressure upon the eastern European states. The yearning for freedom, of course, has always been there. Add to that the effect of growing interaction with the West, an interaction which the East could no longer afford to ignore because it was unable to remain isolated, it having been demonstrated to those in the East that there was an alternative that could lead to a better lifestyle; the inspired and courageous leadership of Lech Walesa and others whose names we are just learning; and finally a changed attitude in the Soviet Union, and the pressure for change becomes irrepressible. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to return briefly to the Soviet Union. Without a changed approach, which honourable senators may argue has occurred voluntarily or has been forced upon the Soviet Union by reality, these changes within eastern Europe would not be happening. Mr Gorbachev saw the same problems in the Soviet Union as we have seen facing the eastern satellite states. He saw it economically falling further and further behind the West, with obvious ultimate defence implications, he recognised that Western technology was essential, and he recognised that economic improvement was not possible without a diversion of excessively high military expenditure-all of which meant that he had to work for a better relationship with the West. </PARA>
<PARA> We applaud President Gorbachev's recognition that there cannot be economic reform without political reform-perestroika without glasnost. The modest extensions of freedom that have been granted within the Soviet Union we obviously support. But the reforms that are under way in the Soviet Union, as most will appreciate, are occurring under great stress. Mr Gorbachev himself is performing a delicate juggling act with almost irreconcilable political demands and pressures: radicals who want the reforms to go further; conservatives concerned with the legitimacy and primacy of Marxism and the territorial integrity of the Soviet Union; and popular frustration with the failure of reform to produce anything so far in the way of tangible improvements in the quality of life, some people in the Soviet Union arguing that their quality of life has deteriorated during the process of change. With such pressures and Gorbachev's future and that of his programs still unresolved, we suggest to the chamber this afternoon that we must exercise caution in our own assessments not only for the Soviet Union but also for eastern Europe because they are irrevocably linked. The process of reform itself, whilst we applaud it, will lead to an interim period of great instability. An unstable environment always presents its own dangers. It is hard to see, for example, how the Warsaw Pact will hold together if its ideological bond is broken, notwithstanding the fact that Mr Gorbachev has been prepared to allow these processes in eastern Europe to occur provided that the Warsaw Pact is not harmed thereby. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course events in eastern Europe are still unfolding. No-one can predict with certainty how they will finally be resolved. There is certainly an imposing agenda building up of unresolved issues created by these events. The significance of these events in eastern Europe is not confined to Europe's boundaries. They create a significant movement of population and possible new sources of refugees and immigrants. They generate changes in the pattern of trade and financial flow. They lead in the longer term to reviews of security and military deployments. I remind the Senate that the United States Secretary of Defense only yesterday foreshadowed big cuts to United States defence spending in the European theatre. The result of the reviews of security could have wide implications for Australia as a member of the Western Alliance. Our challenge is to work out how we can lock into these changes in a positive way, to be supportive and also to protect our own interests. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Gareth Evans told us earlier today that he is being deployed by the Australian Government to Europe to make an assessment of what is occurring. We read in the press that he is to produce a detailed assessment of the security, trade and financial implications for Australia and to put that down in the Parliament. We hope it is to be put down in the Parliament; Senator Evans has introduced no papers into this chamber. The closing of our Berlin Mission in 1986 did not show much foresight. We hope that the Minister may now recognise that it was in fact shortsighted. In view of the dramatic circumstances of recent times, the Opposition will look to having the Berlin Mission reopened. </PARA>
<PARA> Our advice to Senator Evans and to the Australian Government while it remains in office and attempts to assess what is happening in eastern Europe is to be cautious. We regret that the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) saw it in his best domestic political interests to bucket our caution when addressing the Evatt Foundation a few days ago. We suggest that the Government should remember that the Western alliance has secured against war for a record period in Europe and that strong alliances, soundly based on mutual interests, offer better security than Mr Hawke's personal relationships with other world leaders. The Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, in our assessment, sees its security for the future in a neutral Europe, and at least for the foreseeable future a neutral Europe is not in our best security interests. </PARA>
<PARA> We suggest that the Government support the economic process of these eastern European states which are embracing a new direction, because economic involvement will best secure continuation of the democratisation process. This will require some flexibility in approach, because some countries, such as Poland, will obviously need assistance and an aid level, whereas perhaps the best way that we can assist Hungary in its economic development may simply be through opening up the opportunities to trade. So each country will have to be assessed on its own unique circumstances. </PARA>
<PARA> We also suggest that the Government, in making this assessment of Australia's interests in the light of these dramatic events occurring in Europe, should not underestimate the effects of the post-1992 delivery of a single market within the European Economic Community which must now be linked with the possibility of a further economic linkage with a even wider democratic European Community. If this occurs, the consequences to trade and the economies of countries such as ours will be enormous. The time to make these considerations and plan for these possible changes is now, not in some years time. </PARA>
<PARA> In summary, therefore, we rejoice in the fact that the people of eastern Europe are being offered the possibility of freedom, which they have not enjoyed for so many years. We believe that Australia should be looking for ways in which it can support that process consistent with our own interests, particularly our security interests but obviously also our economic interests. Australia should be realistic and recognise that the best way it can do that is to support particularly the western European states which are at the front line and are working hard towards the objective of furthering the democracy process and the economic opportunities in the east. </PARA>
<PARA> We applaud the fact that the European Community leaders have met only in the last few days to look at ways in which an economic linkage might be extended and a bank might be formed that could help in the reconstruction of eastern Europe. We would like to see Australia locking into this process. There is a great goal to be achieved. We want Australia to be supportive. We want the process to continue and ultimately to lead to a situation of greater security, greater stability and freedom for all those who have suffered from oppression for so long. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have no hesitation whatever in supporting on behalf of the Government this motion now before the Senate. I did respond in some little detail in Question Time today on a number of aspects of this question. I do not want to retrack over that ground and, as a result, I think I can make this contribution perhaps a little shorter than it might otherwise have been.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Nonetheless, there are some important things to say and to put on the record. The first of them perhaps is that bipartisan support for the sentiments expressed in this motion which we are seeing here in both Houses today does reflect, I think, the very great pleasure and, indeed, excitement felt by all Australians at the breathtaking developments that we are witnessing in east Europe. Indeed, it is the case that many Australians escaped totalitarian regimes in east Europe, and for these people in particular there will be a definite satisfaction in seeing their former homelands revert to freedom. The fact that the Opposition has come a little belatedly perhaps to an appreciation of the significance of what is happening, as the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) rather graphically made clear in his contribution to the debate in the other place today, makes its current enlightenment no less welcome for that. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator GARETH EVANS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am a statesman these days. The motion correctly recognises that there are uncertainties ahead so far as the future of Europe is concerned. As Senator Hill himself noted, one simply cannot assume that President Gorbachev will in fact stay around to follow through the implications of the crusade on which he has embarked-and it deserves no lesser description than that-in the Soviet Union, the problem there being the extraordinary expectations that have been generated by the course of events until now and the danger that, particularly so far as economic prosperity is concerned, those expectations will not be satisfied for a long time to come. That is a situation that does perhaps generate very real problems for political leaders.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> However, one thing about which there is absolute certainty is that the ideological foundations of communism as it has been practised in eastern Europe and elsewhere have unequivocally crumbled. While the grand principles of the socialist tradition of equality, social cooperation and personal freedom are undoubtedly still capable of application in political and economical systems, what has become unequivocally clear is that their application in the traditional command, totalitarian economies of eastern Europe has proved wholly and comprehensively unpalatable to the citizens of those countries and that the only possible future environment in which they can be pursued in the future is one of political and economic democracy. That is the great phenomenon that we are witnessing at the moment. It represents a transformation of contemporary history, and it is a course of events that we wholly welcome. </PARA>
<PARA> The foundations on which post-World War II Europe were built are being fundamentally shaken and reshaped. The cold war, which we had come to regard as an inevitable feature of contemporary European and global life, is now receding to the point where that description is just no longer applicable. The huge armies that faced each other across Europe already seem to be part of yesterday's world. How else can we interpret events when a soldier can patrol his border during the week and then stroll across it to the other side for some shopping over the weekend? Surely, the nuclear arsenals which the superpowers hold must be the next item on the international agenda to flow from this extraordinary rebirth of rethinking that we are seeing in Europe. </PARA>
<PARA> It is in that context that the Australian Government very warmly welcomes the decisions of President Bush and President Gorbachev to meet in Malta early next month. Their task is not to draw up a new blueprint for Europe. We do not wish to repeat the mistakes of Yalta, but it is important to maintain the flow of dialogue at the highest levels and avoid the kinds of misperceptions and misunderstandings that can creep into international relations when that kind of communication does not occur. It is far too early to try to prognosticate about the larger strategic implications of what is happening, but that there are implications and that some of them are already working themselves out-for example, in the United States defence budget decision making process-is not to be denied. </PARA>
<PARA> As the motion points out, the wall in Berlin is perhaps the centrepiece and focus of international attention at the moment. It has been a symbol of a world ideologically and geographically divided. The wall as a fortification has been well enough known in world history, but the wall as a barrier to fence in the country's own people in a prison state is one of those particularly ugly innovations of the twentieth century. Every year we learnt with horror of those who had died trying to breach that wall, the last victim being shot as recently as earlier this year. We sympathise with the families which are torn apart by the existence of that wall. It is, therefore, entirely appropriate that the Senate should focus, as it is in this motion, on the crumbling away of that wall as the most powerful and unhappy symbol of our times. </PARA>
<PARA> There are very real prospects for agreement on new security arrangements and understandings for the whole of Europe based on and catalysed by the new mood of East-West cooperation. We can hope for early full-scale agreement to match the earlier discussions that have occurred already on conventional force reduction in Europe. The North Atlantic Treaty Organisation has already formally tabled proposals and the initial Warsaw Pact reaction to those proposals has been very positive. The clear and unmistakeable impression we can properly glean from these remarkable developments is that both alliances are determined to succeed and to conclude expeditiously agreements on radical and stabilising reductions in what is still the most heavily militarised part of the world. </PARA>
<PARA> The motion goes on to welcome in effect the prospect of a new Europe. There are now hopeful signs that it will be a Europe of liberal democracy-small `l' liberal democracy-a Europe with a prosperous market economy; and a Europe where human rights are respected. These are the very values that Australia has defended over the years. That is why we can take particular pleasure in Europe's present day triumph. While the battle is not over, the evidence of change is overwhelming. In Hungary we can see a nation united in its desire to rejoin Europe as a multi-party democracy with open borders. In Poland we have seen the Marxist-Leninist party give up its leading role and serve under a non-communist Prime Minister. In the German Democratic Republic (GDR) we have been witness to a spectacular demonstration of people power in which the majorities of cities' inhabitants have demonstrated in favour of fundamental change, a display so overwhelming that the authorities had no option but to accept the will of their people and to break down that wall. </PARA>
<PARA> As I said in Question Time today, the situation is still rather less promising in Czechoslovakia, although obviously tumultuous events are occurring there too. It is distinctly less promising still in Bulgaria, although signs of movement are on the way with the replacement of a long serving and peculiarly lugubrious leader in recent times. In Romania, regrettably, there are no signs at all for the moment of that peculiarly unattractive regime succumbing to the same sentiments which undoubtedly beat in the heart of its people. It can, one presumes, be only a matter of time before movement occurs there, but obviously there is a long way to go. Albania, which is still preoccupied with the China of the 1950s, and with its particular model of social progress, remains off the map as far as Eastern Europe reform is concerned. We need to acknowledge the realities and the fact that not everything is happening at once, but an enormous amount is happening and I am sure that all honourable senators will join me in calling on the other nations of East Europe to embark upon that road of reform and democracy.</PARA>
<PARA> Senator Hill acknowledges the extent to which I am dealing with the substance of his motion-I am not merely using it as a rhetorical springboard-and it is appropriate that we applaud the courage, as the motion does, of those who defied repression and intimidation in the cause of greater political and economic freedom. One of the leading dissidents, Andrei Sakharov, is now a parliamentarian in the Soviet Union and is playing a major role in shaping the future of his country. Others have not found-to date anyway-so happy an ending. This is a particularly appropriate time to recall Imre Nagy, the Prime Minister of Hungary in 1956, who was hanged for his resistance and his espousal of some of the things that are happening today. It is at least comforting, to all except Imre Nagy, to know that he has been posthumously remembered for his services to his country. </PARA>
<PARA> The fate of yet another leading reformer reminds us that the battle is by no means won. Alexander Dubcek was arrested last Friday in Prague for participating in a demonstration calling for political reform there. One hopes that these are just the last gasps of the dinosaur as it succumbs to the momentum that has been so widely generated. But it is important that we continue to acknowledge that the millennium is not yet with us; there is still a road to travel. </PARA>
<PARA> In that context it is important that Australia continues to support actively, to the extent that we can realistically, given our geographical location and clout in that part of the world, this course of events. We have been active in the general Western response to these developments. We have worked with the G24-the group of Western nations-coordinating material assistance to eastern Europe. As I said today, recalling an earlier announcement, the Prime Minister has indicated a package of measures to provide economic assistance to Poland and Hungary. That package announced on 15 October includes food aid to Poland to the value of $5m; extension of the Australian system of tariff preferences to both Poland and Hungary; and the negotiation of double taxation agreements and investment protection agreements with both countries. </PARA>
<PARA> The thrust of these measures is not to provide charity but to give Poland and Hungary a better opportunity to help themselves and to reinvigorate their economies. The process of assistance in which we are participating will also, hopefully, help cement the incorporation of Poland and Hungary in the international economic system. We have worked closely with our Western allies to provide encouraging signals to the governments and peoples of eastern Europe and we will continue along that course. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Hill posed the question as to what we ought to be doing regarding our diplomatic representation in eastern Europe. I do not think that it was entirely appropriate to slap us around for our lack of foresight in closing the GDR mission as we did in 1986 in an environment of fiscal restraint which, I note, will be pursued with knobs on by any administration which we may be unfortunate to see Senator Hill lead. Our absence of foresight was a mere bagatelle as compared with that offered by the Opposition, not least in Mr Peacock's spectacular Cleopatra metaphor. As that has had something of an outing today, I will not belabour the point, but it is too good a prediction to miss putting into the public record Mr Peacock's response to the Prime Minister's statement on his trip to Hungary in July this year when he referred to the Prime Minister as being `like Cleopatra in a barge'. He stated:</PARA>
<PARA> Like Cleopatra in her barge, we had the sight of our Prime Minister sailing down the Danube proclaiming the world `was at a turning point in history'. </PARA>
<PARA>Mr Peacock continued:</PARA>
<PARA>The Prime Minister's belief that the new democratic process emerging in Hungary will automatically flow through to other eastern European nations is not borne out in fact. What of Czechoslovakia? What of East Germany?</PARA>

As to the extent to which it may be necessary to rethink the pattern of that representation in the light of current and future events, that is something which we will bear in mind.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We are trying to keep track of the situation and estimate its impact on Australia and the rest of the world as best we can. As I said in Question Time today, and as Senator Hill acknowledged politely and graciously, I will travel to Europe next month to participate first hand in this historic process, attending a likely ministerial meeting in Brussels of the G24 countries on 13 December. This will give me an opportunity to discuss with my Western ministerial colleagues their current thinking on the strategic and economic implications of what is happening. To the extent that it is possible to organise this in the time available, given all the tumultuous circumstances, I will also seek to make high level contact with the new reform leadership in Poland, Hungary, Czechoslovakia and, hopefully, the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics and the GDR in order both to get a first-hand feel for it and to meet the new leaders who will play a fundamental and important role in future. That will also enable Australia to assess the implications in this context of the impact it is likely to have on world economic developments, the trading system and trading and investment opportunities for Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> There will be opportunities for all Western nations in the re-ordered economies of Eastern Europe. For that reason alone I will seek to make contact with those responsible for economic management and trade policy to see where the opportunities for us might lie. We have to grasp those opportunities as best we can, but the real opportunities are those now opened up for the citizens of Eastern Europe themselves. It is their new-found freedom that we should be particularly celebrating today and I am glad to add my voice to that cause. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1"> -At the moment we are discussing a motion moved by Senator Hill with regard to a number of matters. The first one focuses on the breach in the Berlin Wall as a symbol of what is occurring. Indeed, it is a symbol of the types of situations which one day politically are considered immutable and the next day are swept away. Unfortunately, all too often it is assumed that this is done in a way that has nothing to do with Australia and that we are mere spectators of the changes and events that exist around us. That, of course, is not the case. Australia, under any administration, spends a considerable amount of money and expertise in seeking constructive change around the world. That is totally appropriate. Unfortunately, silly debates often take place within the Australian community about the usefulness of many of the activities we engage in-many of the international conferences that we and our representatives attend and, indeed, many of the diplomatic operations that are carried out. In many ways the events that occur around the world often flow from this type of activity.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The breach in the Berlin Wall is a symbol that we are moving to a new stage and that we must rethink the type of approach we have had in the past. It is somewhat unfortunate that Senator Hill's motion does not entirely manage to break free of the way of thinking that we cannot afford to continue with. I refer, for example, to part (5), which states:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . measures that will actively encourage genuine reform processes in Eastern Europe in a way consistent with Western security and economic interests. </PARA>
<PARA>The most secure type of operation for the West's economic interests is that the developments in eastern Europe may be in the interests of the people there, and the most secure interests that they see for themselves--</PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Senator Hill" NAMEID="BH4">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="BH4">Senator Hill</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That might therefore be in our interests.</PARA></TALK.START>
</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="2I4">Senator MACKLIN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think that merely to pose a suggestion that the types of developments that ought to go on there should be ones which are useful for us is, first, naive and, secondly, not useful in the sense that the ones which finally will bed down and take root in those countries are those which are in their national interest.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We have seen a very clear indication on the part of the people of many of the countries in eastern Europe that the type of economic and political regime that has been operating is not in their interests but has been operating in the interest of small cliques and groups. Hence the people themselves have finally come to the breaking point. But, of course, people are able to be intimidated. One only had to view on television in recent days the `spontaneous applause' on 60 or 65 occasions for President Ceausescu of Romania in, of all things, a six-hour speech to know that dictators are alive and well and that people can be intimidated and terrorised into accepting them. </PARA>
<PARA> That prospect, of course, can re-emerge in eastern Europe and, we must acknowledge, in the rest of the world as well. It behoves us to be slightly humble. Even a country in the organisation to which we belong and with which we have so many ties, the Commonwealth of Nations, managed to create its own dictatorship and overthrow a democracy in our own region within the last couple of years. These types of changes have occurred in the past and may occur in the future. They will not be prevented simply by what I heard Senator Hill refer to as the `quality of life'-by which I think he was actually referring to the standard of living. They will be prevented not simply by economic measures but by worldwide support for a whole range of issues which I would like to call the quality of life issues. They are issues of freedom and democracy and the support of people who are poor and oppressed. There is also the recognition-which has now been acknowledged, I think-of the complete unwillingness of people to live any longer in a constantly and increasingly polluted environment. That is a very important element in the changes, for example, that are taking place in the Soviet Union. </PARA>
<PARA> In Senator Hill's terms, the Senate should welcome the prospects for a more democratic future for the peoples of eastern Europe. Certainly it should. I think that that is the most important item of Senator Hill's motion. We should welcome an increasing ability of the people of eastern Europe to determine their own future in a way which is in their interests and for their development. Some stupid articles have been written about recent events being a triumph of capitalism. They are silly and probably do not require very much rebuttal, but it is naive to suggest that people were looking for some of the aspects in our society that we in this chamber spend a lot of time trying to eradicate and constantly pass laws trying to prevent. There is no way in the world, for example, that any of the Eastern bloc countries want our level of imprisonment, or the gross drug trade, or any of the other ills we have managed to spawn in our society. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us not be overweeningly proud that we have managed to develop a social structure that does not incorporate ills and problems. We have them. They are part of our structure and they are part of the way that we have chosen to organise ourselves economically. We have a lot of developing to do and a lot of changes to initiate within our own societies. I suppose we can acknowledge that many of these societies which have up until recently suffered under oppression have been able to move in the direction they have. </PARA>
<PARA> One particularly important element in all of this exercise, of course, is the incredible change that has taken place in the prospects of world peace. It was not many years ago that that famous clock had its hands moved much closer to 12. When they were asked their greatest worry, it was that the world would not even be around. That was not so long ago. Indeed, it was only a couple of years ago that that was turning up in the polls taken of youth in this country. </PARA>
<PARA> What has occurred since, of course, has been nothing short of a revolution. It has been initiated from the side of the Soviet Union, which is rather extraordinary. Earlier, Senator Crichton-Browne gave a most extraordinary interpretation of what has been occurring. One point he made concerned this particular matter. It was the Soviet Union that moved first and moved constructively to unravel, but the reasons for this would obviously be a matter of dispute between us. I freely acknowledge that a large amount of it was driven by sheer economic desperation as the Soviet Union economy very rapidly became unravelled. In fact it was the Soviet Union that moved under its current President and it was, at least in part, the response of the United States which enabled that momentum to be carried through. What we as a small country have to do is keep up the pace of those types of developments. We do not do that by being a sycophant of either, but by stating our voice as a small country that has an interest in this matter. The momentum towards peace, the momentum towards disarmament and the unravelling of the nuclear insanity that still exists must be a high priority, and we in the West have as much responsibility as the countries of Eastern Europe to engage in that activity. </PARA>
<PARA> The proposition in Senator Hill's comments at paragraph (d), concerning the considerable uncertainty as to the future course of events in Europe, is acknowledged. Certainly, one would have to have blinkers on not to know that many of the positive changes that have taken place could be overturned as readily as they have come. It is in our interests to make sure that they are not. How do we actually do that? One of the ways that the Government has chosen is for the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade (Senator Gareth Evans) to visit Europe. I thought the Opposition's rather lukewarm support for that was rather odd. It seems to me to be most appropriate that a senior Minister of the Government go to eastern Europe at this stage to present from the point of view of Australia another symbol against the Berlin Wall symbol and indicate that we recognise the important changes that have taken place. It is a pity that Senator Hill, on behalf of the Opposition, could not give warmer support for that initiative by the Government. For our part, we wish Senator Evans well in that move not only in terms of demonstrating that Australia is very supportive of the changes that are taking place but also in terms of our economic interests, to see where in fact we need to go economically and in trade. </PARA>
<PARA> The Australian embassy in the German Democratic Republic was mentioned by both Senator Hill and Senator Evans. I think I am the only person on record as opposing the closure of the GDR embassy at the time. The reason was not that I had prescience that this was about to occur; I wish I had, but I did not. The reason I opposed it was that I have always seen the GDR as being the linchpin in whatever occurred in that region in the future. I did not expect what occurred in the GDR to occur. I must admit that, even two or three months ago, I would have thought it almost impossible. But I did know at the time that we should be there as a listening post and be able to understand the types of movements that were taking place because undoubtedly the GDR has been, is currently and will be, in the near future at least, a country very important to an understanding of what is occurring in the Eastern bloc. An embassy there would be more important than our embassies in Warsaw and a number of other countries. That is not to denigrate them; it is merely to say that the GDR does have a fundamental role probably because of its strategic and geographic locality and also because it has been the most successful of the Eastern bloc countries economically and has always been a powerful voice in their deliberations. It seemed to me that it was, in that vein, a silly move to close down the embassy there. I hope that the Foreign Minister, in his visits, will look very closely at the possibility of restoring that diplomatic mission in Berlin as again an essential ingredient in our total diplomatic moves. I thought it was silly at the time, not because I had the foresight to know what would occur but because it was then a very important country in understanding the eastern European area. </PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Democrats support the motion moved today and welcome this move by Senator Hill and the Opposition in this chamber and in the other place. We are living in exciting times. We are living in dramatic times. We are living in times full of hope. It is important that we in this chamber add our words and encouragement to those very hopeful prospects that are occurring, and I thank Senator Hill for undertaking this move. While we are mindful, as he suggested, of the uncertainties of the future, we are supportive of the changes that are taking place and certainly wish that all of those moves to democracy, liberty and freedom will be encouraged by the GDR being joined by other countries in quick succession. I refer to those countries that have not joined in any sense, such as Albania, or in any constructive way, such as Romania. Little has been done in Bulgaria. Even the Czechoslovakian situation remains extremely unclear. The moves in Czechoslovakia could go in any direction as of even today. Opening Czechoslovakia will be a difficult task if repression on a mass scale takes place by those leaders clinging to power in what is undoubtedly a vastly unpopular government. </PARA>
<PARA> The situation is sitting on a knife edge. We have seen some wondrous things take place and we wish that more will occur. At the same time we must say that the changes that will take place and really take root are those that are in the genuine interests of the people of those countries, not necessarily to construct the type of country that we happen to like but to construct the type of country and social system that looks after those people and delivers to them security, freedom and reasonable economic growth and development. If that happens, we can be assured that it will continue; if that does not happen, the country will undoubtedly close down again and it may be another 50 years before we see any lights on the hill and we will all be plunged back into a situation to which we do not wish to return, one in which the world itself teeters on the edge of nuclear war and holocaust. We have moved away from that in a fashion which I repeat is almost unbelievable. It is enormously hopeful for those of us who politically spent a lot of time on this issue that the countries are now in a position to be unravelling their nuclear arsenals and spending on the poor and the underprivileged everywhere in the world those vast amounts which today are spent on weaponry. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I share the general sense of hope and welcome the changes that have been taking place very dramatically in recent times in eastern Europe. I am grateful to Senator Hill for putting forward a motion which gives us a chance to express our hope that these changes for further democracy will take place. These are indeed amazing times. Only a few years ago, we would not have thought it possible that the Berlin Wall would have crumbled to the extent that it has.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In general terms, I support the motion, but come in with a word of warning about the very last line of the motion which suggests that we should encourage the reform processes in eastern Europe in a way consistent with Western security and economic interests. We should be thinking about global security, not Western or Eastern. That is part of the cold war thinking that has to go. That is the dramatic change which we have to embrace wholeheartedly. It will impose some risks and it will make people feel nervous because of the rate of change that has taken place. We should think of security in a global sense rather than an East-West sense because that is the stuff of the cold war, that is the stuff we have to leave behind. We must not look at this in terms of what is best for us or our security on one side of the ideological divide. We have to move beyond both communism and capitalism. The world is doing that at a very great pace. Environmental concerns have brought the world together because we have to think as one global community and not as part of one ideological set opposing another. </PARA>
<PARA> I welcome the motion in its expression of our hope for greater democracy and its applauding the courage of those who have struggled for openness over the years since this divide has been in place, since families have been separated. The enormous courage displayed by so many people in seeking this greater openness certainly needs to be recognised. I include in that group people who have been extraordinarily courageous, those who have been persecuted for belonging to peace groups behind what has been called the Iron Curtain. They have been there all these years and we have been in contact with them. I have continually mentioned in this place-I think some honourable senators have not believed it-that opposition to the Warsaw Pact was alive and well within the Warsaw Pact. People who have been working in an underground sense all these years are now vindicated in the efforts that they have made. Certainly they have been working for disarmament and have opposed the militarisation of the Warsaw Pact as much as we in the West have opposed the militarisation of the Western alliance. </PARA>
<PARA> We need not only to look at the situation in eastern Europe and the importance that it has for all of us globally, but also to bring that rhetoric and our hopes for genuine democracy to our region. We should also bring the work for disarmament into our region. That is what my notice of motion earlier today was about. The major superpowers of both East and West should reduce their military expenditure. It is high time that they realised the need to do that. It is absolutely essential, as Senator Macklin said, that we pay attention to the very real social needs which remain unmet. Millions of people could well do with military expenditure being redirected towards meeting the basic social needs of human beings. Our environment could also benefit from some of the billions of dollars we pour into militarisation. That money could go into repairing our environment so that we can all live as global citizens belonging to one world. Increasingly, it has to be seen as that. </PARA>
<PARA> Going further than that, I call on the Australian Government to respond. We heard from the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade (Senator Gareth Evans) many very encouraging words about the situation in eastern Europe, but he did not translate what that means for Australia in our region, what it means for us here. Will the promise of the former Minister for Foreign Affairs, Mr Hayden, of regional disarmament, looking at naval arms control, especially in the Pacific, be on the agenda now? It should be. I encourage our Foreign Minister to take up the enormous challenges and opportunities which are now presented for the Pacific also to be a part of the disarmament process, also to recognise that the cold war is over and to look seriously at the question of naval arms control in our region. </PARA>
<PARA> The weapons that have been dismantled in western Europe-of course, I join with others in being very glad about that-the intermediate nuclear range systems, are now being deployed at sea. One-third of the world's nuclear weapons are on board ships and submarines which are all over the place in our oceans and are increasingly coming into our ports. The Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories (Senator Richardson) would do well to acknowledge that that is also part of the environment movement. The very people he disparaged in his answer to my question earlier this afternoon are the same people whom he is wooing so assiduously in trying to capture the green vote. It is about time that Senator Richardson made the connection. Disarmament is an environment issue. Getting rid of nuclear weapons which are an environment risk to our ports is an environment issue and the Minister needs to understand that because every time he puts me down so rudely, as he did this afternoon in answer to my very reasonable question about nuclear weapons coming into our ports, he offends a lot of people. </PARA>
<PARA> We also have to understand that many of the world's crisis points have related to and continue to relate to East-West tensions. We have seen that exemplified in our region. We need to call again for the removal of all foreign bases in our region. That includes the Soviet base at Cam Ranh Bay, which the Secretary-General of the Soviet Union has put on the international agenda. We need to call for the removal of all United States bases in the region. That has not been put on the agenda by the United States, but it could be put on the agenda by Australia. We have to understand that the ANZUS alliance was framed in the hysteria of cold war rhetoric in the early 1950s when, as Senator Hamer pointed out to me this afternoon, Australia's concern was about the pact that had recently been signed with Japan. We have to understand that many of those tensions which were in existence in the early 1950s are increasingly irrelevant. Thus we need to challenge our membership of the ANZUS treaty; so we need to step up our moves for disarmament in this region; so we need to step up our calls for the naval arms race to be put on the international agenda so that there is some independent monitoring of the nuclear weapons which are on board ships and submarines at sea at the moment. This is all part of the democratisation which must take place and which will flow on from the exciting changes which have taken place in Eastern Europe. We cannot underestimate the nature of the change. </PARA>
<PARA> The decade of the 1980s will go down in history as a decade of enormous change, when we move from the cold war concepts of East and West into a global thinking pattern. That is very exciting and encouraging. Australia could be taking a greater part in it by questioning our continued involvement in one of those two superpower blocs. We need to be part of the democratisation process too, which means looking very closely at Australia's current defence relationships, our current expenditure on militarisation which is increasing when in other countries it is decreasing in response to democratisation. We need to challenge what is now being referred to as Australia's new militarism, which is not appropriate in the current economic climate and certainly not appropriate in the current international climate which is moving further towards reconciliation, discussion and democratisation. I welcome the changes.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Opposition opposes this motion. I am sorry that we have not really had the opportunity to discuss it across the chamber beforehand, but the situation is that clearly the chamber must take priority. Already two Senate committees have been given leave to sit during the course of the Senate sittings. I have to say to the Government, the Democrats and the Independents that this has been done most reluctantly by us, but on each occasion it was explained to us that the priorities were absolutely essential. The first matter is in relation to the pilots dispute and, with the urgency of that matter, one could understand why the Senate would accept that there would be a need for one of its committees to meet while the Senate was sitting to consider that matter. The next is in relation to a foreign affairs matter where a representative of the Soviet Union has apparently come out from the Soviet Union specifically to deal with this particular matter and it is agreed that the only time he can give evidence is apparently this evening.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There are not so many senators and, when one looks around the chamber, one sees that the situation is becoming quite out of hand. When we start talking about a committee to deal with regulations in relation to migration, the Opposition thinks that it must draw the line. We had a meeting today at which we pointed out to one of our colleagues, who was raising this question as to whether or not a committee could meet, that it would be possible for the committee to meet formally either during the luncheon recess or during the dinner recess. They could overcome the formal responsibilities in relation to the meeting procedure and thereafter they could then meet informally while the Senate was sitting. That would mean that they would then be responsible for answering the calls of the Senate, including the answering of the bells for divisions and the bells for quorums. </PARA>
<PARA> If we continue down the path of allowing Senate committees to meet willy-nilly during the course of the Senate sitting, then ultimately it will get to the stage where the Senate frankly will just not have a quorum available. This is a ridiculous situation and one that we are strongly opposed to. I have been in this Parliament now for 13 years and for many, many years-as long as I have been in this Parliament-we have been opposing Senate committees meeting during the course of the Senate sessions. I can recall my predecessors in this place who used to lecture me at great length-Reg Wright and Jim Cavanagh on the Labor side and others-and say it was outrageous that Senate committees should be allowed to meet. </PARA>
<PARA> If the Government has set the program-as it has-currently requiring the Senate to sit right up until 22 December and, in effect, sit four or five days a week right up until 22 December, then all I can say to the Government is that it had better get its act into order and reorganise its program so that there is time for the Senate committees to meet. We are going to oppose this motion, and if the Government would like to take a division, that will be the result. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;in reply-I listened very carefully and closely to the words of Senator Lewis. I also listened with a degree of sympathy to the sentiments that he was expressing in opposing the motion. I do not think that too many people around Australia realise the workload of senators, not only in time in the chamber, but also in committees. It is a work load that grows exponentially as the session heads to a conclusion, with the necessity for committees of the Parliament to present reports to the Parliament to meet deadlines imposed by the Parliament.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Migration Regulations Committee is not a committee that the Government sought to have established. We opposed its establishment, but it was the will of the chamber that such a committee be established. In fulfilling the task imposed on it by the Parliament, the Committee has met with a number of obstacles, not the least of which is the fact that the regulations which go with the new Act covering migration to Australia are extremely complicated. They run to about 180 pages. The Committee members received the draft regulations only on 31 October. They met for three days the week before last, one day last week, and all day yesterday. They have certainly put in the hours in attempting to fulfil the obligations imposed upon them. As the Committee has pursued its business, it has been necessary to seek clarification on various items that are included in the draft regulations, and many of the answers to those questions were delivered to the Committee only yesterday. </PARA>
<PARA> We have a deadline to meet. The deadline which was imposed was to report back to the Minister by tomorrow and report to the Parliament prior to 19 December. There are all sorts of printing schedules and such to be considered as well. The committee is endeavouring to fulfil the obligations imposed upon it by the Parliament and, quite honestly, this is the only way that we can fulfil those obligations. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to raise yet again the question of annual reports arriving long after Senate Estimates committees have met to discuss matters to which these reports relate. I want to draw attention in particular to the annual report of the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) which now, I remind the Committee, is a one-line entry in the Estimates but which involves the expenditure of considerable amounts of money. When I asked questions at the Senate Estimates Committee on the CAA, its role in air safety and the expenditures involved in air safety, I was told that the annual report was not available and that there was no requirement on the Civil Aviation Authority to provide an annual report at any reasonable time. There was not even a suggestion that it should provide a draft to the Senate Estimates Committee because it is one of these new, ludicrous structures which this Government has created, a sort of corporatised body which it seems is responsible effectively neither to this Parliament nor to the public. As I said earlier about Telecom Australia, it is the worst of all worlds.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I want to stress that as far as I am concerned the CAA situation is totally and grossly unsatisfactory. At that Senate Estimates Committee I asked Mr Freeland of the Civil Aviation Authority, `When do you expect the CAA's annual report to be released?'. His response was, `It is our first annual report, as you know. It is our first year of operation. I would think it should be tabled about November. It is basically complete and has to be printed'. So this report was basically complete at the time the Senate Estimates Committee was inquiring into the operations of the CAA, but the report was not available to the Committee; there was, roughly, a one-line appropriation. I suppose it is appropriate to describe this time as `about November'. It is about the end of November; we are two-thirds of the way through November. </PARA>
<PARA> I want the Minister to give some sort of indication, if he can, as to when we can expect the CAA's annual report. Not having the CAA's annual report or any of these annual reports at a time when the Senate Estimates committees meet, which is the only time they are subject to any kind of scrutiny, is like having the annual general meeting of a corporation before the report is issued. I do not know of any other occasion when the Senate is given the opportunity to examine these bodies in any detail, when any real evidence can be presented and their responsibilities to Parliament can be discharged. As you know, Mr Temporary Chairman, a five-minute speech on reports is hardly the place for a coherent examination of the multi-million dollar activities of some of these bodies. This Government in particular has shuffled these bodies increasingly into this halfway house or never-never land, which diminishes Parliament's opportunity of thorough and proper investigation. </PARA>
<PARA> The very serious matter of air safety is being examined by a Senate committee as part of the general inquiry into the question of the impact of the pilots strike. This subject had a real relevance and should have been made available to the Senate Estimates Committee at that time. The Committee even held an extra meeting to discuss questions of air safety, but nothing from the CAA annual report was available to us about air safety, even though I did ask about that matter. </PARA>
<PARA> I will raise this matter in another forum, but it seems ludicrous that these bodies are exempted from the request to departments to provide their annual reports in good time for Senate Estimates committees. In fact, the Chairman interrupted my questioning during the Senate Estimates Committee meeting by noting that the guidelines for departmental annual reports are to be made available, if possible, even in draft form, for Estimates committees. However, the guidelines for statutory authorities do not contain that requirement. As I said, I believe it is a very bad principle and my first question is: When is the annual report of the CAA-a report, one would imagine, of some substance and relevance-to be made available?</PARA>
<PARA> I am also concerned about the annual report of the Federal Airports Corporation (FAC). As I recall it, that report became available to us after the Senate Committee deliberated on the matter, although the letter from Mr Ralph Willis to Mr D. W. Sullivan, the Chairman, appears to bear no date. I cannot recall whether or not this report was available to us at the time. However, as far as I am concerned, the FAC has been involved in a one-sided dispute with me about security at Sydney Airport. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It would be nice if I could get somewhere when I went in. I know that there is no industrial dispute in the airlines because the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) has said so, but one cannot get anywhere. The problem with Sydney Airport security is that one can get into secure areas far too easily. Officers from the Auditor-General's Office managed to gain access to the tarmac and to secure areas without any pass or authorisation of any kind. They reported all these matters in an auditor's report and I raised them with the Australian Customs Service in the appropriate Senate Estimates Committee.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I have made some serious charges in this chamber by repeating the charges made by Customs officers and the Auditor-General. Why did the FAC present a totally misleading and, I believe, disgraceful report on 7 September 1989 in which it claimed that the problems raised by Customs officers and the Auditor-General had largely been resolved when that was simply false, as was evidenced by the comments made by the Customs officers to the Senate Estimates Committee? I wonder whether the Minister has any response to this matter. I might add that all that appeared in the annual report from the FAC was that a review was undertaken at each airport and security had been improved. It has been improved so much that Customs officers believe that it is totally and grossly inadequate. </PARA>
<PARA> What concerns me about the lack of any Government response to this matter is that since I raised this matter in the Senate Estimates Committee, I think on 3 October, according to Customs officers a meeting was to be held with the FAC and other relevant bodies at Sydney Airport to discuss the urgent need to improve security. Can the Minister inform the Committee what has happened about that meeting? Were decisions taken that would remove the concerns expressed by the Customs officers? If so, we have heard nothing. The Government has not paid us the courtesy of responding to my expressed concerns about security at Sydney Airport. If staff members of the Auditor-General can walk freely onto the tarmac at Sydney Airport and can report that gates that are supposed to be locked in fact provide ready access because they are unlocked, it seems that we have a real security problem. It is not as though terrorism is unknown in the airline industry. It is not as though there is no real risk that people may behave in a wild, reckless and dangerous way with either threats or actual terrorist activity. The fact is that these things are real. </PARA>
<PARA> We have an immense facade of x-ray machines and heavens knows what, which have been installed at great expense, to take baggage or people into security areas and the Auditor-General says, `All you have to do is to walk through the right gate or door'. I would like the Minister to help me, if he could, in these areas because it is a matter of some urgency. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to address some very important issues of broadcasting policy which I think it is now abundantly clear to the Australian population are totally out of control under the present Government. Not so long ago Senator Evans was vaguely in control of this area, but certainly no-one is in control now. What strikes me above all is the backfilling that has been going on in recent weeks which I think demands an explanation. I hope Senator Evans is sufficiently on top of what has been happening in Cabinet when he chooses to pass through Australia these days to be able to at least throw some light on the difficulties that have emerged. One, of course, is the fiasco that resulted in a journalist writing a report in the Sydney Morning Herald on a briefing she was given by a senior departmental officer which then resulted in an extraordinary letter to the editor, but otherwise no communication with the press, by the Minister for Transport and Communications, Mr Willis.</PARA></TALK.START>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="LD4">Senator ALSTON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As usual, he is sleeping soundly on the sidelines. He is presumably back in the country by now, but why he ever left is a matter of speculation. One can only presume that the kitchen got too hot and he realised there was nothing more to be gained by hanging around. As a result he took the last trip available to him before the change of government. One can well understand why he would do that, but it is certainly not in the best interests of the broadcasting industry or, indeed, broadcasting regulation in general.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> What is particularly deplorable and what I think needs explanation are the two faces that are being presented in this area. The remarks that appeared in the Sydney Morning Herald on 3 November made it clear that the fundamental review that Mr Willis announced on 1 November-when I say `announced' I mean announced by way of press release-was going to canvass a whole range of issues, including the possible abolition of the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal (ABT), the abolition or amendment of ownership levels, the relaxation of foreign ownership rules and the possibility of allowing self-regulation in areas such as the Australian and children's content requirements. That report provoked a flurry of outrage and indignation to the point that the Minister was compelled to write to the Sydney Morning Herald and basically deny the proposition. But what he did not do was to rule out the possibility that this fundamental review that is going on in the back rooms will be canvassing those very matters. </PARA>
<PARA> It is a matter of acute concern to the Australian public in the run-up to the election to know precisely what is on the Government's agenda. Is the Government saying, through Mr Willis, that this fundamental review process will simply not canvass issues that might touch on the abolition of the ABT, the abolition of ownership levels, the relaxation of foreign ownership rules and self-regulation in general? Are those matters simply off the agenda altogether or have they been put out in the back room so that they can be dealt with in due course by that review team?</PARA>
<PARA> That, I think, is a matter that is very much exercising the minds of people who include Mr Saunderson and who are about to do to Mr Willis what they did to Senator Evans. Senator Evans, at a time when he still had a bit of energy and drive, was quite interested in the concept of deregulation in the telecommunications industry. Senator Evans pursued with some vigour the notions that would have involved substantial deregulation and the exposing of Telecom Australia to competition. Of course, the fatal mistake was that those plans got out. The draft report of the task force which Senator Evans had established got into the public domain, and, as a result, we saw the establishment of the Telecom monopoly protection society, which passed under the name of the Telecom Caucus liaison committee. That proceeded substantially to derail all of Senator Evans's fond hopes for deregulation in this industry. As a result, he was so comprehensively rolled that we now have probably the most protected and sheltered telecommunications environment in the Western world. </PARA>
<PARA> That was a tragedy that does not deserve to be repeated, yet that is precisely what seems to be in train now, because Mr Saunderson, no doubt basking in the reflected glory of his Caucus colleagues and about their triumphs and successes over Senator Evans, is on the verge of attempting to repeat the same success. Various newspaper reports have suggested that the Australian Labor Party Caucus has begun to fight moves by the Department to deregulate broadcasting policy. Various articles suggest that backbenchers are furious at reports that the Government may be considering an approach similar to the Opposition's policy. The next meeting of the Caucus committee is expected to insist that a three-member subcommittee be formed to counter the push. There are no prizes for guessing who will be on that subcommittee. It will comprise John Saunderson, Neil O'Keefe and Roger Price, the same triumvirate who were successful in knocking off Senator Evans and any hopes for deregulation under this Government-one of the jewels in the micro-economic reform crown which the Government hoped to be able to parade before the electorate, which was unceremoniously ripped off at the scalp. As a result, we have absolutely no reforms in that area. </PARA>
<PARA> It looks as though history is about to repeat itself. The thing which is of most concern is that the Minister will not come clean. On the one hand he is saying that there are no plans to abolish, demolish or fundamentally restructure and deregulate. On the other hand, of course, that does not rule out the possibility that there may well be plans in the not-too-distant future. I think we are entitled to know, in the run-up to the election, whether this Government is going to propose any such thing or whether it is simply off the agenda. We should know whether Caucus, Mr Saunderson and a number of Mr Willis's other like-minded friends, have decided that enough is enough and there will be no further reform this side of the election, or whether there are those who share the concern and frustration of Mr Keating. </PARA>
<PARA> It is quite clear from a report in the Sydney Morning Herald only two weeks ago that Mr Keating was very upset at the total lack of progress in this area. One can understand Mr Keating's frustration because he is probably aware of the words of the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) in the June 1987 election campaign when he promised urgently to reform this nightmarish legislation. Of course 2 1/2 years having gone by, precisely nothing has happened. The proof of that-because Mr Willis, I presume, would deny it and say, `Well, we've had policy reports and reviews and we've considered this and that'-is a press release put out over the Minister's name, but which states that further information can be obtained from Mick Trimmer. I suppose that suggests that it is really Mick Trimmer's press release, but nonetheless it is issued under Mr Willis's name. It begins with this headline: `Hawke Government begins reform of broadcasting laws' and is dated 1 November 1989. If the Minister had bothered to look at the press release that his principal officer was pumping out, he would have realised that that was a horrible concession of failure. To announce, 2 1/2 years later, that the Hawke Government was to begin reform of the broadcasting laws is a damning indictment of all that has taken place over that period. </PARA>
<PARA> There have been any number of calls. One would have to say that Mr Saunderson and his crew have beavered away manfully-usually pretty much in the wrong direction, although some of my colleagues on the Standing Committee on Transport, Communications and Infrastructure have endeavoured to maintain the pace of deregulation, but Mr Saunderson's propensities are precisely in the opposition direction. As a result, the most that Mr Saunderson has contributed to the debate so far has been comprehensively to bucket the policy review document that appeared in July this year. Mr Saunderson branded it as totally inadequate, defective in many respects and precisely contrary to the deregulation proposals that it purported to embrace. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Saunderson was very critical of the fact that the Chairman of the ABT was a member of that committee of review. I share that concern because the end result, not only in that document but in a second go via the current broadcasting amendment proposals, is a vastly increased set of powers for the ABT. I think that is quite unjustified and certainly has not been rationalised in any way by the Government. All we had in the Minister's second reading speech was a few vacuous words about what long-term changes there will be and how they will be introduced in the first half of next year. We know, and blind Freddy knows, that the Parliament is most unlikely to resume once it rises and that we will not be looking at any more broadcasting reform policies introduced by this Government at all. All the Minister is doing is deferring. That is a tragedy but I hope we will have the opportunity to rectify it in the near future. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Gareth Evans, who is in a position to understand all that has gone on because he presided over this policy of drift for 12 months or more, knows full well that commitments have been given in terms of reforms. He knows the furore that erupted when that article appeared in the Sydney Morning Herald and that there had to be demotions and at least one cosmetic replacement of a certain person. Despite Mrs Kelly pretending that all of these reform items were off the agenda, all Mr Willis said on 3 November was that there are no plans of this order. If there are no plans will there be any plans in the run-up to the election? Is this Government contemplating any further forms of substantial deregulation? If it is not, what is the fundamental review doing? Why is there any need for it? If it is, we are entitled to know what is on the agenda and what is not. I strongly suspect that all these items are very much on the agenda. They have simply been put on the back burner so that the Government can pretend to those in the community who have a vested interest in the regulation that nothing will be touched but back there it is business as usual and that that review committee will continue to contemplate a number of the very necessary deregulatory proposals that have been widely canvassed in the industry. </PARA>
<PARA> Unless Senator Gareth Evans and Mr Willis-when he finally gets back and decides to address these issues once more-are prepared to come clean, the Australian public will inevitable assume that what is really going on in the Department is a significant deregulatory approach, one that we on this side of the chamber think is long overdue and one which the Government does not have the intestinal fortitude to embrace prior to the election. The challenge is stark: either the Minister comes clean and explains what is going on in the review process or we will assume that in any event. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I suppose I should be bowled over by the fierceness of that rhetorical onslaught and the formidable character of the dilemma with which Senator Alston has presented me in his concluding words, but I am afraid, for all the rhetorical huff and puff we have had from Senator Alston, I am going to disappoint him. I understand this issue well enough to know how complex and sensitive matters of broadcasting policy are and how extremely difficult technically they are in a context in which the Government is wrestling these days with multiple different modes of transmission, multiple different kinds of subject matter and a legislative apparatus that is manifestly not well equipped to cope with the current technical reality. The dilemma has been stated often enough and there may well be scope for significant changes in the way in which the regulatory arrangements operate to deal with that new reality.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I am not, however, going to pre-empt in any way the course of the Government's inquiry into these difficult and delicate matters. We acknowledge, and no doubt we will continue to acknowledge, the legitimacy of the Australian content provisions and provisions so far as children's television is concerned. It is difficult to imagine in any conceivable legislative reordering scenario that kind of regulatory structure disappearing. But beyond that it really is a matter for close attention by the Government over whatever time frame is necessary for sensible conclusions to be drawn and communicated to the community and appropriate discussion held. No assumptions should be made at all in any direction about the nature of the Government's preliminary thinking on this matter based on the kinds of anxieties about timetable and so on that Senator Alston has sought to articulate. We have just experienced a bit of an all purpose rave which Senator Alston can turn on and off like a tap for these occasions. It is not one that moves us to respond in any more detail than I have. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Could we be given some enlightenment as to whether Caucus is proposing to or has formed the same sort of body that overrode the telecommunications task force? I ask that question because despite the fact that I imagine the Minister's instinctive reaction will be to say that Caucus matters are of no concern to the public, the fact is-and I was amazed that the press did not fasten onto this when it first surfaced last time-that that three-member committee had more power than any Senate committee. It met with departmental officers. It reshaped the whole structure of that task force as Senator Gareth Evans well knows. The task force was very much in favour of removing Telecom's first phone monopoly. It was in favour of allowing a second cellular network licence operator to come into the business and I think there was even a time when it contemplated some serious competition on the basic network. All of that was turned around and Senator Evans had his head metaphorically kicked in by that three-member committee which was able to walk the corridors of the Department and was able to influence Ministers in a way that no public servant could do-certainly in a way that no member of the Parliament would be able to do. I doubt that any other backbencher on the Government side, let alone any frontbencher on our side, would have had any sort of access to the task force deliberations in the way that that three-member committee did.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> If we are going to have that sort of outfit riding side-saddle on broadcasting review policy in this country, it should be pretty clear that it will be calling the shots. We accept that it will be headed by John Saunderson from the Left who is very much in favour of regulations. He has made it clear on a number of occasions that he wants to extend the powers of the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal. Mr Roger Price, the second member of the Committee, like Mr Saunderson, is a former Telecom Australia employee who is steeped in trade union folklore. He is very much a public sector advocate and very much a regulator. Neil O'Keefe, who is the third member of the committee, is an old trade union advocate. So the three members of the committee are all tarred with the same brush, all have the same view of the world and all were immensely successful in overturning deregulation in that area. Therefore, I suggest to the Minister that the public has a right to know whether the broadcasting policy will be suborned in the same manner that the telecommunications policy was undermined. If newspaper reports are correct, there is a very serious public policy issue at stake. I believe that the community is entitled to know the score. If Caucus has not decided to let them loose on this occasion, maybe a few minds can be put at rest quite simply by telling us, `It ain't so'. I fear the worst. I invite the Minister to inform the Committee as to the current state of play. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I find it extraordinary that Senator Gareth Evans should somehow pretend that this is just mere media speculation. The Australian Financial Review of 8 November reported:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Despite Mr Hutchinson's removal as head of the broadcasting review team yesterday, Caucus back-benchers are still planning to establish a Caucus liaison committee to monitor-</PARA>

<PARA>the departmental review. </PARA>
<PARA> ``You can't just blame one individual. There is a need for Caucus to get involved given the tendency and direction of the review,'' left-wing convener, Mr John Saunderson, said yesterday. </PARA>
<PARA>It has to be abundantly clear from that that Mr Saunderson is determined to get deeply involved, determined to bring this review process back under control, as he sees it, and very much to influence the course and direction of policy formulation. If that is not a matter of public interest, I do not know what is. If what Senator Evans said is to be taken at face value, then the public is to be treated with contempt because it will not be informed as to who is really pulling the strings, who is going to make the real decisions and where the influences will come from. If they are not matters that we are entitled to know about, then we might as well not even get press releases or be told what Ministers have in mind until we see legislation in the Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> It is a preposterous proposal. It is probably simply an example of Senator Evans being too tired to concentrate on public policy issues which once were very close to his heart and which no doubt he used to take great enjoyment in debating, but now it is all too difficult; we should all go away and let him get on with making the right decisions and introducing legislation when he feels like it. I dare say that he has not drafted a press release for years. Whilst one can understand that sense of overwhelming tiredness, the fact remains that there is a large body of the community which is deeply interested in the policy formulation processes and reads Mr Saunderson saying, `There is a need for Caucus to get involved, given the tendency and direction of the review'. Given Mr Saunderson's antecedents, they are entitled to presume that his involvement will not be benign as far as deregulation is concerned. I therefore invite the Minister to tell us why it is that the public is not entitled to know whether that committee has in fact been established. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have been listening with some interest to the debate going on between my colleague Senator Alston and the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade (Senator Gareth Evans), if I can call it a debate when it has been so one-sided. We have listened tonight, in the latter part of the discussion on the Department of Transport and Communications appropriations, to a series of quite reasoned comments put forward by my colleague Senator Alston and a series of almost discourteous replies from the Minister, in the sense that he has been simply brushing off the points made from this side of the chamber in a manner which does a great deal of credit, I suppose, to his arrogance but nothing whatsoever to his parliamentary performance.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I would like to extend the debate a little. Senator Alston was particularly focusing upon the shambles in the communications area of the portfolio of the Minister for Transport and Communications, Mr Willis, whom Senator Evans represents in this place. The truth is that the communications area is not the only element of shambles in that portfolio. The whole portfolio is one great shambles. Without wishing to be unduly personal to the Minister who is responsible for the shambles, I have to say that that is no great surprise to anybody with any knowledge of the Minister's performance as a Minister. When the Minister in question held the portfolio of industrial relations, that was also a shambles. It still is in many respects, but at least we have some better idea of what is going on there today than we did at that time. </PARA>
<PARA> Other areas that the Minister in question is responsible for and which are included in the votes before us are such areas as the waterfront and the Australian shipping industry-for example, the vote for the Waterfront Industry Reform Authority and the vote for the Shipping Industry Reform Authority. I think one other area referred to before I came into the chamber tonight was the air transport industry, another area for which the Minister is responsible, except that he had the carriage of that particular matter taken out of his hands at the outset by none other than the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke). In other words, we have got a total record of failure in this whole portfolio area on the part of Mr Willis. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister has to be reminded that earlier this year we had a very good report, although rather long in its preparation, from the Inter-State Commission on the Australian waterfront. When that report was brought down-I think it was about three years in the preparation, with an earlier preliminary report-we first of all got a statement from the Minister saying that he needed three further months to have a look at the recommendations, and then he would consider it and let us know what he thought about it. He exceeded his own initially set time, but we did eventually get a view put down by the Minister. But what did we get? We got a decision to raid the pockets of the Australian taxpayers to the extent of $155m over the course of this and the next two years in order to pay golden handshakes to 3,000 waterside workers, most of whom I think were members of the Waterside Workers Federation, averaging $100,000 per person. I almost said `per man'; I think they are all men who are being asked to retire. This payment is by way of saying thank you to them for retiring when in fact most of them have been retired all their lives, with working weeks of 25 hours or less and on wages or salaries very much higher than the average for the work force and performing in most cases relatively unskilled work. These people are going to be paid, at the taxpayers' expense, on average about $100,000 per person for being good enough to retire and get off the waterfront. </PARA>
<PARA> I would have thought that, given the record of service that these people have given to the Australian economy over the course of their lives on the waterfront, one ought to have been asking whether they were prepared to give a bit of it back rather than asking for another $155m from the taxpayers of this country for doing the decent thing and getting out of it. </PARA>
<PARA> This is the great contribution that Minister Willis has made, on the basis of the Inter-State Commission report, to the future of this country. In doing so, the Minister has ignored most of the other seminal recommendations in the report, in particular the quite crucial recommendation that the future of the waterfront will be totally clouded until there is an enterprise system of labour operating there instead of one which is actually controlled by the single major trade union on the waterfront, the Waterside Workers Federation. But no, the first loyalty of Mr Willis, who I remind the Minister was himself the advocate for the Australian Council of Trade Unions for many years before what was then called the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Commission and who in an earlier sense was the acolyte to the present Prime Minister, is not to the people of Australia, not to good government, but to the trade union movement, and always has been. </PARA>
<PARA> If one is looking for a consistent thread to explain the appalling performance of the Minister in the execution of his ministerial duties throughout the whole of his portfolio-not just the waterfront, which I have been talking about-one can look at that trade union affiliation, because every time the Minister approaches a policy decision in any area of his portfolio, first of all he asks the relevant trade union what it wants him to do. </PARA>
<PARA> Telecom Australia is in a shambles. I am sure that Senator Alston could spend a lot of time talking about that. Perhaps he will do so at a later point. Telecom is in a shambles because it is run by the Australian Telecommunications Employees Association and because when Mr Willis wants to know which policy should be implemented he asks the head of that union. He does not ask the consumers of this country or pay attention to lowering business costs in this country, for example, thereby rendering Australia a more competitive economy, which other Ministers spend their time prating about, as the Treasurer (Mr Keating) did recently in Tokyo. He went there to tell our Japanese creditors that things are not as bad as they look and that if only they will be patient with the Government for a few months longer until the election is out of the way everything will be fine. The fact is that the Minister in charge of the transport and communications portfolio has been a total failure. He was also a failure in the industrial relations portfolio, but that is nothing compared with his performance after he was shifted-I think after the last election-to his present portfolio. </PARA>

<PARA> I have mentioned the Minister's performance in the waterfront area, but let us look at his performance in the coastal shipping area. We have a disgraceful situation, as everybody knows, in that it is hopeless getting anything transported around the coast of Australia on Australian ships as far as cost is concerned. This is equally applicable to the trans-Tasman shipping trades. If one wants to send a car from Sydney to Auckland, I am told that it is cheaper to send it via Tokyo on Japanese ships. It is cheaper to send it from Sydney to Tokyo and then from Tokyo to Auckland. That is because, once again, the Seamens Union of Australia and one or two other unions in the maritime area-but mainly the Seamens Union-are in charge of the trans-Tasman shipping trades. What has our Minister for Transport and Communications done about that?</PARA>
<PARA> We have a closer economic relations agreement with New Zealand which is supposed to be all about integrating the two economies. I have been a strong supporter of this ever since it began, when I was in the Public Service. Doug Anthony was the chief catalyst for the agreement and it was probably one of his proudest achievements, or will prove to have been when the history books are written. While we have been pulling down tariffs, getting rid of quota restrictions and other forms of restraint on trade between the two countries, we have an enormous barrier of transport costs between the two countries imposed by a totally unelected body-a trade union-which Mr Willis is simply incapable of dealing with or even beginning to address because it is not in him to do so. I ask Senator Evans whether he can hold out any hope to the people of this country that the man who is presently in charge of the portfolio which is under discussion now in this Committee might be shifted out of it in order to allow, even in the dying days of this Government, some rather more competent Minister to begin to address some of the problems which the Minister is leaving unaddressed. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Having just looked at the second reading speech by the Minister for Transport and Communications (Mr Willis) to the Broadcasting Amendment Bill, I cannot resist the temptation to point out what the Minister, I think quite unwittingly, has allowed to be put out in his name. Clearly, it embraces very far reaching policy proposals for deregulation. I suspect that the Minister's total ineptitude is the reason he allowed all this to go through to the keeper. For example, he said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>Present arrangements require the Minister and the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal to be heavily involved in judgments about when a service area needs or can support new commercial services. We need to develop arrangements that provide greater scope for broadcasters to take initiatives and carry them forward on their own responsibility . . . We also need to examine whether community needs are better recognised and met by the integration of planning and licensing arrangements under the umbrella of an independent authority. </PARA>
<PARA>In other words, moving well away from the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal. He went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . the regulation of programming standards needs to be examined to ensure that quality is maintained . . . It is the Government's responsibility to safeguard the public interest, but this can be achieved by creating the right regulatory environment for industry to provide services of an acceptable standard. The question of whether standards need to be examined by statutory regulation or self-regulation needs to be looked at. </PARA>
<PARA>So quite clearly the agenda of the fundamental review is all about deregulation. Yet the Minister, dithering as he is, has the hide to pretend that somehow none of those matters are being addressed. There might have been a bit of shuffling and verbal legerdemain but the fact remains that that review is still ongoing. It will undoubtedly address these issues and provide advice to the Minister along those lines, unless he simply says that he does not want it. I can understand why he would say that. Clearly, the last thing that he wants to do, given his total history of captivity to the trade union movement, is to propose anything that might smack of deregulation. Indeed the only exception to the general rule of kowtowing to the Left side of politics and all those arch regulators was when Mr Willis had the temerity to stick his hand up and support the possible privatisation of the airlines. Honourable senators will recall that he did that only because he was toadying to the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke), who had tried to float the issue a short time earlier. They both got their heads kicked in and have gone back into the burrows. Therefore we will not hear of privatisation again, although it is a critical ingredient of micro-economic reform. </PARA>
<PARA> What we have is a Minister who has acknowledged quite explicitly, by his own statement of 1 November, that he is beginning the reform process 2 1/2 years down the track. It ought to be remembered that in the interim not only did the Prime Minister, some 2 1/2 years ago, make that gratuitous promise to reform urgently this nightmarish legislation but also the Minister for Transport and Communications, Mr Willis, reiterated that sort of promise on a number of occasions. It got to the point where even the Secretary to the Department of Transport and Communications told a seminar in Melbourne that the Broadcasting Act was unwieldy and unworkable. They were his expressions. Subsequently the same Secretary, Mr Evans, wrote a letter to the Canberra Times. I would be interested in Senator Stone's view of this because it strikes me as being quite unprecedented. The Secretary to the Department wrote a letter in which he branded the present Broadcasting Act as a regulatory framework which is excessive and characterised by too many players, overlapping functions and a raft of outdated and unnecessary rules and requirements. He went on to state that if the legislation is fundamentally deficient there are limits to what can be achieved by continually tinkering with it. </PARA>
<PARA> That strikes me as being wholly out of court unless authorised by the Minister. One therefore is entitled to assume that this pusillanimous presider over the Department, or the ministerial component of it, was prepared to allow others to get out there and talk about fundamental reform and deregulation but has not had the courage to stand up and embrace it himself. So we have had the Secretary having to be the advance guard. Those in the Department who have been on the review team have also had to carry the burden but this Minister has simply wrung his hands, gone on Face to Face and announced that there will be a fundamental review with the aim of creating a more freewheeling and far less legalistic framework. That is about as far as he has gone. </PARA>
<PARA> In introducing the current amendments he has proposed a whole series of utterly irrelevant and unnecessary amendments that simply heighten the complexity and uncertainty that already attaches to the Broadcasting Act. It is a travesty of reform and a disgrace in the circumstances because the industry is crying out for a whole range of new initiatives, a whole dismantling of that structure of regulation which is overbearing the industry, which is making life a nightmare for everyone but the lawyers-and even those, I think, must have second thoughts because none of them can be absolutely sure they are right. No doubt those who advised the Minister that all of these amendments were constitutional have certainly got egg on their faces now that Sir Maurice Byers has thrown a very heavy dead cat into the ring in the shape of his opinion which makes it clear that very many of these sections are quite unconstitutional; that, at their face value, they plainly go too far and will need to be read down. </PARA>
<PARA> That is a disaster. We are faced with a dog's breakfast and the Minister, when he gets back into the country and if and when he addresses himself to the issue, should have the courage to say, `Enough is enough. We have gone too far. We ought to call a halt to all of this, put it back into the melting pot and let the fundamental review pass judgment on whether these sorts of amendments are going to contribute one iota to the need for deregulation, for less regulation and for substantive reform in the area'. Instead we have simply had a Minister who is not prepared even to brief the press on what is meant by the very tortuous and complex amendments; and was not prepared to have a press conference, which again was quite unprecedented; and who was prepared only to write a letter to the editor and somehow pretend that he was denying what was going on, that the Deputy Secretary was somehow not saying what he was reported to have said and that he, Mr Willis, was going to pretend that somehow all of this was off the agenda. </PARA>
<PARA> This is a charade. It is an insult to the intelligence of the Australian public. It certainly does not fool the journalists who have been writing about the subject. They know that broadcasting policy is in turmoil, that the Minister has left it in tatters, that nothing will happen under the present incumbent. Senator Stone quite rightly echoed a press release of mine some weeks ago in which I said that the only possible hope for meaningful reform was to start again with a new Minister, but one can understand the exigencies of politics close to an election--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Indeed. I suppose when something is so fundamentally obvious it is not surprising that great minds will come from different areas and arrive at the same conclusion. We will be faced with the political expediency of the Prime Minister, who is not interested in reform, despite his own election promise so easily given, but rather in protecting the hides of those who are incompetent and those who have simply failed comprehensively to come to grips with what was involved. Senator Gareth Evans does not escape responsibility. He was the responsible Minister for some 12 months or more. But I would say, most charitably, that he was a victim of this unworkable mega-department structure. Perhaps because of his amazing capacity, if not to stay awake all the time then at least to throw a bit of energy into one particular area at a time, he was actually prepared to tackle some of the issues in telecommunications. I am sorry to disturb him, but how can we possibly expect even someone of Senator Evans's relative competence to address a whole clutch of separate issues, let alone someone with the total lack of competence of Mr Willis. Mr Willis is supposed to be solving the non-existent pilots dispute; he is supposed to be doing something about waterfront reform and fixing up government business enterprises; and he is supposed to be undertaking reform of the Broadcasting Act. In fact, he is doing nothing about any of those things. That is the tragedy in this area.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Even with the very limited pack that is available, I would have thought that a shuffling could only throw up a better card than the one we have got at the moment. The tragedy is that we will be exposed to yet another meaningless debate about a whole raft of amendments to the Broadcasting Act which can only have as their ultimate effect complicating the issue even more. They will not make a skerrick of difference to Bond. They will certainly not make any difference to Skase. The proof of the pudding there is in the remarks that Mr Willis made to Laurie Oakes last month. He was asked whether the proposed amendments would cover a situation where a television proprietor goes broke, or where a network goes into receivership or liquidation. Mr Willis said that that situation is currently covered by current powers. Even the current crisis has flowed directly from the Government's decision to restructure the cross-media ownership rules and open up the floodgates. We now know the catastrophes that are besetting metropolitan commercial television operators and regional network operators-those who have been silly enough to pay fantastic prices for commercial radio licences. I suppose that the only satisfaction we have in all this is that the top bid for an FM licence in Melbourne was the $31m bid by the Australian Labor Party or its surrogate. Bond, of course, weighed in for only $22m, and he probably will not be delivering on that-he will just forfeit his deposit. The third highest bid was $10m. That was in a different climate altogether. At least there will be the satisfaction that the Labor Party will have to cough up its $31m when the real price is probably something like $5m to $10m at most. Perhaps that is not a reflection on the Minister. I doubt whether he was in attendance at that particular administrative committee meeting that decided, as did the media proprietors, that this looked like something too good to refuse.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> So we have a shambles. We have a Minister who is not prepared to do anything about it. It is just a matter of regret that Senator Evans is too tired to try to bring any influence to bear on this situation. I suppose he is just going to limp through to the election and pretend that somehow he is not responsible any more. That is a tragedy for Australia. All I can ask is that he have a word with Mr Willis to see whether he will withdraw the amendments so that at least we can get on with some fundamental reforms rather than pretend that somehow they are not happening up front when we all know that they are happening out the back. </PARA>

I can assure Senator Alston also that flattery will get him absolutely nowhere in terms of the way in which he approached his attempt at comparative injustice in his treatment of our ministerial performance in this very difficult portfolio area. It is a big, sprawling and difficult portfolio, but it is not an unmanageable one, and the formidable combination of Ralph Willis, Bob Brown and Ros Kelly is an ample demonstration of the formidable intellectual and other resources that this Government brings to bear on the resolution of these problems.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I would not wish my relative brevity to be taken in any way as a willingness to accede to any of the things either Senator Alston or Senator Stone, in his even more vulgarly, rhetorically excessive fashion, said about my ministerial colleague. He has done a first class job in the area of micro-economic reform. On the waterfront, in shipping productivity, massive gains have been realised or are in prospect at the moment as the result of the Commission reports and their implementation. We are talking about 30 per cent productivity gains over a very short period on the waterfront. We are talking about manning levels on shipping under Australian flags being very much up to the highest standards of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development within a three-year period. We are talking about thoroughly competitive rates being applicable in those particular environments. More work remains to be done particularly in areas such as port administration, some aspects of tug boat administration and things of that kind. We acknowledge that and we will continue to keep the focus on those areas because we acknowledge their significance in terms of the overall competitiveness and effectiveness of Australian industry. To suggest that these problems have been mismanaged or are beyond the capacity of this very formidable ministerial team to deal with effectively is simply vulgar, rhetorical, political excess of a kind that regrettably becomes all too familiar around this time and part of the electoral cycle. </PARA>
<PARA> It is a rather sad and dispirited Opposition one confronts when we find it deriving its primary ammunition from quoting each other's press releases in the Senate. I would have thought that Senator Alston could do a little better than that. However, I do not want to be taken as encouraging him to do so. I think that sufficient points have been put on the table to make clear the general gist of what is being said. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn now to the broadcasting review process. The need for immediate holding amendments to the legislation has been made very apparent by the outcome of recent court proceedings. Some of the penalties in the areas of particular breach are so far-reaching and draconian as to be difficult of practical administration without bringing down potentially the whole structure that we are seeking to keep fundamentally in place. That is why it has become apparent that within the present Australian Broadcasting Tribunal situation, some more flexible sanctions need to be able to be applied, and that is essentially the rationale for the legislation that is coming before us. This is not the appropriate time, nor is it within Standing Orders, to debate the pros and cons of the particular piece of legislation. That is something we can do when that legislation is actually before us. In my earlier reply I said as much as I could about the larger broadcasting review progress that is under way. It is not a matter of putting off until a less volatile period something that is too difficult; it is a matter of wrestling as best the Government and its advisers can with some intrinsically different subject areas and producing viable conclusions as soon as we possibly can. That is what is happening and, in the meantime, it is necessary to put some sort of holding operations together in the way that I have described. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I shall be brief at this late hour of the night but I should like to continue with a few points raised by Senator Stone on the lack of performance by the triumvirate of Ministers in the other place. It is no wonder that there has been a spate of accidents involving heavy road vehicles in New South Wales and Victoria and a few other places in Australia during the last few months. Of course, quite a few factors contributed to those accidents. Probably the most serious is the state of the roads, especially in New South Wales.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;He said it there but maybe he was thinking about the strip of bitumen that runs out to his property. Senator Stone would know the district. I spent three days travelling on country roads in New South Wales when I was locked up in this State by the airline pilots strike and could not get home on a long weekend. The state of the roads is unbelievable. That is because of the lack of road funding for the last four years. It is a well known fact that road funding dropped 40 per cent in real terms in that time. That is one of the reasons. Another good reason is that the truck drivers have had to drive faster and work longer hours because any vehicle three years old would have been financed back in the days when the average overdraft rate was 15 to 17 per cent whereas it has now moved up to 21 to 25 per cent. This results in drivers being more tired and this tends to cause accidents. The third reason is the increased use of roads because of the lack of performance by coastal shipping and by rail.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Last Friday, in Perth, I attended an Australian Institution of Engineers seminar, which was open to the public. The road engineers, the representatives of road transport and others were at loggerheads and were blaming each other for the problem. One of the points I made was that all modes of transport should be complementing rather than competing with each other. But, in the last few years, road transport has come very much to the fore because of the lack of performance by rail transport. There is no way in the world that trucks should be able to operate profitably from Sydney to Perth, Melbourne, Brisbane or anywhere else in competition with rail, especially where there is standard gauge rail. In fact, road transport is competing and is competing successfully. Goods should be carried, especially across the Nullarbor, by the use of containerisation and fast rail. However, rail transport is shackled by social costs which should be isolated and handed over to the Social Security portfolio to make sure that what rail is charging is truly reflective of costs. That would take a lot of trucks off the road. </PARA>
<PARA> Much the same applies to coastal shipping because of lack of competition. Coastal shipping still has a big part to play in the future of Australian transport, but it is doing less and less. The north-west of Western Australia used to have a good shipping system but it has almost disappeared. As Senator Stone pointed out, it is cheaper to send goods to New Zealand via Singapore or Japan than to send them direct. Coastal shipping should be put onto a more competitive basis and the waterfront would need to be cleaned up before that problem could be overcome, because ships have to be loaded and unloaded. The Government has allocated $650m to restructure the waterfront without obtaining a real restructure and probably another $650m will be needed in a few years time if things go the way some people think. If we get shipping and rail modes of transport running as they should, trucks would still be able to do the shorter hauls very well. With fewer of them on the road, we would not need so much funding for roads. That is the only chance we have of getting the roads back in good condition. I do not see how the roads I saw in northern Victoria and especially in New South Wales can be restored to a satisfactory condition without a massive increase in funding. In addition to increasing funding, we must cut down the number of heavy vehicles on the roads. </PARA>
<PARA> I venture to give the Ministers whom I mentioned before a bit of advice on how to reduce the number of road accidents. Frequently in the last few weeks, the fitting of heavy vehicles with speed limiters has been mentioned. Any licensed heavy vehicle above a certain category should be fitted with a tachograph. The trucking industry has not welcomed that suggestion too much. It says that the fitting of such devices would not add to safety. However, if used properly tachographs would be safety devices. In Europe tachographs are compulsory. It is also compulsory to keep the record from the tachographs for six months. An inspection can be made and a fine imposed any time in the six months. The industry has said that because we could not know where the vehicle was, we would not know whether it had been speeding. However, if the tachograph showed that it had travelled at a speed in excess of 100 kilometres an hour it would mean that the speed limit had been broken anywhere in Australia. That would be one way to go about the problem. </PARA>
<PARA> Speed limiters can certainly be fitted to heavy prime movers. I recommend such a course for already licensed vehicles. In future, however, a certain date should be selected by which no new heavy vehicle would be licensed if it could travel at speeds in excess of 100 kilometres an hour. That would be the way to go about it because a speed limiter can be interfered with. Any electronic gadget can be interfered with; for example, phones can be tapped. Therefore, speed limiters can quite easily be tampered with. If a vehicle were restricted to travel at a maximum of 100 kilometres an hour, the driver would be unable to exceed the speed limit. Everything I have said about heavy road vehicles applies equally to heavy passenger buses, especially interstate passenger buses, which, it is known, are driven at excessive speeds as much as any other heavy vehicles. I paced one last weekend doing 140 kilometres, at least. I know that I was speeding, but I had to try it out to make sure that I knew at what speed the bus was travelling. </PARA>
<PARA> Another very important point relates to the drivers of heavy vehicles. Governments should have the courage to make the offence of driving a heavy vehicle under the influence of alcohol a gaolable offence because there is nothing more lethal than a heavy vehicle being driven by somebody under the influence. I know that a certain amount of drinking and driving goes on, especially at night. The same would apply to drugs. Gaol would certainly be a great deterrent for those who are caught, as well as for those who are not. I would like the previously mentioned Ministers to think about these points with respect to trying to reduce the road carnage. </PARA>

<PARA> At a time when the pilots have been told that their initial claim is pure greed-I think the Prime Minister and others described it as obscene-and in the absence of any element of productivity in the arrangements, one has to look in a very jaundiced way at the pilots' initial claim. However, debate on the matter is not as clear-cut by any means as some advocates of the Government and the airlines would suggest. At a time when the pilots have been told that their claim is pure greed, it would be reasonable to assume that the executives of the airlines themselves would be fairly modest in the satisfaction of their own financial wants. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;One would also expect them to know how many pilots they have, how many they need, and how many will be required in the future. In my view, there has been a quite appalling lack of apparent knowledge by some of the senior executives in the industry about the situation confronting them. In relation to the pilots' claim and my expectation, therefore, that the financial requirements and satisfaction of the senior executives of the major airlines would be reasonable, it might be pertinent to look at the financial remuneration of those executives and, in particular, of the chief executive officers.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The situation in relation to Australian Airlines Ltd is fairly well known and fairly well documented. The Chief Executive of Australian Airlines until recently was on an income, without significant additional benefits, of the order of $120,000 or thereabouts. That figure has now been increased to something like $250,000. That is a significant percentage increase, but by comparison with some executives in other industries it is still not a huge income. I looked at the 1989 annual report of TNT, which is Ansett Airlines of Australia's parent company in the sense that it owns 50 per cent of Ansett. I thought that it would be interesting to compare the figures for remuneration of directors and executives shown in the TNT 1989 annual report with that in the 1988 annual report to see what happened over the intervening 12 months because the latter part of the 12 months covers the period of the pilots dispute. The TNT report is traditionally published in late September or October and relates remuneration figures to a financial year, but is often updated to a little beyond that. The figures that I am about to mention either relate to the period ending 30 June 1988 and 1989 respectively, or to the period closer to the end of September. </PARA>
<PARA> It is very easy to do this research, although I have not seen too many other people do it. One has to delve into the notes to the accounts of the company, but it is a revealing and worthwhile exercise. Therefore I thought it might be important to put it into the public record, not just in terms of the intrinsic interest in TNT and its executives alone, but also in relation to some of the comments that have been made in recent days by the Government and some of its acolytes about other leading public figures in the business world. </PARA>
<PARA> The Chief Executive Officer of TNT is Sir Peter Abeles and, as I said, TNT owns 50 per cent of Ansett Airlines. Sir Peter is the person who calls the shots on Ansett's policies and actions, as we have seen so clearly in what is now the many weeks of the pilots dispute which, as I said at the outset, both Sir Peter and his puppet, the Prime Minister, deny even exists. </PARA>

Sir Peter is described in the 1989 annual report of TNT that has been released in the past month as the Deputy Chairman, Group Managing Director and Chief Executive, as well as the Joint Chairman and Joint Managing Director of Ansett Transport Industries Ltd. According to my reading of the financial accounts and the notes to the accounts of TNT's 1989 annual report, in the course of 1988-89 Sir Peter's remuneration rose from a figure of $4,750,000, in 1987-88-I think at the end of 1988-to a figure 12 months later of $5,350,000. On my arithmetic that is an increase in one year alone of $600,000 or three-fifths of a million dollars.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In percentage terms I have to say that it is not as great as it sounds, in that it is only 12.6 per cent, but I would have thought that 12.6 per cent well exceeds the Government's own guidelines. Certainly, the amount of increase is quite staggering. It is a $600,000 increase in remuneration in a year in which the airlines are accusing the pilots of blatant greed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Then I looked at the shareholdings of Sir Peter Abeles in TNT alone and in the course of 1988-89-indeed, on 28 November 1988-there was an allotment of bonus shares. TNT made a one for five bonus offer and Sir Peter, who as at 12 September 1988 owned 4,212,404 shares, as a result of the one for five bonus-which I assume is non-taxable, but that requires clarification-went to a shareholding of 5,054,384 shares, that is an increase of 821,980 shares. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="DJ4">Senator SHORT</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Twenty per cent was the bonus. Today's market price of TNT shares is $2.80 to $2.83. This year it has come down. This year it peaked at a little over $4. Indeed, given the non-dispute that we are involved in at the moment, it is understandable that the shares have fallen. A valuation of those shares at $2.80 would probably be a very conservative valuation. The 821,980 shares that Sir Peter received as a result of that bonus on today's market price are worth $2.3m.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is also interesting that the 1989 accounts show that Sir Peter has 19,600 1991 registered options. He did not have any at all 12 months earlier and it does not appear from the TNT accounts outlining the capital changes in the past 12 months that those options came along as a result of the bonus issue, because none of the other directors seemed to increase their options to that degree at all. Of course, he has gone from nil to almost 20,000. Today those 19,600 options are worth something like $1.80 or thereabouts an option. </PARA>

However, the point that I want to make is that I find a degree of double standards in terms of the pilots dispute; a set of double standards that are really quite sickening. This country is grinding to a halt as a result of the pilots dispute. We have a situation where we have a Government that seems absolutely incapable of bringing sanity or resolution to the problem. We have a situation where it appears very apparent to most Australians that the reason the Government is not able or willing to act sensibly and rationally in this dispute is that it is the puppet of certain leading players in the airlines industry. I say quite unequivocally that Sir Peter Abeles's role in this whole exercise is one that most Australians would have very grave doubts about. Yet, we have a situation where that Chief Executive has gained enormous increases in remuneration and benefits in the last 12 months at a time when the pilots are being told that their situation and demands are ones of pure greed. It is about time that we had a little less of the cant and hypocrisy from not only the Government but also the airlines in terms of the handling of this issue.</PARA></TALK.START>

I do not want to go off on any kind of a tangent in this debate. Senator Short has exercised that prerogative with a long-winded account of the share structures and the managing salary structures of TNT Ltd as he understands them, or as he tries to generate speculation about them. We all know that leading businessmen in this country are very well rewarded indeed for the executive, managerial roles they perform and we all know that there are increasing disparities between the way in which those rewards are in fact enjoyed, with lots of other senior people, particularly in the public sector, not getting anything like the remuneration that arguably they deserve for similar inputs and for work of similar social and national relevance.

As I said in this place the other day, there continues to be the remnants of a problem that arose from that initial dispute.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The situation, as I have described it, is very different indeed, particularly when one looks at the claims of the pilots, which, because of their flow-on potential, were simply absolutely beyond the capacity not only of the industry to bear but also of the whole community to bear. Every time that Opposition spokesmen get up and huff and puff and twist and turn, and generally perform verbal pyrotechnics and put up puffs of diversionary smoke of the kind that Senator Short has offered tonight, they ignore the fundamental problem which it is. If the Government had not taken strong and resolute action of the kind that it has in this instance, this country would have a wage break-out-a wage explosion-which would make its present economic difficulties absolutely fade into insignificance.

That has been the position from day one of this whole affair.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Earlier today I asked a series of questions and was hopeful of an answer coming forward. I thank the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade (Senator Gareth Evans) for arranging for the answer that I was particularly seeking to be faxed to my office late this afternoon. The questions related to the operations of the Federal Airports Corporation at Darwin Airport, the implications of the airlines dispute on the FAC, and the implications for air traffic control at Darwin.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I can understand that there has been a six- or seven-week delay in providing these answers. I understand that, at the conclusion of this Committee debate, the Minister will table those answers in the Parliament. However, I appreciate being given advance copies an hour or so ago, because I can now understand why the Government has taken six or seven weeks to provide these answers. I asked the following question:</PARA>
<PARA>What cost implications will arise to the FAC as a result of the pilots strike which will impact on charges levied on general aviation and private pilots?</PARA>
<PARA>The answer is as follows:</PARA>
<PARA>The pilots dispute-</PARA>
<PARA>it is acknowledged on the Minister's own fax machine that there is a dispute-</PARA>
<PARA>will impact on the FAC's 1989-90 revenue. To offset this reduction in income, the Corporation has taken prudent action to ensure that, where appropriate, operating costs have been reduced and non-essential expenditures deferred. </PARA>
<PARA>An admission. My second question asked:</PARA>
<PARA>Given the independent financial status of the FAC, what action is required by the FAC to implement the Prime Minister's direction that airport landing charges are to be waived for the duration of the pilots strike?</PARA>
<PARA>Quite a comprehensive answer is given by the Department, through the Minister:</PARA>
<PARA>Under the arrangements between the Government and airlines during the airline disruptions which provide for the Government to meet the agreed wages costs of the airlines retaining on their payrolls staff who would otherwise have been stood down, the Federal Airports Corporation is directed from time to time, under section 41 of its legislation, to waive a specified amount of landing charges incurred by a particular airline. Pursuant to section 42 of the legislation, this direction is followed by a payment from the Commonwealth of an equivalent amount to that directed to be waived, being reimbursement of the financial detriment suffered by the Corporation as a result of complying with the direction. </PARA>
<PARA>What will be the Budget implications of that particular financial detriment? It is not covered in the Budget at this stage. Very obviously it will come back before us next year in the special appropriations. But no-one is addressing what this financial detriment is that is now being reimbursed to the FAC. My third question relating to this particular aspect asked:</PARA>
<PARA>Will the loss of income to the FAC caused by the pilots strike have implications on other areas of the FAC's budget-in particular will the capital works program be altered in any way?</PARA>
<PARA>Again, a fascinating answer has been provided:</PARA>
<PARA>The FAC has advised that it expects the loss of income to the Corporation caused by the pilots strike-</PARA>
<PARA>an acknowledgment that there is a pilots strike in the answer given to me by the Minister-</PARA>
<PARA>to be relatively small and will, to a large extent, be met by a tightening of the 1989-90 operating expense budget, particularly in administrative areas. There has also been a small reduction in profit expectations for this year. Apart from this, the loss of income from the strike-</PARA>
<PARA>I stress `from the strike'-</PARA>
<PARA>will, of itself, have no impact on the Corporation's budget or require any alteration to the capital program. However, the FAC will be reviewing its capital program in the light of any changes to future growth forecasts arising from the effects of the dispute on demand for aviation services. </PARA>
<PARA>What a tremendous condemnation of the Government by its own answers on the consequences of the pilots strike, dispute, disruption, whatever. The flow-on is quite remarkable. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like also to address the answers that were given to me more specifically with regard to the capital works program for the Darwin Airport. As I mentioned earlier today, this saga has been going on since this Government came to office. In fact, in 1984 the proposals put forward to the Public Works Committee were for a much larger program, they were endorsed by that Committee and were put forward. Of course, while Mr Hawke, the Prime Minister, manned a bulldozer at Darwin Airport for the purpose of an election campaign in 1984, pretty shortly afterwards he got off the bulldozer and for five years nothing has happened. I asked the following question:</PARA>
<PARA>Can full details be provided of the Capital Works Program of the FAC including design and construction timetables, proposed funding expenditures, and sources of loan funds?</PARA>
<PARA>We then have one of these answers which indicates `Appendix A shows details' and then Appendix A, which comprises some three pages, sets out various capital works approvals and programs and many figures relating to various projects. But the question is not answered, including the question about the design and construction timetables. The answers are not provided; rather, the pat answer is given as follows:</PARA>
<PARA>The FAC has advised that design and construction timetables and cash flow estimates will, of course, vary with each individual project and have not been determined for projects not yet committed or included on the current budget. </PARA>
<PARA>Once again, the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) will perform one of his bulldozer exercises a month or two prior to the next Federal election, just as he did five years ago in 1984. The Prime Minister will undertake one of these bulldozer exercises in relation to the Darwin Airport. What confidence can people have when these sorts of answers are given: `No cash flows.' The answer is very conveniently avoided by using bureaucratic language. </PARA>
<PARA> The second question I asked in that regard was as follows:</PARA>
<PARA>Can you tell me the timetable for letting contracts and the start time for Darwin Airport and Terminal?</PARA>
<PARA>The answer was as follows:</PARA>
<PARA>As at 10 November 1989 two preliminary contracts for work at Darwin Airport and terminal had been let and site work-</PARA>
<PARA>and I stress the words `site work'-</PARA>
<PARA>had already commenced on those contracts. </PARA>
<PARA>Very minor expenditure was involved in relation to what was a very minor cosmetic work type of attitude. The answer continues:</PARA>
<PARA>Tenders have been called for the major contract for the new terminal and these tenders closed on Wednesday 15 November 1989. Together, these three contracts will comprise over 95 per cent of the total work. It is anticipated that evaluation of tenders for the major contract will be completed early in the new year and that site works-</PARA>
<PARA>again, I stress `site works'-</PARA>
<PARA>on this contract will commence by end January 1990. </PARA>
<PARA>However, the questions relating to cash flows, construction timetables and design timetables are conveniently ignored. So, as we are again caught up in an election campaign, we are not provided with proper and satisfactory answers; rather, they provide a way out for the Government so that it can avoid facing its real and proper responsibility. </PARA>
<PARA> The third issue raised by my questioning-and it was seven weeks before a reply was given today-related to the reduction in air traffic control operations in the Northern Territory. The Department has now addressed this issue by finally providing the answer that half the staff in Darwin will be transferred to either Adelaide or Perth. Quite a detailed and comprehensive answer is given which sets out various cost savings, et cetera, but the question is really why it took seven weeks for such an answer to be given when it should have been answered by officers on the day of the Estimates Committee hearing. Instead, the Department has provided strange information about Public Service reduction and change. It will reduce the air traffic control staffing over the next year or two but, at the same time, in answer to the other question, we are told that Darwin Airport will be built at a cost of about $60m or $70m and its activities will be built up. Of course, the Government will be there touting its tourism and construction program, but the Civil Aviation Authority is hauling out its staff and moving them to Adelaide or Perth so that it can organise operations a little differently at a cost saving of about $344,000. I find it hypocritical and a strange coincidence of events that, on the one hand, staff of a major aviation authority will be reduced but, on the other hand, the Government has this grandiose commitment to Darwin Airport. I will believe it when I see it. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I withdraw whatever it is that contravenes that standing order. That kind of statement from the Minister reveals a set of double standards-I do not know whether that remark is acceptable, but I hope it is-that sits ill upon his shoulders. The fact is that the Prime Minister has said that the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal is structured in such a way that it needs fixing up. Of course, we have in front of us now the Bond amendments. It has been reported that there has been considerable discussion within the Cabinet. The Sydney Morning Herald reported to that effect via someone who seems to hear quite well what the Treasurer (Mr Keating) seems to be saying in Cabinet. It has been reported that the Prime Minister has been keen to remedy the situation which clearly has affected Bondy. I understand that that appellation relates to Mr Bond and I am led to believe that the Prime Minister has occasionally used it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> If the Minister suggests that the close mateship that appeared to exist when Mr Hawke had a champagne shower with Bondy did not exist, then I can only wonder about the purpose of such a denial. However, there is no doubt that in this area the Prime Minister has sought to improve the lot of the moguls or, in some instances, ex-moguls who have been involved in Australian television. An attempt was made in Parliament, for example, to increase their capacity to have access into markets. The Prime Minister was keen to support that move and the Government endorsed it, but in recent times-in fact, in 1987-Mr Hawke described the Broadcasting Act as `nightmarish legislation full of meaningless red tape and pettifogging inquiries'. </PARA>
<PARA> What interests me is that there was the appointment-and this has been detailed in the media; Senator Alston touched on this matter-of Mr Hutchinson, the Deputy Secretary of Mr Willis's Department, to try to hasten the fixing up of the mess in broadcasting that had clearly developed under Mr Willis's ministry in particular. An article by Tom Burton in the Sydney Morning Herald noted:</PARA>
<PARA> In early August, Transport and Communications Minister Ralph Willis went to New Zealand. With him was his departmental secretary, Graham Evans. </PARA>
<PARA>He is a former staffer, of course, of Mr Hawke's. The article continued:</PARA>
<PARA> Both were there to look at how the New Zealanders were coping with the deregulation of their broadcasting industry. </PARA>
<PARA> Willis came away impressed by the Kiwis, but disillusioned over the apparent inability of his department to make any progress on reform of broadcasting regulations. </PARA>
<PARA>Mr Hutchinson, the Deputy Secretary-who had acted as the boss of the Overseas Telecommunications Commission after the sacking of the head of the OTC, Mr Maltby-was appointed to take over the task of trying to fix up the mess, to bring about some reform of broadcasting regulation. It was pointed out by Tom Burton that Hutchinson was strongly of the view that there was a need for much stronger market influences in both telecommunications and broadcasting. It is a view that the Opposition holds. In fact, Burton reported:</PARA>
<PARA> In the department, they have been openly saying that they are doing the work for the next Liberal Government . . . </PARA>
<PARA>Burton also reported:</PARA>
<PARA> Hutchinson's deregulation stance is being applauded by the commercial TV networks, whose lobbiests, all exministerial and prime ministerial staffers, have been walking Canberra's corridors, encouraging support for Hutchinson. </PARA>
<PARA> Hutchinson is also forming a strong alliance with the key co-ordination departments of Treasury, Finance and Prime Minister and Cabinet. All three put in strong comments in the `Bond' amendments Cabinet submission considered this week-</PARA>
<PARA>this article is dated 4 November-</PARA>
<PARA>calling for the abolition of the ABT as constructed, and for the repeal of the fit and proper person test. </PARA>
<PARA>That was the test that involved difficulties for Mr Bond at that stage. Mr Burton's article continued:</PARA>
<PARA> In Cabinet, this line was picked up strongly by Treasurer, Paul Keating, who with other ministers attacked Willis for the delay in bringing forward any meaningful reform. </PARA>
<PARA>What is interesting about all of this is that there was clear pressure to go down the quite sensible and practical track of the Opposition's policy on deregulation. This Government has been pinching such large sections of Opposition policy that one would not be surprised to see it pinching more of it. But the intriguing thing is what happened next: Mr Mick Trimmer, Mr Willis's senior personal adviser, substantially rewrote Mr Hutchinson's proposed second reading speech for Mr Willis. He rewrote it at the last minute, I understand, with the result that it was nearly incomprehensible, so Mr Hutchinson then rang up the media to explain what the hacked-about speech really meant. One of the reasons why he did that is that Mr Willis, apparently, has some reticence about discussing matters with the media, which I suppose is appropriate for a Minister who is supposed to be in charge of communications; the Government works in mysterious ways its wonders to perform. As a result, Mr Hutchinson apparently briefed the media quite fulsomely about what the move towards deregulation was all about and what the Minister's speech really meant, when translated into some kind of coherence. </PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Labor Party left wing backbencher, Mr John Saunderson, from Victoria, has clearly been seeking to abort this move towards deregulation and the proposals that not only the Prime Minister but also apparently, according to Mr Burton, the Prime Minister's Department, have been supporting in interdepartmental gatherings. Of course, he also sought to abort what Mr Hutchinson was doing. This is quite significant because what is happening in broadcasting under the influence of a left wing Victorian member, Mr Saunderson, is that the left wing is triumphing. People seem to think that this is a government of moderates who simply do what is best for the friends of Mr Hawke. That is simply not so. This Government still has to kowtow to the left wing of the Labor Party on a remarkable number of occasions. This is one of them. </PARA>
<PARA> The real power in this area appears to lie with the left wing, which has managed to get Mr Hutchinson sacked and which has managed to put on hold any suggestion that there should be any diminution in the power or, if you like, a restructuring of the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal. All the brave sounds on deregulation that we were hearing appear to have gone by the wayside, to the extent that Mr Willis has even written a letter to the Sydney Morning Herald denying its earlier stories, in which it quoted Mr Hutchinson. Mr Willis said that there are no plans to abolish the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal, to abolish or amend the ownership levels, to relax foreign ownership rules or to allow self-regulation in areas such as the Australian and children's content requirements. While no plans may have yet been presented to the Cabinet, and no plans have yet been presented to the Parliament, it is nonsense to pretend that there are no plans unless Mr Saunderson has succeeded, with his left wing supporters, in removing those plans, which were clearly and readily acknowledged by the media to be in place, from the Government's agenda. </PARA>
<PARA> If that has happened, the people of Australia should be aware of the continuing significance and influence of the left wing of the Labor Party in these major matters of control over and, if you like, interference in the marketplace relating to television in Australia. There is no doubt that television in Australia is in a serious mess at the moment. Heaven knows what the future will bring. But the big question of whether there should be maintenance of the sort of control which obviously has not prevented these problems occurring, or whether there should be deregulation, which would allow a genuine marketplace to exist, is a major issue. It is an issue which, as I said, heightens the clear fact shown by the evidence-that the left wing is dominating media policy in Australia at the moment. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There are a few matters that concern me. The Australian Audit Office, which is under the control of the Department of Finance, took on notice several questions I asked in the Estimates Committee hearing. To my knowledge I have not received an answer to them. If the officers have some knowledge of the stage of those answers I would be grateful if they could let me know. The reason this is so significant is that it relates to the lack of resources in the Audit Office because of its inability to provide adequate salaries to retain many officers, particularly in the middle range, with auditing skills. I raised this matter at some length with officers of the Audit Office and with Senator Walsh. There is no doubt that matters of serious concern did emerge. For example, Mr Jacobs of the Audit Office said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>Our essential problem is that we feel our base has got too low in terms of being able to do performance and efficiency audits. </PARA>
<PARA>That is its skill base. It has had a very high turnover level; something like 20 per cent. There is no doubt that some measures have been aimed at allowing the Audit Office more flexibility in its employment patterns. The Audit Office says that it is slowing down the trend towards greater problems. In the Senate Estimates Committee hearing I pointed out in regard to the Auditor-General's response to the recommendations of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts:</PARA>
<PARA> If it should be decided that the AAO will continue under present arrangements and general funding levels, I believe it must inevitably fall further and further behind, which is in no-one's interest. Does that mean that if this trend continued for much longer you would not even be able to undertake mandatory, regulatory-type tasks?</PARA>
<PARA>Mr Jacobs responded:</PARA>
<PARA> The trend has been that way. It has been redressed to some extent by the mandate adjustments that we have negotiated with the Department of Finance on a year-to-year basis. The trend has been slowed by that process. </PARA>
<PARA>The important point I want to make to the Committee now is that the trend may have been slowed but it is still going on. As there is a greater and greater requirement for fuller and more detailed activity from the Audit Office, the capacity to fulfil the full role of Audit Office functions is being diminished. On page 32 I pointed out:</PARA>
<PARA>At page 129 you say that the Priorities Review Committee approved 381,359 regulatory audit task hours and that of these 81 per cent were completed. </PARA>
<PARA>In fact, in the latest year that involved a slight increase in the previous period when the achievement rate was 80 per cent. In other words, it was a failure rate of something like 20 per cent. Mr Hay from the Audit Office replied:</PARA>
<PARA>One of the reasons why we managed to do slightly more would be taking resources from our performance area and applying them to the financial statement area. </PARA>
<PARA>In other words, the only way the Audit Office can achieve even a reasonable rate of completion is by taking staff resources away from other areas where they are supposed to be doing another job which while perhaps of less immediate significance is nonetheless very significant and is a statutory requirement. I raise all these matters because in the Estimates hearing I asked:</PARA>
<PARA>At page 126 of the explanatory notes the comment is made:</PARA>
<PARA>Despite a significant loss of experienced audit staff and the difficulties in recruiting suitable staff the AAO was able to achieve 71% of the workload planned for the year. </PARA>
<PARA>Firstly, that suggests a 29 per cent failure rate in terms of the target. How does that compare with, say, last year and the year before?</PARA>
<PARA>Mr Hay from the Audit Office said:</PARA>
<PARA>I am sorry, I do not have that information with me. We could take that on notice and get it back to you. </PARA>
<PARA>To my knowledge I do not have that information. It seems to me that when there is a 29 per cent failure rate in terms of the workload planned for the year, some pretty good explanation is required. I think some fairly significant action has to be taken. I would be grateful if the Minister could let me know when I could get an answer to that. I also asked about the extent to which the Commonwealth Auditor-General was losing staff to State government auditors who appeared to be providing substantially better salaries and other packages. Mr Jacobs said:</PARA>
<PARA>We do have details of people who have gone into State audit offices which we can supply to you. We are losing people to those. </PARA>
<PARA>I have not had that information supplied to me, to my knowledge. I would be grateful if that and the other questions I asked could be answered. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I did not have the benefit of being here precisely at the time Senator Michael Baume commenced his series of questions. Therefore, I will endeavour to answer those questions I heard. The officers have been very kind and have told me what the honourable senator's line of questioning was. I am not sure whether I can answer all of his questions but I will make an effort to do so. I understand that the honourable senator's questions concern the Australian Audit Office and that a number of the questions were asked in the Estimates Committee hearing itself. I understand that the honourable senator does not have answers to those questions that were asked in the Estimates Committee hearing. I am advised by the Department that all of the questions asked in the Committee have been responded to and the answers have gone to the secretariat.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I understand that Senator Baume asked a further question which was taken by Senator Walsh and was not referred to the Audit Office for answering directly. My advice is that on 4 October Senator Walsh supplied an answer to that question. My understanding is that it concerned the turnover of staff in the Australian Audit Office and other agencies and his answer, of which I have a copy in front of me, contains four tables. It is too complex an answer to convey orally, so I will make it available to the honourable senator. By so doing we will beat the answer that Senator Walsh has obviously given to the secretariat and which is on its way to the Committee. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to speak tonight about the very important issue of the continued visits of nuclear warships to Australian ports. On Friday, 10 November, Battlegroup Alpha entered Fremantle. Its lead ship was USS Midway, one of the oldest aircraft carriers in the United States naval armoury and, of course, one loaded with nuclear weapons. It is the largest ship ever to tie up alongside the passenger terminal at Fremantle quay; it is unprecedented for an aircraft carrier actually to tie up right alongside in Fremantle. Battlegroup Alpha also included USS Reeves, which went to Stirling naval base. This was one of the ships which had suffered an accident in the previous 10-day period. Other ships went to Bunbury and Geraldton. Between them, Battlegroup Alpha warships carried over 200 nuclear weapons. However, there were no nuclear reactors as part of this battlegroup.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This visitation of another United States battlegroup is not remarkable, but is very significant at the moment because of a string of accidents that highlight the unsafe record of the United State Navy. In the last three weeks 11 serious accidents have taken place with United States Navy vessels, which prompted the Navy to call for a complete shutdown of operations on 16 November. I shall just run very quickly through the accidents that have occurred to get them on the record. On 29 October, a pilot making his first landing on the aircraft carrier USS Lexington crashed and killed himself and four others. A videotape of the crash will not be made public because it is part of the current internal investigation. On 30 October, an aircraft from the aircraft carrier USS Midway dropped a bomb on the USS Reeves, which I mentioned was part of Battlegroup Alpha, in the Indian Ocean, injuring five sailors. On 30 October, a sailor fell off the aircraft carrier USS Carl Vinson into rough Pacific seas about 998 kilometres north of Wake Island. An air and sea search was commenced but the body of the sailor was not recovered. On 31 October, a wave swept three sailors and 38 missiles off the aircraft carrier USS Dwight D. Eisenhower about 145 kilometres south-east of Cape Hatteras, North Carolina. Two sailors were rescued, one in a serious condition. The search was abandoned for the missing sailor. There are no plans to salvage the missiles due to salt water damage. </PARA>
<PARA> On 1 November, a fire on board the naval vessel USS Monongahela in the eastern Atlantic injured nine sailors. Sailors were trying to start a boiler when it caught fire. The blaze disabled the ship. On 13 November, USS Kincaid, a Spruance class destroyer, collided with merchant ship Kota Petani in the Malacca Strait 386 kilometres north-west of Singapore. One Navy crewman was killed in the pre-dawn collision, five Navy crew were injured and fires were started on both vessels. On 14 November, fire broke out on board the amphibious assault ship USS Inchon when it was dry-docked for maintenance work at Norfolk, Virginia. At least 24 people were admitted to hospital, at least one in a serious condition. On 14 November again, two A6 attack bombers from the naval air base at E1 Centro, California, dropped 12 bombs about 300 metres from a camp site, injuring one civilian. The pilots overshot their target by five kilometres and dropped the 120-kilogram bombs, igniting fires over 1.5 hectares of the California desert conservation area. </PARA>
<PARA> Accident No. 9 took place on 16 November, when a Navy Reserve pilot flying an A-7E jet crashed into an apartment complex in Smyrna, Georgia, killing two civilians and injuring two others, including the pilot himself. Accident No. 10 took place on 17 November, when a fire aboard the submarine USS Finback broke out in insulation around an engine on the attack submarine, forcing the vessel to cut short sea trials. Accident No. 11 took place on 17 November, when mechanical problems forced a TA-4J training jet to ditch in the Gulf of Mexico south of Pensacola, Florida. The two pilots ejected safely, but presumably the training jet went to the bottom of the ocean. </PARA>
<PARA> This was a very serious string of accidents, which resulted in the Chief of Naval Operations at the Pentagon, Admiral C. Trost, and Navy Secretary Lawrence Garrett requiring all US Navy operations to cease within the next 72 hours from 16 November. A 48-hour safety check was ordered. The accidents that caused this unprecedented and very dramatic action on the part of the United States naval command ranged from collisions to fires and accidental bombings, and have taken place on land, in port and at sea. They have involved civilians as well as US Navy personnel. These accidents have been quite serious but there has been no admission of nuclear weapons being involved, in keeping with the United States Navy's tradition of secrecy. </PARA>
<PARA> It is known that there are already seven nuclear reactors and 49 nuclear weapons from previous accidents corroding on the ocean floor. I might add that they are not all the responsibility of the United States Navy, but they are the responsibility of nuclear navies in general. They are the collective legacy of the world's nuclear navies. Yet our Government blithely assumes that accidents will not happen here, or so our Minister for Defence (Mr Beazley) very clearly said on the ABC's 7.30 Report during the Bicentennial Naval Review. It might well have been called the United States naval review because there were lots of US ships here, in company with French and British nuclear weapons-bearing ships. The Minister said very clearly that accidents will not happen in Australian ports. I do not know how he dares to assume such a God-like role and say that accidents will not happen when three accidents have happened in recent times in Australian ports. </PARA>
<PARA> In 1981, at Stirling naval base, USS Pintado was rescued from rocks during a severe storm by tugs of the Seamen's Union of Australia, averting a disaster. The second accident was in 1987 in Brisbane, when USS Texas crashed into the wharf when leaving port. The third accident occurred in 1988 in Cairns when USS Berkeley collided with the pleasure craft  Coralita, causing extensive damage to the pleasure craft. I do not know how much more evidence the Government needs before it finds the commitment to prioritise the safety of the Australian people and the Australian environment above the so-called needs of United States Navy personnel. It seems to me to be absolutely extraordinary that the Minister can continue with a blithe absence of interest in the lack of safety of the United States Navy. </PARA>
<PARA> I asked a question on this subject today in this chamber. In response Senator Richardson, speaking for the Minister for Defence, although he was also speaking on his own behalf-he was not reading from briefing notes-was very rude and arrogant and showed total Government irresponsibility on this question. In light of this unprecedented shut-down of United States naval operations the Minister for Defence should at least have been interested in the status of Battlegroup Alpha while it was in the port of Fremantle during that 48-hour safety review period. The Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories said that he would not even bother to pass my questions on to the Minister for Defence. That is how arrogant his response was. </PARA>
<PARA> I think it is absolutely essential for our Defence Minister to know what is going on with United States vessels when they are visiting Australian ports. It was as though he did not know and did not care-and did not want to know, which is even worse. I find that really extraordinary. It is my judgment that the Minister for Defence ought to know whether there was a check of all weaponry, for example, while those ships were in port. That would have included nuclear weaponry being checked while those ships were in port, but of course the Minister chooses not to know. We needed to know what form the safety review check took-whether all United States personnel were called back to their ships from their rest and recreation in the ports of Fremantle, Geraldton and Bunbury to undertake the safety check. It was meant to involve the entire United States Navy and all naval personnel. </PARA>
<PARA> I can tell the Senate more than the Minister was prepared to tell the Senate this afternoon in response to that question, because I have been checking up on this, which is more than the Minister bothered to do. Evidently, personnel were not called back. The United States Navy might have had a mutiny on its hands if personnel had been called back from their precious rest and recreation to conduct the safety checks. So what kind of safety check was it? Our Government did not even bother to find out. I think it is also incredible that Senator Richardson fails to understand the importance of this United States naval shutdown and fails to link the environmental aspect of this question to his own portfolio area. He very assiduously seeks the vote of people who are concerned about environmental issues, but he does not seem to have made the connection for himself that this also is an environmental issue. These ships pose an enormous risk to us in light of the kinds of accidents that could take place-I hope they never do-in an Australian port if nuclear weapons or nuclear reactors were involved. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister also needs to know that he is out of line with the majority of the Australian population on this issue, presumably many of those who support his environmental moves which generally are in a good direction. In fact, only 26 per cent of Australians continue to support such visits. That figure comes from a Small and Associates Pty Ltd poll conducted in September this year. So the Minister, who wants to keep the environmentalists on side, is extremely foolish to be such an enthusiastic advocate of nuclear warship visits as he has demonstrated twice in this place by saying that he would be among those queuing up to go and look at the warships that come to visit us. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course, the military gawkers will always crowd on board. I wish that the silent majority was not so silent on this issue. I wish that more people would take part in demonstrations, but they were certainly there during the Bicentennial review. For years we have demonstrated against the visits of these warships to Fremantle. We could compare the military gawkers who crowd on board with the Romans who watched the Christians being fed to the lions. That did not make that action any more right than the action of our Government inviting these nuclear weapons-bearing warships into our ports. </PARA>
<PARA> There is a very strong conditioning in our community to accept military propaganda. It is extremely effective, but it is also true that millions more people stay at home disgusted by the display of military might. Their opposition to the visits of nuclear-armed vessels coming to our ports is not based just on the environmental risks which they pose and on targeting opportunities for the enemy. By that I mean that whenever these nuclear weapons-bearing ships come into our ports, those ports are targeted by the so-called enemy. However, more importantly, people's opposition to the continued visits of these nuclear warships is that they send a message of welcome to nuclear nations. They give our approval to the dangerous nuclear posturing which the nuclear navies undertake. That is a very important moral question. I do not believe that our Government addresses it seriously. </PARA>
<PARA> It is extremely hypocritical of the Government to talk about disarmament and to rejoice in the intermediate-range nuclear forces (INF) treaty and welcome into our ports on board ships and submarines the same weapons that are being dismantled in Europe. The Tomahawk cruise missiles are the direct replacement of the INF weapons which were signed away towards the latter part of 1987 in Europe. It is extremely hypocritical to welcome those weapons into our ports. </PARA>
<PARA> The nuclear navies which are not monitored and not subject to any disarmament agenda are increasingly unpopular wherever they go. Wherever the nuclear navies go in the world-not only the United States Navy but also the French, the Soviet, the Chinese and the British navies-they are increasingly unpopular because people see that nuclear weapons at sea are a great risk to the whole of humanity. There are now 16,000 nuclear weapons deployed at sea. Looking at it mathematically, nuclear accidents involving those weapons are inevitable. As I have said, there are already 49 nuclear weapons at the bottom of the ocean corroding away. One day their nuclear payloads will be distributed on the ocean floor as will the nuclear contamination from the seven nuclear reactors already rotting away on the ocean floor-the legacy of nuclear navies. Increasingly, the world's people are calling for a revision of the welcome that has previously been given to nuclear navies. </PARA>
<PARA> In these days of glasnost and perestroika and the breaking down of Cold War barriers, which was the subject of an earlier discussion in this chamber today, there is a great opportunity for Australia to rethink its unpopular longstanding invitation to nuclear navies in light of the changing international climate and in light of this unfortunate spate of accidents which has dogged the United States Navy in recent weeks. But no, we now expect another huge battle group, including the USS Enterprise with eight nuclear reactors on board, as well as over 100 nuclear weapons, to come into Australian ports in December. </PARA>
<PARA> Once again we will get the popular version presented by the media and silence from the Government. The media will say that the Navy is coming here just for rest and recreation and that it will spend lots of dollars. It was even reported in the Western Australian media last week that we were having a United States Navy-led tourism recovery; that because the pilots dispute has caused such havoc for the tourist industry in this country, we were welcoming the sailors because they would inject much-needed tourist dollars into the country. People do not seem to see past the dollars and cents of this or the flag waving opportunities from the Government point of view. They do not seem to see that an important moral question is involved. We are literally giving harbour to the most destructive weapons known to humanity every time we allow vessels bearing nuclear weapons to come into our harbours. So it is business as usual; business in every sense of the word. Lots of dollars will be made. The usual negative social consequences involved with the visit of a large number of sailors to any port at any time, for whatever reasons, are there to see. We need to look at sexually transmitted diseases much more carefully than we have in the past when such visits have taken place. </PARA>
<PARA> The business as usual approach is being adopted despite the 500-page report of a Senate standing committee concerning the accidental release of ionising radiation from the visits of either nuclear-armed or nuclear-powered warships coming into Australian ports and despite the excellent dissenting report by Senator Dunn. Even the limited reforms that were suggested by that committee are being totally ignored by the Government. Those very limited reforms related only to plans on paper. They did not make any difference in substance whatsoever to the risks which Australian ports are subjected to every time a nuclear navy comes into port. The Government did not have the guts to make the hard decisions that need to be made. The Government has not even responded to that committee's report. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister has already been proved wrong in saying that accidents will not happen in Australian ports. As I have pointed out, we have already had three accidents relating to United States naval vessels in Australian ports. I hope that the Minister will not be proved wrong in relation to nuclear weapons accidents in Australian ports. If he is proved wrong it will be too late to count the cost. It will be too late then for any accusations or expressions of sorrow. If a nuclear weapons accident or a nuclear generator accident occurred in an Australian port there would be little that anyone could do about it, notwithstanding the long awaited Senate report. I fervently hope that we never see that day because, if we do, it will be too late to reverse the Government's blind spot on this issue. Much wringing of hands will take place. It will not give anti-nuclear campaigners any satisfaction to say, `We told you so'. </PARA>
<PARA> The point is that this is an unnecessary risk. We do not have to take it. We are not obliged to invite these vessels into our ports. Inviting them into our ports is not part of the ANZUS Treaty. It is not part of that written agreement that was signed in 1951. We need to rethink our commitment to that agreement as well and to the unwritten millstones which it ties around our necks. The visits of nuclear warships is one of them. </PARA>
<PARA> Now is the time for a rethink. It is an opportunity for the Government to change its policies. My plea is that the Government listen to the wisdom of the people. Remember that I said that only 26 per cent of Australians support the continued visits of these nuclear-armed and nuclear-powered vessels into our ports. The Government should listen to the wisdom of the people who are so often ahead of the Government on these important moral questions. The Government should follow the New Zealand Government's lead to ban the visits of these potentially dangerous and militarily threatening warships into our ports. It is high time we took a very brave decision. I hope that with the changing international climate it will give the Australian Government some impetus to rethink its policy and to change its mind. What we need is an immediate and permanent ban on all visits of nuclear-armed and nuclear-powered warships from Australian ports. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Tonight I want to mention the death at the weekend of Mr Jim Bradfield, the Federal member for Barton from 1975 to 1983. His passing was noted when we met earlier today. However, I would like to take this opportunity to outline to the Senate the role that Jim Bradfield played in a very important part of Australian political history. I refer, of course, to the enormous swing to the coalition parties in 1975 and the ending of the extraordinary period of the Whitlam Government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Jim Bradfield was one of the people who came in in that election. I was one of them, too. We were called `oncers' by our Australian Labor Party colleagues because they took the view that we would be here for one term only, and we were continually subjected to that jibe in our first term in office. Most of us survived for at least three terms, including Jim Bradfield. He was, if you like, unfortunate in coming in with such a large group of highly competent people. He was a successful businessman and after he left Parliament he also became a successful farmer. He was a thoroughly decent, honourable man with a very sound knowledge of economics and he made excellent contributions to economic debates. He was a member of the treasury committee during the Fraser Government's period in office. Had there not been so many highly skilled people, there is no doubt that Jim Bradfield would in normal circumstances have become a Minister of the Crown. Certainly his talents deserved that reward but there were many people in that group, like Murray Sainsbury and Maurice Neil, QC, who were unable to get what they deserved in politics, which was the reward of becoming a Minister, before unfortunately they were beaten-in Jim's case in the big swing of 1983. </PARA>
<PARA> Jim Bradfield regularly attended our `oncers' dinners-which were always held, by the way, as close as possible to 11 November, the day the 1975 change in government initially took place-and was always a very friendly contributor to what were always joyous occasions. At our recent `oncers' dinner we were all very distressed to hear how unwell Jim was, although we were told that he had maintained the enormous spirit and courage that he had shown all through his illness. </PARA>
<PARA> Jim Bradfield is the second of our 1975 group to have died. The other was Senator John Knight, who died, as you would remember, Mr President, in office as a senator. I certainly know that all my colleagues who came in in 1975 join with me in regretting the passing of our very good friend Jim Bradfield. Our sympathies go to his wife Jill and to their children, and to other members of Jim's family, with whom he was very close. He was a person whom it can quite properly be said was beloved by his family and admired and respected by his colleagues. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1"> asked the Minister representing the Treasurer, upon notice, on 25 May 1989:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Following the passing of the close corporations legislation in the Senate, does the Commissioner of Taxation intend to extend, via his rulings, roll-over relief to close corporations free of capital gains status which is currently available to individuals or partnerships rolling-over to companies.</PARA>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="2961" SPEAKER="Walsh Sen The Hon P.A." NAMEID="TJ4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="TAS">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="TJ4">Senator Walsh</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Treasurer has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Section 160ZZN of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936, subject to certain conditions being met, grants capital gains tax rollover relief in respect of assets transferred, by an individual or partnership, to a wholly owned company. The Commissioner of Taxation considers that a close corporation is a company for the purposes of the Income Tax Assessment Act. Consequently, the Commissioner considers that capital gains rollover relief is available under section 160ZZN on the same conditions as apply in respect of assets transferred by individuals or partnerships to other types of companies.</PARA>
<PARA> There will, no doubt, be cases where it is desired to convert a ``traditional'' company into a close corporation. Where the requirements of section 24 of the Close Corporations Act have been met, the newly formed close corporation is deemed to be the same legal entity as the former ``traditional'' company. (Section 24 requires, among other things, that the ``traditional'' company not be a holding company, and that all its shares be fully paid up, be of the same value and have the same rights.) The Commissioner has indicated that, where section 24 applies, rollover relief would not be necessary as there would, in those circumstances, be no change in ownership of the relevant assets.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="UI4">Senator Robert Ray</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Administrative Services has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) IBM Australia has not become the sole supplier of computer hardware and software to the Department of Defence. IBM was selected as the Prime Contractor for DESINE after the invitation of public tenders on the basis that it offered the most cost-effective Total Solution. IBM supplies the equipment in conjunction with twenty-one selected subcontractors. In addition to fulfilling computer contracts which were already in existence at the time the DESINE contract was awarded, other companies will be given the opportunity to bid for requirements which are exempt from DESINE, in accordance with the criteria which Defence has made publicly available.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) The Minister for Defence consulted the Prime Minister, the Ministers for Finance, Industry, Technology and Commerce and myself concerning the decision to award the contract to IBM Australia Ltd. I was advised by my Department that the selection of IBM Australia Ltd as the successful tenderer would withstand public scrutiny. Officers of my Department followed normal procedures and arranged the contract with advice from the Australian Government Solicitor. These procedures did not require any further approval from me before contract signature.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) The contract is consistent with the guidelines contained in the Commonwealth Purchasing Manual, Chapter 13, Section 2, which provides that if the Commonwealth wishes to bind a contractor to fulfil orders placed under a period contract, this may be achieved by guaranteeing that all of its requirements for items covered by the contract will be obtained from that contract.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) The RFT sought to establish a prime contractor to supply hardware and software which would be the basis for a standard computing environment. The final contract is consistent with that expressed objective.</PARA>
<PARA> (5) The final contract for DESINE is consistent with the Request for Tender.</PARA>
<PARA> (6) At the time tenders closed, agreement between my Department and Defence had not been reached on certain aspects of the evaluation methodology. In accordance with normal procedures, the tenders were not released by my Department until the evaluation methodology had been approved.</PARA>
<PARA> (7) Defence personnel were given access to the tenders for the purposes of registration and sorting only. It was a condition of providing access to the documents that the Defence officers would not commence a technical evaluation of the tenders. The tender documents remained in the care of officers of my Department until they were formally released.</PARA>
<PARA> (8) My Department formally approved the evaluation methodology in the form of a memorandum to Defence.</PARA>
<PARA> (9) On 21 August 1987. A copy can be made available to the honourable Senator's Office on a ``commercial-in-confidence'' basis.</PARA>
<PARA> (10) I was advised prior to the approval of the shortlisted tenders that all the tenders were evaluated in accordance with the predetermined criteria for shortlisting of the offers. Only those total solutions which were shortlisted (from Digital Equipment Corporation, IBM Australia and Unisys Australia Ltd), were evaluated in detail. All the remaining tenders were assessed as part tenders in the final phase of the evaluation.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator Gareth Evans</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Telecommunications and Aviation Support has supplied the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) A person or group of persons may design, build and operate a single place aeroplane for their own use under the provisions of Civil Aviation Order (CAO) 95.10. The only requirement placed upon the designer/builders is that the aircraft must be fitted with occupant restraint. The aeroplane class is restricted by weight limits, but unlicensed persons may fly the aeroplane for recreational purposes.</PARA>
<PARA>The Corby Starlet is currently the only Australian designed aeroplane type eligible for a Certificate of Airworthiness under the amateur construction rules of CAO 101.28.</PARA>
<PARA>The type was first accepted for construction by amateur builders on 27 September 1972. Issue 2 of the construction package was accepted on 20 June 1980.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) For personal or recreational use, the only significant regulatory requirement applicable to Australian CAO 95.10 aeroplanes, beyond the requirements of the United States, is the fitting of the occupant restraint. The Australian weight limitation is more liberal than that of the United States for similar aeroplane classes. The United Kingdom requires compliance with the British Civil Airworthiness Requirements Section S for the class of aircraft similar to the Australian CAO 95.10 types.</PARA>
<PARA>Australian amateur built aeroplanes, with a type certificated engine, can be eligible for an unrestricted Certificate of Airworthiness. The aeroplane may then be flown in any mode dependent upon the pilot's qualifications and the fitted communications and navigation systems. An amateur built aeroplane with a none type certificated engine may be restricted from flight over populated areas. The amateur built aeroplanes in the United States and the United Kingdom are not eligible for an unrestricted Certificate of Airworthiness.</PARA>
<PARA>Commercially sold recreational aeroplanes, with a maximum take off mass less than 450 kgs, are to comply with the requirements of CAO 101.55 as the result of the adoption of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Transport Safety Report. These aeroplane types are eligible for Certificates of Type Approval and Certificates of Airworthiness, but are restricted from flight over populated areas unless they are fitted with a type certificated aircraft engine.</PARA>
<PARA>Because the Australian amateur built aeroplane, (built to comply with CAO 101.28), may be operated in a more liberal operational environment the airworthiness rules must be appropriate to the operational envelope. The United States imposes operational restrictions upon amateur built aeroplanes but has a more liberal design and construction environment. The United Kingdom has a more restrictive operational environment in that a Certificate of Airworthiness is not issued, but has design and construction rules which parallel the Australian requirements.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) The continued justification for the existence of CAO 101.28 paragraphs 3.3 and 3.4 is the requirement for the primacy of safety of civil air operations in Australia. The brief descriptions of the various classes in Part 2 of this question indicate that amateur built aeroplanes are eligible for a wide spectrum of operational freedom.</PARA>
<PARA>If amateur built aeroplanes are to be eligible for an unrestricted Certificate of Airworthiness, then the issuing Authority must be sure of the structural integrity of the aeroplane as well as satisfactory handling and performance.</PARA>
<PARA>Designs of aeroplanes for amateur construction which originate from overseas must demonstrate a history of safe operation for several examples of the aeroplane type. The drawings and other construction directions are examined for structural integrity and flight trials are conducted to verify handling and performance characteristics.</PARA>
<PARA>An Australian, or foreign, design example which has never flown cannot have a safe history of operation and therefore be eligible for a Certificate of Airworthiness under the ``safe history of operation'' requirement.</PARA>
<PARA>The opportunity for an Australian design to accumulate a history of operation exists through the application of the CAO 101.31 provisions for developmental flying. A submission for developmental flying has minimal assessment requirements before permission is granted to conduct operations according to an agreed flight test schedule. Assessment of the aeroplane structure is accomplished at the same time as the developmental flying. If the structure and handling are satisfactory the aeroplane may be granted a Certificate of Airworthiness, with or without restrictions, on the basis of only the engine certification status.</PARA>
<PARA>The Australian regulatory position for paper designs is neutral, dependent upon the chosen class, and the discrimination, if any, is in the realm of aviation safety for the public and the aeroplane occupants. There is no discrimination against Australian builders who wish to construct an established aeroplane design.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) All of the CAOs are under constant review but the programme's priorities are dependent upon the available technical resources. The current priority is directed toward the regular public transport category which exposes the most people to the risks of aviation. The review of the amateur-built category certification requirements will deal with paragraphs 3.3 and 3.4 of CAO 101.28.</PARA>
<PARA>I have received representations on alleged discrimination caused by paragraphs 3.3 and 3.4 and have asked the Air Safety Regulatory Review Task Force to specifically examine this issue.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4F4">Senator Button</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) No. A person who wishes to commence amateur construction of an aircraft is not required to produce a design. There is a range of designs of aircraft types already accepted and suitable for amateur construction.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) The Australian Light Aircraft Industry Study Group Report noted the discriminatory aspect of Air Navigation Order 101.28. However, in practice clauses 3.3 and 3.4 do not impose any conditions upon Australian amateur builders of aircraft to which overseas builders are not obliged to conform.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) The Civil Aviation Authority does not keep a complete register of all aircraft built for personal use in Australia. However, the Light Aircraft Industry Study Group Report noted that construction of amateur-built aircraft in Australia began in the early 1950s. Since then approximately 260 aircraft were believed to have been completed. The Report noted a total of 440 ``active'' amateur-built projects in Australia. These projects involved a total of 77 approved Aircraft types, while 22 types were under consideration. Of these 99 types, 80 were of US origin. Only two types, the Corby Starlet and the Paleto Maverick, were of Australian design.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) Yes, as far as I'm aware in regard to aircraft falling under the provisions of section 101.28. However information from Jane's All The World's Aircraft 1987-88 indicates the Corby Starlet was first built in 1972. Information from the Department of Transport and Communications also confirms the later date for the Corby Starlet.</PARA>
<PARA> (5) No. The Australian Light Aircraft Industry has well over twenty active light aircraft projects and while most are still in the development phase a few have made the transition to production and sales. In some cases early export shipments have been achieved. This can be seen as indicative of some of the strengths of the Australian Light Aircraft Industry which includes:</PARA>
<PARA>pockets of design capability and expertise coupled with great enthusiasm;</PARA>
<PARA>high levels of innovation and research and development;</PARA>
<PARA>a high rate of growth (though care must be taken to ensure that this does not result in an unacceptable degree of fragmentation);</PARA>
<PARA>sizeable home market which can be used as a springboard for exports.</PARA>
<PARA> (6) I have accepted Recommendation 7 (``the study group notes and supports the House of Representatives Committee on Transport Safety (HORSCOTS) recommendation 17 (a) that the Department of Transport and Communications remove the discriminatory aspect of ANO 101.28. The distinction between aircraft of Australian design and those of overseas design should be withdrawn while ensuring that the Australian requirements are no more complex than those existing for imported aircraft.'') of the Australian Light Aircraft Industry Study Group Report and I wrote to my colleague, the honourable Ros Kelly, Minister for Telecommunications and Aviation, on 24 January 1989, drawing this recommendation to her attention. Her response was ``The Government accepted this HORSCOTS recommendation and this CAO, which deals with amateur-built aircraft, will be reviewed as part of the general review of airworthiness Orders.'' She went on to say that ``discussions are underway with The Sport Aircraft Association of Australia regarding an appropriate level of self-administration of the amateur-built aircraft sport.''.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Transport and Communications has supplied the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) Under the terms of the domestic terminal leases, which took effect from 1 January 1988, Ansett and Australian Airlines were granted leases for a 20 year term with provision for an extension of around 10 years subject to certain specified conditions.</PARA>
<PARA>These leases supersede the previous agreements which generally gave Ansett and Australian Airlines exclusive rights to their terminals until 1993, well beyond the start of deregulation on 31 October 1990.</PARA>
<PARA>The Government recognised that the success of deregulation would depend on the ability of new entrants to gain access to airport facilities. The Government therefore took the initiative, and decided in the absence of other available facilities to renegotiate the leases held by Ansett and Australian Airlines, with a view to allowing other operators access to terminal facilities after deregulation.</PARA>
<PARA>Copies of the terminal leases have been made available to potential new entrants on request.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) Leases have been agreed with Ansett and Australian Airlines at the following Airports; Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane, Perth, Adelaide, Hobart, Coolangatta and Launceston.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) Yes, under the terms of the terminal leases, Ansett and Australian Airlines are required to provide new entrants with a full range of passenger processing facilities, including access to baggage check-in and handling facilities, passenger assembly areas, aerobridges, where appropriate, and aircraft parking positions.</PARA>
<PARA>The leases require Ansett and Australian Airlines to provide facilities at Sydney and Melbourne to handle two passenger aircraft each at any one time. At Adelaide, Perth and Coolangatta, facilities for the handling of one passenger aircraft by both Ansett and Australian Airlines are to be provided. Ansett is required to provide facilities at Launceston to handle one passenger aircraft. At Brisbane, the Federal Airports Corporation (FAC) has alternative accommodation that can be made available to new entrants. At Hobart, new entrants can be accommodated in the international terminal.</PARA>
<PARA>Use of facilities by new entrants will be on either a dedicated sub-lease or common use basis, depending upon the needs of new entrants.</PARA>
<PARA>The process to allocate terminal facilities to new entrants will commence by 1 January 1990, when Ansett and Australian Airlines must advise the FAC of the facilities that they are to make available.</PARA>
<PARA>On 1 February 1990, the Secretary to the Department of Transport and Communications will arrange for public notice to be given of new entrant facilities available at airports and call for applications for their use.</PARA>
<PARA>On 1 March 1990, these applications will be opened in the presence of Ansett and Australian Airlines representatives by the Secretary and the facilities will be allocated on a priority order:</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="UI4">Senator Robert Ray</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) The new policy governing the entry of applicants wishing to undertake non-formal study courses of less than 12 months duration and ELICOS (English Language Intensive Courses for Overseas Students) has been introduced to curb a real overstay problem. The overstay rate for students from all countries in these programs is 23.3 per cent. (In 1988/89 21,483 persons were issued visas to undertake ELICOS.) By way of contrast, the overstay rate for visitors is 1.8 per cent and over 1.3 million visas were issued in 1988/89 under this program.</PARA>
<PARA> The overstay rate at the end of May 1989 for students from the People's Republic of China (PRC) was 40 per cent. Since 1 January 1986, 15,111 PRC students have arrived in Australia and up to the end of May 1989 only 1,685 (or 11.2 per cent) had left Australia.</PARA>
<PARA> The Government's new measures were introduced to address the overstay problem as well as the ``pipeline'' of 25,000 applications lodged with the Embassy in Beijing. The ``pipeline'' processing measures are less stringent than the global measures (which will apply to PRC applicants from 1 January 1990) in that ``pipeline'' applicants will be assessed against a lower education level criterion (year 10 compared with year 12 for the global measures) and will not be subject to more extensive immigration bona fides testing (required under the global measures). Immigration bona fides tests are applied to assess the applicant against the stated purpose or reason for wanting to come to Australia and likely compliance with the entry conditions (ie the applicant will leave Australia at the expiry of the entry permit).</PARA>
<PARA> The under 35 years of age stipulation is an education rather than immigration criterion. In general terms, it is expected that by age 35 people will have undertaken the education offered by the ELICOS program. There are exceptions to this and the Government has recognised these in framing the measures to apply to the ``pipeline'' processing.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) The new measures are based on objective evidence of overstay patterns.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) Not applicable. Objective criteria have been established and further delay in implementation would worsen an already intolerable situation.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) It is more efficient and considerably less costly to apply immigration checks prior to visa issue. The statistics referred to in (1) above illustrate the efficiency of immigration bona fides testing-the visitor program is subject to immigration bona fides testing, the ELICOS program has not been. Compliance activity in Australia plays a role but it is very expensive. The average cost (excluding court costs) associated with locating and deporting a prohibited non citizen is $9,000.</PARA>
<PARA> Part of the new measures introduced to address the student overstay problem is the introduction of an application fee of $130. Monies raised by this fee will offset the cost of location and removal of student overstayers.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Defence Science and Personnel has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) The findings of the Auditor-General's Audit Report No. 11, 1989/90, into the Department of Defence's recruiting practices have been noted by the Minister, particularly the first key finding that the Defence Force Recruiting Branch has been effective in substantially achieving annual recruitment targets despite a number of difficulties. The Honourable senator's question quoted three of the difficulties identified in the Auditor-General's Report. The report also noted a decreasing target population, competition with civilian employers, changing recruitment targets which require long lead times for achievement and constraints on recruitment targets.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) Not all of the difficulties outlined by the report are capable of being overcome. Recruiting is conducted to meet the personnel requirements of the three Services. Decreasing recruitable age population, competition with civilian employers, changing recruitment targets, constraints on recruitment targets (if a target is not met at a particular time it is difficult to make up the shortfall later because of limits on the number of recruits that can be trained at any one time) and difficulty in competing for qualified staff have to be accepted as part of the recruiting environment. Media comment will always contain both adverse and favourable aspects depending on the viewpoint of the journalist concerned. The need for and the value of advertising is recognised as is the need for adequate travel funds. These areas are accorded an appropriate level of priority for funding within the Department of Defence.

<PARA> (2) As shown in the above table, over 3,000 projects were completed in each year. These projects ranged in value from a few hundred dollars to several hundred thousand dollars involving single field units to multiple field parties. Clients included virtually all Commonwealth Departments, a number of Government Business Enterprises (GBEs), State Governments and the private sector.</PARA>
<PARA>AUSLIG introduced full cost recovery from 1 January 1988. Prior to that date GBEs were charged for surveying services while Commonwealth Departments were not. In addition, AUSLIG refined its charging rates over the period covered by these questions in anticipation of the move to Trust Account operations which occurred 1 July 1989. Thus it is not possible to provide precise cost details for all projects.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Prime Minister has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In my replies to the honourable senator's previous questions relating to expenditure by the Commonwealth in individual States, I have explained that:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) I consider Commonwealth expenditure in the States a legitimate and pertinent subject for a Parliamentary question by a Senator but within the context of a number of accounting limitations;</PARA>
<PARA> (b) Commonwealth accounting systems have been designed to record expenditure against the source of payment;</PARA>
<PARA> (c) in the case of programs for which client location is a significant factor in judging program performance, information about client location is routinely collected, although not necessarily in an accounting context. That information may allow expenditure under the program to be calculated by individual States; and</PARA>
<PARA> (d) for those programs for which client location is not significant in evaluating program performance, information about client location is not routinely collected.</PARA>
<PARA>Neither this Government nor previous Governments have sought accurately to calculate Commonwealth expenditure by individual States. This information has not been denied to Parliament since it has not been requested. As previously advised, considerable resources would be required accurately to calculate Commonwealth expenditure by individual States and, in the case of my own Department, I determined that I would not authorise the use of the considerable resources involved e.g. each salary transaction for Central Office in Canberra would need to be examined to determine whether payments were made to a bank in Canberra (Australian Capital Territory) or Queanbeyan (New South Wales). In the same way, payments to suppliers would need to be examined to determine whether the supplier was located in Canberra or inter-State.</PARA>

<PARA> I refer the Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce to press reports that pineapples valued at more than $1m, representing about 8,000 to 10,000 tonnes of fruit, were left to rot on Queensland farms because of a market glut triggered by cheap Asian imports. In view of the fact that imports of canned pineapples from countries such as Thailand, Indonesia and the Philippines have jumped 50 per cent in the past year to the equivalent of about 25,000 tonnes of fresh fruit, would the Minister consider supporting the industry in mounting a case to have dumping duties imposed on these imports-</PARA>
<PARA>The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:</PARA>
<PARA> Provisions exist under the anti-dumping legislation for an application to be made for the publication of a dumping duty notice if dumped goods are causing or threatening material injury to an Australian industry. I would advise the industry to lodge a dumping complaint with the Australian Customs Service (ACS) if it considers it is being materially injured by dumped exports of canned pineapples from South East Asia.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator Gareth Evans</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) Through its Cultural Relations Branch the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade promotes a range of cultural, artistic and educational activities aimed at furthering Australia's broader foreign policy objectives. Examples of activities covered in the programs include visits overseas by Australian performers and artists and visits to Australia by key cultural figures from target countries, mounting festivals and screenings of Australian films, the provision of Australian sports coaches, the provision of Australian television programs and support for Australian studies courses overseas. The Branch's activities are complemented by activities undertaken by the Australia-Japan Foundation, the Australia-Indonesia Institute, the Australia-China Council and the Australia-New Zealand Foundation.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade is not a grant giving organisation. In order to carry out its programs it meets the costs (fees, travel, etc.) of artists, sportsmen and sportswomen and academics to undertake specific tasks on its behalf. On occasions it provides part funding with other institutions such as the Australia Council. In some instances it assists financially, and in other ways, individuals or groups already undertaking or proposing to undertake activities overseas where these are in accordance with the Government's overseas cultural relations priorities and where a measure of assistance would be cost-effective. There is no regularly scheduled allocation for such assistance, rather requests are considered on their merits as they arise. The Australia-China Council, the Australia-Japan Foundation and the Australia-New Zealand Foundation and the Australia-Indonesia Institute also make payments for broadly defined cultural activities in accordance with policies set by their various boards.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) The total expenditure for cultural relations programs for 1988-89 was $4,194,196.</PARA>
<PARA> This was broken up into:</PARA>

<PARA>105 000</PARA>
<PARA> (5) In carrying out its activities the Department works closely with a range of bodies including other Commonwealth and State Departments and instrumentalities, professional and artistic bodies, the Australian Sports Commission and the Australia Council. In late 1988 the Government established a Cultural Coordinating Committee under the chairmanship of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade which includes a wide range of bodies active in the promotion of Australian culture overseas. The aim of the committee is to enable these various government and non-government authorities to cooperate and coordinate their activities where appropriate. The Department does not seek to dictate or to determine which activities should be undertaken. It does however attempt to marshal the resources of other groups in support of particular events (e.g. an Australian Cultural Fortnight to be held in Bangkok in October/November 1989) and to encourage other bodies to undertake activities in areas of foreign policy priority.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Primary Industries and Energy has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There is no estimate available of the level of indirect assistance provided to tobacco growers under the terms of the 1989-1993 tobacco industry stabilisation plan. While the first year of the plan ended on 30 September 1989, import statistics necessary to calculate assistance are not yet available.</PARA>
<PARA> The 1989-1993 tobacco industry stabilisation plan is underpinned by the local leaf content scheme. Under this scheme, concessional tariffs apply to leaf imported by domestic manufacturers of tobacco products who purchase at least 50 per cent of their leaf requirements domestically. As all manufacturers participate in the local leaf content scheme, price levels for domestic leaf under the plan will be influenced by the extent of the differential between the general and concessional tariff rates on imported leaf.</PARA>
<PARA> The level of assistance provided to tobacco growers during the term of the 1989-1993 plan will be affected by a number of factors. These include changes in the price of Australian leaf relative to that in overseas countries supplying tobacco leaf and exchange rate relativities.</PARA>
<PARA> In accordance with the 25 May 1988 Government decision, the general tariff on tobacco leaf is being progressively lowered from 25 to 15 per cent by 1992.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Primary Industries and Energy has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The major issue currently facing the Australian citrus industry is the need to develop a comprehensive marketing plan taking into account forecast large production increases over the next few years. These forecasts are derived from new plantings of citrus which will come into production and higher yields from existing plantings.</PARA>
<PARA> A critical element of the marketing plan will be to establish export market strategies for fresh fruit to reduce the present reliance on the domestic processing market.</PARA>
<PARA> In these circumstances it is not appropriate for the Government to be considering increased levels of assistance to the citrus industry.</PARA>
<PARA> Under the general tariff reduction announced in the May 1988 Economic Statement, the tariff for most citrus juices is being phased down to 15% by 1 July 1992, with a 5% margin for developing countries. The tariff applicable for the 1989-90 financial year is 24% general rate and 19% developing country rate. This rate provides substantial protection for the industry. No exemptions to these general tariff reductions have been granted as to do so would run counter to the aim of encouraging a more competitive industry structure throughout the economy.</PARA>
<PARA> Under the current sales tax arrangements for citrus juice, beverages with a minimum Australian or New Zealand juice content of 25% incur a sales tax rate of 10% rather than 20% which applies to other juices and aerated and carbonated soft drinks. The IAC has claimed in its report on the Fresh Fruit and Fruit Products Industries that these arrangements provide substantial assistance to the industry. The Commission also pointed out that they encourage too great a reliance on processing at the expense of fresh fruit and other activities. This reliance has an adverse flow on effect on planting decisions, horticultural practices and marketing. The IAC recommend that the local content provisions be removed and sales tax on fruit based drinks containing not less than 25% of fruit juices be increased to 20% by 1994.</PARA>
<PARA> The citrus industry has made further representations to the Government on this issue and has also approached the IAC in the context of their current inquiry into the Food Processing and Beverage Industries. The Government has not made any decisions on the sales tax or local content issue pending further assessment of the evidence provided by the citrus industry.</PARA>
<PARA> The citrus industry recognises the challenges which lie ahead and is developing a marketing and promotion strategy in conjunction with the Australian Horticultural Corporation (AHC). Mr Baker's comments are made in the context of his role as Chairman of the Citrus Marketing Committee established by the industry and the Corporation to implement the strategy.</PARA>
<PARA> The AHC was established by the Government in August 1988 to help Australian horticultural industries reach their full export potential. The Government has provided a total of $5.85m to the Corporation over its first five years to assist in its early operation. I commend the citrus industry on its decision to become a founding participant in the AHC and its willingness to plan for the future.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator Gareth Evans</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Transport and Communications has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question, based in part on information provided by the Australian Broadcasting Corporation:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) The ABC advised that, in response to the events which took place in Beijing in June, Radio Australia's standard Chinese broadcasts were extended from six and a half to eight hours per day.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) and (3) The answers to these questions are quite complex. Radio Australia broadcasts on the high frequency (HF) or shortwave bands of the radio frequency spectrum. In order to achieve long distance transmission, these high frequency radio waves are deliberately directed above the horizon-so that they are reflected from the earth's ionosphere and come back to earth many thousands of kilometres away. Each such transmission path, involving one reflection from the ionosphere, is known as a `hop'.</PARA>
<PARA> For extremely long distance transmission, it is necessary to rely on multiple `hops', where the transmitted signal is reflected once from the ionosphere, returns to earth and is re-reflected at the earth's surface-to be reflected once more again by the ionosphere.</PARA>
<PARA> Unfortunately, the signal-reflecting properties of the ionosphere vary diurnally, seasonally and over the sun spot cycle.</PARA>
<PARA> It is thus necessary to transmit very high levels of signal power, if reasonable signals are to reach the target audience, and it is necessary to change the transmitter's frequency during each day, to compensate for the changes in the ionosphere.</PARA>
<PARA> In the case of high frequency transmissions from Australia to China, the separation distance is so great that two-to-three transmission `hops' are necessary. Thus, using RA's most powerful transmitters, signal coverage of Southern and parts of Central China is reasonably reliable, but signals into Northern China are relatively weak and become very variable due to the cumulative influence of the ionosphere over the number of `hops'.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) There are no immediate practical options for significantly improving Radio Australia's signal coverage of Northern China from within Australia. This could only be achieved using transmitters sited in a country much closer to Northern China. The establishment of such transmission facilities would not be a simple matter and would not be a short-term project. It is intended that the Government will consider the future role and responsibilities of Radio Australia later this year, as a necessary preliminary to any upgrade of the transmission system for the overseas service. The Department of Transport and Communications will undertake a study of optimum transmission sites and equipment.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Science, Customs and Small Business has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) The actual appropriation for administrative expenses in 1987-88 in regard to the Co-ordination and Services was $12,843,000. The figure of $12,825,000 quoted on page 273 of Budget Paper No. 3 is correct and reflects actual expenditure against the appropriation of $12,843,000.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) The figure of $16,916,000 is the actual administration expenditure for 1988-89. It should be noted however that the expenditure in 1988-89 for Staff Housing (funded from Appropriation Bill 2) was included in the actual administration expenditure for 1988-89. Under revised running cost arrangements for 1989-90 costs for the purchase of minor repairs and maintenance of staff housing are to be funded from administration expenditure (Appropriation Bill 1). In order to present expenditure for 1988-89 and estimates for 1989-90 on a ``like'' basis the expenditure for staff housing in 1988-89 was therefore included as administration expenditure in the Department of Industry, Technology and Commerce Budget Explanatory Notes.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) The estimate quoted for administrative costs for 1989-90 does represent a 59% increase over 1987-88. The 1989-90 estimate on the same basis is 21.1% above expenditure in 1988-89. For the first time in 1988-89 details were provided in the Explanatory notes of receipts credited pursuant to Section 9 of Appropriation Bill No. 1. When these are included in administrative costs the increases on 1987-88 and 1988-89, though the figures are not strictly comparable, become 71% and 29.7% respectively.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) The major variations between 1987-88 and 1988-89 are attributed to the following:</PARA>
<PARA> supplementation to cover introduction of ``full cost'' charges for services provided by the Department of Administrative Services (DAS) +$263,000</PARA>
