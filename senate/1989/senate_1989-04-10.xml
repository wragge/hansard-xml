<TITLE>Violent Television Programs</TITLE>
<PARA>To the Honourable the President of the Senate and members of the Senate in Parliament assembled:</PARA>
<PARA> The petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth, that:</PARA>
<PARA> We are concerned about the increase in violent television programmes for children and particularly those programmes promoting violent toys that are available for sale in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA> Your petitioners therefore humbly pray:</PARA>
<PARA> That you support the Broadcasting (Prohibition of Violent Programmes for Children) Act 1988 which has been presented by Western Australian Independent Senator for Nuclear Disarmament, Jo Vallentine. This act aims to prohibit the broadcasting of children's TV programmes that are violent and that promote toys modelled on characters, weapons or other war accessories which are also available for sale in Australia.</PARA>

<TITLE>Home Ownership</TITLE>
<PARA>To the Honourable the President and members of the Senate in Parliament assembled. The petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth that:-</PARA>
<PARA> Recent huge rises in mortgage interest rates have pushed the cost of buying their own home beyond the reach of most Australian families</PARA>
<PARA> Those Australians already paying off home mortgages are now suffering severely and unfairly through increased mortgage payments or longer repayment times so that many will never pay off their mortgage and go further and further into debt unless interest rates fall substantially.</PARA>
<PARA> Now, therefore, your petitioners request that the Senate in Parliament assembled require the Hawke-Keating government to cease its excessive reliance on high interest rates as its major economic policy weapon and instead to use other measures which would allow interest rates to return to levels that do not force most Australian home-seekers out of the housing market-and many Australians out of their homes-so that the traditional right of home ownership is returned to average Australian families.</PARA>
<PARA> And your petitioners, as in duty bound, will ever pray.</PARA>

<TITLE>Sydney (Kingsford-Smith) Airport</TITLE>
<PARA>To the Honourable the President of the Senate and members of the Senate assembled in Parliament; the humble petition of the undersigned showeth:</PARA>
<PARA> That Kingsford-Smith Airport is becoming increasingly congested and existing facilities are inadequate to handle the number of aircraft or their passengers.</PARA>
<PARA> The Federal Government's plans to divert aircraft from Mascot to Bankstown and/or increase landing charges for peak periods will do little to relieve congestion and will place enormous financial and other burdens on commuter airlines and their passengers.</PARA>
<PARA> We therefore call on the Federal Government to take heed of airline and travel industry warnings and-</PARA>
<PARA> 1. give immediate approval for the construction of a third runway at Mascot</PARA>
<PARA> 2. upgrade existing radar and other traffic control facilities to enable Australia's high safety record to be maintained.</PARA>

<TITLE>Pharmaceutical Drugs</TITLE>
<PARA>To the Honourable the President and members of the Senate in Parliament assembled. The humble petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia showeth:</PARA>
<PARA> That your petitioners deplore the Federal Government's decision to remove 53 Pharmaceutical drugs-including the best available for the treatment of high blood pressure, cancer, epilepsy, high cholesterol and uneven heartbeat,-and place them for cost saving reasons only on a special list requiring Authority from a Canberra bureaucrat, and;</PARA>
<PARA> that we believe a patient's doctor is clearly the best judge for medication needed for their particular illness and that it is therefore wrong and unfair to force that doctor to waste valuable time referring a case to a person in Canberra who has no personal knowledge of that case.</PARA>

<TITLE>National AIDS Program: Funding</TITLE>
<PARA>To the Honourable the President and members of the Senate in Parliament assembled:</PARA>
<PARA> The petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth:</PARA>
<PARA> That your petitioners are offended and outraged by the direction of the AIDS Programme in Tasmania, in that it actively promotes Homosexual Acts and in particular anal intercourse, and that taxpayers money is being used to fund literature which directly promotes homosexual behaviour as a normal and desirable human activity.</PARA>
<PARA> Your petitioners therefore urgently and strongly request that the Federal Government and the Minister for Health review the National AIDS Programme and withdraw funding for this literature, and from any other aspects of the AIDS Campaign which encourages or condones anal intercourse.</PARA>
<PARA> And your petitioners, as in duty bound, will ever pray.</PARA>

<PARA> (1) that the existing laws, which exclude toy libraries from exemption from Sales Tax be removed i.e. toy libraries pay sales tax.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) They believe that toy libraries are non-profit and educational, and that they are of particular benefit to families who because of financial, social and geographical constraints most need a toy library.</PARA>
<PARA> Your petitioners therefore humbly pray:</PARA>

<PARA> (iii) that this disruption has already cost the Australian meat industry hundreds of millions of dollars in lost productivity and has threatened vital trade contracts with overseas markets,</PARA>
<PARA> (iv) that primary producers have once again been adversely financially affected by these unionists, particularly pig producers and feed-lotters who cannot alter production schedules merely to suit union convenience, and</PARA>

<PARA> (c) questions the predictable Soviet assertion that there is no danger of radiation leakages from the nuclear reactor and nuclear weapons on board, just as all the nuclear weapon states have made doubtful assurances in the event of accidents involving their nuclear warships or underground nuclear weapon tests over the years;</PARA>
<PARA> (d) condemns the escalation of the nuclear arms race at sea which can only result in an increase of accidents involving nuclear-powered and nuclear-armed warships and submarines, ultimately involving further pollution of the oceans as a legacy for generations yet unborn; and</PARA>
<PARA> (e) calls on the Government to reject the recent assertion of the British Prime Minister (Mrs Thatcher) that nuclear weapons should be a permanent feature of our world order and to intensify Australia's commitment towards talks on regional security and naval arms control and disarmament so that these kinds of accidents can never happen again.</PARA>

<PARA> (i) that projected Commonwealth spending on capital works in Tasmania through to the end of the financial year 1990-91 is only $17.3 million,</PARA>

<PARA> (a) notes-</PARA>
<PARA> (i) with concern the warning by Australian banks that housing interest rates could be forced up from today's record of 16 per cent to as high as 17 per cent to 18 per cent later this year as a direct result of the Government's deliberate economic policies;</PARA>
<PARA> (ii) that this would represent a further increase in home loan interest payments from the $40 a week rise so far this financial year to up to $70 a week on the average Australian home mortgage of $80 000, since June 1988; and</PARA>
<PARA> (iii) that this huge rise in the Australian family's average home interest bill is almost 4 times as much as the Hawke-Keating promised tax cut of $18 a week and almost 3 times the promised wage rise of $25 a week over the next 2 years, revealing the Government's tax-wage deal as no more than a cynical gimmick which goes nowhere near resolving the dreadful problems the Hawke-Keating Government has created for Australian families; and</PARA>
<PARA> (b) calls on the Hawke-Keating Government to halt those cynical vote-buying policies that destroy the prospect of fixing up the economic mess it has created and instead to introduce the major economic reforms advocated by the Liberal-National Coalition under John Howard that are aimed at lowering Australia's foreign debt, correcting our balance-of-payments crisis and reducing the disastrous interest rates that are pricing Australians out of their homes.</PARA>

<PARA> (c) notes that Jessie's particular contribution was her lifelong commitment to improving the legal, economic and social status of women, and that she was also instrumental in the 1967 referendum which won the vote for Aboriginal people;</PARA>
<PARA> (d) notes that Jessie Street was invited by Prime Minister John Curtin to be the only female representative on the Australian delegation attending the inaugural meeting of the United Nations Organisation in San Francisco, and that she was instrumental in having inserted in the Charter a clause prohibiting discrimination on the basis of sex; and</PARA>
<PARA> (e) applauds the personal commitment, humour, energy, determination and strength of character which Jessie Street maintained throughout her life despite the contumely that was heaped upon her during the Cold War years when she was branded a `communist' for her advocacy of world peace.</PARA>

<PARA> That the Senate-</PARA>
<PARA> (a) considers that climate change and the protection of the atmosphere are the biggest problem and the biggest challenge faced by mankind in this or any other age;</PARA>
<PARA> (b) notes that the Government, while being congratulated on its promise of $7.8 million for greenhouse effect research, must recognise that the principal emphasis of its committee must be on strategies to reduce greenhouse effect gas emissions rather than to accept the inevitability of, and adaptation to, the consequences of these global atmospheric changes;</PARA>
<PARA> (c) notes that Australia is a significant per capita contributor to these changes;</PARA>
<PARA> (d) notes further that Australia could reduce its effective emissions of greenhouse effect gases by 30 per cent by the year 2000 and should do so,</PARA>
<PARA> (e) notes that, because only 50 per cent of greenhouse effect warming is caused by CO2 and because nuclear energy can only substitute that part of fossil fuel used for electricity production, nuclear energy cannot make a significant contribution to solving the greenhouse effect problem,</PARA>
<PARA> (f) notes that, because of the high capital cost of nuclear power stations, much greater contribution to greenhouse effect amelioration can be obtained from improved energy efficiency.</PARA>

<PARA> (a) notes with alarm the large number of senior public servants who have resigned from the Public Service over the past 18 months, which in the case of the Treasury has amounted to 40 resignations in 1987-88;</PARA>
<PARA> (b) expresses its concern that if such resignations continue in the future, they have the potential to seriously undermine the effectiveness and professionalism of the entire Public Service;</PARA>
<PARA> (c) notes that most of these resignations have occurred because:</PARA>
<PARA> (i) the remuneration system in the Public Service does not reward excellence and achievement and is relatively poor compared to the remuneration of senior executives in the private sector as pointed out by the Treasury in its Annual Report for 1987-88, and</PARA>
<PARA> (ii) the morale of the Public Service has slumped in recent years due to successive Government changes;</PARA>
<PARA> (d) further notes that the Government has been examining the appropriateness of the remuneration system in the Public Service and reviewing the Commonwealth Superannuation Scheme for over 12 months, yet no concrete action has been taken; and</PARA>
<PARA> (e) urges the Government to introduce a more responsive and incentive-driven remuneration system in the Public Service as contained in the Opposition's Public Administration Policy as a matter of urgency to stem the tide of Public Service resignations and restore morale.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I give notice that, on the next day of sitting, I shall move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That the Senate notes that-</PARA>
<PARA> (a) the strategy of negative gearing, supported by both the Labor Government and the Liberal/National Opposition, as a means of resolving the housing crisis has clearly resulted in a displacement of intending home-buyers with speculating investors;</PARA>
<PARA> (b) this is clearly demonstrated by the latest Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) figures which show that there has been a dramatic increase in investor activity since the reintroduction of negative gearing from 9.4 per cent of all finance provided for housing in the September quarter of 1987 to 20.7 per cent in the December quarter of 1988;</PARA>
<PARA> (c) in raw figures this is a total increase in investor finance from $121.2 million to $443.6 million, which breaks down to an increase in purchase finance for existing dwellings from $68.6 million to $302.6 million (an increase of 5 times), and an increase in construction finance from $52.6 million to only $141 million (an increase of only 3 times);</PARA>
<PARA> (d) these ABS figures show clearly that investors are using negative gearing to displace home-buyers, not to build new housing;</PARA>
<PARA> (e) the Victorian Department of Housing and Construction December Quarter Rental Report, shows that, in the 12 months from December 1987, rentals increased by almost twice the inflation rate; and</PARA>
<PARA> (f) given Opposition support for this negative gearing rip-off of home buyers, the bluster of Victorian Opposition Leader (Mr Kennett) on the housing crisis in the Greensborough by-election campaign takes on an air of hypocrisy.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is addressed to the Minister representing the Prime Minister. I preface my question by reminding the Minister that during the past 12 months the cost of business finance, in the form of bank bill rates and bank housing loan rates has risen by 6 1/2 per cent and 2 1/2 per cent, respectively, and that the Government has induced these interest rate rises in an attempt to deal with the serious economic and particularly, balance of payments situations which its policies have created. I ask the Minister: Is it a fact that, with the economy still overstretched and the balance of payments crisis continuing, the provision of tax cuts not matched by reductions in government spending, plus significant wage increases, will almost certainly mean a further rise in interest rates, for both businesses and householders?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In so far as the contents of the April statement to be made on 12 April are concerned, Senator Stone should await that statement before he draws any conclusions about the quantum of tax cuts or wages, which will be dealt with in that statement. It is very dangerous to make projections on the basis of what we at this stage do not know.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I agree with Senator Stone's comment on the basis of the national accounts figures published last week that the economy still appears to be growing strongly, although it is very difficult to say on the basis of those figures what has happened since the period to which those figures apply. I suspect that there are conflicting signals about that. But there is no doubt that the Government is committed to tax cuts, which will be announced this week, and the nature of a trade-off, so-called, with the unions regarding wages will be announced at the same time.</PARA>

Secondly, do I understand him to be saying that, although he concedes that the economy is still considerably overstretched, the provision of those tax cuts and wage increases will not lead to a further round of interest rate increases of the kinds that have been occurring for the past 12 months?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is addressed to the Leader of the Government in the Senate as Minister representing the Prime Minister on the status of women. The introduction of the higher education contribution scheme has been opposed by some because they argue that it might be a reason for women not entering or continuing higher education. Can the Minister inform the Senate whether the higher education contribution scheme has resulted in a reduction in the number of female enrolments in higher education?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4F4">Senator BUTTON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The information which Senator Crowley requests is freely available to the public, but some people do not seem to have obtained it. Therefore, I welcome the question in order that Opposition senators, for example, who fall into that category will be able to be better informed. Early estimates obtained from all universities and colleges on student numbers in 1989 show that enrolments by women students in higher education are at record levels. Women constitute 232,000 or 51.5 per cent of higher education enrolments, an increase of almost 17,000 on 1988. Overall higher education enrolments, male and female, have increased by in excess of 30,000-a 7 per cent increase on the 1988 figures-bringing the total student population to 451,500. These figures represent, the highest level of enrolments by women in the history of this country. It is fair to say that they refute criticisms that the higher education contribution scheme would deter women's participation in post-secondary education. Research released last week by the Australian National University predicts that the higher education contribution scheme will have no overall impact on enrolments and in fact that female participation in higher education will continue to grow more highly than that of males.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Government specifically addressed the needs of women in formulating that scheme. The higher education contribution scheme is related to personal rather than family income levels, giving women the opportunity to make free choices about their own educational future. As the Government announced, the scheme contributions will be used to create additional higher education places, many of which on the basis of current trends will be filled by women. At the end of the current triennium this Government, since coming to power, will have created an extra 110,000 higher education places, lifting women's participation from 46 per cent in 1983 to today's record level of 51.5 per cent. In respect of some of the criticism which has come from Opposition sources, I might say that the Opposition cannot get its higher education policy to add up. It has a $300m hole in it which would have to be filled by reduced institutional budgets or by reducing the up front fee to at least $2,000.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Does the Minister for Resources know of the international energy analyst, PetroConsultants, and does he agree that it is one of the most authoritative international energy analysts? Is it a fact that PetroConsultants has described the Government's energy policy as seriously flawed, and says that there is an urgent need for policy changes `to avoid excessive and irreversible crude import dependency'? Does the Minister agree that this assessment directly condemns the Government's policy, which does not give priority to encouraging Australian oil search, on the basis that oil can be bought on the world market and the cost of purchase is offset by increased trade in other commodities? Will the Minister review the policy which, if not changed, will condemn Australia to a high and potentially unaffordable dependence on imported crude oil before the end of this century?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="1242" SPEAKER="Cook Sen The Hon P.F.S." NAMEID="RF4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="WA" MINISTERIAL="RESOURCES" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RF4">Senator COOK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the first question is yes; the answer to the second question is yes. The third question is not as simple as Senator Chaney proposes in his comments. The consultants he referred to are a respected authority but the latest figures show that Australia's current dependence on domestically generated crude oil is about 85 per cent. According to the figures, by the end of the century we will move to about a 35 per cent dependency. The argument as to whether our regime of taxing is a sufficient incentive to oil producers and for exploration purposes is a matter of some contention between the Government and some of those associations representing oil companies, as well as individual oil companies. Our view is strongly that the regime is comparable to that in countries of a like nature and indeed is a regime that is competitive on the world scale. It should provide an incentive for oil exploration and production.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Two other matters of significance have to be considered along with the policies of the Government. The first is the price of oil, which as we all know was heading to $10 a barrel just a few months ago. Falling prices are a major disincentive for companies conducting oil research. Fortunately the price is now in the $20 range for top benchmark crude, west Texas intermediate, and is expected to remain in that range for a while. Maybe it will soften in the middle of the year when the northern summer breaks, but oil prices are expected in the medium term to be at about the level they are at now. That will be a comprehensive increase on the lower prices being experienced when companies were framing their exploration agendas last year and should ensure that there is an increase in exploration. The second major factor is Australia's prospectivity and how it compares with other areas. This relates to the likelihood of finding oil. We think the prospectivity for Australia is good. I announced last Monday the release of acreage for bidding-those biddings are to close in August this year-which will open up areas for further exploration on the continental margins of Australia. All of that has to be seen as consistent with the picture presented by the consultants. I should also say that traditionally consultants operate for the industry and not for the Government, and a commonality of view between what they say and what the industry espouses is not surprising.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I ask a supplementary question. I thank the Minister for his answer but I ask: Is it a fact that the Government's policy, taking into account the considerable additional cost of oil imports which is likely, given the Minister's own figures in the answer he has just given, is based on the assumption that that cost can be offset by other energy exports? Does the Minister, having considered the views put forward by Petro Consultants, have any concern about the fundamental validity of that assumption?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RF4">Senator COOK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We are always concerned about and examining whether judgments we make are, in the light of experience, sound and proper judgments. I think the basic validity of the assumption, as a general assumption, is proper and well based. It is not something from which we would wish to divert; it is certainly not anything with which we would quibble. We take the view that it is not sensible to divert economic resources to one particular form of energy, in this case oil, and thus ignore the contribution that other sources of energy make to the general economy-that is, to set up a dysfunction, if you like, in terms of particular supports.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We know that maybe shortly after July this year we will commence shipments of liquefied natural gas off the North West Shelf and that will contribute greatly to our balance of payments. We are a major coal exporter. Indeed, in energy terms, we are a net exporter of energy because of our coal production, and that contributes into the future of our energy trade balance. So, because we are down in one area of the balance but up in others does not mean that we should divert resources from what we do better to areas where we are suffering a reduction. Overall, we will come out of it pretty much in balance or a bit ahead of balance.</PARA>

</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="1243" SPEAKER="Evans Sen The Hon G.J." NAMEID="VD4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="VIC" MINISTERIAL="FOREIGN AFFAIRS AND TRADE" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator GARETH EVANS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have always operated from the premise that it is important for Australia's foreign policy to be conducted on as bipartisan a basis as possible. I have actively scoured the Opposition's foreign policy, as released last Friday, for indications of a similar perspective being shared. I am certainly prepared to acknowledge that there are a number of areas of the Opposition's policy with which we would have no basic disagreement and which could certainly form the basis of a fully bipartisan policy approach. Let me instance in that respect the priority it gives to our relations with countries of the South West Pacific and the Western Pacific rim and, indeed, the specific language of the Opposition's policy on New Caledonia which, despite the editorial in this morning's Australian, is not language with which we have any disagreement at all. Nor do we disagree about, in broad terms, the direction and focus of our aid program, support for the ANZUS alliance, support for an active Australian role in international efforts to achieve arms control and disarmament, recognition of the role and significance of the Commonwealth of Nations, acknowledgment of the increasing importance of international environmental issues and, indeed, the Opposition's general approach to the Middle East.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> However, I do have to say that in many respects adoption by the Government of the Opposition policy would either cause major problems for the country or would involve us in neglecting what are manifestly major national interests. First of all, there are some really conspicuous omissions. There is no mention, for example, of the Republic of Korea, notwithstanding its huge and growing economic importance to us. There is no reference at all to the development of relations with Vietnam and Laos. Again, there are some distortions of focus which are so great as to, in effect, amount to omissions. For example, the proposal for a Pacific Basin community refers only to strengthening our ties with the market economies of the region, ignoring the vast importance already to Australia, obviously, of the People's Republic of China, quite apart from the potential importance of Indo-Chinese countries like Vietnam.</PARA>
<PARA> Again, the treatment of our relations with the United States of America, which is alleged to be in many ways the centrepiece of the Opposition's foreign policy, is quite one dimensional in the sense that it deals only with the defence alliance relationship, ignoring the wide ranging trade, economic and other political dimensions of that relationship. Again, the treatment of East-West relations as a whole deals only with arms control, ignoring the other crucial issues which have long been on the superpowers' negotiating agenda, including regional conflicts, human rights and bilateral economic and political relations. Again, and very crucially, I think there is the complete absence of any treatment of trade policy, even at its interface with foreign policy. There is a complete failure to acknowledge the significance of the integration of the former Foreign Affairs and Trade departments, an integration which we certainly would not wish to reverse. It is surprising that the Opposition policy does not seem to acknowledge the significance of that.</PARA>
<PARA> Moving from sins of omission to those of commission, there are a number of specifics in the policy which are simply impossible to accept. They make no sense at all from an Australian national interest perspective, and they are simply misconceived or just plain wrong. For a start, the proposals to renegotiate the South Pacific Nuclear Free Zone Treaty are wholly unrealistic as well as being wholly undesirable. They are at odds with the strong and growing support for that treaty in the region and they are at odds with the acknowledgment by the United States of America that it is not inconsistent with United States practices and activities in the region.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;And to pick up that point, it is at odds with the declared willingness of the United States, as indicated to me directly by Secretary of State Baker a few weeks ago, to review its decision so far not to sign the protocols to the treaty. Then again, the proposal specifically to allow the stationing of nuclear weapons on Australian soil-I repeat, to specifically allow the stationing of nuclear weapons on Australian territory-is quite extraordinary. It is obviously completely at odds with the views of the overwhelming majority of Australians in this respect, and it is unequivocally opposed by us in any foreseeable circumstances.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Again, the enthusiasm of the Opposition policy, recommended to us and to the nation, for the strategic defence initiative program and its deterrent utility is at odds with the review of that which is now being conducted in the United States. That is a program which the Australian Government simply cannot support in its present form.</PARA>
<PARA> On chemical weapons, the advocacy of the enlargement of the 1925 Geneva protocol completely misses the point that all international attention is currently focused, as it should be, not upon the Geneva protocol but on implementing a universal new chemical weapons convention to outlaw these weapons entirely and to destroy existing stockpiles.

The question was within Standing Orders, I concede, and that is why I did not take a point of order on the question.

I simply ask you to draw the Minister's attention to the amount of time that he has consumed with his answer in order to enable a reasonable number of questions to be asked at Question Time. I think the Minister would agree that there is unlimited scope for a Minister to speak for an hour on the subject, if he wishes, and I am sure that this Minister could speak for two hours if we gave him an extension of time.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This question probably falls under a number of my responsibilities. It is a recreation, which is covered under the Department of Sport. The question also refers to the World Heritage Properties Conservation Act, so I probably get a role in a few ways. I am aware of the reports; I have seen them. The main part of the question asked whether I agree that the playing of two-up on Anzac Day is part of Australia's national heritage. I think I can say unquestionably yes. I suspect this is the only time that I could proclaim my belief in Australia's heritage and have the support of the National Party of Australia. It would be difficult to imagine even Senator Boswell opposing such a proposition.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In reference to the World Heritage Properties Conservation Act, the difficulty I have with that is that it would require the acquisition of actual property. As far as I am aware, the place where these games are often played is usually in the toilets of these clubs. It would be very difficult for the Commonwealth to propose to start to acquire any of them. However, there is one way we could go about this. There is a cultural list for World Heritage. It would be possible to look generally at the clubs of the New South Wales central coast, because they are obviously havens for culture in our society. Those culture vultures who attend them on Anzac Day are entitled to culture. Having said that, I disagree with one part of Senator McLean's question. He said that a substantial part of the proceeds of these games go to charity. I can recall my father coming home a couple of times after Anzac Day with his pockets fairly stuffed full of money. I doubt very much if much of those proceeds made it to charity, beyond that of his bookmaker. I suspect that might have been the case in a number of games. Nonetheless, one does have to fight one's way past poker machines to get to the games. It does strike me as ludicrous.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am very pleased to be able to report to the Senate that after exhaustive negotiations in Geneva over the weekend, the log jam in the GATT trade negotiations that developed in Montreal last December has now been resolved. From Australia's point of view that is a result of massive significance. It means that constructive negotiation of fair world trade rules will continue, which is essential for a trading nation of Australia's size. It goes against the views of some pessimists that saw the international trading system as breaking down and forming into bilateral trade deals between the majors.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I think one ought to pay tribute at the outset to the work of the Australian Ministers and officials who have worked tirelessly to produce an outstandingly successful result of Australia, particularly my colleague Michael Duffy, the Minister for Trade Negotiations, who has acted as chairman throughout this exercise of the 14-country coalition, the Cairns Group, to which Senator McMullan refers, and also his predecessor, Mr John Dawkins, as Minister for Trade who actually established the Cairns Group.</PARA>
<PARA> On the topic of agriculture, which has been, as everyone knows, the centrepiece of the log jam and which in many ways is the crucial element in the whole current round, what has happened is that the GATT talks have in essence accepted all the major elements of the original Cairns Group proposal. Those elements are, firstly, a commitment to long term reform in agricultural trade rules, opening up world markets and reducing unfair production and export subsidies as exist in the European Economic Community and the United States. That process of long term reform will be started in 1991, which is the year following the conclusion of the GATT talks. Secondly, until that reform package starts, there will be an immediate freeze or cap on existing hand-outs to farmers, including those in the United States and the European Economic Community. Access to markets, including Japan, is to be maintained at least at current levels. Finally, we have even secured a commitment that countries will reduce the support and protection levels in agriculture in 1990; that is to say, prior to the implementation of the long term reform process.</PARA>
<PARA> The significance of all this can hardly be underestimated for Australia. Ultimately, Australian farmers and, indeed, the community will be billions of dollars better off because, as one of the world's most efficient agricultural producers, we can be assured that in a fairer and more open market for agricultural products our farmers without any doubt will be able to secure continually improved export sales. Further, the development of fairer and more predictable rules in agricultural trade will help reduce the boom-bust cycle in that trade which has previously been exacerbated by the pricing and production policies of the major countries. The fact that the Cairns Group has worked together so well over the difficult period since Montreal has established once and for all, if anybody were in any doubt, that that group is here to stay. It will continue to be a central force in the agricultural negotiations, through which we now have to convert the principles agreed at Geneva into practical application.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories. Is it a fact that the Premier of Tasmania, Hon. Robin Gray, asked the Federal Government on 13 February to cooperate with his Government to establish joint guidelines in relation to the proposed establishment of a pulp mill at Wesley Vale in Tasmania? Does the Minister now admit that his response to that request in refusing to cooperate with the Tasmanian Government was a contributing factor in the ultimate failure of the project because, in the absence of this information, the Tasmanian Government was unable to set requirements to meet Federal demands?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I cannot recall 13 February being an operative date in these discussions. I will have to check that. As far as I can recall, the Premier of Tasmania insisted through the months of negotiations that the Tasmanian Government was the appropriate body to handle environmental guidelines. The difficulty faced by the Government in looking at those guidelines, and in evaluating my response, of course, as Senator Walters put it, was that the Tasmanian Government showed at the end of the day that it had no political will and no environmental sense. It set down a series of guidelines. I think they would have been fairly close to the mark.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4E4">Senator RICHARDSON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will get on to that in just a second. I am very glad that Senator Archer has referred to Noranda and to telling the truth. I am delighted, Senator Archer, and I will refer to that. If we look at the contribution made by Tasmania we will see that first of all it sets down a series of guidelines which were in some respects tough and in other respects not as tough as I would have liked them. Nonetheless, it was a reasonable place at which to begin. The difficulty for the Tasmanian Government was that, as soon as it was confronted by a big, arrogant and powerful multinational which said that it did not like that and would not wear it, it backed off. Premier Gray said for months that these guidelines would not be changed and repeated that the day before he changed them. But what happened was that he backed off. He did not back off in little way; he backed right off. The guidelines were torn up and they started to process them again.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As the Treasurer, Paul Keating, said when we met with the company only a few months ago, `Look, you saw the Tasmanian Government coming four miles off through a pea soup fog. You knew you could run over them, but you can't run over us'. That is exactly what happened. All we did was inform the company of what was a pretty obvious fact, and that was that the claim that the technology which was to be used in this mill was in some way the best in the world was nonsense. In the first meeting we had with the Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce, Senator Button, and Paul Keating, we were able to get the company to admit that it could go further than the Tasmanian guidelines. That took no time at all.</PARA>
<PARA> I also want to point out that when one refers to Noranda-and Senator Archer's claim about lies, Mr President-it is not the case that the Commonwealth Government got involved in this at the last minute. On 11 July last year the Commonwealth met with the company and told it what we expected. On 7 December last year the Commonwealth and the Tasmanian Government, in partnership, sent a joint letter to Noranda and North Broken Hill Peko Ltd. In that letter we listed 85 points where the environmental impact statement (EIS) was either inadequate or where points had not been addressed at all. What did Noranda choose to do about that? It chose to ignore it. Noranda was always accustomed to getting its own way. What happened here was that it met a government determined to see that, if the mill were to proceed, it would proceed only under environmental guidelines that protected Bass Strait. That was always the Commonwealth's basic position, and it remains so.</PARA>
<PARA> So far as the future is concerned, this afternoon at 4 o'clock Senator Button, the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Kerin) and I are having a meeting to look at the process by which the Commonwealth can resolve the difficulties over pulp mills because we have a number of proposals coming up in the next few years. We will deal with that this afternoon.</PARA>
<PARA> As to what we said to the company about what the guidelines should be, let me give a couple of examples. We told the company straight away that the idea that it could only go up to 40 per cent chlorine substitution was nonsense. We proved to them straight away that in Sweden hardwood mills exist with 90 per cent chlorine substitution. That, of course, is the crucial element in producing the organochlorins that were to be dumped in Bass Strait. It was not hard to show where these guidelines were rotten. They were rotten right through. I am proud of the fact that the Government knocked them back and any company that thinks it can ignore the Government in the future I hope will have learned a proper lesson.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would have thought that the answer was there, but, to repeat what the Prime Minister said a couple of days ago, it would be ridiculous to expect to give total guidelines for every mill. It would be pretty obvious, even to a moron, that when we examine pulp mill proposals the different product that goes in affects the effluent that comes out. The method of disposal will also vary from site to site. It is possible therefore to draw up guidelines, in the broad. It is not possible to make guidelines for every mill under every circumstance straight away. We would not attempt to do that. We will, however, address the process, and that is why I will meet with the other relevant Ministers this afternoon. We wish to attract industry.

In view of the catastrophic effects of the Alaskan oil spill disaster-and I particularly draw the Minister's attention to an article by Mary Anne Gwinn in Saturday's Canberra Times which describes the horrific effects on many of the native birds in the area-has the Government done anything to ensure that Australia's procedures to deal with such a disaster are the best possible? Can the Minister explain what kind of planning is in place to deal with oil spills in Australia?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 24 March an Exxon shipping company supertanker, the Exxon Valdez, ran aground while loading at the southern terminal of the trans-Alaskan pipeline. Up to 50 million litres or 300,000 barrels of oil is reported to have been spilled. Press articles have reported criticism for the initial response to efforts being made to clean up the spill. The Alaskan Department of Environmental Conservation has been reported as saying that `the initial response was inadequate and did not match the planned outline response measures to be taken in a spill'. I understand that aerial chemical spraying has failed to disperse the oil slick. They are waiting for calmer weather conditions to prevail. I am aware of the article in the Canberra Times and other reports referred to by Senator Devereux relating to damage to the marine environment and to sea life in general. It is not a simple matter of oil in the water; it is also a major environmental hazard.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We have two national plans to combat any event of this nature in Australia. We have the national plan to combat pollution of sea by oil, which is a plan held by and operated by the Department of Transport and Communications. It has a cooperative Federal-State component. It is a contingency plan for where there might be major oil spills off the Australian coast. Under the national plan, State and Commonwealth committees work to a series of administrative guidelines that are worked out in advance in territorial waters. At various points around the Australian coast they stockpile dispersants and equipment so that, in the event of a spill, they are near at hand and can be accessed readily. The committees have a strategy, first, to contain and, secondly, to coordinate and clean up, and provide technical and logistical support where necessary. The second plan is the marine oil spill action plan, which is an industry based plan. It initiates action for any spillage, not just major spillages. It, of course, interacts with the Federal plan.</PARA>
<PARA> There is a third consideration in all of this in that, where oil exploration and drilling and production are going on on the continental shelf, proposals for authorisation to drill or to produce are put to me under the Commonwealth Petroleum (Submerged Lands) Act. All such proposals have to be accompanied by environmental assessments of the work that is being done and guarantee of non-major disturbance. Those plans are approved as site specific plans in the particular location where the drilling or the production might be going to occur.</PARA>
<PARA> In view of this massive disaster-I think everyone would agree that that is a correct description of it-an interdepartmental committee for combating oil spills has been inaugurated. It is chaired by the Department of Transport and Communications. It will be reviewing the events that caused the Alaskan spill to get out of hand. Any lessons for us from that will be applied off the Australian coast. That is consistent with the strategy that this Government has adopted where major events of this nature occur. Honourable senators will remember that last year, after the Piper Alpha explosion in the North Sea, I reported to the Senate that we had set up a committee to review the proceedings of evidence as adduced before the inquiry into the Piper Alpha disaster. The industry, along with the States, has participated on that committee. Indeed, industry has foreshadowed some changes to its procedures because of that. That is a very heartening sign. It is consistent with what we are doing here to prevent the replication of a devastation such as the Alaskan one occurring in Australia.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RF4">Senator COOK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There is a series of questions; let me try to pick my way through all of them and answer them, if I can. The first is a question of semantics-what is the difference between `quarantine' and `stockpile'. I think the word `stockpile' comes from a statement made by the head forester in the Eden area in a television or radio interview he gave and of which transcripts have been furnished to my office. That statement has been relied upon for a number of comments made publicly, subsequently, by environ- mental spokespersons. I have insisted that the right description of what has happened is quarantining. I take it that one stockpiles in the interests of some time in the future using the thing stockpiled, but quarantine suggests-I draw this inference from my administration of the Quarantine Act-that one may hold the thing for inspection but may not admit it, or one may according to whether or not it is later found to be acceptable. I do not believe there is any mystery about that because in previous answers I have said the material is being held and it may or may not be used, and in fact I have even said it may never be used.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Section 6c is a section that I have inserted in the woodchip licence conditions. I inserted it for the first time for this specific interim set of conditions when I issued the woodchip export licence on 29 December last year. It did not appear before. It appears specifically because I want to have the power-not that I do not have it, but I want that power to be explicit-to control the use of material from areas on the interim list of the World Heritage Commission which I have statutory obligations to do something about. The purpose of section 6c is not to deny ever cutting in a World Heritage area or an interim listed area; it is to provide that if we decide to cut in those areas we must have regard to the sensitivities of the region because it is one found by the World Heritage Commission to have outstanding values. Cutting would be carried out only in certain circumstances and then with specific regard to the protection of those values.</PARA>
<PARA> The honourable senator further asked: why did Harris-Daishowa extract-and the word `extract' is pregnant in this context because it has been contorted to mean other things-the particular wood? To the best of my knowledge, Harris-Daishowa did not extract in the classic sense in which that term may be used. The cut was authorised by the New South Wales Forestry Commission. The Minister responsible for that Commission is the Minister for Natural Resources in New South Wales, Ian Causley. This is not a matter over which I have any jurisdiction or control. If it involves export, I would have; if it does not involve export, I do not have. It is something I would prefer did not happen, but he has the constitutional authority. He tells me that this action was taken so as to maintain the supply of sawlogs to Bombala sawmill; otherwise people would be put out of work in that area.</PARA>
<PARA> As far as the honourable senator's other questions are concerned, it so happens that I have a supplementary answer to make to the question that was asked by her last week. If the honourable senator checks, she will find that the `pinks', the Daily Hansard and the Weekly Hansard, are all the same; they are all in accord on this. I said something to the effect-and I am relying on memory now-that I could not confirm or I was not sure of the exact circumstances but it may be or I think it is this, and then I proceeded to answer. My supplementary answer, which I will put down in about seven minutes time, the Senate willing, is that I can answer the specific questions to which the honourable senator referred.

Firstly, can the Minister inform the Senate whether or not the Government intends to develop minimum national guidelines? Secondly, if not, does the Government intend to proceed with specific guidelines for each pulp mill project?

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4E4">Senator RICHARDSON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am aware of the Prime Minister's statement on strict national guidelines. The honourable senator asked whether the Government would develop minimum guidelines. That is what Senator Button, Mr Kerin and I will be discussing at 4 o'clock this afternoon, and presumably we can report to the Senate on the progress of our discussions when they are completed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The honourable senator also asked whether an approach which suggests that we have individual guidelines for each mill lead to accusations of bias or discrimination. I would suggest that no matter what we did Senator Watson would allege that. So I am hardly too worried about what he might think. In terms of attracting industry, obviously industry needs to know what basic government requirements are. There is no possibility, under any regime that presents itself as fair or equitable, for an environmental impact statement process for individual projects to be done away with. It seems to me that the procedures Senator Watson and other proponents are now advocating have implicit in them the waiving in some way of environmental impact statements. I give one example that even Senator Watson would understand. The Commonwealth was not unnaturally concerned about the dumping of 13 tonnes of organochlorins into Bass Strait. But I think that concern was magnified greatly by the fact that the point at which those organochlorins were to be dumped was in a part of Bass Strait where the water had a very low dispersal quality because there was little tidal movement.</PARA>
<PARA> It may well have been that if that point of effluent were to go somewhere else, where tidal movement was much greater, the Commonwealth would have considered the proposal. That is the sort of problem that one gets into as one looks at individual sites. The method of the disposal of the effluent will always be the real crux of the matter and it will be difficult to ever set strict national guidelines for sites which will vary dramatically all around the country. That is the difficulty.</PARA>
<PARA> Having said that, I think there needs to be a clear process and some broad guidelines for companies, and that is what we will set about doing. In terms of a revised project at Wesley Vale without Noranda, at this stage-I had my office ring around a number of others on Friday-I am not aware of North Broken Hill Peko Ltd proceeding with a proposal, beyond saying that it might look at one. In so far as interest from Harris-Daishowa (Australia) Pty Ltd is concerned, I understand it has said it might have an interest in one. Again, it is so far fairly vague.</PARA>
<PARA> If there is to be a pulp mill in northern Tasmania, obviously we will be talking to whoever decides to bat on with the proposal. As yet, I am not aware of any Minister who has been approached with a definite proposal. When we have been, we will certainly talk to the proponent.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to you, Mr President, and follows a point of order raised by me last week, namely, that Senator Walsh should have been asked to withdraw the use of the term `ratbag', and your decision not to seek a withdrawal on the basis, and I quote from Hansard, that `A fair amount of give and take occurs at Question Time'. Given that senators taking pride in the higher standard of language used in this chamber than in the other place would want to use standing order 418 to maintain that standard, and at the same time would not want unnecessarily to disrupt the chamber with fruitless or vexatious points of order, can you outline for the guidance of senators so wishing to protect the standard in this chamber, without raising vexatious points of order, what guidelines you use in deciding how to rule on a point of order under standing order 418? I ask you to answer in the light of the knowledge that, while the dictionary definition of `ratbag' is `despicable person' and senators must now apparently put up with being called ratbags at Question Time, under your own rulings at Question Time senators may successfully take a point of order if any of the following terminology is used: a wet prawn; an idiot; a mickey mouse person; an old bag; an ideological bigot; an apologist for South Africa; a contemptible person; a drunk; humbugs and hypocrites; mindless maniacs; grovelling sycophants; and/or scurrilous? What aspect of the terminology `a ratbag' or `despicable person' makes it any less offensive than any of the above?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr President, I raise a point of order. Is it in order for Senator Vanstone to draw attention to an expressed distaste for the language used in this place when, on 30 May 1988, she herself used the expression `stuff-up' in referring to referendum proposals, and when indeed the Leader of the Opposition in this place, Senator Chaney, referred on 29 April last year to `a disgraceful bloody afternoon'? I quote in both cases from the relevant pages of Hansard. In the absence of a point of order being taken by the Opposition in this respect, is it appropriate for the honourable senator to have concerns of this kind now?</PARA></TALK.START>

I would have been very sorry if he had brought that up again. There is no point of order. Senator Vanstone has asked you a perfectly reasonable question about the rules that you, Mr President, would apply in determining these matters.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Vanstone is correct that under standing order 418 the term `ratbag' is unparliamentary. I consider it to be offensive whether it is used individually or collectively. With relation to the circumstances of the interjection, at the time I thought the Minister was being provoked by interjections on my left, some of which were also unparliamentary. In order to avoid a dispute and to keep Question Time running so as to allow a reasonable number of questions, I did not rule that `ratbag' was unparliamentary. I declined to ask the Minister to withdraw in those circumstances. That is the reason for the ruling. I did not receive notice of this question. If there is anything else in Senator Vanstone's question that I have missed, I will look at it and give an answer to the Senate tomorrow.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In Question Time last week Senator Tambling asked me a question about a certain incident at Darwin Airport. I have a reply in relation to his question about flight MZ841. The level of airport security for each departing flight is, in the normal course of events, a matter for the operational judgment of security and airport officials. In the case of flight MZ841 from Darwin on 5 April it was judged appropriate for additional guards to be placed on the aircraft and for stringent searches to be implemented. In a small airport like Darwin these precautions can cause congestions and delays and they are visible to the public. There was a brief scuffle between two people at the airport over a private matter. It was quickly settled and the police took no further action. I am informed that a peaceful demonstration arranged with the Northern Territory Police took place at the airport on the morning of 5 April but it was of no security concern.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As to the senator's question about the visit of the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) to Darwin last week, I normally would not comment on security threat assessments but I will say that there was no dangerous security risk to the Prime Minister assessed during that visit.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 5 April Senator Dunn asked me a question without notice about current forestry operations in the south-east forests of New South Wales. In particular, Senator Dunn mentioned specific activities in compartment 1323 in the Coolangubra State Forest and on Apogee Road in the Tantawangalo State Forest. I did not have specific details of logging activities in those two areas at the time. I have now been advised by my Department, on the advice of the Forestry Commission of New South Wales, that there has been road construction activity near compartment 1323 in the Coolangubra National Estate interim listed area which has resulted in pulp wood being salvaged and transported to the Eden chip mill, where it is quarantined.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I am also advised that road construction activity is being carried out on Apogee Road but for reasons associated with creek crossings, rocky terrain and negotiations regarding private property in the vicinity, residues have not been salvaged yet. The contractor has been logging compartment 2453 since 15 March. I am advised that it will salvage all residues, including those from the road construction.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the Senate and I certainly will not abuse the privilege that the Senate has given me. We all know that as part of the process of moving towards an election we get such statements. One point that the Minister did make that went well beyond a debating point was his statement that our policy permits the stationing of nuclear weapons in Australia. The position is that under the South Pacific Nuclear Free Zone Treaty there is at the very least an ambiguity. That ambiguity is in relation to the stock stationing of nuclear weapons. Not only have we argued but also other commentators have argued that under the Treaty at the moment, in the event of a crisis, our principal ally, the United States, which is of course a nuclear force, would not be able to deploy from Australia or Australian waters. In our view, that ambiguity should not exist. That is our policy.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Under the ANZUS Treaty, we specifically have the right to expect the United States to come to our assistance in certain circumstances. The policy of the United States is not to disclose whether its forces are nuclear armed or not; it is a nuclear force. We say that it would be a major breach of Australia's defence capabilities if our ally were not to be able to come to our assistance because of an ambiguity that exists in a treaty, an ambiguity that should be renegotiated and clarified. It is fairly clear that the United States has a similar attitude in that it has not been prepared to ratify the Treaty in its current form. </PARA>

<PARA>Senator Lewis mentioned industry policy. If he had made his speech two years ago, half of the people on his side of the chamber would have said that we ought to do something about tariffs in Australia, and the other half, represented by Senator Watson and others, would have said that we should not do anything about tariffs. </PARA>
<PARA>This is a quite inaccurate statement. I take great exception to the Minister imputing particular stances on policy to me when he has absolutely no right or knowledge to make such an imputation. I have always been a strong supporter for downstream processing and manufacturing industry, including adequate support for creating the correct environment for manufacturing. Unfortunately, the Minister has misrepresented my position on industry protection by blinkered vision in terms of tariffs. As everybody knows, the issues are much wider than that. I want to place on the record of the Senate that I completely concur with the industry policy of the coalition parties, which is to phase down rates of protection in a gradual manner according to a pre-announced timetable. </PARA>

<PARA> That, in the opinion of the Senate, the following is a matter of urgency:</PARA>
<PARA>The need for immediate action by the Government to introduce reforms which will ensure that the Australian waterfront becomes efficient and productive instead of being a national burden and impediment to internationally competitive economic activities. </PARA>
<PARA>We on this side of the chamber believe very much in meritocracy but on this occasion I have to be grateful for the numbers. It is indeed a privilege to speak to an urgency motion in these terms because honourable senators, and indeed, the Australian community, will be aware that we are now almost two-thirds of the way through a so-called historic third term of the Hawke Government. This was to be the term that put the finishing touches on productivity and efficiency in the workplace: in other words, the era of micro-economic reform. Never mind that the Government has had six years for the Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce, Senator Button, and his colleagues to address the issues, whatever that means. I would have thought it would be `return to sender' by now. Quite clearly, even at the time the current Inter-State Commission report was commissioned there would have been ample opportunity for the Government to have addressed the issues. Indeed, it did what it always does: it employed that time-honoured political strategy of keeping the ball in the air. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has now had a further two years in which to have these matters exhaustively considered, and we now are faced with the crunch. This is the acid test. Never mind that inordinate cost burdens have been imposed on employers, manufacturers and producers by giant sheltered workshops in telecommunications, rail and shipping. Never mind that the Government realises the absolute impossibility of conditions on the waterfront, where all the major parties are aware of the need for change. In fact, let me remind the Senate of what the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) had to say in October of last year, as reported in the Australian of 14 November:</PARA>
<PARA>I can think of no reasonable argument why employers and unions in our manufacturing and export sectors must adjust to international trading companies while stevedoring and shipping remain shielded . . . We are determined not to shirk the challenges. </PARA>
<PARA>At the same time the Treasurer (Mr Keating) said, `It is important that Australia not be prevented from further processing of raw materials by the high cost of coastal shipping'. </PARA>
<PARA> That was the rhetoric, but of course the reality was that when it came to the crunch and the Cabinet had to consider the issue it baulked at the first hurdle. We had the disgraceful spectacle of people such as the Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs (Senator Robert Ray) wandering into this chamber and announcing in very strong terms that there would be no change to the employment conditions as a result of that report, that there would be no competition in terms of employment for coastal shipping. Indeed, Senator Ray was pursuing the matter in the way that he always approaches these things. In other words, if there is an opportunity to be honest and reasonable at no political cost, then he is quite prepared to be in it, but when it comes to something critical like a third runway that might impact on the Government's re- election chances, every time he goes for the politically expedient. As a result, we have had no response to the Industries Assistance Commission report. </PARA>
<PARA> What have we had now in relation to the Inter-State Commission report? I do not think anyone could disagree with the diagnosis that is made in that report. It is quite clear that for many years the Waterside Workers Federation, perhaps one of the most intractable and selfish unions in this country, has regarded itself as beyond the law. Certainly it has taken advantage of every opportunity to abuse its monopoly power. In every respect it has put its self-interest ahead of the national interest. As a result we have had all those matters so eloquently identified in the rorts task force, described by Senator Parer as 64 ways to sink an industry. Indeed, that is absolutely right. This industry is sinking fast. We have people working, if that is what it can be called, for many fewer hours than is the average in this country, earning much more money than their skills warrant. We have a problem compounded by ineffective management, we have inordinately high levels of industrial disputation, and we have an industry that is cocooned from the real world. As a result, with no competition there is no incentive for efficiency, no productivity resulting, and, accordingly, we have an industry that is a national disgrace. </PARA>
<PARA> The Inter-State Commission, in my view, made the right diagnosis, and with one crucial-and I think ultimately flawed-exception came up with the right prognosis. But, and it is a very big but, as a result of that flaw, instead of a radical change of lifestyle for the patient the real recommendation is that it should undergo cosmetic surgery. All of us have known for many years that the waterfront has been the sick man of Australian industry. It has been protected in all sorts of outrageous ways. There are solutions that do involve biting the bullet, but essentially they involve injecting some manner of competition into the industry. </PARA>
<PARA> Perhaps the most critical question that the Inter-State Commission had to address was whether it would do away with the manner of employment-those time honoured arrangements that had resulted in pooling and levy systems that were quite inimical to the public interest, that resulted in people working almost when they felt like it, working perhaps for half the time for which they were paid. Indeed, the Inter-State Commission did come up with the right solution. It recommended a move to enterprise based employment. We regard that as critically important because that means that decisions will be made at a local level by employees, not by unions on their behalf. Accordingly, there will be much more incentive for a realistic and constructive relationship to be developed between employer and employee. We will see workers who are motivated, workers who have incentive, and workers who believe in producing a fair day's work for a fair day's pay. We simply do not have those things at the present time, as a result of a system that is driven by union domination, which is not ultimately in the interests of the work force. </PARA>
<PARA> Although the work force has been reduced from something like 26,000 to about 7,000 as a result of the permanent employment arrangements introduced some 10 or 12 years ago, there are still something of the order of 7,240 Waterside Workers Federation members. Some 53.51 per cent of those workers are over 50 and one-third are over 55. Less than one-tenth of the work force is under 35. In Sydney there have been no new recruits to the industry since 1974. There are many waterside workers who have forgotten what real work is all about. This report recommends that there be an immediate movement towards significant reductions in numbers of the order of 3,000 over three years but with a recruitment campaign that would involve taking on younger members, injecting new blood of the order of 1,000 over that period-what we regard as a sensible balance that will bring about at least some reduction in the disgraceful overmanning and featherbedding that has dominated the industry for so long. That is a critical recommendation. If we can find a way to enterprise based employment, then we will be well on the way to bolstering productivity levels from the disgracefully low point at the present time. </PARA>
<PARA> The critical flaw in this plan is the critical flaw that bedevils this Government's whole approach to real issues. It stalls for time. If we look at industries like telecommunications, which are absolutely exploding around the world, we find that most of the major industrialised countries are introducing competition; they are privatising their telecommunications and postal sectors. This country is locked firmly into the monopoly mould. We have given the rest of the world five years start already and this is yet another example of why the Government, I am sure, will baulk at the prospect of real change. This report recommends that there should be negotiations between all of the parties before any real movement towards enterprise based employment occurs. What that means is that the Waterside Workers Federation will have a veto over reform in this critical area. As long as that is the case, the national interest can never prevail. I regard that as a very sad state of affairs because in many ways the report does come up with some very enlightened recommendations. Certainly if adopted in full it would result in something like a 27 per cent improvement in the levels of overmanning. If productivity arrangements were introduced, there would be perhaps a 40 per cent increase. </PARA>
<PARA> There is a long way to go, but I think the report provides a prescription which most Australians could agree with. The recommendation for the employment of casual labour at peak periods is similarly a very important matter. The danger in all of this is that there will be no substantive progress, that this will simply serve as yet another opportunity for the matter to be put off until after the next Federal election. Never mind that it is less than two years since the last election. What this Government is all about at the moment is keeping that ball in the air, ensuring that it does not have to get offside with any of the major players. One would have thought that, with all the enlightenment that Mr Kelty is supposed to have brought to the industrial relations arena, he would have been in heated agreement with the rest of industry, with all of those commentators, and indeed, I have no doubt, in their heart of hearts, with all the Ministers in the Government. Perhaps even the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade (Senator Gareth Evans) almost qualifies these days, after his baptism of fire in the communications area. </PARA>
<PARA> Indeed, it is tragic to report that the Australian Council of Trade Unions (ACTU) response has been almost entirely negative. The reason for that is that it is much more concerned about any loss of union membership when it is striving for single industry-based unions. In other words, its cooperatist approach, its blueprint for change, its grand strategy might be threatened by actually having diversity in competition in this vital area, especially if enterprise based workers took the view that they did not need to be strangled by a union and if, indeed, they were prepared to work hard, develop a healthy and constructive approach with their employers and started working overtime and at weekends without, as happens now-as Senator Parer has so graphically demonstrated-all of these rorts. Most of the time is spent in negotiating rather than working, in deciding how much will be paid in advance. Then there is the darg system under which people go home after doing a certain rostered amount of work. If that is a form of productivity I do not know what the term means. </PARA>
<PARA> It is quite clear that enormous progress needs to be made. Yet the ACTU, when it had the opportunity, simply deserted notions of efficiency and productivity. That tells us a fair bit about what we can expect about awards restructuring in due course. The likelihood is that we will see wage increases first; we will see some token gestures in the direction of award restructuring and productivity gains but, at the end of the day, our productivity levels will continue to languish at the bottom of the international league table. </PARA>
<PARA> It is a tragic state of affairs that this country should be held to ransom by a very selfish union; one that is not in any way interested in the national well-being; one that has dominated an industry riddled with monopoly practices; one that has transformed blackmail into an art form and that ultimately is being aided and abetted by the trade union movement. That is the challenge for this Government. To date we have been met with a deafening silence. The Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce, Senator Button, pathetically talks about addressing the issue and somehow promises that we can expect some progress. We did not get any comfort at all from Senator Button's response. The need for immediate action remains. Those reforms are vital. If we are to have an efficient and productive waterfront, then these recommendations will need to be adopted but not as part of some union negotiating deal. They will be adopted because gradualism has failed; because the way ahead is clear. </PARA>
<PARA> There is nothing magical about these recommendations. They are blindingly obvious to all people other than the members and supporters of this Government, which seems to be much more interested in delaying progress towards real change. Indeed, it simply pacifies those on whom it seems to count for electoral assistance. That is the last thing that this country wants. I am sure that the Australian community cannot look forward to any real progress in this area unless there is a change of government. I hope that today we will, at the very least, have a recognition of the validity of the recommendations of that report without any linkage towards this usual negotiating tactic. If we do, then at least there might be a glimmer of hope. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator GARETH EVANS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Transport and Communications (Mr Willis) will be bringing a submission on this report to Cabinet in May-not in the never-never, not after the election is over, but in May this year-and the Government's decisions will be announced as soon as possible thereafter. Prior to his submission to Cabinet, the Minister will be consulting with key industry participants on the ISC's recommendations and, indeed, in accordance with those recommendations. We expect initial discussions with stevedoring employers and unions to be held very shortly. Many of the ISC's recommendations, particularly those related to the management and operation of port authorities, are the direct responsibility of the State and Northern Territory Governments. The Minister has already written to responsible State and Territory Ministers asking that they give priority consideration to those recommendations.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As far as the union movement is concerned, which attracted the rhetorical indignation of Senator Alston, while the union movement has, in the person who is head of the Waterside Workers Federation (WWF) and, indirectly, through the Australian Council of Trade Unions (ACTU), indicated some reservations about certain aspects of the report, it has confirmed acceptance of the need for waterfront reform. It has also confirmed its willingness to participate in the Government's consultative process, which I have just outlined. It has not deserted notions of productivity and efficiency, as Senator Alston claims. There is a great deal of consciousness about the need to move in this particular area, just as there is in the Government itself. We are committed to achieving considerable and effective reform on the Australian waterfront and we will see through the changes necessary to improve efficiency and reliability in this vital area of the economy. </PARA>
<PARA> A lot of the criticism in Senator Alston's opening tirade-I have no doubt that this is a theme to be repeated over the next 2 1/2 hours-was of the Government for its alleged action in this area over the six years that we have been in government. I do not accept for a moment that anything the Government has done over this period could be construed even remotely as inaction or paying inattention or demonstrating an unwillingness to come to grips with this issue. What the course of action which I will now retail in loving detail does demonstrate is that the Government, throughout this process, has been acutely conscious of the difficulty of achieving extensive structural reform in this area. Because of the clash of interests involved, the extraordinary complexity of the problem, the enormous numbers of different players, parties and different levels of government involved, we are very conscious indeed of the counter-productivity of seeking to ram reform down the throats of people who basically not only want to reject it but also are in a position to disrupt that process. </PARA>
<PARA> It is tremendously important that as much consensus as possible be achieved before the final crunch point is reached. That is the process that we have been going through. It is a process which began back in July 1984, a few months after we were elected, when the Federal Government sponsored the shore based shipping cost seminar involving waterfront industry participants and their clients. It was an exercise designed to review the performance of the waterfront industry. Following that seminar, and in response to problems identified at it, in September 1984 the Government established the industry taskforce on shore based shipping costs under the chairmanship of Mr Ian Webber, Managing Director of Mayne Nickless Ltd. That task force examined all aspects of the waterfront industry, with membership including representatives from union and employer organisations, port authorities, shipping and user interests. It presented interim reports to the Government in December 1984 and December 1985. In June 1986 it presented its final report recommending a series of fundamental changes to be progressed in all sectors of the waterfront industry. In July, in response to that and to the increasing attention focused on the performance of the stevedoring sector, the stevedoring employers and the major unions established the Stevedoring Industry Review Committee as part of a stevedoring awards settlement exercise to examine all aspects of improving stevedoring productivity. </PARA>
<PARA> In December 1986 the Government announced its waterfront strategy in response to issues raised by the task force which had reported a few months earlier. The strategy included an investigative reference to the Inter-State Commission to examine all aspects of waterfront industry on a much wider canvas than that which had notionally been covered by the task force and to develop, with the participation of many more players than had been involved in the task force, a fully integrated plan to improve the efficiency and reliability of the waterfront. That strategy also involved-and in fact it was quite central to it-integrating the activity of four different industry groups, identifying and where possible addressing problems as they went in their separate areas of responsibility. It was not just a matter of preparing a report. It was a matter of a dynamic process here being set in train to pick up and shake each of the areas that had been identified in outline terms in the task force and to do something about getting change along the way, and that has happened. </PARA>
<PARA> Those four groups were the Stevedoring Industry Review Committee, to which I have already referred, which examined employment-related issues in the stevedoring sector; secondly, the Industry Committee, reviewing impediments arising from commercial practices, inadequate documentation and communication systems; thirdly, the Importer/Exporter Panel, representing the concerns of waterfront client industries and monitoring progress of the strategy from their perspective; and finally, the Marine and Ports Group and the Railway Group of the Australian Transport Advisory Council, aimed at progressing initiatives to address rail and port authority issues in consultation with the State and Territory governments That was all set in train in 1986. </PARA>
<PARA> By September of 1987 the Inter-State Commission presented its interim report advising of progress being made by the various industry groups established pursuant to that strategy. In October-November 1987 the Stevedoring Industry Review Committee concluded the first stage of its work program reviewing management and work practices at the local level, with the settlement of agreements between stevedoring employers and major unions under the second tier of the March 1987 national wage case decision. In February 1988 the Structural Adjustment Committee of the Cabinet met with all the major participants in the waterfront strategy to review its progress. </PARA>
<PARA> Through March to July 1988 the Inter-State Commission conducted its first round of public hearings in all capital cities, receiving some 80 submissions from interested parties. In August 1988 the ISC released its preliminary report establishing the basic final agenda for development of the integrated waterfront reform plan. From November 1988 to February of this year the ISC conducted its second round of public hearings, receiving some 60 additional submissions. In December 1988, in the middle of that period, the Structural Adjustment Committee of Cabinet again met with the major participants in the waterfront strategy process to review progress. Finally, in April 1989 the ISC published its final report, which is before us today, providing recommendations aimed at addressing all aspects of the waterfront industry comprehensively with a focus on fundamental structural change in the stevedoring sector. </PARA>
<PARA> I might add that while all this was happening at the governmental level, a lot was happening on the union front in terms of the unions demonstrating their willingness to generate themselves those improvements in efficiency and productivity which everyone is now fussing about. Early in 1987 agreement was reached between a container depot operator in Melbourne and the Waterside Workers Federation on the introduction of a performance-based productivity scheme. That concept was later extended to other WWF container depots. Later in 1987 the Federation announced the establishment of its first joint venture stevedoring operation in Stanley, Tasmania, in an endeavour to improve stevedoring performance in smaller regional ports by the involvement of the operational work force. This has since been followed by similar joint ventures being established in Mackay and Gladstone in Queensland, Newcastle in New South Wales, Geelong in Victoria, Darwin in the Northern Territory and Geraldton in Western Australia. The momentum is being generated, the commitment is there, the action is occurring, and it is all now coming to a head. If it has taken a long time, it is because these issues are relentlessly complex and have to be addressed in a systematic and sensible way, not just rushed at with a great rhetorical bellow like a bull at a gate, in the way that Senator Alston would urge us to follow. </PARA>
<PARA> I repeat that the Government has put restructuring of the waterfront at the centre of its current micro-economic reform agenda and we will see reforms through. We have already established a track record in regard to the crude oil industry deregulation, aviation industry deregulation and telecommunications liberalisation. We have delivered and we are delivering. That is to be compared, and compared dramatically and graphically, as Senator Button made clear in Question Time today, with the performance of the Opposition parties during the years that they were in government-and they were in government for 30 of the past 39 years. They have had endless opportunities over that period to reform not only the waterfront, but the coastal shipping industry about which they are also uptight-a reform that we are now addressing in a comprehensive and thorough way. They had ample opportunity not only not to start the two-airline policy, but to bring it to a close much sooner than they did. They had to leave that to us. They had to leave it to us to get a move rational and coherent deregulation of the crude oil industry and to do what we have just succeeded in doing in the context of telecommunications. The Opposition did none of those things during all those years it was in government. Therein lies the rub, the basis on which its credibility must be assessed. </PARA>
<PARA> What is the Opposition's policy in regard to the waterfront? It has no constructive policies that we can discern to restructure and revitalise the waterfront. Its approach is just a repetition of divisive and shallow ideology of the kind that we have so often heard. Many of the present underlying problems in the waterfront stretch back to the introduction of containerisation in the late 1960s. Many of the industrial relations attitudes stretch back further than that. The Opposition was in government when containerisation was introduced and it should take responsibility accordingly for many of the difficulties which have become apparent on the waterfront. There were never any serious attempts to address the deep-seated problems of the waterfront until this Government came to power. The Opposition's achievement when in government was to hand the industry over to employers and unions to fix it. It abolished the Australian Stevedoring Industry Authority in 1977 and handed over most of its functions to the Association of Employers of Waterside Labour, which now controls employment arrangements in conjunction with the Waterside Workers Federation. It put no strategy in place to ensure that improvements were achieved. What is the Opposition's policy now? The Opposition's Future Directions policy says:</PARA>
<PARA>The chaotic situation which still prevails has occurred because of the mass of restrictive trade practices which have vested unions with excessive power. </PARA>
<PARA>Its solution is:</PARA>
<PARA>Implementation of essential services legislation and our industrial relations policy will achieve greater productivity. </PARA>
<PARA>The introduction of essential services legislation in relation to the waterfront is a policy designed manifestly for confrontation and is only likely to result in further disruption to waterfront and shipping services. What we want in this area as elsewhere is less rhetoric, less huff and puff, but some genuine, careful, thoughtful, constructive, thought out, negotiated, consulted action. That is the base that we have been establishing in all our endeavours over the past five or six years which I have retailed in detail. It is the basis on which we will now proceed to implement major reform and to see that reform through. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise on behalf of the Australian Democrats to support this urgency motion. In our view, it is indeed a matter of urgency that the Government introduce massive reform on the waterfront along the lines outlined in the Inter-State Commission waterfront investigation report. We would anticipate that these reforms and the rapid changes that they will necessitate will be difficult for and make very heavy demands upon all parties involved. Although we support the motion and the reforms, we do not believe that a wharfie or union bash is the way to begin the process. We say that we should all try to be objective about the realities-attitudinal, industrial and political-of the situation on the waterfront. We all concur in and accept the critical significance of this industry in Australia's present industrial and future industrial development and industrial relations, but we must approach reform cautiously. It is an industry with a bad image. We believe that its bad image has been exaggerated and substantially misrepresented over the past decade or so, and I shall cite some evidence to that effect in a moment. So, in essence, the Democrats' position is certainly that reform is needed urgently, but it must be approached in a thoughtful, deliberate and consultative way, as the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade (Senator Gareth Evans) has just this moment quite correctly emphasised.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The report of the Inter-State Commission proposes what we acknowledge as being essentially a very rational strategy. It is worth citing the essential elements of the strategy of reform, which appear in the introductory summary of the report. The report suggests that the intention of the strategy is the elimination of waterfront related transport impediments. `Impediments' is a significant word. This industry is so critical that disruptions within it constitute a major impediment to what happens right across the industrial scene in Australia-particularly the primary and secondary industrial scenes. The report aims at the achievement of a reliable and cost-effective transport system for exporters and importers. Very few things would be more in the national interest than a reliable and cost-effective transport system for exporters and importers. </PARA>
<PARA> The report cites seven main elements of an effective strategy. It begins by saying that management is the essential element of this successful strategy. It says that an effective management and well-motivated work force-that of course acknowledges the criticality of good relations between management and labour-is required. The second element in the strategy is a strengthening of the influence of exporters and importers. Thirdly, we need to increase the industry's transparency and accountability-in other words, let us establish what the realities are, let us see what is there rather than speculate. I will mention some of the anomalies in a moment. Fourthly, the report says we must improve industrial relations and dispute settlement procedures; fifthly, ensure a market oriented provision of infrastructure and service; sixthly, remove anti-competitive practices; and, seventhly, establish a body to coordinate and manage the strategy. That strikes us as being an inherently rational start point for making dramatic improvements in a critical industry, and we commend the Opposition for suggesting to the national that this is a matter of urgency. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like to discuss, only briefly, four points. First of all, the industry has a bad image. Not only does it have a bad image at home but it also has a bad image internationally. That affects the attitude of our potential traders as to convenience or inconvenience, the possibility or impossibility and the economics of trading with Australia. So the image of this industry is extremely critical. By no means do we deny that the industry has a bad image, but it is probably exaggerated. The pre-1980-82 image of the waterfront was extremely bad. There was a peak in industrial disputation between 1980 and 1982 but since 1983-that is, since the accord-there has been a quite dramatic improvement in the level of industrial disputation on the waterfront. The post-accord period has been a period of positive improvement. In 1985, 312,000 hours were lost on the waterfront. In 1986 there was a 60 per cent improvement, with the numbers of hours lost decreasing to 127,000 hours-still a lot of time. In 1987 there was a 30 per cent improvement, down to 88,700 hours. Things have improved quite dramatically, and as the Minister cited there is a movement towards a positive attitude on the waterfront in recent times. I believe it is important for us to acknowledge those realities.</PARA>
<PARA> The report quite correctly cites structural problems and labour inflexibility as being the inherent limitation on the waterfront. There are not only limitations for workers but also limitations for management. The report also cites the fact that most of the management problems are of a clerical nature and that there is vast diversity and repetition in the handling of the paperwork that is associated with the industry. There has been an interest in sustaining that diversity because it has allowed opportunities for delay, hold-up and disruption. It is within that clerical dimension that a lot of the problems lie. If there could be a major move towards standard- isation and towards computerisation of these procedures a good many of the management problems would be resolved. A lot of the communication breakdowns are associated with this diversity or inconsistency and repetition within the clerical dimension of management. </PARA>
<PARA> There are major design problems. Our wharves are appallingly designed and it is very difficult to achieve technological advancement because of the inherent historical design limitations which impose a restriction upon major management changes. Worker attitudes within the industry have become inbred. It is an industry where workers are, by comparison with the remainder of the work force, relatively elderly. It is an industry where the bulk of the work force has been in place for decades rather than a few years. There is an entrenchment of attitudes, including the present disposition of resistance to change. Those attitudes reflect historical circumstances and will not be changed overnight. The Commission recommends that there be a flush-out, if you like, of portions of the work force-which is an acknowledgment of the fact that it imposes very serious limitations for change. The proposed generous redundancy plan is an attempt to acknowledge the fact that there is a need to see a lot of new faces and perhaps have a substantial reduction in the number of people actually in the workplace. At the moment the workers are relatively well off and therefore not disposed to leaving the workplace without a fight. There is no doubt that they have, through industrial action and other methods, been successful in creating a very favourable set of circumstances for themselves. Naturally they are reluctant to see these significantly disrupted, as they obviously would be by significant change in the workplace. </PARA>
<PARA> The most important thing for us to acknowledge in this debate is that the whole question of the waterfront is tied in with the broader question of the transport industry, which in turn is tied in with some very profound questions that the Australian community has to come to grips with, for example, in relation to the greenhouse effect and energy, and these proposals for change are very opportune. The Australian Democrats would argue that sea transportation must emerge as the primary form of transportation between our major centres of settlement in Australia in the next three to five decades, and that that process of dramatic change must begin now. It is a fact that most Australians live on the seaboard and within close proximity to ports. It is a fact that there is the potential for most of Australia's commodity requirements to be transported by sea. It is a fact that there is a bias towards road transport in Australia, which is expensive, dangerous and polluting. So it is quite appropriate that, at a time when we are beginning to examine the whole question of the greenhouse effect and alternative sources of energy consumption and transportation, there also be an examination of the wharves in relation to the shipping industry. </PARA>
<PARA> We must acknowledge the need for review within the transport industry generally, and the wharves are critical to that. The Inter-State Commission has delivered to us a very long-sighted, positive and responsible national strategy. The Democrats suggest that this is a timely opportunity to approach these industrial challenges. We would urge the Opposition particularly not to enter this critical debate with a wharfie bashing or union bashing mentality. We believe that it would be quite inappropriate to do so. In supporting the urgency motion, we simply make a plea to all parties involved to agree with the Inter-State Commission that we are addressing a critical challenge at a critical time. We need to acknowledge its urgency and the demands it places upon all parties involved. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to address my remarks to four separate aspects of Senator Alston's motion. First of all, on Wednesday evening of this week we are contemplating a statement by the Treasurer (Mr Keating) which will purport to address the economic problems of this country. It will do so, as we all know, by way of providing for a major tax cut to be operative from 1 July this year and by way of agreement with the trade unions-an agreement, no doubt, that will be rubber stamped by the Industrial Relations Commission-for a very significant rise in wage and salary rates in the course of 1989-90. I want to say something about that. I also want to say something about the pressing need, under the circumstances in which Australia finds itself today, for reform of the micro-economy-the individual elements that go to make up the whole of the economy. I want to say something specifically about the waterfront, which has been the particular topic of investigation by the Inter-State Commission for some considerable time now and on which it has just reported. If I have time, I would like to say something very briefly about the human relations aspects of some of these matters, which are often too quickly passed over by those discussing them in purely economic terms.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In terms of the overall economic background, at Question Time today Senator Button, the Leader of the Government in the Senate, agreed with my comment that we have today an economy which is overstretched and which is undergoing a continuing crisis in its balance of payments whereby Australia is getting further and further into debt to foreigners and selling off more and more of the Australian farm. What Senator Button did not say-and it is fair to say that I did not suggest to him in my question that he should-is that a solution to these economic problems is to be found in measures which will render the Australian economy more competitive. We need to address the fact that our productivity performance today is woeful-one could use any number of stronger terms. </PARA>
<PARA> It is extraordinary that in these circumstances we have the Treasurer of the Commonwealth of Australia proposing to make a statement on Wednesday evening of this week purporting to address the problems of our economy which will contain nothing, so far as we are presently informed, that relates to the woeful productivity performance of this economy. Rather, the Treasurer appears to be under the impression that we can fix up our productivity problems by, on the one hand, the Treasury handing out a bag of money and, on the other hand, the Industrial Relations Commission, as it is now called, forcing employers to hand out more bags of money by way of higher wages and salaries. Of course, everybody in this country knows that we cannot fix up our problems in this way. The only way we can address those problems is by improving our productivity performance, by lifting our economic game, our productive game. It is a travesty of economic policy that the Treasurer of this country will get up in this Parliament on Wednesday night of this week and ignore those topics. </PARA>
<PARA> We need to lift our game by addressing the problems of our major domestic service industries as well as other industries. There is a need for what the economists call micro-economic reform. This Government has taken a great deal of credit-and I think it has been deserved credit-for the reforms it made by way of deregulating the financial sector of the economy. But there it has stopped. It has been frozen into immobility ever since December 1983. Meanwhile, the labour market, which is the greatest single market in this country, has gone totally unreformed, totally untackled by this Government. It is as rigid today as it was five years ago. The waterfront, which is the subject of the Inter-State Commission report to which I referred earlier, is a total shambles. Coastal shipping is an absolute disgrace. In effect, it is a monopoly in the hands of the Australian Seamen's Union. There are land transport inefficiencies, particularly in our State railway systems, whose financial deficits alone amount to something like $3 billion a year. I think in the case of New South Wales alone it is something like $1 billion a year. There are also inefficiencies in communications generally. </PARA>
<PARA> In addition, a whole raft of government enterprises-so-called business enterprises; in most cases it is almost a joke to describe them in that way-are still meandering along in their comfortable governmental clothes. As we all know, and even the Government itself has dimly begun to recognise this-although, as Senator Lewis said this afternoon, recognising is not the same thing as doing anything about it-the only solution to that problem is to privatise those government so-called business enterprises. It is only by these measures that we shall tackle the question of raising productivity. </PARA>
<PARA> As it happens-and this is very opportune-we have before us today a draft report of the Industries Assistance Commission on international trade in services. This report has a great many very interesting things to say about matters which are totally apposite to the points I have just been making. Let me quote a few paragraphs from that report, to which Senator Lewis also referred earlier this afternoon. For example, the report states:</PARA>
<PARA>Because of the crucial importance of these embodied services-</PARA>
<PARA>that is to say, services embodied in our exports-</PARA>
<PARA>any inefficiencies in their production can seriously undermine the capacity of Australian industries to compete internationally. </PARA>
<PARA>The report goes on to detail a list of examples. It states:</PARA>
<PARA>In 1988 the Commission-</PARA>
<PARA>that is the Industries Assistance Commission-</PARA>
<PARA>estimated that a reduction in coastal shipping freight rates to levels in line with those applying internationally would reduce direct costs by some $180 to $460 million in most years, with beneficial flow-on effects that would increase GDP by between $250 million and $550 million. </PARA>
<PARA>The report makes a second point:</PARA>
<PARA>In an information paper prepared for the inquiry into Government (Non-tax) Charges, the Commission estimated that direct savings from productivity improvements in government rail authorities could amount to $1 billion per year-</PARA>
<PARA>I think that is a modest estimate-</PARA>
<PARA>and that if these savings were passed on to rail-freight users, GDP could increase by about $1.8 billion annually. </PARA>
<PARA>The Commission also quotes a report by the Business Council of Australia and states:</PARA>
<PARA> The Business Council of Australia in a recent study suggests that if best international practices were adopted for shipping and related shore transport, the cost of transporting Australian exports and imports would fall by more than $2 billion annually. When these savings were added to a further $1.3 billion the Council estimated to be available from productivity improvements in the operation of railways, the economy-wide effects were increases of more than $6 billion per annum in GDP and 17,000 persons employed. </PARA>
<PARA>That is, above those who can now be employed. So it goes on. I have not the time to quote at more length, but it concludes by saying:</PARA>
<PARA>However, the implied benefits of removing (these impediments) are so great as to suggest that these heavily regulated and protected service industries are imposing a debilitating burden on the rest of the Australian economy. It is difficult to envisage how increased international competitiveness of Australian industry, which is a fundamental objective of the Government's agenda for micro-economic reform, can be achieved if these service industry deficiencies are not tackled as a matter of urgency. </PARA>
<PARA>Let me go on to say something more specifically about the waterfront. We have the report of the Inter-State Commission on its investigation into this matter. The Commission has made estimates, which are that the benefits from tackling the inefficiencies and the monopoly of the control of labour on the waterfront by trade unions would benefit the Australian economy to the extent of $620m per annum. Indeed, what the Commission actually says, in leading up to that view, is that it is convinced that there is `a need for further substantial change to the waterfront industry'. It says that many of the other estimates being provided to it as to the benefits from doing so `were much higher than the Commission's own minimum estimate of $620m per year'. It goes on:</PARA>
<PARA>The evidence to the Commission on many matters, such as inefficient work practices, unsatisfactory industrial relations, ineffective supervision and management, high costs and widespread unreliability all indicate that fundamental rather than incremental change is required. </PARA>
<PARA>The most obvious example of that, of course, is the overmanning in the industry. The Commission estimates that the work force in the industry can be reduced by about 30 per cent; that is to say, roughly 30 per cent of the work force in the industry is presently either effectively unemployed or inefficiently employed. Other estimates range much higher than that and go as high as 40 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> As Senator Alston has said, the Commission has proposed a plan of campaign, a plan of attack if you like, upon that totally unsatisfactory and unacceptable situation. What has the Waterside Workers Federation of Australia said in response? The General Secretary of that Federation has said-I was engaged in a television debate with him on the subject; so I heard him say it-`This is a recipe for chaos'. He said that, as far as the Waterside Workers Federation is concerned, it is totally unacceptable. What is more, he went on to say, `I have the full authority of Mr Bill Kelty of the ACTU for saying so'. This is the body which we are told has been so reasonably assisting the Government of this country to conduct our affairs for the past six years. </PARA>
<PARA> The Commission has a number of salutary things to say about the monopoly powers of trade unions, but the time available to me will not permit me to quote them. However, let me quote just one particular example of the extraordinary situation we have on the waterfront. There is a category of workers on the waterfront known as gangway watchmen. I should say, in fairness to Mr Bull and the Waterside Workers Federation, that these are not members of his union. They are members of, I think, the Federated Miscellaneous Workers Union of Australia (FMWUA). The Commission says quite flatly at page 212 of its report:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . there is no case for the employment of gangway watchmen . . .</PARA>
<PARA>It goes on to mention that there are in all 493 of these watchmen on the so-called `A' Register of Waterside Workers and, in addition, `69 watchmen were employed'-I am quoting from page 213-`on the `B' Register as casual employees'. There have already been proposals to reduce the number of these people for whom there is no need at all. The Association of Employers of Waterside Labour has proposed redundancy lump sum payments equivalent to nine months average earnings for each person, which would amount to approximately $32,000 in the case of watchmen in Sydney. In its response to that offer, the FMWUA proposed-I am quoting again from page 213 of the report:</PARA>
<PARA>That its members should receive twelve months' average earnings, four weeks' pay in lieu of notice, and four weeks' average earnings for each year of service. In the case of a Sydney watchman with ten years' service, this amounts to a lump sum of approximately $78,000. </PARA>
<PARA>Not bad if one can get it. But, of course, that does not come out of thin air; it has to be loaded on to every consumer in this country and, not least, the exporters upon whose effectiveness this country will depend for its survival. </PARA>
<PARA> I simply want to say that what we have here is a classic example of a trade union and its representatives confusing their interests and the interests of that union not only with the interests of Australia, which of course is obvious, but also with the interests of other people who might want to get employment in other jobs which could be created in Australia if this waterfront were not weighing down our cost levels to such an extent that export industries are put out of business in the process. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We are dealing with an urgency motion moved by the Opposition in the following terms:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The need for immediate action by the Government to introduce reforms which will ensure that the Australian waterfront becomes efficient and productive instead of being a national burden and impediment to internationally competitive economic activities. </PARA>
<PARA>Senator Evans, for the Government, has made it very clear that the achievement of a more productive and reliable waterfront is a major priority within the Government's micro-economic agenda. It complements and reinforces reforms being pursued in other areas of the economy and is essential in enhancing the international competitiveness of Australia's agricultural, mining and manufacturing industries. So, the Government does agree that this is a priority. I will show that the consistent approach of the Government is to achieve change. </PARA>
<PARA> We have heard what we would expect from this Opposition. Senator Alston led off in a vicious attack on the Waterside Workers Federation of Australia. He has been ably supported by Senator Stone, who has attacked the seamen and others. The Opposition's approach is always to attack the unions first, and to give what I would suggest is a rather superficial analysis of the industry. One of the matters I want to raise, as others might not raise it, is that the council of the Waterside Workers Federation is meeting today. It received the report before lunch and its members are reading it. </PARA>
<PARA> What we have here is an urgency motion from the Opposition. It believes that everything is so important. The members of that council are indeed reading and analysing that report, as people in the industry are and as everybody else should be. The report is a package. Many of the proposals would be acceptable to the Waterside Workers Federation. An example is where the union has put proposals forward. It disagrees with a number of the proposals and, as is the tendency in industrial relations matters, it states its position very strongly, as Senator Stone has said. But I believe that the Waterside Workers Federation will-it has indicated that it will-negotiate with the other parties to achieve an effective reform of the industry. When we make these statements, as the Opposition has, I think it is worth while analysing the sort of criticism that the Waterside Workers Federation has referred to. It is concerned about the bulk handling proposals, with which it disagrees. It is concerned about something that Senator Alston mentioned, namely, enterprise employment. It is concerned because the Liberal and National parties are always out to smash the unions, to undermine the economic power to trade unionists through their unions and so reduce the salaries that unionists might get. The concerns of enterprise unions are based on a bitter, bloody history in Australia, particularly in Sydney, which is where I come from, where everything that could be done to people was done in the hungry mile of Sussex Street. It is against this difficult background that we have to achieve change. We have examples of overseas experience--</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="IF4">Senator CHILDS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Alston, as a lawyer in his previous life, had the audacity to talk about the monopoly power of the waterside workers. Here we have professionals, Senator Stone, who can determine their own salaries, who can determine the pyramid structure of employment, who can exclude people and who can do every imaginable thing-but that is all right; they are professionals.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> When people like the waterside workers try to retain employment, to improve conditions of employment or to increase salaries, Senator Stone says, `This will bring the country to its knees'. That is the double standard inherent in what the Opposition is saying. When the waterside workers are critical of the proposals for enterprise employment it is not an impossible situation to deal with. The Australian National Line, in Sydney and elsewhere, is a type of enterprise employment. When that is examined-and it has not been rejected out of hand by the waterside workers-it will be possible, given good faith, to get into a situation where some sort of a compromise proposal can be reached which protects the interests of the workers involved and which allows for the industry to be remodelled and streamlined. We cannot expect people who have had a history of strong solidarity to easily agree to some of their colleagues being completely eliminated in the process. That is a bitter and difficult process and, of course, it is one of the reasons the Australian Council of Trade Unions said that the Commission's recommendations on industrial relations aspects are not acceptable to the union movement in their present form. However, the unions have confirmed their acceptance of the need for waterfront reform and their willingness to participate constructively in the Government's forthcoming consultation process. </PARA>
<PARA> That is where Senator Stone shows his ignorance. Clearly there is an opening ambit claim. The council of the union is meeting this week. The Minister will go to that council meeting to discuss the matters with the Waterside Workers Federation. This is in keeping with the Government acting immediately to discuss the reforms and to achieve those reforms. Of course, employers will have concerns from within the waterfront. I think some of Senator Stone's National Party supporters throughout Australia might be concerned too and, legitimately, some community interests will be concerned with the centralisation of wheat. It is intended that wheat will be routed to the central city ports, instead of to places 100 miles along the coast, as it is now, where transport is close at hand. This concerns National Party people. I will be very interested to see how Senator Stone deals with that. He will probably deal with that matter in the usual way the National Party deals with these problems; on the one hand it is in favour of change, but on the other hand if the changes affect people in the country it screams the loudest. </PARA>
<PARA> It is proper to have a community discussion on the matter and I agree that the matter is urgent and that we should all participate in the debate, but I do not agree with the carping criticism in the terms of the matter of urgency that was put today. The Opposition's emotional and confrontationist approach will not help find a solution. Grandstanding has no place when we are looking to achieving complete change. When we talk about change, when we talk about the micro-analysis of industry, this Government has a good record, particularly in the steel industry, in heavy engineering, in shipbuilding, and in the textile and clothing industry. The people in those industries have had the opportunity to participate in changes. Change is only effective when people can take part in that change. Giving orders, passing motions, which is the Opposition's way, has not been effective. It has not been effective from the time of the Menzies Government through to the Fraser Government. Those governments failed to change anything because they could only make statements and speeches on the problems. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Stone talks about productivity. Does he not realise that we only get an increase in productivity when people give freely, when people believe that they are able to participate, when they can see that they are being treated fairly. Standing over people on our waterfront is no different from standing over people anywhere else. It is the only way known by people like Senator Stone, who are part of the elite in this society, on how to handle these matters, but they have not changed anything. This is confirmed in the Future Directions policy document of the Liberal Party. That policy says:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The chaotic situation which still prevails has occurred because of the mass of restrictive trade practices which have vested unions with excessive power. </PARA>
<PARA>This is the usual thing the Opposition refers to. The Liberal Party says its solution is:</PARA>
<PARA>implementation of essential services legislation and our industrial relations policy will achieve greater productivity. </PARA>
<PARA>The history of the waterside workers in particular in Australia is characteristic of the Australian labour movement. We want people to make effective changes that will transform the waterfront. They are the sorts of changes that we want to achieve. We want to take the industry away from its bad history. I do not deny that it has a bad history. It is a history that we want changed. Senator Gareth Evans gave the Opposition, by chapter and verse, an account of the detailed discussions that have occurred since 1984 in trying to get agreement and improvement. He referred to an improvement in August 1987 when the Waterside Workers Federation established the first of its joint venture stevedoring operations in Stanley, Tasmania, in an endeavour to improve stevedoring performance in smaller regional ports by the involvement of the occupational work force. This has since been followed by similar ventures being established in Mackay and Gladstone in Queensland, in Newcastle in New South Wales, in Geelong in Victoria, in Darwin in the Northern Territory, and in Geraldton in Western Australia. The employers and the Waterside Workers Federation will have discussions with the Government. The Government will lead those discussions. It is acting as a catalyst to try to achieve changes. It is a priority of the Government's economic reform agenda and the Government will be giving urgent consideration to the recommendations of the Inter-State Commission. It has been two years in preparation. There has been an interim report. There has been a great deal of preparation. We now have the opportunity to enable people to examine the report. We are coming to the important phase. </PARA>
<PARA> Unfortunately, the Opposition's reaction is to go back to the past, to attack the unions. If anything, this debate today will make it more difficult for the unions to come to the conference table with the Government and the employers and to be able to give some ground, as they have already done and will in the future. </PARA>

That will only occur after they are convinced that it is in their interests to modernise and change the industry. This Government has given this matter a priority. The Minister will meet with the people concerned in the near future. I am confident that as a result of that we will have a much more streamlined waterfront industry than we have had in the past.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Today we are debating an urgency motion proposed by my colleague Senator Alston which reads:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The need for immediate action by the Government to introduce reforms which will ensure that the Australian waterfront becomes efficient and productive instead of being a national burden and impediment to internationally competitive economic activities. </PARA>
<PARA>Nothing could be more urgent in Australia today than this motion. Before starting with the subject matter I think it is best to point out the state of our economy. We are enjoying the best terms of trade that we have seen for 10 years. Yet month in, month out, our balance of payments-our current account deficit-is in the order of $1 billion to $1.5 billion a month. Our net foreign debt is $100 billion and growing. Senator Childs talked about the need to be productive. We all agree with that. However, he went on to say that the only way to achieve that is by cooperation, consultation and-as Senator Gareth Evans said-consensus. Consultation and consensus on the waterfront has not worked. It is as simple as that. The only criticism I have is of the implementation of the Inter-State Commission's report. I will come to that later. </PARA>
<PARA> What are the problems on the waterfront? They are not that individuals who would like to work harder will not. I am not under any circumstances criticising the majority of people who work on the waterfront. I am criticising the system, the Waterside Workers Federation of Australia (WWF) and the restrictive work practices. I would like to give a few examples in the short time available to me. We all realise that people on the waterfront are paid a lot more than the average wage. </PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Senator Stone" NAMEID="LJ4">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="LJ4">Senator Stone</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;About 30 per cent more, on average.</PARA></TALK.START>
</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="KI4">Senator PARER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As a minimum it is about $800 for a 28-hour working week. I would be prepared to accept that if those workers were permitted by the system, by the Waterside Workers Federation, to be reliable. The major problem in this country lies in the lack of reliability and the effect it has on our exports, our import replacements and, hence, our current account deficit. I will give a few examples of that. In addition to what are very generous wages, the WWF employees receive a whole range of extravagant allowances including a site allowance, a telephone allowance, a laundry allowance, an obnoxious cargo allowance, a bad stow allowance-for unloading badly stowed cargo-a dirt allowance, a rain allowance and a cold allowance, to name just a few. They do get a telephone allowance but when they fail to turn up for work on an almost daily basis work does not continue unless a replacement is found, which is made difficult by the fact that the workers do not telephone to advise that they will be unavailable, even though they are paid the allowance. In my home city of Brisbane that allowance is $7 a week. Another example is the eighth day off, where a wharf labourer works seven days in a row and gets a day off which is added to his annual leave. There is the infamous nick system that I have referred to often in the past. It is alive and well throughout Australia. This is where two or more men are rostered on to do the same job or some invented job and the spare wharfies can nick-off while on full pay. These are some other examples of overmanning which allows wharfies to nick off.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> At Brisbane's conventional port-not the container or bulk ports-at least two extra workers are employed for each vessel. These spare men do no job and are not allowed to be employed even if a job arises during the shift. They are not permitted to work. Others must be employed to do any new jobs that arise during a shift. These are just a couple of problems. There is a system called two up, two down. On Brisbane's container and coal loading wharves a down driver must be employed on the ground for each up driver operating a crane. As cranes and other equipment are driven for the full shift by the same driver the down driver has no job to do. At one container terminal 480 shifts were allocated to surplus down drivers last year. That is the problem. We have spare front-end loader drivers who must be employed when gypsum cargo is loaded on to road transport in Brisbane ports. When three loaders are being used an extra five drivers must be employed in addition to the actual drivers. Needless to say, these spare drivers have no job to do. This is what we are paying for. This is why we are unproductive. This is why we cannot compete on overseas markets. </PARA>
<PARA> There is a group called general purpose men. Two general purpose men-GPs, as they are called; they have all the lingo down on the wharf-are allocated on board the vessel regardless of whether they are needed. We have people called amenities men. When a gang of 15 or more A-registered waterfront workers are employed an amenities man must also be hired to tidy up amenity rooms after breaks and safeguard waterfront workers' personal belongings. The amenities men have no real cleaning to do as the job of cleaning the amenity rooms is done by the port authorities. This is a most incredible situation that occurs in this country. </PARA>
<PARA> Another issue I wish to talk about relates to first aid men. This is not a safety issue. One of the most blatant examples of featherbedding is the first aid men on the waterfront. A fully qualified waterside worker must be employed in each stevedoring gang to man the first aid station. If he does not show up no work commences. If someone has a heart attack or cuts an artery there is nothing that person can do except call for an ambulance. In 1988 it was calculated that these first aid men cost-I am giving the example of my own city and the port of Brisbane-$1.5m for the year and tied up 17 qualified waterside workers who could have been doing other work. The stevedores decided that a much more efficient practice would be to contract with the ambulance brigade which would provide ambulances all the time with paramedics. They would have saved $700,000 a year if this had been done. It was rejected by the Waterside Workers Federation which said that one of the major problems on the wharf was the lack of wharf labourers available to work. </PARA>

<PARA>Nothing, as the report observes, is more certain than that the waterfront industry will not reform itself. </PARA>
<PARA>It cannot do that. I could go on and on. There are people called the glutmen. In Brisbane two glutmen must be employed to pick up any gluts-pieces of timber used to support cargo in transit-which may fall off timber packs. The incidence of gluts falling off is rare and does not require two workers to do the job. It was estimated that 400 man shifts are lost each year as a result of that simple overmanning. Waterside workers work for seven weeks and are rostered a week off. This is what they call a one in seven roster. This is in addition to holiday pay. It is included in the calculation of holiday pay allowances. </PARA>

Also, the extra hour's work that has just been referred to on top of their seven-hour shifts entitles them to a 20-minute coffee break, thus reducing the extra hour to 40 minutes.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I refer briefly to the report of the Inter-State Commission. Frankly, I think it is an excellent report, although I do have one reservation with regard to its implementation. The one reservation I have is in connection with the plan, which is on page 142 of the report. The plan itself is excellent and must be implemented. This will be the acid test for this Government. The report says:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . the Commission proposes that the first step be an in-principle agreement between government, the employer association, the ACTU and key unions. </PARA>
<PARA>As Senator Stone mentioned, we have already seen the reaction of the key unions and the Australian Council of Trade Unions, which are not going to have a bar of it. Under the implementations suggested by the Commission, which assumes that it is dealing with reasonable men-and I doubt whether they are-either of those groups has the power of veto. This is the major challenge for the Government. The Government must not use that as an excuse not to implement something which it has talked about for six or seven years. It is worth commenting, in passing, on remarks made by the Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce, Senator Button, the other day when he came in here and tried to have a bit of fun at Senator Boswell's expense. Senator Button said:</PARA>
<PARA>What is wrong with this country is that for years and years we had governments which were not prepared to face up to the problems of real deregulation. They were not prepared to face up to the problems of reducing protection to soft and flabby industries. </PARA>
<PARA>That is fair enough, but why did he stop there? He did not mention the monopolies that have been created in the labour market in this instance-the Achilles' heel of Australia-the point of exit of our export goods, the point of import of the capital goods that are needed for import replacement for exports. Going back to the Inter-State Commission report, it states in the general conclusions:</PARA>
<PARA>The evidence to the Commission on many matters such as inefficient work practices-</PARA>
<PARA>which I have just covered briefly-</PARA>
<PARA>unsatisfactory industrial relations, ineffective supervision and management, high costs and widespread unreliability all indicate that fundamental rather than incremental change is required. </PARA>
<PARA>Yet we heard the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Senator Gareth Evans, earlier quoting a litany of studies and investigations with no sense of urgency whatsoever. Further on the report says:</PARA>
<PARA>Australian industrial law and practice has had the general effect of conferring on unions monopoly or near-monopoly power . . . </PARA>
<PARA>This is never heard from the other side; we hear about it in respect of other issues. Dealing with the important considerations that flow from that, the report continues:</PARA>
<PARA>First, there is a strong case for representation of users and the community in the negotiations that lead to industrial arrangements. Second, a union-</PARA>
<PARA>the Waterside Workers Federation-</PARA>
<PARA>to which society has conceded a large degree of monopoly power should be committed to exercising that power responsibly. Third, abuses of monopoly union power should be dealt with in a manner similar to abuses of corporate power. </PARA>
<PARA>We have been saying that for year and years on this side of the Parliament. We are looking simply for the unions to fit within the same level playing field as applies to everybody else in the community. It is not a matter of union bashing. I would fight just as strongly for the right of someone to participate in a trade union as for his right not to participate. What must happen-and these are the major recommendations-is that we get rid of restrictive work practices, get away from the industry-based pooling system, get on to an enterprise-based employment system where people who work for a company can build up their expertise and have some loyalty to that company so that each day their pride grows that they are improving their productivity and are adding to the ability of this country to compete and not destroying our competitiveness and productivity in overseas markets. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;With the tabling at the end of last week of the conclusions of the Inter-State Commission (ISC) recommendations on its waterfront investigation, the Hawke Labor Government has finally run out of even the flimsiest of excuses for failing to take immediate action to change the disastrous and intolerable structures and work practices on our waterfront. That is why the Opposition has moved today, as a matter of urgency:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>The need for immediate action by the Government to introduce reforms which will ensure that the Australian waterfront becomes efficient and productive instead of being a national burden and impediment to internationally competitive economic activities. </PARA>
<PARA>The Australian waterfront has been costing the Australian people hundreds of millions of dollars a year more than it should. Numerous inquiries and reports in recent years have provided abundant evidence of this and, indeed, pointed the way to the specific changes required. But this Government, the toady of the union movement, has refused to act. It has always sought one more inquiry, one more report, as a camouflage for its lack of guts. It now has the Inter-State Commission report. There can be no more excuses. There can be no more delay. The buck rests fairly and squarely with this Government. It can have April or May economic statements and August Budgets until the cows come home, but if it fails to reduce the costs on our waterfront the Australian economy will remain in tatters and every Australian will continue to suffer declining living standards. </PARA>
<PARA> The findings and recommendations of the report of the Inter-State Commission are welcome. They reinforce the evidence of earlier inquiries. The proposals for change are moderate and, indeed, generous to waterside workers, whose rorts and work practices have for decades ripped dollars out of the pockets of their fellow Australians. Why is the Government so obsessed with discussions and negotiations and so incompetent and gutless in actually dealing with the waterfront fiasco? The report lays down in detail a plan of action. There is no need for further discussion. Indeed, if there is a fault in the report, it is its moderation in seeking the execution of its plan over a three-year period. Action is so urgent that it should be completed within a year. After all, every year that goes by retaining significant elements of the present structure costs Australians at least $620m and probably more than $1 billion. Given that need, if a three-year program is to be implemented, then it must start now. The time for talk is over. </PARA>
<PARA> We have already heard a cacophony of responses to the Commission's findings and especially to some of its recommendations. The most notable and, unfortunately, the most predictable was the response from Mr Tas Bull, General Secretary of the Waterside Workers Federation of Australia, who slammed the report when it was released last Thursday, rejecting its proposals outright. His little mate Bill Kelty, the Secretary of the Australian Council of Trade Unions (ACTU), has come out in support of Mr Bull and his union's position. Both are simply serving vested self-interest, not of the waterside workers but of trade union structure and power. Under the proposals, both can see the premier waterfront union losing membership to other organisations in a rationalisation of labour when the ACTU is seeking to create all-powerful super unions to entrench its power in the corporate state which this Government is establishing. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Childs claimed a few moments ago that honourable senators on this side of the chamber had not seen a live unionist. Since that report was published last Thursday, I have spoken about the report with a senior official of the Waterside Workers Federation. One can certainly understand the union leadership adopting a negative position on the report-it is against their vested interests-but it is the Government's responsibility to act in the interests of the wider community. It must act without delay. However, improved industrial relations and productivity on the waterfront require a marked change in attitude, an end to the `us and them' mentality between employers and employees. </PARA>
<PARA> Some of the Commission's recommendations address these attitudinal issues directly-such as replacing labour pooling with an enterprise employment structure. The union should not oppose them. Let us hope that saner heads prevail at the meeting this week of the National Council of the Waterside Workers Federation, which is considering this report. Let us hope that Mr Bull's initial reaction is replaced by a greater recognition of the national interest. </PARA>
<PARA> The Commission's findings, which recommend considerable and specific changes to work practices and necessarily reduced employment to sort out overmanning, finally, after years of hearings, get to the heart of the matter, to the heart of the disease on our waterfront. Evidence to the Commission of inefficient work practices, unsatisfactory industrial relations, ineffective supervision and management-and we need to note there is a managerial responsibility as well as union responsibility with regard to some of the problems on the waterfront-high costs and widespread unreliability, all indicate that fundamental rather than marginal changes are required. </PARA>
<PARA> It is about time too. For far too long we have had a plethora of investigations, inquiries, commissions, studies, reports and reviews, none of which have so far resulted in the implementation of the key restructuring of the waterfront and its associated participants which this nation requires. This has chronically affected Australia's efficiency and standing in international commodity markets and has denied us many export income opportunities. Here in Australia the stevedoring industry has not been subject to direct regulation in the last 10 years other than through the general provisions of the trade practices legislation. In recent years there has been increasing shipper and community concern about the level of shore-based shipping services and costs. With the considerable changes that have occurred on the Australian waterfront since the Second World War, such as the move toward containerisation, the refocus of trade patterns fostering growth with Japan rather than Europe, industrial and environmental issues and a developing society and economy, it was evident that waterfront labour needs would by necessity reflect a change in demand. </PARA>
<PARA> In the 30 years since the late 1950s there has been a 79.8 per cent drop in the number of A-register watersiders, despite an increase in bulk and non-bulk tonnages over that time. The proportion of the volume of cargo stevedored by Waterside Workers Federation members shrank from 63.8 per cent in the early 1950s to 21.8 per cent in the early 1980s as a result of much of our mineral and some other bulk commodity exports being handled by members of other unions such as the Australian Workers Union or through private ports. This very occurrence is a sad reflection on the productivity of Waterside Workers Federation members. </PARA>
<PARA> In recent years primary labour concerns have been the surplus brought about by the increasing development of containerisation and the rigidity of the permanent employment scheme. The flow-on effects, concession on wages and conditions, together with a 35-hour week, which was introduced in the stevedoring industry before any other section of the economy, made labour-intensive operations costly and hastened the introduction of container shipping operations. The recent experience of industry scrutiny under government structure reform committees suggests that innovation is not a feature of the industry. The existing waterfront scene has long been set, and it has inherent dangers. </PARA>
<PARA> As I said a few moments ago, the Waterside Workers Federation members are now handling less than a quarter of all cargo moved in and out of the country. Restrictive work practices, low productivity, overmanning and inefficient management produce an industry where cost overruns are in excess of $1 billion per year. Just imagine what the cost overruns would be if more than a quarter of all cargo was handled by the Waterside Workers Federation. In the light of such cost overruns, the Commission figure of a $620m per year benefit to the Australian community if the Australian waterfront becomes more productive seems very conservative. In fact, other participants in the Inter-State Commission's inquiry have offered much higher figures. The figure of $620m was the lowest estimate to emerge from the inquiry. The fact that Australian productivity levels tend to be lower than those of comparable countries is recognised even within the Australian Council of Trade Unions. </PARA>
<PARA> One factor worthy of further scrutiny is the high average age disability profile of our waterfront work force. Labour force statistics highlight the reasons why the industry exhibits low productivity. Some 53.5 per cent of A-register waterside workers are over the age of 50 and one-third of the work force is over 55 years of age. In my own State of South Australia almost half the Adelaide waterside work force exceeds the age of 55 years. In Sydney there has not been a single new recruit for some 15 years, since 1974, while in Adelaide it is some 22 years since there was a new recruit to the waterfront. Of course, the age structure has its flow-on in terms of disabilities as well. The debilitating effect on the industry of this profile is obvious when the combined effects of age and disability are seen against a trend demanding improved skills, training and labour flexibility. The only way these issues can be addressed is through early retirement and the recruitment of younger, properly trained employees, as recommended in the report. </PARA>
<PARA> All ports around Australia are subject to an exhaustive list of restrictive work practices. My own research has identified further rorts in my home State of South Australia in addition to those I outlined when last debating this issue in the Senate last year. In Adelaide, for instance, workers transferring between ports were refusing to commence work until their agreed travelling time had expired. As a result, other labour was forced to stand by at the commencement of a shift. Transfer labour now commences work upon arrival at the berth and receives payment from the stevedores from that time. However, they also require payment of the full travelling time. As a result, they are being paid double for the interim period. </PARA>
<PARA> Fixed minimum manning scales apply for almost every aspect of stevedoring operations. Minimum scales must be allocated if work is to occur. They are not flexible and cannot vary, except upwards, to reflect real operational requirements. As a result, manning throughout the industry is constantly in excess of what employers require. On certain types of ships' gear, such as swinging type derricks, where the equipment has one seat with three control levers and is designed for a single operator, the waterside workers demand two drivers, insisting this is necessary to utilise the three controls, despite the fact that the equipment is designed for one-man operation. Where forklifts transport unitised cargoes, two men on the wharf are employed as a minimum to assist the forklift. Their role is simple to stand by and replace any component of the unitised cargo which might fall off. Why is it necessary to employ at least two men in case something falls off the forklift when they perform no other function? In some cases hired-in equipment such as mobile cranes and front-end loaders are supplied with an attendant driver. In such circumstances it is the current practice that Waterside Workers Federation members be allocated to that type of equipment whether they are capable or proficient to drive that equipment or not. </PARA>
<PARA> Irrespective of who finally operates the particular item of equipment, there is a duplication in overall manning, doubling up the real driving requirements. This is an increasing restriction which is resulting in carriers not using stevedoring equipment due to its high cost. As a result, stevedoring companies are losing hiring charges which they would otherwise be able to gain from the utilisation of their equipment by road transport carriers. Heavy lift cranes are only driven by specialised crew which are supplied with the crane. However, the Waterside Workers Federation demands payment for waterside workers drivers as if they worked the vessel. In Adelaide, a specialised submersible vessel worked with no involvement of the Waterside Workers Federation. However, the Federation demanded payment for drivers. </PARA>
<PARA> Spelling is a common activity, with few exceptions, in Port Adelaide. The allocated hold complement on all vessels and commodities in the port adopt this practice where, at any given time, only half of the labour is actively working and the other half give themselves a spell. At Port Pirie, on bulk discharge operations, when a front-end loader is operating in the hold; a whistle man is employed in the hold in addition to a hatchman. On a signal from the hatchman, he activates a remote control warning device in the front-end loader to warn the driver that the grab is returning. The device, however, can be activated by the hatchman, thus obviating the necessity for a whistle man to be employed. However, no adjustments have been made since the introduction of the remote control device. </PARA>
<PARA> The rorts and cost impediments to our waterfront go on and on. That is why it is important that the recommendations of the Inter-State Commission's report be implemented. Its reforms are not radical except, it seems, for those in the Australian waterfront. Reform on the waterfront is crucial if serious impediments to the growth of Australia's export competing industries are not to occur. These industries that create wealth for all Australians have suffered for far too long at the hands of the waterfront. We can no longer afford the rorts and low productivity of our waterfront. If this Government does not act, then undoubtedly a future coalition government will. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It would appear that the word `productivity' has really been given a bit of overtime today. I do not believe in productivity for productivity's sake because the product of all the rubbish stated here this afternoon by the Opposition would not produce any benefit for anybody. The attitude of the current Government in its policy set down for the future in relation to labour market reforms and industrial relations agenda entitled `Labour Market Reform-the Industrial Relations Agenda' states that the elements of the Government's strategy for economic reform include:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>. . . a legislative framework which ensures the effective operation of the industrial relations system and promotes industrial harmony;</PARA>
<PARA>a wage system which facilitates micro-economic reform;</PARA>
<PARA>education and training arrangements to ensure the development of a more skilled work force . . .</PARA>
<PARA>Senator Chapman talked about one water-side worker or more who could not operate certain bits of machinery. This policy will take care of that problem. The current position has come about because of the lack of training provided by employers. The policy continues:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . the restructuring of awards to provide incentives for skill formation, and to help develop more flexible forms of work organisation;</PARA>
<PARA>the expansion of practices of information sharing and participation in decision making. </PARA>
<PARA>There is no way that one will succeed in reforming the waterfront or any other organisation unless what is required is understood by the work force and management. Therefore, they would be inclined to cooperate in the national interests. A change in attitude is required on the part of management, supervisors, workers and trade unions. </PARA>
<PARA> The policy goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA> An adversarial approach will not bring about the fundamental changes in workplace and management attitudes required for long term improvement in productivity and competitiveness or for continuing acceptance of new technology and other changes. </PARA>
<PARA>That is, union bashing will not succeed one little bit. The policy continues:</PARA>
<PARA> The Government will continue to use the Accord process as the foundation for ongoing structural adjustment and labour market reform. </PARA>
<PARA> The Accord is a process for addressing changing economic and industrial circumstances; it is not a prescriptive charter. </PARA>
<PARA> This is in contrast to overseas experiences where prices and incomes policies have failed because they have not been able to make this transition. The result will be a more flexible labour market and a better quality of life for employees. </PARA>
<PARA>That is our position. Let us examine some of the rubbish that has been stated this afternoon by those opposite. Senator Stone talked about people lifting their game and the question of productivity. Senator Alston talked about production and efficiency. He said that waterside workers had more money than they deserved. I have in front of me a document put out by the Waterside Workers Federation, which is directed at its members. It explains their position. It says that a waterside worker's basic rate is $429 per week, which is far below the average national wage. It is certainly far below what Senator Alston would be getting if he were operating as a practitioner in law. I do not know that I would give him a job. However, he may be fairly competent. He talked about no productivity being a disgrace. If we look at the documentation we find that the number of waterside workers has been reduced from about 25,000 in 1970 to 6,000 currently. In the last 20 years productivity has increased more than five times. I do not think that is a disgrace. It may well be argued that productivity could be more, but one cannot argue that and ignore the fact that management practices and attitudes have a lot to do with it. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Stone talked about the need to look at coastal shipping and rail. He ignored certain elements of costs involved in that area. Only last week I mentioned that road transport has an unfair advantage because of the tremendous road costs borne by the taxpayer, whereas the rail industry has to provide its own maintenance, its own permanent way. There is no doubt about that. It is an unfair criticism of the railway system. I believe the railways can be efficient. Originally they were saddled with two different gauges, in New South Wales and Victoria, and later a third, Queensland, with a 3 foot 6 inch gauge. If that is a prescription for efficiency, I will have to re-think my position. I do not think that would be the case. </PARA>
<PARA> What more do those opposite want in regard to shipping? The seamen have accepted lesser conditions in many instances. Manning has been drastically reduced on coastal shipping. Do those opposite want our seamen to work like those who work on ships from ports that are used as tax havens and tax rorts? Do those opposite want our seamen to sail rust buckets, for about $20 a week, in which their lives are at stake when it is possible that they go down at sea with no trace? No, they do not want to do that. This is the correct process. It is not helped by abuse from those people opposite. Ship owners say that there has been a big change in industrial relations and that they are fairly happy with the way that the Seamen's Union of Australia is dealing with a real problem that certainly needs to be looked at. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Chapman talked about the lack of guts and the fact that we should work together. In terms of floating the dollar, de-regulating banking-we will de-regulate wheat and sugar-this Government has shown a lot more guts than the Liberal-National Party. Those opposite wanted to do it but they never had the guts. They should not talk about guts because they do not have any. People can see what has happened. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Alston talked about feather-bedding and the darg system. He should know that the darg system was introduced by employers; not by the Waterside Workers Federation of Australia. It was introduced years ago to get higher productivity. He talked about featherbedding-people looking after their own interests. I can assure him that if I were a waterside worker and my ability to provide food and lodgings for my family and an education for my children meant that I had to withstand certain changes in my industry and the only thing going for them was that they were in the national interest, and the national interest did not care about me, I would make a stand too. We talk about the national interest but we do not talk about what we will do for those people who will lose their jobs and how we will distribute and re-allocate all the savings amongst the work force and the general community. In many cases, higher productivity has put more profits into the hands of the employers. It has not helped the community at all. </PARA>
<PARA> It was interesting to hear Senator Alston talk about featherbedding. I have known many people working in the field of law. Many of them are very fine people. Some I have not particularly liked. But I noticed the other day that legal practitioners were outraged when someone suggested that in New South Wales solicitors and barristers were really not needed in many cases involving up to $5,000. It was said that this was outrageous: how could one take away the right of people to have lawyers represent them in the courts? I do not knock that. They have a right to argue that but Senator Alston had better think about it. He should not be a hypocrite by suggesting one approach when it comes to the waterside workers and another approach when it comes to legal practitioners. </PARA>
<PARA> There was talk about the national interest and the national debt that was increasing. I have some figures in front of me which show that in the three months to November 1988 car imports amounted to $500.8m, as against $173.2m in the same period last year. The latest new motor vehicle registration figures show that the largest increase in numbers of cars imported has occurred for luxury vehicles. I assure honourable senators that the wharfies are not buying the luxury vehicles; I suggest that the employers are-the very people that Senator Alston and all those opposite represent. And they worry about the national debt! Those opposite should ask their people to stop buying Mercedes-Benzes and Rolls-Royces. We, on this side of the chamber, will keep buying Fords and Holdens that are made in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> Those opposite talk about enterprise unions. Enterprise unions are only a way to deny workers access to a union which can give them the expertise which employer organisations give to employers. Employers who have millions of dollars in resources can employ skilled and trained people in industrial relations and negotiations, but those opposite want shop stewards with no access to any of those things to try to match them. It is no match at all. I have no problem with the idea of having a proper organisation within the enterprise, but it must be linked up with and be part of a trade union on an industry basis so that people can have a fair go and no-one is taken advantage of. </PARA>
<PARA> Even before this report was brought down, we had a media release by Tas Bull, the National Secretary of the Waterside Workers Federation. One Opposition senator said today that Tas Bull and the Australian Council of Trade Unions rejected this report. I took that to mean that it needs a lot of working over and that there are many things it contains that the union does not accept, but I find it difficult to accept that the report contains suggestions made by the unions. If that is the case, it would be a little silly to think that the unions are rejecting such proposals. I believe that the unions are saying that the report needs a lot of working over. Tas Bull says in the press release:</PARA>
<PARA>To ensure that debate on waterfront restructuring is full and broad-ranging, the Waterside Workers' Federation of Australia (WWF) is putting together comprehensive briefing papers about what needs to happen on the waterfront and why. A working version of these papers was released to the media today. </PARA>
<PARA> The National Farmers Federation and some other industry groups have been lobbying hard to influence the outcome of the Investigation. </PARA>
<PARA>There is nothing wrong with that at all. Tas Bull also says:</PARA>
<PARA>The National Farmers Federation, the Association of Employers of Waterside Labour and others would like to force changes which serve their own interests. They are seeking to scapegoat the unions for all the industry's inefficiencies, in some cases including their own. </PARA>
<PARA> Self-serving solutions are not the answer. </PARA>
<PARA>He goes on to talk about a desperate need for rejuvenation. He talks about some of the successes which have come about as a result of joint ventures, Mackay being one and others have been mentioned. He was kind enough to include a letter from one of his satisfied customers. There do not seem to be any of those on the other side of the House. One of the customers wrote:</PARA>
<PARA>You often read criticisms of waterside workers . . . so it is therefore particularly gratifying that I am able to write to you to applaud you and your men associated with the Port of Geelong stevedoring company for the excellent effort in loading the `Professor Popov'. Everything from the lack of damage, to the loading rates was more than you could reasonably expect . . . I can only say once again how particularly pleased we were for the efforts that everybody put into it. Mike Murray, Managing Director, International Food Processing. </PARA>
<PARA>The unions also put in a graph which showed that 50 per cent of waterside workers were over 50 years of age, 32 per cent over 55. It dealt with the fact that there had not been any new waterside workers brought into the industry since back in the 1970s and that that needed to be done. The unions did not wait for the report before making suggestions as to what was needed. The union agrees with those sorts of things. But the question the unions asked themselves was, `Why should we allow these changes to take place totally against the interests of our members and be expected to carry the burden for the whole community and to provide higher profits for the employer?'. The Waterside Workers Federation's document says:</PARA>
<PARA> The WWF has been working with various government bodies over the past two years to reform the waterfront. Further, we have taken initiatives to introduce joint stevedoring ventures and productivity schemes. It is the Federation which is pressing for change. </PARA>
<PARA>The Federation said that the unions are not mucking about but are pressing for change and want it to happen. The document issued by the Federation went on to mention the seven ports around Australia which operate joint ventures. The Federation also mentioned a fresh approach to fruit exports. It said that after it had made changes the fruit all arrived in perfect condition and that there was no deterioration at all-normally, the deterioration figure is 15 per cent. What happened was that the wharfies visited Shepparton fruit growers and as a follow-up the farmers came to the wharves, because both felt that they could profit by working together. They hit on a simple formula-more coordination over delivery and loading, more trade and more jobs. The outcome has been a boost to Australian fruit exporters, according to the Executive Director of the Northern Victorian Fruit Growers Association. He said:</PARA>
<PARA> If the fruit keeps arriving in Europe in as good a condition as this lot we'll be very, very pleased . . . Now thanks to the cooperation of the shippers and the union we're getting a good slice of the overseas market. </PARA>
<PARA>That is an example of where the waterside workers took the initiative. Quite calmly, they went and talked to the farmers and the farmers indicated that perhaps they had not done all the things they needed to do. One cannot put rotten fruit on the wharves and then blame the wharfies if it is crook. The farmers realised that the fruit needed to be in good condition. They provided it in that condition, and they benefit, as does the community. It is a case in which there is mutual benefit. But that is not what the report suggests. Everything that it suggests certainly will not be mutually beneficial. The document continues:</PARA>
<PARA>While there continues to be real problems on the waterfront it is clear that substantial progress has already been achieved. This progress could not have been achieved without the cooperation of the waterfront unions, including the Waterside Workers' Federation and their recognition of the need to maximise competitiveness in order to improve job security and increase employment opportunities for union members. </PARA>
<PARA>Those are the sorts of attitudes that people have. It is an attitude which was shared by Ralph Willis, the Minister for Industrial Relations, in 1988. I do not want to go on any further, but my last plea is that we should go forward together. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I enter this debate because of my concern about the inefficient waterfront industry in Australia, and especially on the eastern coast, which greatly affects the rural industries throughout the country, especially the wheat marketing industry. At present this Government is trying to restructure marketing in the wheat industry-a system which has operated successfully for 42 years. At the same time the Government is trying to impose on the industry proposals which the Government will not apply to itself. Mr Kerin, the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, would like wheat farmers in this country to take on measures that will reduce their income, and yet the Minister and his colleagues will do nothing about the waterfront. There is no mention of cost cutting measures that are imposed on farmers.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This afternoon the Senate heard a tirade from Senator Button during Question Time about the coalition in Opposition failing to come to an agreement on the deregulation of the domestic market, and he referred to the Liberal Party falling into National Party thinking. Let me tell Senator Button that we are very capable of coming to our own decision on wheat marketing without any interference or suggestions from him. What is more, the Liberal Party represents as many wheat growers as do the Nationals, and together we will work the problem out. </PARA>
<PARA> The difference between the waterfront industry, about which this Government will do nothing as long as it can get away with it, and the wheat industry is that the wheat industry has no rorts. There are none of the rorts that one finds on the wharves-rorts which have been mentioned by several speakers in this debate. Our wheat industry is the most efficient wheat industry in the world. If honourable senators want confirmation of that fact, they should read the Hansard report of today's proceedings. Who said that the Australian wheat industry is the most efficient in the world? It was said by Senator Gareth Evans during Question Time, in answer to a Dorothy Dixer from his own front bench. Honourable senators can read that for themselves when that report appears. The big differences between the two industries is that there are no rorts in the wheat industry, and certainly one finds those rorts operating on the waterfront. The McColl Royal Commission into Grain Storage, Handling and Transport found that savings of $10 to $12 per tonne could be achieved if some of its reforms were implemented. That also included some freight. </PARA>
<PARA> I have seen some of the rorts operating in Fremantle. I have watched self-loading ships and have seen men scattered everywhere-men who fill in their time when in fact they are not needed. The report of the Inter-State Commission on waterfront investigation has found that the waterfront of Australia is the most imperfect marketing system that one could ever find. There is inefficiency of management, lack of general efficiency and poor work force training. Senator Burns set out the reasons why there is a lack of training, but he thought that it was the employers who were not carrying out the training task. In all sorts of jobs, be they professional, technical or labouring, one expects some on the job training; but the employers cannot be expected to take that on board when, for example, a fellow applies for a job to drive a crane or a truck. One expects that he has some knowledge of that before he arrives. This Government has always said that the Australian work force in other areas should be trained before we take trained personnel from overseas, but I am afraid that in Australia there are too many people who do not want to be trained. </PARA>
<PARA> We see introspective industrial attitudes, as my colleagues have pointed out. There is poor information for users and poor links in transport. I have seen many times, as have many honourable senators in the chamber right now, road transports down at the wharves waiting to load or unload containers. In the morning 30 or 40 trucks will be lined up and those same figures of 30 or 40 trucks will still be lined up even towards knock-off time in the afternoon. It is beyond all comprehension why the wharves cannot put in place a booking system so the transport operators can get an approximate time at which they may be loaded or unloaded. It has been asked for, but that request has been refused time and time again. These unions want to waste the time of these 30 truck operators, who have to wait at the gate until a quarter to four or a quarter past four, or whatever early time the waterfront workers knock off in the afternoon, just hoping that they may get loaded or unloaded. When the gates shut they have to drive away and come back and get in the queue the next morning. It is thoroughly inefficient. </PARA>
<PARA> There is an imbalance in the use of facilities. For weeks on end facilities may be underused. Then when a couple of ships are in at the same time the waterfront is snowed under. But those involved do not try in any way whatsoever to meet the demand. That keeps others waiting, and it is all because of the abuse of a monopoly power. I can give a good example of a small company that exported some cottonseed out of the port of Brisbane. This company contracted to supply 1,500 tonnes of cottonseed to a client in Saudi Arabia. Although this seemed to be a fairly straightforward exporting initiative, the company experienced a number of problems. First, delays in unloading the ship prior to the commencement of loading resulted in the company becoming liable for expenses of $4,000 for labour placed on standby, awaiting the opportunity to load. Secondly, the actual loading rate was well below that initially indicated by the stevedoring company, so that 11 shifts of labour were used instead of the four shifts originally estimated. In addition, the company had to provide about $4,500 worth of plywood to resolve a safety dispute involving the loading operation. Thirdly, the much slower than expected loading rate made the company liable for ship demurrage charges of $21,600. The total cost of the loading operation at the wharf, including stevedoring, plywood and demurrage, came to $92,800, or $62 a tonne. The initial estimate by the stevedoring company was $23 a tonne. So that figure was multiplied several times. That is what we get with an abuse of monopoly power. </PARA>
<PARA> The Commission's report did recommend that in order to become efficient the waterfront work force around Australia should shed 3,000 workers over the next three years. The report advises that in the meantime 1,000 people under the age of 30 years should be recruited. This will mean an effective drop in the work force from approximately 7,000 men, and perhaps women, to 5,000. The new people will then be trained in the skills required. We certainly need to have multi-skilled people so they can move, for example, from a crane to a front-end loader. There is also an advantage in having younger people because they can be trained more readily. We have all heard the old saying that you cannot teach an old dog new tricks, and that is especially the case if the old dog does not want to learn them. We have had many examples of that this afternoon. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Some are getting that way-including myself. The point is that not only will we have people more willing to learn, but also they will be more adaptable. In the main, they will also be fitter. As the report said, the average age of workers in our ports around Australia is over 50, and a lot are over 55; many of them should not be working because of medical conditions.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The report did mention-this is most important in industries involved in bulk grain handling terminals; industries with which I am involved-that bulk terminals should operate as one unit and labour should be employed by that unit. I refer in particular to the bulk wheat terminals around Australia, which could work far more efficiently. When the new port was built just below Fremantle in the early 1970s it operated quite successfully until the Waterside Workers Federation decided to take over representation there. We have had no end of trouble since. If the terminals could handle their own labour and that labour were represented by a less militant union, I would say the wheat industry would be far better off. We have a far better chance of the smaller ports around Western Australia being in a much better situation, but unfortunately those ports are short in draught capabilities and only smaller vessels can be accommodated. The bigger ships can be loaded with a certain amount of cargo but then they have to go to Kwinana to finish the loading. </PARA>
<PARA> This report points out that unfortunately it will cost $158m over the next three years to implement the recommendations. I believe that $158m is not an amount that employers, and probably the Government of Australia, should have to pick up, because of the way things have gone over the years and the rorts and systems that have brought about the present situation. The report also tells us that there could be a saving of approximately $620m a year once those measures have been put into place. Much as I dislike the public purse picking up the cost, I believe that in this case it should be picked up so that we may eventually get over these problems and save $620m a year. </PARA>
<PARA> I mentioned earlier that Senator Button had said during Question Time that the Opposition was not willing to deregulate the domestic wheat market but wanted to deregulate the waterfront. The coalition came to the position that we would, under certain circumstances, support deregulation of the domestic market if the Government were willing to put into place certain measures under which the waterfront and other areas would be fixed up. This afternoon the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) made a statement to try to appease our side, but I do not know whether really it will introduce measures that exempt the Australian Wheat Board from State regulations that impede the efficient storage, handling, transport and marketing of grain being traded interstate or overseas. He knows as well as I do that trucks will not be able physically to move all of that wheat even if we deregulate road transport. The wheat mostly has to be moved by rail. The Government also has to look at keeping wheat on rail. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Senate is debating the following urgency motion:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The need for immediate action by the Government to introduce reforms which will ensure that the Australian waterfront becomes efficient and productive instead of being a national burden and impediment to internationally competitive economic activities. </PARA>
<PARA>I think the importance of this subject cannot be overstated. We are a great trading nation. But, frankly, at the moment we are not doing very well. Our current account deficit is more than $14,000m a year and is going up by between $1,000m and $1,500m each month. We desperately need to improve our exports. As an integral part of improving the competitiveness of our exports, we must improve the performance of our ports. It is essential to our survival that we do so. </PARA>
<PARA> Not only that, our ports are also very important in terms of interstate traffic. We are a very scattered industrial community. If our industries are to be efficient, we need to be able to move products cheaply, quickly and reliably between our scattered centres. But we cannot do that at the moment. The costs are appalling. It is cheaper to ship a given quantity of freight from Tasmania to Europe than it is from Tasmania to Melbourne. We cannot be internationally competitive if this is the way our ports as well as our very inefficient coastal shipping carry on. </PARA>
<PARA> It is not only a question of costs; it is also a question of reliability. Our exporters will lose orders if they are unreliable in respect of delivery. In some parts of Asia the only news that seems to come through about Australia is contained in the lists of the current strikes in Australia that are affecting the country concerned. We have a very unenviable reputation as a reliable deliverer of goods of any sort. We are very unfavourably regarded as a suitable supplier by many countries whose manufacturing industries depend for their efficiency on keeping their stockpiles low. </PARA>
<PARA> We have, regrettably, the reputation for having the worst and the least reliable ports in the developed world. Some countries insist that extra insurance be taken out before their ships come to Australia. They even advise their ship owners not to trade with Australia because of the very poor standard of our ports. This matter, in the interests of the whole Australian community and the efficiency of the Australian economy, must be tackled. It has been estimated, I think accurately, that for every dollar we improve the efficiency of our ports, through every dollar that we can save through increased efficiency, the national product would go up by $2. It is not a matter of looking for jobs for the boys on the wharves. If we can increase the efficiency of our ports, our whole industrial efficiency and our gross national product will rise $2 for every $1 we save. </PARA>
<PARA> It has also been estimated that 20 per cent of the $11 1/2 billion we spend on transporting and handling exports and imports could be saved by just bringing our standards up to those of our international competitors. This, of course, comes back again to the question of reliability. The potential savings from increased reliability are very great. Unreliability comes not only from sheer bloody-mindedness. Political strikes are also a big factor, as are demarcation disputes. The non-involvement of our work force on the wharves is a particular factor in the success or failure of the enterprise they are involved in. Lack of competition and lack of involvement are fatal to efficiency. </PARA>
<PARA> Even now we have the absurd situation of containers being sent by road along the Hume Highway from Melbourne to Sydney. This is an absurd way to move a container. The reason for this is the high cost of coastal shipping and the very high costs and very low level of reliability of our port handling facilities. People prefer to send containers by road, which is reasonably competitive and efficient, rather than being involved in our coastal shipping and port handling facilities. Nevertheless, this is a very inefficient and unsuitable way of transporting containers. If only we had efficient coastal shipping; if only we had efficient ports. </PARA>
<PARA> The Inter-State Commission report lists many of the rorts and inefficiencies which have been mentioned many times in this debate. I certainly do not intend to go through them in detail. I will just mention a couple of examples of the problems we have. The average throughput per employee in an American grain handling terminal is 100,000 tonnes. In Sydney, using the same equipment, the throughput per employee is 17,000 tonnes; in Newcastle it is 21,000. This compares with 100,000 tonnes using the same equipment in America. We just cannot afford to let this sort of thing continue. </PARA>
<PARA> I will give the Senate another example of the sort of productivity that we are not getting. Container cranes are almost identical around the world. For 100 containers handled on Australian wharves at a given time, New Zealand handles 138, the United Kingdom 141, northern Europe an average of 214, North America 250 and Japan 312. Using the same equipment, the Japanese load and unload containers three times as fast as we do. Australia cannot possibly remain competitive under such a situation. </PARA>
<PARA> As I said, I do not want to list all of the many rorts and inefficiencies that are listed by the Inter-State Commission. I want to give the Senate just one more example. The enforced use of gangway watchmen and hatchmen has nothing to do with safety. If the work of a watchman is required, it is a matter for the ships crews, which in the case of our coastal shipping are already heavily overmanned as it is. There is no necessity for them. At present, they are provided by regulation or union demand at very considerable cost. As I said, there is no need for them. They are just as useless as Melbourne suburban railway guards, who have not had a job to fulfil for 25 years but who have continued as a result of historical accident. There are 948 unnecessary gangway watchmen and hatchmen around Australia. These men, who have no job to do at all, are being paid for ultimately by the Australian community. </PARA>
<PARA> A month ago a much publicised summit on the waterfront was called by the Government. That summit did not achieve anything. In fact, the result was a drop in productivity, which has not yet come back to what it was before the summit. There have also been extra delays since the summit at an average of two days extra per ship. The so-called summit-the much heralded summit-just did not achieve anything. Of course, the Government's solution to problems is to talk about them or `address' them, as it says, and not do anything. </PARA>
<PARA> At Question Time today the Leader of the Government in the Senate, Senator Button, made a remark about the Liberal-National Party coalition not doing anything about the wharves. Two things can be said about that. I accept that the wharves have been in an unsatisfactory state for many years. This is not a sudden occurrence of the last few years. But we now have a crisis in our balance of payments. The pressure to do something, which was always there, is now urgent and it is time for the government of the day, of whatever political colour, to take action to deal with the crises as they arise. As a matter of fact, there were two inquiries during the term of the Fraser Government. I would be the first to say, as I said at the time, that they did not go far enough or deeply enough into the real problems on the wharves. In response to what Senator Button has said, the recommendations of these two inquiries were promptly implemented. What did the Australian Labor Party do about them? It opposed them step by step, all the way. But if this Government is now prepared to take action to sort out the mess on the wharves, real and effective action, I can assure the honourable senator that we will be supporting it. We want to see something done in the national interest about the crisis on our wharves. </PARA>
<PARA> The Inter-State Commission has recommended a number of fairly radical proposals to try to solve this long-running and disastrous problem. For instance, it recommends the introduction of casual labour. Well, that is common right throughout the rest of industry. If a firm has varying loads, if it has full employment, it has standard people to cover the standard load, and employs casual labour to deal with the extras. What is so extraordinary about that? The attitude of the Waterside Workers Federation of Australia is, as far as can be established, `No way!'. The second recommendation of importance is an end to the so-called general employment system, that is, the pool. Instead, waterside workers should work for the particular enterprise they are being employed by. This again is elementary throughout the rest of Australian industry and it does at least give some chance of developing a feeling among the people working for an enterprise that their future and their standards are bound up with the efficiency of that enterprise. That is the direction in which we must move. What is the attitude of the Waterside Workers Federation? In no way will that be agreed to. What is the attitude of the Government? We do not know yet, but I am certain that it will not do much about it. </PARA>
<PARA> The next recommendation is that the employment arrangements of the waterfront industry can be restructured to allow more competition. The only way to break down the exploitation of monopolies is either by legislation, if it can be introduced and enforced, or by introducing competition. Competition is by far the most effective way of doing it. I think we must look for ways in which we can introduce proper competition on the waterfront so that the efficient terminals get more business and the inefficient ones get less. Ultimately that is the only way in which we are going to improve efficiency on the waterfront.</PARA>
<PARA> The Commission also recommends the ending of the waterside workers' monopoly and, in particular, that the people who work on bulk handling facilities should be employees working for the bulk handling terminals and, as far as I can gather from the recommendations, members of a separate union. That is entirely sensible. That is the way in which we must go. We cannot continue with our bulk handling terminals working at one-fifth of the level per employee of American ones. The Commission also recommends a gradual reduction in the average age of the stevedoring work force. It is presently over 50 years of age. I do not accept, as Senator Button seems to be implying, that people over the age of 50 cannot be usefully employed. Nevertheless, for hard manual labour it is perhaps much too high as an average age. The idea of a retirement or redundancy package to encourage people over the age of 50, who are frequently not fully fit, to leave the industry and to recruit young employees is one I am sure we should all support. My worry is that the Government will put this, as it has put virtually all the other micro-economic reforms, in the too hard basket. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Today we are in effect debating a report from the Inter-State Commission entitled Waterfront Investigation, Conclusions and Recommendations. Whether or not we agree with the conclusions and recommendations, at least the report should be used as a basis for discussion and proper analysis of what might be done on the waterfront. Having listened to the debate, unfortunately it seems to me that the Opposition has not used this debate as a basis for developing a strategy to answer the problems on the wharves. It has used it to present a litany of the evils of the waterside workers. The problems, according to the Opposition, will be solved if we can somehow put leg irons around the waterside workers and use the whip to scourge them so as to stop their so-called rorts. To return to the convict days of old, all the problems were cast upon the people in chains, the people actually doing the work. There was nothing wrong with the New South Wales Corps, the system or anything else; the only people who could be blamed were those who were doing the work. That, of course, was not the approach taken by this report.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The first point of the seven main elements which this strategy describes is that we, as a nation, should achieve effective management and a well motivated work force. The Opposition's approach to obtaining a well motivated work force is to go down to the wharves and say to anybody who is not under 30, `You have to leave because you are too old', or to say, `For years you have been engaged in several rorts. You have never been able to work well; you have never done as much work as people overseas, whether in Japan or the United Kingdom. In fact, you are pretty unsatisfactory human beings'. That is the approach the Opposition takes. It will say that to the waterside workers and then add, `Having told you these things, we now expect you to be well motivated. You really will not mind being called the scum of the earth, the lowest of the low, people who earn more money than they ought to. You ought to accept what we well-motivated people from the National Party and the Liberal Party in the Senate have to say as we really know how you ought to work. We are telling you how to do it. Now we want you to go away and become well motivated'. </PARA>
<PARA> The situation on the waterfront has developed over many years. Although there are faults on the waterfront, and it must be accepted that there are many, they did not appear during the period that this Government has been in office but at a time when the Liberal Party and the National Party of Australia pursued an economic and trading policy whereby we sold commodities overseas and imported manufactured goods. That is still the situation. That is a legacy from the past which is still with us today. The situation on the waterfront is a great illustration of that because Australia brings in many more container loads of manufactured goods than it sends out. In fact there has been a build-up of containers. That is not a problem that has been created by the waterside workers. It has been created by the way industry has been developed in Australia over many years. Not only has industry developed that way, but the attitude that has developed in that industrial scene has been reflected amongst those at the waterfront. Senator Hamer asked: What has this Government done? I will tell him what this Government has done. Before I do so I will read from page 124 of the first volume of the report. It states:</PARA>
<PARA>During its investigation the Commission was encouraged by the way in which the main parties in the waterfront industry appear to accept the need for fundamental change. </PARA>
<PARA>That is what the Commission found. All the main parties, including the employers and the employees, accepted the need for fundamental change. That is not a statement consistent with the sort of libel that has been placed upon the waterside workers by the Opposition up until now. It continues:</PARA>
<PARA>This is not to say that all parties agree on all of the components of the necessary changes. </PARA>
<PARA>The report goes on-this is the part I want to emphasise-to say:</PARA>
<PARA>But a climate does now exist in which it is practicable to move forward and revitalise the waterfront industry. </PARA>
<PARA>That statement could not have been made when the Opposition was in government; it could never have been made at the time this Government came into power in March 1983, but it can be made now. That is the answer not only to the waterfront, but also to industry and to the development of commodity production and to secondary production in this country. The clue is that there has to be a new climate, a new culture, a new attitude developed amongst managers and workers. That is happening, and it has happened under this Government. There is much optimism in that statement about the course this Government has pursued through an accord with the unions, through a proper approach to unions, through a proper approach to management, through a proper approach to those who take part in production-that is the companies and the people who manage and plan-and through a proper approach to those who work under them. This proper cooperation will lead, and has led, to vast increases in productivity. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me give an illustration. Most illustrations that have been given today have been anecdotal. There has been a swapping of stories. The Opposition gives stories about how dreadful it is. The people on this side give stories about how good it really is. I will illustrate how the waterside workers have accepted a quite big drop in wages over the years for an increase in the tonnage handled per man. I am not saying that this illustration proves that things are anywhere near perfect, but it illustrates that if a proper approach is taken a climate can be formed where the reform can take place. The illustration is that in the early 1970s, the waterside workers were paid according to a formula which in effect was 93.75 per cent of the gross national average wage for the adult male unit. That was adjusted every three months in accordance with the average male wage paid over that time. During the Whitlam period, wage indexation was introduced and the Waterside Workers Federation of Australia went along with that, but then there was a wage freeze and we had the development of the accord. The fact is that if the 93.75 per cent formula had applied to the general hands on the waterside throughout that period-that is from when it was introduced in the early 1970s until now-the general hands would now be getting $90 more than what they get. There has been, therefore, according to that illustration, an acceptance of the need for a moderation of the increase in wages and an understanding that there had to be an increase in tonnage. That is an illustration of the fact that if the problems on the wharf are approached in a cooperative way, in a way which does not denigrate one side, in a way which respects the approach taken by all sides, there is hope of getting out of this problem. </PARA>
<PARA> To go on to another point, much has been made about the monopoly union power on the wharf. Let us look at that. The first thing to remember, as has been said already, is that the waterfront is run, in theory at least, by a number of stevedoring companies, all of which are privately owned. This is an industry that has developed as a private industry over the years. It is an industry which has employed labour on the basis that it will no doubt help each stevedoring company in competition with the others. Much has been made in the report about the monopoly powers of the Waterside Workers Federation. In the same breath there has been much criticism of demarcation disputes on the wharves. They are inconsistent statements. If we are going to have unions in competition on the wharf, we are certainly going to get down to a series of demarcation disputes which, I happen to think, are the most destructive of all strikes. The employer cannot do much about these disputes. If we are going to run a centralised wage-fixing system, if we are going to run an industrial relations system as we have since 1904 and before Australia became a Federation, we have to have unions covering particular groups of employees. That is the way the system is run and by and large it has run well. As has been pointed out in this report, there has been a diminution in industrial disputes on the wharves since the Waterside Workers Federation obtained greater coverage early this decade. Many of the illustrations put forward by the Opposition to show that things are working badly are, in fact, signs that things are working a lot better than they did in the 1950s, the 1960s and the 1970s, or when it was in government. That is the real comparison to make. How do things stand now compared to how things were at the end of the previous Government's term in office? I notice that Senator Michael Baume will speak next. If we compare the situation now with what it was at the time when the Opposition was in government, we will see that the situation is much better, that the tonnage per man is greater, that the wages are more moderate, that strikes are down and that demarcation disputes are much more modified. The exciting thing about all this is that there is hope, as this report says, that things will improve rapidly. When we look for improvement we are not to look, simply as has been done by the Opposition, at changes in the attitude of unions, at changes in the work that they do and at the productivity. The whole industry must be looked at. In that context, the union's contribution must be looked for and demanded just as the contribution from the employers must be looked at and demanded. It is a complex problem. Finally, I will quote from page 123 of the first volume of the report as it illustrates that very point. It says:</PARA>
<PARA>The evidence to the Commission on many matters such as inefficient work practices, unsatisfactory industrial relations, ineffective supervision and management, higher costs and widespread unreliability all indicate that fundamental rather than incremental change is required. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am always interested to follow Senator Cooney, not necessarily because he occasionally makes some remarkable Freudian slips which reflect reality, such as his comment, `as we come to the end of the Hawke Government', but because Senator Cooney has almost a natural honesty, which means that when he has an impossible case to argue his argument demonstrates that it is an impossible case. The reality that emerges from Senator Cooney's point is that there is a clear demand on this Government to respond positively to this report and not to take its riding instructions from the Australian Council of Trade Unions, those instructions already having been given by Mr Tas Bull of the Waterside Workers Federation of Australia, who says he has the support of the ACTU in this matter. Everything Senator Cooney said on behalf of the Australian Labor Party points to the need for this Government to take action to correct the disastrous situation on the waterfront.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is totally wrong for Senator Cooney to say that the only people the Opposition seems to be criticising are the workers themselves and that we are putting the blame on the workers for everything. I stress to Senator Cooney that the Waterside Workers Federation has been under solid attack from this side of the chamber for one very simple reason: its total, outright and disgraceful rejection of the Inter-State Commission report, its irresponsible damning of this report, its instructions to the Government not to act on this report in any effective way. When a union behaves as irresponsibly as that and is half-heartedly defended by Senator Cooney, then it does not deserve to face anything less than severe criticism in this chamber. Let us look at the sorts of problems the union has got itself into in this matter. This report made an examination of industrial disputes in the period from 1 December 1988 to 1 February of this year. This was just a brief two-month period to examine whether all the reports of irresponsible behaviour on the wharves were accurate. This was the conclusion in the report:</PARA>
<PARA>Most disputes were, if not spurious in intent, at least questionable and they illustrate a degree of failure in dispute-settlement procedures as well as seeming indifference to the consequences of their actions on the part of labour involved. </PARA>
<PARA>That is absolutely damning of the unions involved, which are responding to this report by saying that nothing should be done along the lines of the recommendations. They are instructing this Government to maintain a situation in which these unions can behave irresponsibly and get excessive money in some instances for not producing the goods. Some of these industrial disputes are incredible, and I recommend that people read pages 393 to 409 of the report. One of the disputes referred to on these pages related to holding up a ship because it dared to have South African cargo on it. The report reveals that the suggestion that such protest action may harm the wrong parties was given weight by the comment of the ship's agents, who stated:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . a greater part of the ship's alleged South African cargo was in fact Mozambican tobacco, railed south and shipped from South Africa because of the poor state of Mozambique's main port. </PARA>
<PARA>Apart from anything else-the serious question of who is running our foreign policy, Tas Bull and the Waterside Workers Federation or Mr Hawke and Senator Evans-the fact is that this silly and irresponsible action by the Waterside Workers Federation and other waterside unions that have at times joined in this kind of black ban in effect hurt the people who are least capable of withstanding that hurt-the Mozambicans. The stevedoring cost of that dispute was $20,000, excluding quarantine costs. The demurrage on the ship involved, sitting idly doing nothing, was in addition. The fact is that this was no industrial matter at all. This was a political issue. Of course, many things hide behind health issues. There is another instance on which the report states:</PARA>
<PARA>This case is typical of many of the safety disputes that occur on the Australian waterfront regularly, and is indicative of the extremism exercised by sections of the WWF in an endeavour to avoid having to work. </PARA>
<PARA> It is the type of attitudinal behaviour which creates the unreliability for which the Australian waterfront is infamous. </PARA>
<PARA>Strangely, it is the union that is responsible for this kind of behaviour which is attacking this report. This Government has to have the intestinal fortitude to stand up to it. There was another case-case study No. 5-where there had been an agreement to have a specified level of productivity. If the men did their work satisfactorily and got enough goods unloaded they could then go. As a result, when the men who had done their work went all the other gangs said, `Well, if they can go so can we'. But they had not entered into such an agreement and had not done such work. This is just ludicrous and is explained in many cases in the report. I repeat the conclusion from the report:</PARA>
<PARA>Most disputes were, if not spurious in intent, at least questionable, and they illustrate a degree of failure in dispute-settlement procedures as well as seeming indifference to the consequences of their actions on the part of labour involved. </PARA>
<PARA>That is one of the reasons why we need radical reform of the waterfront. The question also seriously affects the coal loading industry, particularly on the south coast of New South Wales. It is in New South Wales that the coal loading industry is demonstrated by this report to be totally and monumentally inefficient. A study was undertaken by the Inter-State Commission which identified a number of factors influencing the performance and costs associated with the domestic transport, handling and loading of coal at the terminals investigated. Those were Port Melbourne, Balmain, Newcastle, Gladstone, Dalrymple Bay and Hay Point. Basically, they found that in New South Wales in particular it was a disaster. The report says:</PARA>
<PARA>The consultant identified a number of factors influencing the performance and costs associated with the domestic transport, handling and loading of coal at the terminals investigated. First, the consultant considered that many port and ancillary charges may be based upon inappropriate pricing mechanisms. </PARA>
<PARA>It went on to outline what they were. It continued:</PARA>
<PARA>Second, employment and industrial relations factors underlie many differences in the operational and financial performance of the coal terminals investigated. </PARA>
<PARA>It noted:</PARA>
<PARA> the level of manning at the New South Wales terminals, which is substantially greater than that at the Queensland facilities;</PARA>
<PARA> the level of manning at terminals owned and operated by the Maritime Services Board, which is significantly greater than employment levels at privately owned Newcastle facilities (even though the throughput at the public facilities is less than that at the privately operated terminals);</PARA>
<PARA> the current Maritime Services Board service agreements at Port Waratah and the Kooragang Coal Loader, which are operated by a pool of Maritime Services Board employees;</PARA>
<PARA> the large number of unions representing New South Wales coal employees, which inhibits agreement between employees and management;</PARA>
<PARA> the enforced use of gangway watchmen and hatchmen, which appears to have been maintained as a result of historical practice rather than as an operational or safety requirement of contemporary bulk shipping;</PARA>
<PARA> the absence of flexibility, efficiency and skill clauses in particular industrial awards and agreements;</PARA>
<PARA> industry-based rather than company-based employment at some loaders;</PARA>
<PARA> restrictive work practices (for example, minimum working hours and wage requirements at Balmain);</PARA>
<PARA> some union benefits derived from the expedient settlement of industrial disputes in the past. </PARA>
<PARA>Third, in some ports the regulations require use of pilots for foreign-flag vessels without recognition that many coal ships are dedicated to a particular trade and the ships masters have excellent knowledge of local port conditions.</PARA>
<PARA>It continued:</PARA>
<PARA>Finally, the high level of road and rail transport rates, unsatisfactory receival facilities at some terminals, and limitations on rail movements resulting from priority being given to passenger services significantly affect costs: land transport costs constitute approximately 30 per cent and 25 per cent respectively of New South Wales and Queensland export prices. </PARA>
<PARA>That is intolerably high, and many honourable senators in this chamber have been commenting on this for quite some time. </PARA>
<PARA> In relation to ownership and administration of loaders, the report states:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . the consultant suggested that in view of the poor performance of Maritime Services Board loaders, the New South Wales Government should consider `corporatising' coal terminal operations. This would provide the necessary commercial freedom to efficiently service the current and future industry. </PARA>
<PARA> . . . </PARA>
<PARA>Port charges should be reviewed and restructured to reflect costs. </PARA>
<PARA>So there are many matters apart from the Waterside Workers Federation itself. But the point remains that the Waterside Workers Federation has behaved appallingly in this matter, along with other waterfront unions. </PARA>
<PARA> Having stressed that there is scope for massive improvement in this area, I want to stress, on behalf of the people who live in the Illawarra region, that there is an urgent need for this recommendation of the consultant referred to in this report to be brought into effect. The consultant recommends that there should be an independent review of rail freight rate structures for coal haulage in New South Wales and Queensland; that current restrictions in New South Wales on the use of road vehicles should be removed; and that a number of other measures should be taken with a view to improving road infrastructure and receival facilities where it is inappropriate to use rail. The consultant also concluded that in relation to port operations and regulations the Government should continue to explore the need to upgrade existing facilities in order to ensure continuing improvements to efficiency; that particular attention should be directed at increasing the depth alongside some berths, removing the existing restrictions on night-time entry in New South Wales, and allowing tug requirements to be determined according to maritime conditions at the time of entry or departure. Those are all rational and sensible things. I hope this Government will do something about them rather than adopt the approach of the Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs, Senator Robert Ray, as I recall it, referring to a previous report, who said: `There is no way that we are going to do anything about it, and don't hold your breath waiting'. </PARA>
<PARA> There has been a suggestion that the Opposition when in government did nothing about these things. When we were in government we introduced a lot of reforms. I accept that we did not introduce enough reforms, but one of the reasons that there were not enough is that there was a lack of-that marvellous word-consensus, without which the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke), who is always calling for consensus, says that nothing really significant can be achieved. What sort of consensus did the Australian Labor Party give us when we were trying to reform the wharves during the time of the Fraser Government? While we were in government, the Labor Party was only interested in aiding and abetting the stranglehold of the unions over the waterfront and stevedoring. That is the way it voted and spoke consistently. Now it is in government and the iniquities of the present system on the waterfront and of the shipping industry have been so thoroughly exposed, it is at last forced to at least consider taking some action. </PARA>

Yet we hear this nonsense that when we were in government we did nothing. We called the second National Stevedoring Industry Conference and took action to implement its recommendations.

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the paper. </PARA>
<PARA>I appreciate that this Inter-State Commission report on the waterfront has been the subject of very lengthy and very fruitful debate in the Senate today. I think that reflects the importance of the report. In the five minutes available to me I would like to make some of the points that I would have made had I had the opportunity of speaking in the debate today. The report by the Inter-State Commission is one of the most important reports tabled in this Parliament in recent years. It goes to the heart of the micro-economic reform required if Australia is to improve its productivity and its ability to compete with other countries both in export markets and in Australia itself with imports. </PARA>
<PARA> The rhetoric that we have heard from the Government over the last 18 months, two years or more in terms of the importance of micro-economic reform has not in any sense at all been reflected in the performance of the Government. The consideration that the Government gives this report and the treatment that it accords it will be a major test of the Government's credibility as to whether it is really serious about wanting to get this economy on the rails. </PARA>
<PARA> The waterfront industry and the shipping industry are two of Australia's most important industries when it comes to determining international competitiveness. This report, of course, deals only with the waterfront. In the near future there will be a report on the shipping industry which has been prepared by another inquiry headed by Mr Ivan Deveson. That too will be an inquiry of major significance. If we cannot handle our exports efficiently from the time they get to the wharf to the time they are received in their overseas destinations, we will continue to lose our competitiveness. The bottom line result would be increasing balance of payments crises, an unstable currency, higher inflation, less employment and lower living standards for us all. </PARA>
<PARA> This report found a great deal wrong with the waterfront industry. The litany of problems, of course, is very long. The problems were dealt with earlier today. They include ineffective management, poor work force training, introspective industrial attitudes, poor response to user needs, and attendance and the abuse of monopoly power reflected particularly in pricing and investment policies and the approach of the trade unions. The report noted that considerable changes have occurred over the last 50 years-as one would certainly hope they have-in the industry but that there is a need for further substantial changes. The Commission found that the benefits would be great. If the recommendations of this report were adopted the minimum contribution to the Australian economy was estimated at $620m a year. That is a very significant contribution indeed. </PARA>
<PARA> The report said that fundamental rather than incremental changes are required if the necessary results are to be achieved. The report emphasises that the role of government itself will be absolutely vital if these changes are to be implemented because the industry will not be able to reform itself. The most important change required of all is to reduce the extent of monopoly union power in the industry. That is spelled out in some detail on pages 125 to 127 of the report. It is to be regretted that both the Waterside Workers Federation of Australia Secretary, Mr Tas Bull, and the Australian Council of Trade Unions Secretary, Mr Kelty, have so prematurely rejected the report. Mr Kelty is reported to have called the findings childish. I think that is highly regrettable. He has a great responsibility to assist in pushing these reforms through. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the paper. </PARA>
<PARA>I rise to speak on the Joint Coal Board forty-first annual report, 1987-88. The Joint Coal Board is an anachronism in Australia. I think it is worth just drawing attention to the beginning of the report where it talks about the general powers and functions of the Board. Really, when one looks at them, they are somewhat hilarious. The Board was established by the Minister for Post-war Reconstruction in about 1946. The general powers and functions of the Joint Coal Board include the powers:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) to ensure that coal is produced in the State-</PARA>
<PARA>that is, New South Wales-</PARA>
<PARA> in such quantities and with such regularity as will meet requirements throughout Australia and in trade with other countries;</PARA>
<PARA> (b) to ensure that the coal resources of the State-</PARA>
<PARA>New South Wales-</PARA>
<PARA> are conserved, developed, worked and used to the best advantage in the public interest . . . </PARA>
<PARA>This was introduced at a time when the only coal in this country being mined was in New South Wales. It was introduced at a time when the major energy source in the country was in New South Wales. Of course, the Board itself is funded 50 per cent by the Government of New South Wales and 50 per cent by the Federal Government. I cannot help but question why the rest of Australia should be funding an industry which in 1946 may well have been totally enclosed in one State but has no relevance whether it be Western Australia, my own State of Queensland, Victoria or Tasmania. </PARA>
<PARA> The Joint Coal Board is an authority which the Federal Government has said on numerous occasions it intends to get rid of. In fact the recently elected New South Wales Government said that it would also be prepared to do that. I find it fascinating that here we have an organisation which is, as I said earlier, an anachronism and yet, when one goes to page 12 of the report, we find that not only is it not going to be removed as it should be but it has been expanded in the past 12 months. </PARA>
<PARA> There is an occupational health and rehabilitation service. I read in the report that the Joint Coal Board has now leased accommodation at Narellan to house a rehabilitation service. We must bear in mind we now have Medicare-most companies contribute to some sort of health fund to pick up the gap-and we have the Joint Coal Board going on its way willy-nilly spending the taxpayers' money through the Federal Government and the Government of New South Wales. The Joint Coal Board has fitted out new premises at North Wollongong. As I said, for similar reasons, a property has been purchased in Warners Bay. I wondered what this occupational health and rehabilitation service is. I find one of the things the Board is very proud of, because the report goes into it in great detail, is a pilot study which was undertaken to determine the prevalence of tinea in coalmines preparatory to undergoing a major prophylactic drug trial as outlined in the previous annual report. This was a major step forward. It states:</PARA>
<PARA> This involved the examination of 273 miners in three separate districts. A prevalence of approximately 10% was recorded for all categories of disease, with quite large local variations. The much more stringent criteria for diagnosis required by the trial drug protocol (which only accepts moderate to severe disease) dropped the prevalence of those acceptable for entry to the trial to 4.3%. </PARA>
<PARA>I have said this year in, year out: The Joint Coal Board is an anachronism. It was established at a time when this country was quite different, over 40 years ago. It really serves no useful purpose, bearing in mind that New South Wales, for instance, has its own mines department. Yet we have an organisation that has one member on it for every 71 miners in the State of New South Wales. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I, too, rise to discuss the Joint Coal Board's annual report. This is another of those reports which are unjustifiably late. It was signed by Mr Wilcox, the Chairman, on 28 November. The audit report is dated 2 December and it now comes to the Senate in April. That is a disgrace. However, even more disgraceful is the situation that this Board reveals. On page 5 of the annual report it notes:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>The net operating loss of the export sector of the industry for 1987-88 has been estimated to be $151m following a loss of $84m in 1986-87. </PARA>
<PARA>The report fails to deal in any substance with one of the major problems affecting profitability and contributing so enormously to that loss; that is, the enormous cost and massive inefficiency involved in shipping coal out of Australia. The annual report deals with the Hunter Valley Coal Chain Council. But all it does is note:</PARA>
<PARA> The aim of the Council is to resolve by discussion and consultation industrial difficulties occurring in the coal chain (the chain that extends from mining the coal to loading it on a ship for export) before they erupt into disputes disrupting the operation of the coal chain. The activity of the Council has proved most effective. </PARA>
<PARA>I just wish it had proved an awful lot more effective not only in stopping some ludicrous disputes but also in diminishing the outlandish and disgraceful costs that are imposed on this industry by the appalling waterfront situation. The report of the Inter-State Commission, which was dealt with earlier today, noted in its conclusions:</PARA>
<PARA> One other measure relates to the unsatisfactory financial and operational performance of the Port Kembla terminal-</PARA>
<PARA>that is, the coal loader terminal-</PARA>
<PARA>(and to a lesser extent the Balmain facility) compared with private facilities-</PARA>
<PARA>that is, coal loading facilities-</PARA>
<PARA>in New South Wales and both private and public facilities in Queensland. The Commission's consultant stated, . . . it is recommended that the New South Wales Government corporatise State government coal terminal assets (particularly Port Kembla). The purpose of the restructuring would be to provide stakeholders with the autonomy and commercial freedom to</PARA>
<PARA> better develop commercial operating style and capital resources necessary to service future shipping requirements,</PARA>
<PARA> achieve economies by enabling exporters and stakeholders to better integrate existing transport, storage and handling activities. </PARA>
<PARA> The consultant also observed that there are alternatives, such as sale of government assets, private investment in existing facilities, or a lease and management contract. </PARA>
<PARA> On the basis of the evidence provided and the results of the consultant's study, the Commission considers that there is potential to substantially improve coal loader performance in New South Wales. If properly implemented, a number of the Commission's plan components will contribute to improve performance. However, action by the New South Wales Government is also recommended. </PARA>
<PARA> Naturally so, because after so many years of Labor government when some of these new things were instituted, such as the Port Kembla terminal, there is clearly now a desperate need for action. The action plan that the Inter-State Commission recommends is:</PARA>
<PARA>The coal industry should monitor the implementation of the waterfront industry plan and take action as appropriate under other plan components to ensure the realisation of the potential efficiency gains for coal loaders. </PARA>
<PARA>I interpose there: Clearly those potential gains are enormous. The second action recommended is:</PARA>
<PARA>The New South Wales Government should examine the Commission's consultancy report . . . with a view to taking action as appropriate to improve coal terminal performance, particularly in relation to the Port Kembla and Balmain terminals. </PARA>
<PARA>As I said, these are matters of major significance. In fact, the whole report on the waterfront is a matter of major significance. But all that the Joint Coal Board could get around to discussing in this report was current problems such as the implementation of the Coal Industry Tribunal's decision on flexible working hours, problems with flag of convenience ships and the Port of Newcastle review. It is looking at a couple of minor shrubs when there is a great forest of problems. </PARA>
<PARA> I join with Senator Parer in saying that the Joint Coal Board is an anachronistic body. It is strange that it is spending more money and employing such a large number of people per head of coal mining population. If it cannot get its report out on time, maybe the bell has tolled for this organisation. It may well have run out of time. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I also wish to speak to the forty-first annual report of the Joint Coal Board, but in a somewhat different vein from the two previous speakers, Senator Parer and Senator Michael Baume. The report lists in a table the increased production of coal and employment and various other figures. It makes rather interesting reading to observe that in 1950-51 Australia's production of coal was just under 13 million tonnes. In 1986-87 it reached a peak of nearly 89 million tonnes and then dropped back to about 76 million tonnes; in other words, between six and seven times the production that we had 40 years ago. The output per man shift-this reflects a little on what Senator Michael Baume was saying a moment ago-has risen from 3.28 tonnes for all mines to 19.5 tonnes. In other words, there has been a six-fold, almost seven-fold, increase in the output per man shift in raw tonnes of coal.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The production for power station consumption has risen from 2.5 million tonnes in 1950-51 to 18.9 million tonnes. Again, this is a factor of eight times. The point I want to make bears on a point that I was making earlier today in connection with a motion that I will be moving tomorrow; that is, the evidence is that we need to change our attitude to the burning of fossil fuels and not take the rather optimistic and blind view, which is taken by both the Government and the Opposition, that we can go on endlessly increasing the production of fossil fuels and expecting to export those profitably to other parts in the world. </PARA>
<PARA> It is, therefore, rather upsetting to find that an organisation such as the National Energy Research Development and Demonstration Council (NERDDC), which should by now be turning around and researching other areas of energy production, has, together with the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO), been funding more research work on the utilisation of coal. On page 22 the Board states:</PARA>
<PARA> With funding from a grant from the National Energy Research Development and Demonstrates Council (NERDDC) the Board, in collaboration with the CSIRO Division of Coal Technology, is developing a practical proton magnetic resonance thermal analysis . . . </PARA>
<PARA>In fact, NERDDC, which has rather limited funds to spend on research purposes, allocated $311,000 for this purpose. I would have thought that in 1989 we would have moved on somewhat beyond this view of where Australia's energy future lies. It is worth remarking that this Government's attitude to the funding of research would led it to make precisely the sorts of decisions which are reflected in this report and also make it impossible to make decisions which are more broadly based and which have a view on the future. </PARA>
<PARA> I noted earlier today that the Government has decided to spend $7.8m on problems of the greenhouse effect. One of the expenditures under that broad sum of money is to set up a committee. One hopes that the Government goes well outside the sorts of in-groups, the sorts of conventional wisdom givers, who are likely to be put on that committee, heaven help us. One hopes that the Government will seek people with alternative, wider views, people with wider research experience to direct the Government to research projects on the greenhouse effect which do not go back simply to the burning of fossil fuel and to other technologies which are becoming quite antiquated and antiquarian and which are ineffective in dealing with Australia's economic needs in the future. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the paper. </PARA>
<PARA>This is another annual report for the year ended 30 June 1988 which has been presented to the Senate appallingly late, in April 1989. Surely the Government can do better than this. In fact, all the reports tabled today, as I understand it, are unjustifiably late, and no member of the Government has got up to justify this monumental and continuing incompetence. This topic is now being examined by the Senate Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration. I would have thought that that would have encouraged the Government to try to do a little better than this culpably bad reporting standard that it seems to be maintaining. </PARA>
<PARA> Earlier today Senator Messner gave notice of a motion about the extraordinary and worrying level of retirements of experts, senior public servants, from the Department of the Treasury and the impact it is having. It is appropriate to refer to this matter because in the Treasury's annual report there is a clear implication of major disagreement between the Department of the Treasury and the Government about the nature of the remuneration packages available to senior Treasury officers. As the Treasury is fairly inhibited in its language in these matters, what it says in its annual report, which is strong criticism of the Government, is simply the tip of the iceberg of major discontent which has spread through that Department. The report says that, during 1987-88, 94 permanent staff-that is 17 per cent of the total average staff level-left the Treasury. The main single reason for this was 40 resignations and only six retirements. It is intriguing to note that people are resigning from this Department rather than retiring because they have reached retirement age. The Treasury in its annual report says:</PARA>
<PARA>These numbers point to a continuing drain of senior . . . and experienced staff from the Treasury. That drain in large part reflects persistently strong demand from the private sector for Treasury trained economists. </PARA>
<PARA> The cumulative impact of those and similar losses in earlier years-and into 1988-89-is such that the Treasury is being robbed of many of its most promising officers who could have been expected to form the backbone of the senior ranks of the Department in the years ahead. Some of the Department's institutional memory is being lost in the process. There is also a risk that the very large gaps now opening up in relative salary levels for Treasury and private sector economists could begin to undermine the exceptional commitment from officers who choose to remain with Treasury. The reality is that if the Government is to have access to the best available advice on the nation's on-going economic problems-as it is entitled to-it will have to pay for it (although it does not follow that the overall costs of government must rise; a better paid but leaner, more productive Service could well lead to net savings). </PARA>
<PARA>It is quite interesting that a major department such as the Treasury should be, in effect, castigating the Government for its failure to create a leaner, more productive service which could lead to net savings but which would enable the skilled experts in higher positions to be adequately rewarded. </PARA>
<PARA> There is one benefit that the Treasury has as a result of spreading its ex-members around in the private sector, and that is that it can quite happily seek almost to mislead the private sector by suggesting to former colleagues still within Treasury that the Government knows what it is doing about the economy. It will be noticed that a very large number of forecasts made by former Treasury economists working in the private sector about how the Government's last Budget was sensible, rational and doing the right thing were demonstrated to be absolute nonsense. This ex-Treasury mafia has served its purpose, while leaving the Government bereft of adequate and coherent advice. </PARA>
<PARA> I am distressed that the Government seeks to diminish the expert levels of the Treasury by one move by appointing a Treasury officer, for the first time ever, to be Governor of the Reserve Bank. I regard it as a retrograde step. The Government is behaving disgracefully in so doing. The money markets are expressing proper concern by regretting that someone who is accustomed to Canberra rather than the reality of the marketplace should be moved from the Department of the Treasury to take over as Governor of the Reserve Bank. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the paper. </PARA>
<PARA>In the very brief time at my disposal in this debate, I wish to reiterate the Opposition's support for the National Crime Authority (NCA). That support is shown by the fact that in South Australia we now have an office of the Authority and a member of the Authority manning it, largely as a result of the Opposition in the Federal Parliament and the efforts of the State Opposition in South Australia. Regrettably, that office was obtained only after a tooth and nail fight with the Government which month after month opposed its setting up. </PARA>
<PARA> Our support is consistent with the philosophical statement set out in our important document Future Directions, which notes the fact that crime and violence in our society are increasing at an alarming rate and, in effect, sets out to tackle such crime and violence with a series of integrated law enforcement actions. In contrast, this Government's attitude is shown not only by its attitude to the setting up of an NCA office in Adelaide, but also by its deplorable attitude in regard to the Australian Federal Police (AFP), which in the last couple of weeks has had to take industrial action for the first time in its history as a result of this Government not being prepared to properly fund the AFP. It was industrial action not to benefit members of that force but to put them in a position in which they could do their job properly. That is reinforced by information that we have from the police to the effect that one of its functions, the manning of Perth Airport, was not only undermanned but manned at a level which the AFP regarded as putting it in an unsafe position. It is a deplorable abdication of responsibility by this Government, and I regret to say generally reflects the Government's attitude to law enforcement. </PARA>
<PARA> I use the last few moments in this discussion to commend the staff of the National Crime Authority. I wish particularly to mention Mr Justice Stewart, because I imagine this will be the last time that he will present the annual report. I commend him for his work, which must be one of the most difficult jobs in Australia. We look forward to the appointment of his successor. The value of the Authority is very much reflected in the capability of the Authority head and we regard it as one of the most important appointments this Government will make. There are so many areas that are deficient in law enforcement-lack of coordination that we still see, papers coming out of the Government talking of dropping the Australian Bureau of Criminal Intelligence--</PARA>

There is a proposal for Grafton, and pulp mills are said to be going in in East Gippsland. Frankly, we do not know enough about them. We do not know what the economic benefits, if any, will be, and we do not know what the environmental impact or the social impact will be. We do not know how many jobs, if any, they will create. It is for these reasons that I ask that Standing Orders be suspended. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Tonight the Senate is debating the Insurance Legislation Amendment Bill 1989, which is associated with the General Insurance Supervisory Levy Bill 1989, the Life Insurance Supervisory Levy Bill 1989 and the Insurance Supervisory Levies Collection Bill 1989. The overall Bill, the Insurance Supervisory Levy Bill 1989, gives effect to the 1988-89 Budget announcement, last August, to levy an annual supervisory fee on general insurers, Lloyd's and life insurance. This measure is intended to recover the ongoing costs of supervision of such insurers under the Insurance Act of 1973 and the Life Insurance Act of 1945 by the Insurance and Superannuation Commission.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Another Bill contained in this insurance legislation package, the Insurance Legislation Amendment Bill 1989, contains provisions to amend the Insurance Act 1973 and the Insurance (Agents and Brokers) Act 1984 to provide for the registration of insurance intermediaries dealing with unauthorised foreign insurers, and for the collection of statistics regarding premiums remitted overseas; and to amend the Life Insurance Act 1945 to give effect to a number of miscellaneous changes to improve the administration of the Act. </PARA>
<PARA> I should say straight off that the Opposition will be supporting these Bills because it believes that they are reasonably based and, therefore, should go through unopposed. However, a number of issues need to be raised. First, this insurance legislation in effect corrects yet another Government botch-up, another mistake. According to the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) this super deluxe, high quality front bench is supposedly the best that this nation has ever seen. He has stopped making that claim now, having had to sack so many, pension so many off and send so many overseas. But this is yet another one of those administrative botch-ups that this Government has been responsible for. </PARA>
<PARA> This package replaces the Government's aborted Insurance Legislation Amendment Bill 1988. The original Bill sought to make virtually the same changes as do the present Bills. But the Government withdrew the Bill last November before it was debated in the Senate in order to reassess its provisions in the light of the High Court of Australia decision to reject the immigration arrivals fee in the Air Caledonie case. Hence, the current Bills have been drafted following the immigration fee debacle to ensure that they are constitutionally sound. The point to be made, therefore, is that the Government failed to get the legislation right in the first place. The capital gains tax, for example, has been subjected to monumental correction months and months after an announcement was made. In fact, in that case people had to take commercial decisions on the basis of the announcement of a law which ended up not being reflected accurately in the legislation that was ultimately passed. We have seen the same sort of nonsense in respect of the broadcasting legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> It seems that this is yet another example of what happens when this Government makes mistakes by trying to make short cuts in drafting its legislation and gets it wrong. This comes not simply at a cost to the people who have to act on the announcement of legislation-in this case, for example, from the time of the last Budget. It also comes at a cost to the Parliament by, quite frankly, wasting its valuable time and resources. It also demonstrates the Government's continual contempt for the Parliament by entertaining such constitutionally unsound legislation which simply cannot be sustained. One wonders whether at some stages-early in the session in particular-this Government is in fact just whacking up legislation simply to give the appearance that it has itself prepared and ready and that it is actually doing something. We find that at the end of each session we have to deal with mountains of hurriedly prepared legislation. We get the situation where legislation such as the Bills before us had to be withdrawn after the Government's first try and it has had to try again. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course, the Government's action also comes at a cost to taxpayers in particular because of the huge cost of constitutional challenges in the High Court and the additional paperwork, of course, that results from this kind of continual muck-up. The Government makes blunders in respect of its legislation. It is about time, after six years, that the Government got its act together and stopped making these nonsensical, absurd mistakes in regard to legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> It may well be that this is another example of the consequences of the Department of the Treasury's complaint in its annual report that was released today about how this Government is monumentally incompetent in establishing not only a leaner Public Service but a better paid Public Service so that it can get better quality people. I am glad to see that the Minister for Finance (Senator Walsh) is in the chamber. I encourage him to read the Department of the Treasury's annual report because, clearly, it gives its side of what must have been continual battles with him and his Department about an inappropriate and disadvantageous system that continues to apply with the result that the Treasury Department is losing so many of its senior officers. Maybe the loss of senior and competent public servants continues to bring these sorts of problems. Of course, as I said, it may well be that the Government is rushing legislation into the Parliament just to give the appearance of doing something, particularly at a time when it does not have itself in any kind of shape, it has not got its legislative program in any kind of order and it has to fill in early in the session with a whole lot of matters which could have been better thought out. </PARA>
<PARA> Another comment worth making on this group of Bills concerns taxation. In his second reading speech on the General Insurance Supervisory Levy Bill, the Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs (Senator Robert Ray) said:</PARA>
<PARA>The proposed levies reflect the Government's view that, generally, where a service is designed to benefit a particular group, the cost should be borne by that immediate group of beneficiaries of the service rather than by taxpayers in general. </PARA>
<PARA>That sounds a great principle. I think it is correct. But in this case it is really quite eccentric. There is really something very odd about a statement from a Hawke Government Minister on this one. How can the Minister hold a straight face while mouthing those words about relieving the burden on taxpayers in general when, of course, the Hawke Government is the highest taxing Government in Australia's postwar history and is responsible for the greatest number of new taxes and charges of any previous government? The Hawke Government has obtained its Budget surplus on the backs of ordinary taxpayers, mainly through bracket creep. Families in particular have been hit by the Hawke Government's ruthless attack on middle Australia. In other words, this Government has taxed the incentive out of the country. </PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Senator Puplick" NAMEID="TI4">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="TI4">Senator Puplick</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;And the worst interest rates.</PARA></TALK.START>
</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="LE4">Senator MICHAEL BAUME</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As Senator Puplick says, and the worst interest rates. There is no doubt that today's news on that score is particularly worrying, with one bank now having outlined that as a result of deliberate governmental policy it will be increasing some of its mortgage interest rates to 17 per cent. Another bank is forecasting that 18 per cent is likely.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I should just mention in passing on that score that it is ludicrous for the Government to pretend, as it will on Wednesday night, that it is providing an immense benefit by giving an $18 a week tax cut and a $25 a week pay rise when, if interest rates go, as expected, to 18 per cent, this will mean an extra $70 a week in the interest and mortgage repayment bill of someone purchasing no more than an average Sydney home. This slug is already up $40 a week extra compared with June of last year. The bill will be increased by another $30 a week to $70 because of this Government's direct and deliberate economic policies, which are pushing interest rates up higher. </PARA>
<PARA> As I was saying, at the same time as the Government is continuing this massive attack on people through interest rates, it now promises to give back a tiny fraction of the enormous amount of money that it has taken from them. I think the Opposition has established very clearly now that people are something like $58 a week worse off than they were when this Government came to office. This is mainly because of tax. This is why living standards have plummeted under Labor. By 1 July this year, when the long awaited tax cuts are due, a person on average weekly earnings with a dependent spouse would need, as I suggested, a tax cut of something like $58 a week simply to restore that family to the situation it was in before the Hawke Labor Government came to power. No Minister has effectively refuted this statement. Although there has been a bit of personal abuse about it, there has been no effective refutation of the figure. Yet the Government still has the gall to talk about relieving taxpayers by the supervisory fee that is imposed under this package of legislation. Apart from anything else, it is rather quaint to impose supervision on an industry, which the industry says is not necessary anyway, and then to charge the industry for the benefit of the supervision it is getting. But that is a separate issue. </PARA>
<PARA> The fact is that this Government is pinning its political survival on the tax cuts that are due to be delivered from 1 July this year. They are to be announced this Wednesday, and they will virtually disappear within 12 months, and no doubt before then, because the money Mr Keating will give back in tax cuts will be taken away again by inflation and more taxes. In fact, it has already been taken away, as I indicated, by massive increases in interest rates affecting the purchase of homes. Interest rates have priced many thousands of Australian families out of the prospect of owning their own home. The Keating $18 or $20 tax cut will not in fact mean a decrease in taxes of $20 a week, because he will claw back most of it through taxes on the wage rises that are now planned to take place during the year. In June 1990 an Australian on average weekly earnings with a dependent spouse and two children will still be at least $50 worse off than in March 1983, when this Government came to power. He gives with the one hand and the Australian Taxation Office and price rises take away with the other. Therefore, even after so-called wonderful tax cuts, living standards will still be in a shocking and depressed state, courtesy of the Hawke Government. </PARA>
<PARA> Getting back to the specifics of this legislation-I have just dealt with the irony of the Government claiming some kind of purity on tax in this matter-the final issue to be raised concerns the Government's inaction to date in introducing other important legislation in the insurance area. Prior to last year's May economic statement, the tax system treated life offices and friendly societies on a concessional basis. Life offices were taxed at 49c in the dollar but on a concessional tax base because of certain tax deductions under sections 46, 115 and 116 of the Income Tax Assessment Act. Friendly societies were taxed at 20 per cent. Following the May statement, the deductions allowable for life offices will be severely cut back, and the rate of tax applying to the life insurance business of friendly societies is to be increased from the present 20 per cent to 30 per cent. But after nearly 12 months we are still to debate this legislation. The industry is becoming very concerned about the absence of this legislation in black and white. </PARA>
<PARA> This is yet another occasion, in a long list of occasions, where this Government announces a policy decision but fails to back it up with legislation, in some instances up to three years after the decision. This is not simply monumental incompetence, it is monumental arrogance. There is no doubt that this Government, the longer it stays in office, is revealing a greater and greater level of arrogant disdain for the requirements not only of the corporations in this nation-in this case the insurance companies of this nation-but of people on whom it depends for votes. I think that this kind of uncertainty on the part of the ultimate consumer, that is, the taxpayers of Australia-the fact that the private sector in so many instances does not know what the legislation is going to look like and has to rely on initial statements of some years standing, which are not necessarily backed up by the reality of the legislation as major changes take place-generates considerable additional costs, apart from the fact that enormous amounts of professional advice have to be obtained to ensure that, whatever the corporations are doing during this time of limbo, they are not put at risk in any of the activities they undertake. </PARA>
<PARA> I conclude by saying that the coalition parties do not oppose these Bills. We are glad that eventually the Government has got around to bringing into the Parliament, and putting into black letter law, the statements that it made in last year's Budget. I suppose it is appropriate, with the mini-Budget coming on this week, that the Government should choose this week as the way of eventually introducing some legislation relating to that Budget. But we will be watching very closely the Government's claim that this legislation will be effective in improving the administration and the regulatory supervision of the insurance industry. There is no confidence on this side of the chamber, particularly in view of the incompetent manner in which this matter has been dealt with so far by the Government, that the Government will be capable of being effective in improving the administration and regulatory supervision of the insurance industry. The Opposition wants to see the industry expand under an effective regulatory environment, but one that imposes as few regulations as necessary. In other words, the only role of government in this arena is to ensure that there is fair and honest play on as level a playing field as possible. That means we have a basic philosophic difference from so many members of the Australian Labor Party, whose main objective is to generate a maximum volume of regulation and red tape. So the Opposition's commitment to limiting the amount of regulation to the minimum amount necessary stands in general contrast to the philosophic basis on which the Labor Party has existed all these years. I repeat: the coalition parties do not oppose these Bills. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Senate is tonight debating a package of four Bills, and in that package there lies a story, as Senator Michael Baume has already pointed out. We are dealing with the General Insurance Supervisory Levy Bill 1989, the Life Insurance Supervisory Levy Bill 1989, the Insurance Supervisory Levies Collection Bill 1989 and the Insurance Legislation Amendment Bill 1989. The Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs (Senator Robert Ray), in his second reading speeches, pointed out the litany of problems that lay behind this package before us tonight.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Bills, of course, are substantially the same as the Insurance Legislation Amendment Bill 1988, which was passed in the House of Representatives in November of last year. It was, however, withdrawn before the Senate had an opportunity to debate it. The primary reason for the Government withdrawing the legislation, before giving it to the Senate for debate, was that the Government could make some changes in the light of the Air Caledonie case, which was taken to the High Court of Australia over the issue of immigration review panel fees. It was the High Court's decision in that case which led the Government to rethink the format in which it was presenting the legislation. The result of that decision was to cast some doubt on the Government's attempt to impose insurance supervisory levies on general insurers, Lloyd's and life insurers. Therefore the levies and the method of levy collection are in separate Bills in the legislation currently before us. </PARA>
<PARA> In the House of Representatives, and in the chamber a moment ago, the Opposition indicated its general support for the legislation. But it raised some other issues, such as the Government not giving the House of Representatives enough time for it to debate the legislation generally; the foresight of Australians in not giving the Government control of the Senate; the decline in living standards; and an appalling propensity by the Government to try to legislate by press release. To all these concerns and views the Australian Democrats say, `Hear, hear!'. It was with the support of the Opposition that the Democrats last year had a motion passed through this chamber that set in place some restrictions on the Government's capacity to legislate by press release. I think this will make life somewhat easier for people in complicated professions who need to know where they are on a day to day basis and who do not want the Government indicating that it will change some legislation three years before it actually gets around to presenting the legislation to the House. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="1H4">Senator HAINES</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Indeed, it has nothing to do with the legislation and I had intended to make that point. However, I wanted to point out that it was Senator Michael Baume and his colleagues who supported the deregulation of the financial sector which has led, inevitably, to these sorts of high interest rates and caused many problems to many people who have to deal with the financial sector that Senator Michael Baume was talking about. In fact, on the Page One program tonight the Chief Executive of Westpac Banking Corporation, Stuart Fowler, very cheerfully admitted that the banks are in the business to make profits and that if they can increase those profits by squeezing the customer dry, by putting fees on all sorts of services that they advertise they want people to take advantage of, that is precisely what they will do.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator Michael Baume is quite right to be concerned about the level of interest rates in this country, but he and his colleagues have to share the responsibility for that fact, not only because they supported this Government in deregulating the financial sector and encouraging foreign banks to come in, all under the guise of increasing competition, providing better services and lowering interest rates-none of which has occurred-but also because they share with the Government a predilection to encourage foreign investors into this country for a variety of reasons. They support the sort of tax inequities that apply which allow investors to get a tax break if they want to buy into the housing sector but do not allow a similar tax break to people who want to buy a home to put over their own and their children's heads. This is somewhat different from the story in both the United Kingdom and the United States of America, where people who own homes for themselves to live in are given a tax break. </PARA>
<PARA> Furthermore, the Treasurer (Mr Keating) is running around saying that all of this is at least partly caused by the fact that people are not putting their money into the banks any more, that they are spending as if there is no tomorrow. Yet no encouragement is given to people to support the banking sector in this way because the Government takes through the tax system the bulk of interest that people earn. So unless governments change their attitude we will have the sort of situation that Senator Michael Baume quite gratuitously raised this evening. </PARA>
<PARA> The legislation before us will achieve two important changes for which the Government can be praised. There are a couple of other changes, however, which could cause some concern. I hope that the Minister for Finance (Senator Walsh) will respond to those issues. The Government has made some commendable changes. It has provided for the registration of insurance intermediaries who deal with unauthorised foreign insurers. In order to carry on insurance business in Australia, authority under the Insurance Act 1973 is required. The authorisation process involves making an application, providing the relevant information, and receiving a grant of authority by the Insurance and Superannuation Commissioner. As a result of this legislation, all insurance intermediaries who arrange insurance contracts with unauthorised foreign insurers will be required to register under the Act. They will also provide to the Insurance and Superannuation Commission copies of their agency agreements with the unauthorised foreign insurer, provide an annual return to the Commission and, importantly, obtain written acknowledgment from the insured that cover is being provided by an unauthorised foreign insurer. To recover the additional supervisory costs of this measure the legislation will also implement a fee via regulations on insurance intermediaries who deal with these unauthorised foreign insurers. </PARA>
<PARA> The second change which the Government has quite justifiably made is this: the legislation introduces the requirement for each life insurance company to nominate a suitably qualified appointed actuary. This will assist the Insurance and Superannuation Commissioner to identify the actuary for each company, and this actuary will be responsible for discharging the actuarial functions within the Life Insurance Act. I think those two moves are ones for which the Government should be given considerable credit. </PARA>
<PARA> There are, however, a couple of changes which cause the Australian Democrats some concern. The first lies with clauses 20 and 25, which abolish section 13 of the principal Act empowering the Insurance and Superannuation Commissioner to arbitrate in a dispute between a life insurance company and a policy owner in relation to a policy. It is interesting to note that the explanatory memorandum on page 10 describes clause 20 as repealing unproclaimed sections of the principal Act which are redundant. I find that a rather bizarre statement. Not only the Parliament but also the public is entitled to know why so much legislation that goes through this place is either all or in part left unproclaimed. I wonder what we do here sometimes, arguing and debating legislation, only to find years later sometimes and frequently accidentally that some sections and sometimes whole Acts were never proclaimed for a variety of `Yes Minister' reasons. </PARA>
<PARA> The second reading speech claims that this provision, that is section 13, has been used only once in more than 40 years of the operation of the Act. Does this mean that the one dispute was the subject of arbitration on the basis of unproclaimed legislation or is there earlier legislation which established the arbitration facility? Interestingly enough, perhaps even oddly enough, clause 25 also repeals section 13-so we have a double repeal of this section-but includes a saving provision, subclause (2), so that section 13 continues in effect for any parties to a policy who may have already entered into contracts to submit disputes to the Commissioner under section 13. Why, one is forced to ask, is the Government including a saving provision for current disputes when it is repealing a section which we are told has been used only once in over 40 years?</PARA>
<PARA> Is it possible that the reason there are so few disputes referred to arbitration by the Commissioner is that arbitration power encourages the insurance companies to settle in favour of the policyholder? I can understand why the insurance industry would be happier to move to self-regulation than to maintain the arbitration power of the Insurance and Superannuation Commissioner. Self-regulation is clearly in the interests of the insurance companies. However, I believe it is good for the public to have someone outside the industry to fall back on. The potential problems of having Caesar reporting to Caesar are legendary, and it may be better for the industry to set up an independent ombudsman to deal with such problems. Perhaps that is what they have in mind. At the moment nobody is aware of that, or if anybody is they have not passed that information on to me. In general, self-regulation works against the interests of the complainant. If the industry wants these sorts of changes, it has to be prepared to show its bona fides by having an outside independent authority to deal with disputes. I would like the Government to come up with some answers to those issues. I would like the Opposition to consider opposing the repeal of section 13 unless the Government has some answers that are a little better than simply saying that it has only been used once in 40 years. </PARA>
<PARA> Our second concern relates to clause 42, which increases the threshold for publication in the Commonwealth of Australia Gazette of life insurance unclaimed moneys. It increases the threshold from $20 to $200. Again, one is forced to ask why. The second reading speech gives an explanation. It argues that publication of unclaimed moneys below $20 is time-consuming and costly; but so are a lot of things that we continue to do. I am aware of the fact that in excess of 50 per cent of all unclaimed moneys are below $200. We are wiping out in this move a large number of listings. What happens to unclaimed money? Is it reported? Is it paid to the Treasury each year and deposited into Consolidated Revenue? The answer to that question is yes. Attempts are then presumably made to find the owners of the money. I say `presumably' because attempts are certainly made, but whether they are actually made to find the owner is a moot point when one considers that attempts are made by inserting a notice in that highly popular publication, the Government Gazette, which we all, as a matter of course in this community, read with considerable interest--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Boswell, there are a lot of people who wait breathlessly for the next edition of the Government Gazette to see whether they rate a mention or whether anybody they know rates a mention, or whether Truth has missed out on a story for the week. It is a touch bizarre to argue that we are increasing this limit from $20 to $200 and we are going to help everybody find out whether they are in this little game by putting the notice in the Government Gazette.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Since 1985-86 the total amount of unclaimed moneys under the Life Insurance Act 1945 going into Consolidated Revenue has been over $1m per annum. It is a lovely little revenue raiser for the Government. It does not quite match up to the amount of revenue lost by the fact that half the major companies in this country are paying precious little tax, but it goes some small way towards taking money off ordinary people to make up for those losses to Consolidated Revenue from the bigger companies. In 1987-88 the figure was $1,283,052. That was when the threshold was $20. I wonder whether raising the threshold from $20 to $200 will increase the flow of unclaimed moneys into consolidated revenue, given that about 50 per cent of all unclaimed moneys are below $200. I would have thought the resounding answer to that question was yes. I wonder whether the money would not be put to better use to fund the ombudsman that I mentioned earlier so that there is somebody to act for insurance policy owners who are in dispute with insurance companies, rather than that being done by somebody operating from within the industry. To whom is the person within the industry going to report? If a job is given to a person by the industry, then it can be taken away from that person by the industry, presumably, unless it is a tenured position. There would be enormous pressure placed on somebody within the industry to make enough decisions that are on the side of the industry for that person not to lose the position. The idea of using the unclaimed money to fund an ombudsman to act for insurance policy owners who are in dispute with insurance companies would be an especially good idea if the arbitration function of the Commissioner is abolished. </PARA>
<PARA> In any event, the Democrats do not oppose the principle behind these Bills. We applaud some of the moves that the Government has made. But I repeat that I am concerned about the effect of clause 25 of the Insurance Legislation Amendment Bill. I would appreciate it if the Minister could give some assurances with regard to that clause and, in doing so, ensure a fairly speedy run through the committee stage. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not intend to hold the Senate up for long but I will respond briefly to a couple of points Senator Haines has raised. With regard to the unclaimed moneys, the $20 figure has been in the Life Insurance Act ever since 1945. I cannot state this positively off the top of my head but I think the consumer price index has increased 10-fold since 1945 so in real terms it is about what it was then. We can argue that it should be more or less. But it is entirely consistent with the Act when it was originally passed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> With regard to the other question-that is, the repeal of section 13 of the 1945 Act-it might be worth quoting it in part. It says:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . if the parties have agreed . . . to submit the dispute or difference to arbitration by the Commissioner, the Commissioner may act as arbitrator of the dispute or difference and his award shall be binding on both parties. </PARA>
<PARA>I am advised that that section has been used only once in 44 years. I am also informed that the Insurance and Superannuation Commission is examining, in conjunction with other government agencies and industry bodies, possible improved arrangements for resolving disputes between insurers and policyholders. I am advised that those discussions involve not only the regulator and the insurers but also representatives of policyholders. Discussions relating to that question are expected to result in some worthwhile improvements. I do not profess to have any knowledge of this at all, but I am advised that some similar procedures involving the Ombudsman in the United Kingdom either have been in use or are about to be in use and that it is possible or even likely that something similar to that may evolve in Australia. Otherwise, I do not propose to delay the passage of the legislation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In leading for the Opposition tonight on the Qantas Airways Limited (Loan Guarantee) Bill 1989 I would say at the outset that the Opposition will be supporting this legislation because it basically provides for Qantas to raise some more money. We are very critical about the steps taken by the Government which put Qantas in the position where it has to raise money once more with the guarantees of the taxpayers. I will be moving an amendment to this motion later on. That amendment will be:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> At end of motion, add `, but the Senate calls on the Government to recognise the urgent need to provide additional capital resources for Qantas and to overcome the ideological objections to the sale of shares in the airline to its staff and to the Australian public'. </PARA>
<PARA>The Qantas Airways Limited (Loan Guarantee) Bill is to enable the Treasurer (Mr Keating) on behalf of the Commonwealth to guarantee under certain terms and conditions the payment of amounts which Qantas Airways Ltd is liable to pay with respect to money borrowed to assist in financing the purchase of three new Boeing 747-400 series aircraft and related spare parts and equipment. It is proposed that the limit of any borrowing subject to guarantee should be $US385m or its equivalent, which is 85 per cent of the total project cost of these three aircraft. It is proposed that the terms and conditions under which the moneys are borrowed will be subject to the Treasurer's approval. </PARA>
<PARA> This is the first Bill we have had this year for loan raisings for Qantas. I spoke on the last Bill that came before the Senate, which was not so many months back, last year, where funds were raised for the purchase of some new Boeing 767 aircraft. We are certainly going to have more Bills in the future because the Qantas fleet expansion is proceeding almost as fast as Boeing can build the aircraft. As I said in my introduction, the purpose of this Bill is to allow Qantas to borrow more money, with a Commonwealth guarantee. Qantas, of course, despite what the Australian Labor Party thinks, is not a statutory authority; it is a public company and all the shares in Qantas are held by the Commonwealth of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> Initially I want to talk about two points. Firstly, I want to talk about the financial position of Qantas and, secondly, I want to go on to make a few general remarks about Qantas itself. The first point I would like to make is a very basic one. Australia is an island tucked away in a corner of the world quite a long way away from all the great centres of population. The other important basic point is that Australia is a great trading nation. Transport to Australia is big business, both by sea and by air, because it is how we move people to and from this country, and it is how we move our exports and bring in our imports. It is very much in our interests to have a very efficient transport system. We have got to be efficient so that we keep the costs of transport down because everything we buy and everything we sell has a transport component in it. The Australian consumer has to pay for that on goods he buys. The Australian exporter has to lose the cost of transport on what he sells in competition with other world markets. So we want to be as efficient as we can in the transport field. </PARA>
<PARA> The second point I would make is that we want to keep as much of the money from transport, that inevitable minimal cost, in Australian hands. In the marine environment, in which we move most of our commodities, we do not have much in Australian hands. Most of the passenger trade comes by air, and we have a higher fraction of that. But in 1986-87, which is the latest year for which I can get figures, sea traffic saw 78 per cent by value of all our imported commodities and 86 per cent by value of our exported commodities. A very low proportion of that was carried in Australian ships. I do not have the precise figure but I have the feeling that about 6 per cent of our export and import trade moves in ships that are owned by Australians or Australian companies. Thanks to the restrictive trade practices of the Seamen's Union of Australia and the Waterside Workers Federation of Australia-as the report of the Inter-State Commission which was brought down at the end of last week and debated in the Senate today in an urgency motion showed-the incentive for Australian companies to own and operate ships both on the coastal trade routes and internationally is so poor that no-one wants to get involved in it. </PARA>
<PARA> We have done a bit better in the air. Roughly 40 per cent of the passenger trade moves with Qantas into and out of this country. Despite the very strong unionisation that exists in the airline industry with its inherent inflexibility and its featherbedding leading to low productivity rates from employees in the Australian airline industry, we do have a bigger fraction of the trade coming into and out of this country in the passenger field in Australian-owned aircraft that we do in the comparable commodity trade at sea.</PARA>
<PARA> Currently Qantas earns a profit. It also earns a great deal of foreign exchange, said to be about $2.5 billion per year. Given the way this country has been driven into such deep indebtedness through the spendthrift policies of this highest taxing and biggest spending government, it is terribly important that that balance of trade be kept up as high as it can be. For Qantas to stay earning that money for us it is important that it earns a profit because if it does not earn a profit there is a limit as to how long it can stay in the marketplace. One of the real problems that Qantas is looking at is that, unless its capitalisation structure is changed, it will not be able to survive into the future. Australia will lose enormously if that happens. </PARA>
<PARA> Last year was the most profitable ever in the history of Qantas. The company declared a profit of around $153m. That has not always been so. In 1982 Qantas lost $20m. In 1983 it lost $47m. From 1984 onwards it has progressively shown increasing profitability. Despite what the Australian Labor Party says, it was not a change of government in 1983 that turned the loss situation into a profit situation; it was the explosion in air travel consequent on the boom in international tourism. For the last four or five years virtually every seat that could be sold to people coming into and out of this country has been filled. Let us look at the economics of aircraft like the Boeing 747 operated by Qantas on long, thin routes where it does not have the penalty of multiple landings that shorter haul operators have. The great majority of routes that Qantas operates on-the Sydney-Tokyo, Sydney-London and Sydney-North America routes-are long, thin routes with very, very few landings on them. Consequently costs are minimised. In normal situations, I would think, the break-even load factor on a Boeing 747 must be somewhere around at least 60 per cent, 62 per cent of seats sold. I believe Qantas is now very close to the maximum attainable figure, which might be 90 or 92 per cent of the seats available on every flight. If that is the case, it should be making a profit. </PARA>
<PARA> While we welcome very much the fact that Qantas made a profit last year, a record profit of $153m, one must put that against the funds that are involved in the company structure. It is said that Qantas currently has a gross asset position of about $27 billion. A profit of $153m on that sum is a pretty meagre return. If we look at it another way round and look at the turnover Qantas had last year of $38 billion, it has averaged in the last five years a 4 per cent profit on a ratio of sales to profit, which is not a very impressive result. The crucial thing from an economic point of view is just how much of Qantas is owned by Qantas. The answer to that is: very, very little. The assets position of Qantas is dangerously low. For many years this Government, which has been in power now for more than six years, has been told that something has to be done about the under-capitalisation of Qantas. </PARA>
<PARA> Running a company is a bit like running a family. A breadwinner, somebody on a good income, can get a mortgage and buy a house or buy a car on hire purchase. In fact, one can take holidays and buy all the things one wants on a credit card. But if that breadwinner gets sick or loses his job, there is a crisis. The Labor Party does not understand the commercial world. It believes that so long as one can borrow one is a good businessman. That is the whole basis of Mr Keating's approach. Every year since he has been running this country as Treasurer he has lost money. He has taken our debt position up to a record level. He started with a figure of about $30 billion. After six years of Keatingism he has blown it out-depending on how one calculates the exchange rate-to between $125 billion and $130 billion. In the six years that he has been Treasurer he has the disastrous record of averaging a loss for Australia of $1 1/4 billion a month. In every month of the Hawke-Keating regime Australia has spent $1,250m more than it has earned. So long as Mr Keating can keep on borrowing he thinks he is the world's best Treasurer. But there is a limit to how long people will lend us money when we are living beyond our means. Just as a family cannot do it, a country cannot do it and no company can do it. There is always a brick wall ahead. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like to return to Qantas. In simple terms, Qantas has borrowed far too much money. Times are good; for the last four or five years it has been making a profit. It can afford to pay the interest on the huge borrowings that it has. But all businesses are cyclical. The Labor Party, with its lack of commercial experience, cannot understand this. It does not matter how good a business is, there are always good times and bad times. It is the bad times that sort out the incompetent operators. At the moment, Qantas cannot service its borrowings without resorting to heavy Government support when the inevitable downturn comes. Times have been good because of the expansion in the tourist traffic but those times could change if there is a downturn in world economies. Inevitably that occurs. We might not like it but it is going to happen. </PARA>
<PARA> For years Qantas has been telling this Government that its debt to equity ratio is wrong. Qantas believes that a comfortable debt to equity ration for it is 70 : 30-in other words, borrowing 70 per cent against 30 per cent of its money. But the Government has failed to support it on that. It is now looking at debt to equity ratios of up to 75 : 25. This is a really dangerous level. The Chairman, Mr Jim Leslie, has repeatedly told the Government that the debt to equity ratio has to be addressed. The Government has not done anything about it. At present it is almost unmanageable. </PARA>
<PARA> If we look ahead we have two matters on the horizon. As a consequence of the ageing Qantas fleet-the average is 9.6 years and honourable senators know that there is an increasing passenger rejection of older aircraft because of the spate of accidents that have occurred on international aircraft-Qantas will be forced to replace those older aircraft just to maintain its public appeal. That is why Australian Airlines had to get rid of its DC9s. The second problem that faces Qantas is the expansion to stay viable in the market. It must expand. We are now in a world of mega airlines. While I am not sure that it has to be one of the mammoth groupings in the world to survive, Qantas certainly has to be larger than it is at present; otherwise it will become a very minor regional carrier in the South Pacific. Qantas knows very well it has to expand. Its target is to go to about a 50-aircraft fleet, roughly double the size it was five or six years ago. That is one of the reasons why it bought into Air New Zealand Ltd. Doubling the size of the airline means greatly increased borrowings. One cannot do that on the minuscule equity basis that the company has at present. </PARA>
<PARA> Even Senator Gareth Evans, the former Minister for Transport and Communications, who was not one of the great financial gurus of the firmament, understood this some years ago. At a Labor Party conference he made the very telling point that just to maintain the equity base- not to pay for the expansion of the company, but to maintain the equity ratio of 70 : 30-Qantas would need an injection of $600m. He asked where it would come from. If Qantas did not expand because it did not have the money, his figures were that, from a position of carrying 44 per cent of the passengers that came into Australia, Qantas would decline to a figure of 28 per cent of the market share in the foreseeable future. A drop of that magnitude will cost Australia a very great deal of money. A 5 per cent drop in that passenger traffic is estimated to cost at least $100m in foreign earnings. From a foreign earnings point of view it is terribly important that Qantas maintain its market share. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Evans, when he was the Minister for Transport and Communications, went on to say that in the foreseeable future Qantas had purchases of new aircraft which would amount to somewhere between $4 billion and $6 billion as well as the infrastructure cost on the ground to support those aircraft. He went on, in reference to the $600m that they would need to put into the Qantas equity pool to support the borrowings for those $4 billion to $6 billion, to say that there was no way that this Government would put that money in and that the only alternative was to privatise the airline; to sell it off. </PARA>
<PARA> Unfortunately the Labor Party has few people in it with the insight to understand what is happening. The great majority of the members of the Labor Party run around saying, `Why should we sell a profitable enterprise? It earned $150m plus. We are not going to sell anything that is making that sort of money'. They lack the ability to understand what is ahead in the market. They do not understand that the only way we can raise the money to keep Qantas a successful Australian enterprise is to go into private enterprise. They do not understand that if we are to go into the market and sell Qantas, the time to do it is when Qantas is making its maximum profits. If it is in the red, if it is losing $40m, $50m or $100m a year, no-one, but no-one, will buy it. The time is right now, particularly as the company is set up as a public company, to move into the marketplace and sell it. </PARA>
<PARA> Every time I go overseas and check my bags in at a Qantas counter the employees behind the counter invariably say to me, `When are we going to get the chance to buy this airline?'. This happens absolutely without exception. When one talks to pilots or cabin crews, they say, `When can we buy this airline?'. The employees of Qantas want to buy it. They should be able to buy it. So should the Australian public have the chance to buy this airline. The only prohibition that the airline employees at the counter put on it is, `Don't let Hawke sell it to Abeles'. They want to be able to take up their share of the equity and they want to see the Australian public join them. That is the realistic way to go. The Government can maintain, through the golden share principle, Australian control of the airline. The xenophobic horror stories of seeing it sold out to the Arabs, the Japanese, the Germans and all the other people that the Labor Party carries on about, are not realistic. The airline can be sold to the Australian public. Australian control can be maintained. Unless it is sold we will not have the capital base to expand Qantas in the next five years, which we must do if we are to keep it as a viable international carrier. </PARA>
<PARA> Apart from capitalisation, Qantas has some other problems. I want to touch on those very briefly. I want to look at it first of all as a traveller. I have been travelling as a passenger with Qantas for well over 25 years. I guess that is longer than some of the board members of Qantas have been travelling on the airline. Now that I am thinking of the board members, I believe that one of the problems Qantas faces is that literally one-third of the board members are Labor Party stooges, people with no commercial or aviation experience, people who have been put on the board of the airline in one of the most ruthlessly competitive international games. They are people whose only claim to fame is the fact that they carry Labor Party membership or are Labor Party sycophants. We simply cannot afford passengers in such a competitive industry. </PARA>
<PARA> Last year I went overseas and travelled by Qantas, because I always fly Qantas wherever I can. Unfortunately, on all but one sector the standard of travel offered to passengers was, in my judgment, the worst I have ever seen, so I made a speech in the Senate about it. Certainly I ruffled a few feelings in Qantas, as some of my friends have subsequently informed me. But it needed to be done and I would have been doing less than my duty if I had not drawn attention to the shortcomings-and in my judgment they were gross shortcomings-in the airline last year. This January I went to a conference in North America and afterwards went on to Europe. I can report that the standard has improved a little. The cabin service is up, the aircraft are a little cleaner, and the ground organisation is a little better. But it is not as good as it was five years ago and, most importantly, it is not as good as the competition. </PARA>
<PARA> Many other airlines are now giving a better standard of service than Qantas is. Some of the board members of Qantas would be well advised to take some of their travel entitlement and travel on the competition, particularly in tourist or economy and in business class. They should compare what is offering in Qantas with that is on offer among their competitors. Most of them would get a shock. The impression I get when travelling Qantas these days is that the morale of the employees is very poor. There is a real need for a bit of leadership there to boost morale and to motivate them. This was once a great airline and it could be again. When one talks to the staff they are depressed because they do not know where the airline is going; they do not know where the money is coming from. </PARA>
<PARA> For all this the Government must take its share of the blame. We have had six years of Labor government and it has failed to address anything in the aviation field. It has failed to address the capitalisation of Qantas, about which I spoke a while ago. It has also failed to address the education market-and education, strangely, has quite an impact on Qantas. This Government has been very keen to throw money at the soft options-the basket makers of Balmain and so on-but we have seen a great collapse in the hard scientific disciplines, the hard intellectual disciplines through the educational program. The teaching of science and maths is at the lowest level it has been for 40 or 50 years in this country. One has only to look at the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO), whose funds have been cut progressively. I hear today that another 500 employees of CSIRO are programmed to be fired. </PARA>
<PARA> Because education is so poor we have a shortage of pilots, a shortage of technicians such as electronics technicians, skilled metal workers and the people needed to run an airline. The only decent training going on in these skills, the hard scientific and technical skills, in the country today is in the Services-in the Air Force for pilot training, radio technicians and airframe fitters, and to a lesser degree in the Army and Navy. The Services are being stripped of these people by the airlines because the Government is not meeting its responsibility to train people for Australian commerce. Although they are excellently trained, in one sense they are inefficiently trained because the requirements of the Services are different and sometimes more advanced than is required for civil use. </PARA>
<PARA> The second problem with the Government's handling of Qantas is its inability to realise that it is not part of the Public Service. It has to have the flexibility it needs to get into the marketplace, to offer the wages and conditions to attract the people it needs. The shortage of staff has led Qantas now, for the first time in its life, to have to farm out its aircraft for maintenance. There are six overseas airlines-Air New Zealand, Singapore Airlines, KLM Royal Dutch Airlines, United Airlines, Air France and Aer Lingus-all doing maintenance work this year for Qantas, at a cost of at least $10m. Qantas is in the position where not only does it not have enough skilled workers but it also has an average attrition rate of 18 per cent. Its experience level has been pretty well halved in the last few years. </PARA>
<PARA> I mention that not only is investment in aircraft required but also a major investment in infrastructure, the building of hangars and workshops and test facilities for the company is needed. In the next few years that will involve the company in expenditure of well over $1 billion, and again that must be financed. In 1982 I suggested that Qantas should start to move out of Sydney. Sydney has become overpopulated and it is too constricted, quite apart from the paralysis of this Government in coping with the runways. Sydney now is built up and it is virtually impossible to build new facilities there. Quite regularly since 1982 I have been putting the case in public that Qantas should move to Brisbane with its maintenance facilities. It is also the logical point of entry into Australia because we find now that nearly 40 per cent of tourists into Australia want to come to Queensland. That percentage will rise, and it will rise above 50 per cent. Brisbane is closer to the sources from which these tourists come than is Sydney or Melbourne, and there is an economic advantage in taking tourists into Brisbane. </PARA>
<PARA> Sadly, we have had no support for this proposition from the Queensland Government, and only in the last month or so has it started to talk about Qantas coming there. But had I had the support of the Queensland Government and the Brisbane City Council, I think there would have been a good chance that Qantas would have considered more seriously the movement to Queensland. Not only is the space available in Brisbane on which to develop and build, but it is also a curfew-free airport and, most importantly, there is a work force there. It is very hard now for any line of commercial activity to get people to move to Sydney because of the huge cost of housing and the great travelling imposition of them. </PARA>
<PARA> In summary, we now have an airline that is grossly overstretched; its management skills are at full tilt; and it is critically and dangerously short of capital. It is essential that the Government recognise the mess in which it has put the company and the inherent dangers of the situation. Unless the Government resorts to the taxpayer when the inevitable downturn comes, the company cannot service its debt position. The Government does not seem to understand this. It is clinging to an outmoded ideology. The Government believes that somehow or other Qantas is owned by all Australians and that if it is sold it will not be owned by all Australians. The truth is that it is owned by the Australian Government on behalf of Australians at present, and by selling it to Australian citizens and Australian companies it will still maintain the same equity which will guarantee its survival into the future. After all, Qantas started as a private company in my own State of Queensland and survived until the Chifley Government nationalised it in the mid-1940s. I formally move:</PARA>
<PARA> At end of motion, add ``, but the Senate calls on the Government to recognize the urgent need to provide additional capital resources for Qantas and to overcome the ideological objections to the sale of shares in the airline to its staff and to the Australian public''. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I agree with much that Senator MacGibbon has said, but not his final conclusion. I do not feel there is any need to privatise Qantas Airways Ltd. If it were privatised the fears expressed by those employees who have been talking to him about Sir Peter Abeles taking over would be realised. I am sure Sir Peter Abeles would be in like a shot. He knows a profitable organisation when he sees one. The operation of Qantas is a very useful bit of activity for the Government and the people of Australia to be engaged in. Qantas, as we all know, has high standards. It serves the country. It brings in foreign exchange.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator MacGibbon has listed a number of these things. He also touched on an area of concern which I would like briefly to reiterate, and that is the lack of maintenance personnel at Qantas. That is probably more due to the low pay regime than the lack of educational opportunities. Qantas simply does not seem to pay enough to keep people in the company. Of course, this comes at a time when the 747 aircraft is under increasing scrutiny because of a lack of safety evident in some aircraft in recent times. The 747s were considered to be completely indestructible, and up until now they have been pretty good. But cracks are starting to show. Most recently people at Boeing, including Mr Ulf Goranson, the manager of structural technology, have stated that the design life of the 747 is 20,000 flights, 60,000 hours or 20 years. Some 68 aircraft have exceeded these limits. One that we need to be concerned about is VH-EBA, which is a Qantas aircraft. It has done 19,000 flights and 59,000 hours, so it is almost up to the limit. It has to be inspected and watched closely. </PARA>
<PARA> Unfortunately Qantas, as Senator MacGibbon has said, does not have the personnel to do all the maintenance work, and some of it is being farmed out. I am told by Qantas pilots as I go overseas that sometimes they are forced to fly the aircraft with unworkable systems. This is not necessarily dangerous because the 747, like all modern aircraft, has a redundant system capability. There is generally at least two of everything, and if one system is not operable the aircraft can still be flown safely. However, this aircraft was designed to have the redundant systems and they should be operable. The industry estimates that Qantas is presently short of 150 personnel in the maintenance area. This is something that should be looked at, but I do not think that selling the airline to Sir Peter Abeles will solve that problem. </PARA>
<PARA> The Qantas Airways Limited (Loan Guarantee) Bill is to enable Qantas to obtain some new Boeing 747-400 aircraft. Unfortunately, these aircraft are not being delivered as rapidly as Qantas or other operators would like because of difficulties in their electronic systems. They are very sophisticated, as noted in the second reading speech. They have a `new technology cockpit' which enables them to be crewed by two pilots. Unfortunately this cockpit is also subject to electronic interference. The pilots found when flying one of these aircraft over a very powerful transmitter in Europe that the electronics went on the blink and they were not quite sure whether they could control the aircraft. Many of these aircraft are still sitting on the ramp at Boeing and will remain there until a suppression mechanism can be installed to shield the electronics from radiation. So it may be a while before we get them. </PARA>
<PARA> The Boeing 747 itself is a wonderful aircraft. I often think, however, being an old-time pilot, that it would be better if we stopped this love affair with electronics and went back to basic pilot skills, with hydraulics and even wire and cable systems, for that matter, and used electronics as indicating devices, letting the pilots fly the aircraft. But I may be a voice in the wilderness and showing my age. I do not know whether Senator MacGibbon would agree with my analysis or not. </PARA>

I agree with many of Senator MacGibbon's comments.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the Senate for its support for the Qantas Airways Limited (Loan Guarantee) Bill. Inevitably the debate, particularly Senator MacGibbon's contribution, turned into an extended recitation of the problems of Qantas's capitalisation. It is certainly a familiar theme for me, as Senator MacGibbon well appreciated when he quoted me, I gather, quite extensively during the course of his contribution. The Government acknowledges that Qantas is playing an extremely significant role in Australia's balance of trade. We want that role to continue in the future. We acknowledge that it is possible for that to occur only in an expanding aviation market and an environment where Qantas has the capacity itself to expand its fleet. We acknowledge the commercial reality that that will involve some improvement in its capital base. The question at issue, as Senator MacGibbon well knows-I certainly well know because I lived with this issue for a year or more as Minister-is just how that can best be achieved. There is no question of our burying our heads in the sand and refusing to acknowledge the nature and extent of the problem. I think we all acknowledge it. Qantas is an issue about which emotions run wide and deep in segments of the community. As a result it is important for us to address the issues carefully and to make sure that we get it right.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Labor governments have certainly in the past not been reluctant to respond quickly to the perceived needs of government owned airlines. Since Qantas was purchased by the Chifley Australian Labor Party (ALP) Government from the British Government and Australian private interests in 1947, the company has received a total of $148.4m in capital injections. Qantas received $66.2m in 10 years of Labor governments and $82.2m from Liberal-National Party, or Country Party, governments over a period of 31 years. I do not think our record has been in any way at fault by comparison with that of the other side. On regaining government in 1983 we moved quickly to address the under-capitalisation problem faced by Qantas. We injected $60m, raising paid up capital from $89.4m to $149.4m-an increase of 67 per cent. We moved with our public sector micro-economic reform package last year to improve the commercial operation of the company. The particular question of capital needs is being addressed by an ALP committee established by the National Conference which is examining the whole range of investment needs and funding options for both Australian Airlines and Qantas. We are also looking at the application of some remaining broad controls, such as the Australian Loan Council, to the fully commercial Commonwealth owned enterprises operating in a competitive environment, of which Qantas is obviously a major example. I am quite happy, as I have been in the past, to engage in an extended debate on these matters at an appropriate time and place. But with an uncontroversial piece of legislation of the kind presently before us and in an environment where the committee to which I referred is still doing its work, I do not think it is helpful for me to wax any more lyrical than I have been on this subject. I think it is inappropriate for that committee's work to be pre-empted at this stage. </PARA>
<PARA> We all know that Qantas has been carrying record numbers of passengers into and out of Australia and that its profit position has improved dramatically as a result, no doubt riding, as it has done, on the wave of massively increased aviation business over the last few years. I simply repeat for the record that we are determined to ensure that Qantas keeps pace with the game. Questions about effective maintenance and so on are ones that both the airline and the Government are wrestling with. We would love to be able to snap our fingers and get on board the extra numbers of maintenance staff that are needed to keep ahead of the game in that respect. But as Senator MacGibbon, Senator Sanders and others should well appreciate, this is an extremely difficult thing to achieve without causing breaches in that dyke of the wage system which we are trying very hard to avoid. </PARA>
<PARA> So it is a matter of being conscious of the whole range of problems that the airline is being confronted with. This particular piece of legislation is, of course, a response initially to current capital raising problems. There need to be some longer term solutions but the time to talk about those in more detail is not now. I commend the legislation to the Senate and thank the chamber for its support, making clear as I do, of course, that we cannot accept, for the reasons that I have already indicated, the Opposition amendment that was moved by Senator MacGibbon.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Ministers of State Amendment Bill 1989 provides for an increase in salaries for Ministers from a total of $745,000 to $820,000. While the total sum might sound quite substantial, in fact I do not believe that it is. The increase that we are approving this evening is some $75,000. If we divide that by 30, which I think is the current number of Ministers, each Minister would receive an increase of $2,750. This is not a particularly substantial amount when tax is taken out. The increases are required to be approved by the Parliament, as the Ministers of State Act requires legislative amendment to increase ministerial salaries. This increase has resulted from two reviews conducted by the Remuneration Tribunal in 1987 and 1988. The Opposition does not intend to oppose this Bill.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There are one or two matters, though, that ought to be looked at. It is always difficult to deal with parliamentary salaries. Somehow this subject always generates a very emotional response in sections of the community and sections of the media, frequently from those members of the media who get far more substantial salaries than do any of us in this place. Let me put into perspective some of the salaries that are the subject of this legislation. The Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) has a base salary of $55,000 and an additional $56,931, which gives him a total salary of $111,931. At the same time, the head of his Department gets $100,402. I think a very good case can be made out for saying that while we are not in any way putting down the position or role of head of his Department, the Prime Minister's salary is sufficiently near that salary as to be not reasonable. </PARA>
<PARA> But the story gets far worse. The basic salary and allowances of the Treasurer (Mr Keating) bring his total salary to $86,016. But the Secretary to the Treasury receives a salary of $100,402. The Minister for Social Security (Mr Howe) receives a total salary of $80,747; the Secretary to the Department of Social Security receives $92,343. The Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Mr Humphreys) receives a total salary of $80,747; the Secretary to his Department gets $92,343. So of the four I have mentioned-the Prime Minister, the Treasurer, the Minister for Social Security and the Minister for Veterans' Affairs-three receive less than the heads of their own departments. </PARA>
<PARA> I have not mentioned these figures to suggest in any way that the heads of their departments are being paid more than they ought to be. The number of recent resignations by secretaries to departments and senior public servants would indicate that they are able to obtain more substantial salaries in the private sector. I suggest that one does not need to read many newspapers to find out that in fact men of that ability are able to earn and do earn more in the private sector. What is not adequate, of course, are the salaries of the Ministers to whom I have referred. Their salaries are a sample of what is being paid. </PARA>
<PARA> I am somewhat bothered that if we continue to do what has in fact been done on a number of occasions over the last 10 years, we will finish up with parliamentary salaries being so low that we will have done a great disservice to the democratic process and the institution of parliament. I believe that all of us here should accept the responsibility and have the fortitude to recognise what we need to do. We need to pass on to our children and grandchildren a parliamentary system which works. On a number of occasions since the Remuneration Tribunal was established in 1973, the Parliament has decreased the salaries which have been recommended. In fact, by doing so, we have held salaries down. If this continues, we run the risk that the only people who will be members of parliament will be those under patronage or those who are sufficiently wealthy in their own right to be here. We will significantly change the process that has been developed since this Parliament was established in 1901. </PARA>
<PARA> I know that it is fashionable to criticise politicians and criticise their salaries. But sooner or later, if those in the Parliament do not have the courage to stand up and say what needs to be said, we will be sorry and we will be subject to criticism by those who come after us. </PARA>
<PARA> I briefly want to refer to a book called Fair Enough which came into my hands just recently.This book, which is written by Roger Holdich, deals with possible changes in the way in which salaries and allowances for Australian parliamentarians are set and administered. It is a summary of Roger Holdich's discussions and investigations while he was overseas on a senior executive fellowship which was completed in mid-1988. He compares salaries and allowances and the manner of fixing and determining them in the United States of America, Canada, the United Kingdom, the Republic of Ireland, France, Italy and the European Parliament. He deals with the questions of both salaries and allowances and how they should be set and how they should be administered. He points out:</PARA>
<PARA>The upshot has been a substantial slippage in politicians' salaries. Six years ago a backbencher received roughly the same salary as a Senior Executive Service level two public servant. At the end of 1988, the latter received $57,775, or 17% more than the backbencher. </PARA>
<PARA>He suggests some changes and says:</PARA>
<PARA>If wage justice is to be achieved and maintained, parliamentary salaries should be linked to those of a less contentious group, such as the public service; or the Government should accept that the power to decide levels of salaries of parliamentarians resides with the Remuneration Tribunal, and that there should be no questioning by government or Parliament of the umpire's decision. </PARA>
<PARA>I recommend this book to anyone who is interested in the topic. He goes on to list a number of other characteristics and matters that should be taken into account when assessing these matters. In referring to other countries, he mentions those that have attached their parliamentary salaries to less controversial groups. </PARA>
<PARA> Frequently it is said that one politician may be worth more than another and that that makes it difficult to decide what the salary should be. Since I have been in the Senate I have met few who have not been energetic and hardworking. We do not find the same criteria taken into account in assessing other's salaries. When we are assessing teachers' salaries, for example, we do not decide the amount which will be paid to the whole group based on whether they are particularly diligent or not. I know of no other group in the community in respect of which that is taken into account in the same way as some would suggest it ought to be when assessing politicians' salaries. Mr Holdich says:</PARA>
<PARA>I would strongly support linkage with an appropriate level of the Senior Executive Service of the Australian Public Service. Alternatively, the Government should accept that the power to decide salaries of parliamentarians resides with the Remuneration Tribunal, and should accept the determinations of that body. In this way the salaries are more likely to rise as a result of an assessment of what is equitable rather than what is politically expedient. </PARA>
<PARA>It is necessary to see that senior public servants-in fact, all public servants, judges and others who are serving the community-are remunerated properly; and it is time that we put our heads together and worked out a system that ensures that our democratic process will continue. This book has extracts, details and information about the salary setting in all of the countries that I have referred to. As I said, I recommend it to anyone who is interested in this topic. The increase in salary relates to ministerial salaries only and it is not opposed by the Opposition. In fact, it is not a particularly substantial amount. But I believe that there are far more significant issues that the Parliament needs to look at on the question of parliamentary salaries. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Ministers of State Amendment Bill 1989 relates to the increases that are necessary and must be passed by this form of legislation to allow the Ministers of State the salary rises and allowance rises that flowed through to members through the Remuneration Tribunal's determination of last year. The last time I spoke on this piece of legislation I pointed out that Ministers of State, as a group, could be seen as the group worst off, with regard to salaries and allowances, of all members of the Federal Parliament.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The reasons for that are many and varied; but, if one looks at the structure of Ministers' pay, one finds not only the salary of a Minister as a member of parliament and the electoral allowance component that is also available to all members of parliament, but also a salary of office component and a ministerial allowance component. The last two are such that, when one looks at the total taxation of the package that arose through legislation passed by this Parliament with regard to the fringe benefits arrangements, undoubtedly most Ministers now would find it extremely difficult to be able to detail, under the taxation law, any deductions with regard to the ministerial allowances. </PARA>
<PARA> Ministers of State, under any government and any political party, will be working extremely long hours and in extremely onerous jobs. It is obvious that anybody who retains a ministry in any government, against the types of pressures that come from the back bench, must be performing and must be seen to be performing. So, there are a number of pressures that keep Ministers in there working, not least of which presumably is their desire to stay as Ministers and the desire of many people that they might move on. </PARA>
<PARA> On top of that there are the demands of this place. We have seen in recent days one Minister make an explanation with regard to the changing of the Hansard record. When we look at that item in isolation, as we were required to, the justification for the Senate passing a censure motion is obvious, and I voted for that. But, when we look at it in the totality of all the other things, we can well see how an item such as that may slip by. But that is no excuse and cannot be offered as an excuse in this place. In other words, on top of the normal workload there is that additional demand of ministerial responsibility under the Westminster system. </PARA>
<PARA> On top of that there are the normal types of pressures that are put on anybody operating in a job with that type of responsibility, the normal stresses and strains, the normal departmental problems which have to be solved and which may flow through to the Minister, and the normal activities of the Minister of receiving delegations of overseas visitors. Added to those is the necessity for the Ministers to attend conferences, to speak at conferences, to visit various parts of the Commonwealth with regard to their own portfolio and to receive delegations of interest groups and individuals from the community. </PARA>
<PARA> When we start adding these items together, it does not take long to see that the task of a Minister is not a simple and easy one, and it is one that the Commonwealth and of the people of Australia certainly all wish to have done well. I think that under those circumstances the remuneration that is offered is not commensurate with the job that we demand to be done. In fact I remember sitting with the Minister at the table tonight, the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade (Senator Gareth Evans), at a table at a conference in a hotel in this city a couple of years ago, when this particular item came up. The other people at the table were directors and managing directors of companies in Australia. The Minister was giving the keynote address, and I think he was receiving the second lowest salary of anybody at the table. The person who was getting a lower one was, of course, me. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="2I4">Senator MACKLIN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, but the Minister was the person who was ultimately responsible for the policy decisions that were going to flow through and affect all of those people who were there from the companies. To me, that was an example of the absurdities that can come about when there is not a market link to the job that is required.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator Reid pointed to a particular document that has been generated in recent times. It certainly is an interesting document, and I join with her in recommending that people go through it. However, I remember a previous document circulated in the British Parliament which made the unerring discovery that seats in the House of Commons could be filled for no salary whatsoever. That is true as well; for a long time they were. In other words, it is notoriously difficult to find for a backbencher an adequate linkage in the market arrangement. I am not at all sure that that is the case with Ministers of State. It is fairly obvious that there are corporations within Australia and overseas of the size of our departments. In fact, some corporations are easily the size of the nation. </PARA>
<PARA> When one looks at the salary packages that are provided to some of those people, one gets an idea of the enormous remuneration packages available. I understand that the highest remuneration package provided to an Australian chief executive is of the order of $800,000. That is an extraordinary amount of money in anybody's terms. When one goes down the line and looks at some of our public servants one sees that our Prime Minister is paid less than quite a number of our public servants, who admittedly are running large corporations under the public umbrella. Nevertheless they are public corporations, and the Prime Minister is the one who is held ultimately responsible for the health of the general economy and the social economy of the country. </PARA>
<PARA> It is a fair and reasonable proposition, although it is always unpopular, that the salaries of Ministers of State need to be put on a much more market oriented scale. At some stage it will have to occur; at some stage it will undoubtedly happen. There will probably be belly-aches from the editors of the major newspapers, all of whom get two or three times what Ministers currently get. That has to be worn. But at the end of the day, to do anything less is to sell the job short because our society wishes to provide remuneration on the basis of the job that is done. It is not as though the Ministers, in the jobs they do, are somehow immune from accountability. As I have already pointed out, there is a large range of ways in which Ministers are held accountable-by their colleagues, by the normal arrangements of their departments, by the Parliament, and by the people. </PARA>
<PARA> The general proposition that everybody ought to be able to accept is that a Minister of State should not be paid less than the secretary to the department he administers. That is not the case at the moment. Ministers of State should be paid more than the secretaries to their departments and their remuneration package should be more than that of the secretaries to their departments. How much more will be a matter which will be determined some years hence, when some sanity comes into this area. At present we ought to say that that is the basis upon which the salaries should be determined. I have been looking at these matters in recent times, and it seems to me that one fair way of doing it would be to have the salary package of the secretary to the department plus 15 per cent, that 15 per cent to be delivered as a ministerial package, as it were, so that the Minister as the senior person receives the highest salary in a departmental structure. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not expect that these matters will ever be discussed with sanity-certainly not for some time, although I must admit that last time round I was quite surprised by some journalists' comments on this matter. It struck me that at last somebody was starting to look and listen and calculate the context in a more reasonable and rational way rather than take the easy line, which is to knock the type of work any politician has to do. I have never subscribed to the notion that if we raise the salaries we will necessarily get better people. That is an argument which really has no bearing on the matter. </PARA>
<PARA> What one is looking for is the job to be competently done and to be paid appropriately, because the pay and allowances within our society indicate the worth we wish to put on the job. I would have thought that the worth we wish to put on the jobs done by Ministers and by the Prime Minister is such that we would want them to be paid amongst the top salaries in our society. Certainly we believe they should be paid the same types of salaries as executives of top public corporations. Certainly a Minister should be paid more than the person who is heading up the department the Minister has to bear the brunt of and for which he bears the responsibility. As I said, at some stage that will occur, but it is probably some years off. Hopefully it will come about. </PARA>
<PARA> On that basis we support the Bill before the Senate. We regret that we have not yet managed to get over the normal political hiccups that occur in this matter. Presumably at some stage sanity will strike and we will be able to deal with this subject on a saner basis. </PARA>

Sir Llew was Chairman of World Expo 88. In that speech he spoke beyond Expo and gave to all of us who have had an opportunity to read the speech a real message worthy of further note.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Sir Llew looked at Expo in light of the extent of the challenge that was ahead of him, in particular, the fact that there had not been an exposition in the Southern Hemisphere in 100 years, the problems of isolation, particularly perceived as such by the Europeans, and an uninterested and cynical media. His approach was that those involved should roll up their sleeves, plan, work towards success and develop to ensure success. He made mention in this speech that there was no Commonwealth money involved, and yet the organisers were able to put together a budget of $620m. He said the Expo would make a profit, and it did. He noted that not one hour was lost in industrial dispute and that they were able to negotiate to operate without penalty rates or overtime. Everything was finished on schedule and on target. The reasons were that they believed in the project, they had a vision and they worked and fought to achieve it. As we all know, it was a wonderful success. </PARA>
<PARA> Sir Llew puts it in the form of four principles which would apply to anything that is done in this country if success is the real objective: firstly, the need for a belief in the project; secondly, the need to strive after excellence; thirdly, anything can be achieved if there is involved sufficient generation of national pride; and finally, it can be achieved if those who are in a decision making capacity respect and value the dignity of people. He put it in terms that he, in his own position as Chairman, had no greater importance in the project than the cleaners. He said:</PARA>
