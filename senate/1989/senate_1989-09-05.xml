<PARA> Medicare cannot pretend to be a Universal health care system without providing a rebate for a termination of pregnancy.

<TITLE>Charter of Residents' Rights</TITLE>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="3I4">Senator McLEAN</NAME><ELECTORATE>(New South Wales)</ELECTORATE></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-I present to the Senate the following petitioning letter bearing 53 signatures and requesting that legislation to implement the proposed charter of residents' rights, as recommended in the report of residents' rights in nursing homes and hostels, be rejected:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>Dear Mr McLean</PARA>
<PARA>The viability of the nursing home industry's very existence is totally threatened under current Federal Government policy. The great care and compassion that we continue to give to the sick and elderly in our nursing homes is being undermined by the Hawke Government in Canberra.</PARA>
<PARA>Under the guise of ``reforms'' we are suffering financial and staffing cuts to our nursing homes. The Federal Government is making it medically harder and harder for the sick elderly to pass medical assessments to obtain admission to nursing homes.</PARA>
<PARA>We can only presume they are supporting their clearly stated goal to see the sick aged back in the family home and the responsibility of relatives at no cost to the government.</PARA>
<PARA>We are particularly concerned to stop legislation of the proposed Patients Bill of Rights which comes out of the Government report ``Residents Rights in Nursing Homes and Hostels''. If legislated all residents would be forced to sign a contract as part of pre-admission procedure. In this contract there are innumerable issues which could create horrendous legal problems for directors of nursing, staff and proprietors. For example, no resident (even if highly dangerous) will be able to be evicted from the home for a minimum of 42 days. Likewise, if all residents have total freedom in social and personal relationships it will be extremely difficult for staff to censure the undesirable behaviour that does occur with some residents.</PARA>
<PARA>Some of the sick elderly in our care are not emotionally well. Yet they will have a contract of rights and external avenues to complain and appeal as they wish against any staff decisions made in the interests of the home.</PARA>
<PARA>The administration and documentation which will be required by the contract will take up valuable time for staff who have already lost many of the hours they need for nursing care. If the contract is legislated there will be implications which are dangerous to staff and residents. For example, dementia patients will have the right to wander and do great harm to themselves and others. Smoking in bed could burn the home down.</PARA>
<PARA>There will be feelings of mistrust and uncertainty created between staff and residents. Who will look after staff rights or pay for the legal representation they will certainly require?</PARA>
<PARA>Many of the recommendations in the report cost money, particularly extra material luxuries such as more variety in menus, telephones, furniture etc. If they are legislated, who will pay for their implementation? Many nursing homes, particularly smaller ones, are already closing through the government's monetary cuts. Yet, it is surely these smaller homes which could offer a more individual and homelike environment.</PARA>
<PARA>All recommendations in this report are already legislated in the Outcome Standards which are regularly inspected and enforced by Government Standards Monitoring Teams. Clearly there is no need for this further legislation.</PARA>
<PARA>It is a ploy under the guise of a Patients Bill of Rights to take away large amounts of money from the elderly. Mr Staples, Minister for Housing and Aged Care, will have achieved total control and regulation of all aspects of our industry if this legislation goes through. He totally ignored the huge amount of industry concern and submissions which were aroused by the draft report ``I'm Still an Individual''. The content of the final report clearly shows the whole exercise has been completed by people with virtually no understanding of the functioning of a nursing home.</PARA>
<PARA>We are concerned at the continuous putting down of the good work we do. Staff morale is at an all time low and current Federal policy makes it more and more difficult to attract or keep our caring workers. We ask you to support us in fighting this Bill in its present form with its horrendous legal and functioning problems.</PARA>
<PARA>Yours faithfully.</PARA>

As far as the letter supposedly or purportedly written by Mr Charles Perkins is concerned, quite clearly I have not had an opportunity to peruse that, though I have seen a newspaper article today which, I take it, draws on the contents of that letter. Senator Chaney indicated that he would be tabling that letter, but obviously I have not had a chance to peruse it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As to the substance of the matters concerned, following the publication of the article in the Australian it has been a matter of importance to the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs to refresh his memory as to the sequence of events about that time. He has done so and has discussed the matter with the Prime Minister. The Minister for Aboriginal Affairs gave a categorical personal assurance to the Prime Minister that the answer he gave in the House on 13 October and the answer given by the Minister representing him in the Senate-that is me-on 14 October are accurate. The Prime Minister has accepted that assurance.</PARA>
<PARA> The Minister has made the following points to the Prime Minister which established crucial inaccuracies in the article. I might mention some of them. Mr Perkins is quoted as saying that on the Saturday night a week before the meeting of the ADC he had a telephone conversation from Alice Springs with the Minister, who was at Marla Bore in South Australia. The article states that `that would be 1 October'. But the Minister was not even at Marla Bore on 1 October; he was in Melbourne. There was no telephone call from Mr Perkins to the Minister, who was attending various Victorian State election functions. If the Saturday night referred to was 8 October, again Mr Hand was not at Marla Bore but in Victoria. The Minister did travel to Marla Bore on Sunday, 2 October, but the Prime Minister has been informed by the Minister that he had no conversation with Mr Perkins. Mr Perkins did telephone Marla Bore but he spoke only to the then State Director for South Australia concerning transport arrangements.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am aware that there are nine Australian companies operating in South Africa but I am not in a position to name eight of them, for reasons I will explain in the course of this answer. In August 1986, the Prime Minister called on Australian investors to refrain from new investment in South Africa or the reinvestment of profits earned in South Africa. Those Australian companies that have subsidiaries in South Africa are not pressed by Australian law to sell them or close them down. They are, however, requested to follow a voluntary code of conduct with regard to their non-white workers. On 31 May this year I tabled in Parliament the second report of the Administrator of the Code of Conduct for Australian Companies with interests in the Republic of South Africa, the Administrator being Mr Ron Bannerman, the former Trade Practices Commissioner. Mr Bannerman reported that seven Australian companies come within the terms of the code-five fully owned, one 60 per cent owned and one 49 per cent owned. Those seven companies employ 745 black workers between them.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Mr Bannerman has also recently discovered an eighth franchised company with two black employees but he was not able to seek full information for it to be included in his report. In addition to those eight companies, there are the interests in South Africa held by the Broken Hill Proprietary Co. Ltd group, publicly declared in Mr Bannerman's report, and a 22 per cent Australian shareholding in a South African goldmining company. The report does not name those companies with interests in South Africa that have voluntarily disclosed their role there, as the code of conduct promises confidentiality to those companies that provide information to the Administrator in his monitoring capacity. This confidentiality has helped ensure general industry support for the code, which is of course voluntary.</PARA>
<PARA> I just want to say two or three things in conclusion. Australia's commercial presence in South Africa is not only small but, in fact, it is declining. The disinvestment list included by Mr Bannerman in his report shows the extent to which that presence has contracted during his term as Administrator. Mr Bannerman concludes that the importance of Australia's commercial presence in South Africa is, in practical terms, close to nil. Mr Bannerman also notes that the companies on which he has reported represent the core of the companies likely to remain in South Africa. He does not however rule out the possibility of another divestiture within the next year.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In 1987 the Economic Planning Advisory Council (EPAC) published a report on international trading services which, based on an assessment by Professor Goldring, showed that some $105m was earned in total from education services provided in Australia to foreigners. That was a 1983 estimate. EPAC estimated that each full fee paying student would contribute around $17,000 a year to export earnings other than fees and other expenses. A Bureau of Industry Economics (BIE) study released more recently estimated that for the 1987 calendar year the earnings from fees and living expenses of overseas students was around $120m but Austrade, more recently again, with the assistance of the Australian Bureau of Statistics, surveyed Australian institutions which enrolled full fee paying overseas students in 1987. It concluded that earnings from tuition fees alone had risen by nearly 400 per cent from 1987 to the calendar year 1988. The BIE calculated that earnings would have at least doubled in 1988 to between $240m and $270m. That figure is expected to continue growing.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As at 30 June 1989 there were some 32,000 full fee paying overseas students in Australia, of whom 826 were enrolled in South Australia. In South Australia the figure has almost doubled from that of the previous year. Senator Foreman asked about South Australia in particular. I am advised that South Australia has an innovative approach to higher education marketing. The Office of Tertiary Education has established an overseas student promotional group which tends to market as a group rather than independently. It offers a complete spectrum of services from secondary to tertiary graduates. In South Australia, Flinders University, the South Australian Office of Tertiary Education, the Ministry of Education, the University of Adelaide, the South Australian Department of Technical and Further Education and the South Australian College of Advanced Education are involved in the marketing and promotion of courses offshore. Some have specific budgetary allocations. One institution sets that figure at 15 per cent of the full fee revenue.</PARA>

Has the Minister been able to evaluate a recent proposal by the Australian Association of Permanent Building Societies (AAPBS) which claims to be revenue neutral or, better still, revenue positive, yet encourages domestic savings by taxing at source all non-superannuation interest earnings at a rate of between 15 per cent and 20 per cent? Does the Minister agree that if the AAPBS proposal is realistically costed, its implementation will increase interest revenue collected by the Australian Taxation Office because the latest national account data shows total interest receipts by households at $17 billion while tax data shows that only $8 billion of interest was declared for tax purposes?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA> I will comment on one or two points raised in the honourable senator's question. He drew a discrepancy between the alleged level of savings as estimated by the Australian Bureau of Statistics and tax data which shows that only $8 billion of the $17 billion saved by households was declared for tax purposes. I just make the point that it is not easy to draw the conclusion from that that it is all because people are not paying tax on income from savings. The larger figure which appears in the national account includes partnerships, whereas the $8 billion does not. It includes children and a whole range of people who might otherwise not be eligible to pay tax. I am not sure that the honourable senator can draw the conclusion he appeared to draw in the third part of his question. The question requires a detailed evaluation of the proposal by the AAPBS.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I did see a report along those lines in this morning's Australian Financial Review. It is impossible not to have some sympathy with those members of the Liberal Party who are somewhat aghast at the lack of talent, particularly that being displayed by their Leader. It goes even beyond the lack of talent to the lack of understanding of almost any policy of any consequence. Therefore, it is quite easy to understand why Mr Tuckey would want to see a person with more talent and competence or, may I say, even diligence occupying that position. The name most frequently floated as a non-parliamentary successor-that is, somebody who is not presently inside the Parliament and therefore apparently satisfied with the present remuneration-and the most frequent extraparliamentary pretender to the Liberal Party leadership appears to be unwilling to enter parliament at current pay rates.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The question then arises: How much more would he have to be paid before he was willing to enter Parliament? Some light may be shed on that by an article published in the Melbourne Herald on Monday, 26 June this year, when Terry McCrann estimated that it would cost Mr John Elliott roughly $44m net to enter Federal Parliament. That cost arises from Mr Elliott's 1c paid shares. Mr McCrann wrote:</PARA>
<PARA>You see Mr Elliott got rather too ambitious back in 1987-or rather the Board felt he needed a lot of incentivising. For it-</PARA>

<PARA>There were about 15 million of those shares, so that contingent liability amounts to nearly $85m gross.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Knowles wants to know what she said. I can satisfy that request. Her exact words were:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>When the Government looks at the effect of the assets test and many other measures that it has taken it will see that many more pensioners are in dire financial straits than there were some years ago.</PARA>
<PARA>In making that statement she has entered some data free area. The facts are that 64 per cent of all people of pensionable age receive a full pension; that is, their non-pension income is within the free area and is not counted for income test purposes. Principally and overwhelmingly, what matters to these people is the size of the pension and, a bit at the margin, the size of the free area. For those people to whom the size of the pension is the critical factor, it should be noted that in March 1983 the standard pension and equivalent payments stood at less than 23 per cent of average weekly earnings. This year they will rise, unequivocally, to above 25 per cent of average weekly earnings. In addition, there have been very substantial increases in the rent allowance for pensioners who have to pay private rent-an increase in real terms of some 74 per cent and, in those cases where pensioners have dependent children, a real increase of some 39 per cent. I made a speech last week which included this and a number of other facts, a copy of which I will consider sending to Senator Knowles so that she can revise her knowledge of this matter.</PARA>
<PARA> I was also asked what it would cost to abolish the assets test. It is possible to come up with different figures, depending on what assumptions one wishes to use. But on any reasonable assessment, the cost of abolishing the assets test would be at least $600m a year. If the proportion of people of pensionable age were still the same today as it was when the assets test was introduced and other things had remained equal, it would cost an extra $600m a year to abolish the assets test. I suggest that the actual cost, had that change not been made in 1984, would have been significantly higher because there was a clear rising trend among the people of pensionable age to qualify for pensions. In other words, people of that age group, in the absence of an assets test but with an income test, were changing their assets from income earning assets to assets which accrued capital gains. Undoubtedly, that process would have gone on had it not been for the changes that were made in 1984. So it is $600m plus. It is difficult to say how big the plus is, but it could well be another $700m, bringing the total cost of Senator Knowles's proposition up to around $1 billion a year.</PARA>
<PARA> Senator Knowles was elected in 1984 when about the only clear policy the Opposition seemed to have was Mr Peacock's populist policy of abolishing the assets test. However, it appears that even Mr Peacock has dropped that one now. If he has not done that, I would appreciate advice from the Opposition that Mr Peacock still intends to abolish the assets test. I would ask how the Opposition reconciles that with the calls from just about everybody else on the Opposition front bench for more targeted welfare expenditure.</PARA>

I refer the Minister to his denial yesterday that any financial arrangements had been made in support of the airline companies during the pilots dispute.

<PARA>Well, I think that there is an understanding that if there are going to be large costs incurred, that there would be some question of offsets-but obviously there are many different ways to approaching that.</PARA>
<PARA>Will the Minister tell the Senate the nature of the understanding referred to by Mr Strong? Does this mean that, short of direct financial assistance at this stage, the Government is, through other means, helping the airlines offset the cost of the dispute?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The quotation from that interview with Mr Strong is about as vague and as elliptical as one can get. I was asked here yesterday what compensation-I think Senator Chaney used another word in addition to `compensation'; he used two words, but `compensation' was the essence of it-had been promised to the airlines in respect of losses incurred in this dispute. I said yesterday, and I adhere to what I said, that the Government had made two sets of responses to that. The first was in respect of arrangements for moving passengers. In that regard, the Government had assisted with the negotiations to obtain the services of overseas aircraft to help move passengers. The Government had also assisted by making the services of the Royal Australian Air Force available to help move passengers. I went on to say that, in respect of compensation, so-called, the Government did receive late last week applications from the airlines for some form of financial assistance in respect of their losses. Those matters have yet to be considered by the Government.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce and refers to genetic engineering. Is it true that Australian law does not prevent the patenting of any genetic material, plant or animal, including human, and/or the plants or animals in which that genetic material has been placed? Does the Government encourage the patenting of genetic material where that appears profitable? Is it therefore true that Australian law allows, and the Government would encourage, the patenting of animals including animals containing any number of human genes? Does the Government have reservations about this imminent possibility and does it intend to legislate in this area before the technology is applied?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I gave an answer to a similar question from Senator Powell on 30 November 1988. I said that the usual requirements of the Patents Act apply for applications for patents in respect of animals. I refer Senator Coulter to that answer and to the further information, particularly the last paragraphs which I had incorporated in Hansard at the time. The same answer applies to the patenting of any genetic material, plant or animal, including human, and/or the plants or animals in which that genetic material has been placed. I repeat that the Patent, Trade Marks and Designs Office would refuse any patent application for a human being.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As to encouraging the patenting of genetic material or plants or animals, the Government encourages the development of genetic engineering just as it encourages the development of other technologies generally in Australia. The patent system serves to encourage inventions and technological developments of all kinds and the transfer of technology between Australia and other countries. The Government encourages the use of that system where this is considered appropriate by inventors. There is nothing in the patenting of genetic material per se that is objectionable but there may be specific instances which could be inherently objectionable. The Patents Office has and should have a neutral role in this regard. The Commissioner of Patents can refuse to grant a patent on an invention where the use of the invention would be contrary to law. This would clearly be the case if the invention in question were a human being.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Government is entertaining the question of admitting uncooked Canadian pig meat to the Australian market, although it has not at this point made a decision as to whether it will do so or not. I am aware, as Senator Giles has suggested, of industry concern about this. I suggest, though, that the industry concern that is currently being expressed is premature. The industry has been consulted quite extensively and the basis upon which the Government will make any decision relies on three matters: first, the risk of entry of disease with uncooked Canadian pig meat; second, the cost of the disease to the Australian industry should it become established; and, third, the commercial impact of imports on the domestic industry.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The risk of disease being transmitted has been assessed scientifically at one in three million on the worst case scenario.

<PARA> The decision will be made entirely and utterly on quarantine grounds and not on the grounds of any concerns about competition in the trade or trade-based concerns. I say that because Australia has been very active in the present General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade Uruguay Round of trade negotiations in pushing for the reduction of tariffs and non-tariff barriers. If any trade-based decision were made we would be held up as an example of the type of thing we have been opposing in international forums.</PARA>

<PARA>We will abolish all export controls on the minerals and metals sector including those applicable to iron ore. The only exception to this being uranium as specified in section 9.</PARA>
<PARA>In the absence of export controls there would be no mechanism through which the Federal Government would be able to prevent the product of sand mining on Fraser Island being exported. Thus, it would lack the power to prevent what the Queensland Government has done since 1987 in renewing the leases for sand mining on Fraser Island. We have an obvious commitment from the Queensland Government in that, despite the fact that there was no public consultation, and despite the fact that compensation was paid after the Fraser Government ban on sand mining on Fraser Island, it reissued the mining leases in 1987. If the Opposition's resource and minerals policy were to be implemented there would be no controls over the export of that mining output. Thus I can answer the question from Senator Burns by saying that if there was a coalition government there would certainly be export of mineral sands from the Fraser Island mining development.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As I said in Paris last week, the outcome of the conference on Cambodia was disappointing and depressing in so far as it did fail to achieve its objective of reaching a comprehensive settlement of the Cambodian problem. The inability of the Cambodian parties themselves to reach agreement on power sharing was the principal stumbling block to achieving that comprehensive settlement. Nevertheless, it has to be said that, even bearing in mind that failure to reach the principal objective of achieving a comprehensive settlement here and now, the conference was not by any means a complete failure. Considerable work was done over the course of the last months in the various committees that were established in that conference to identify mandates for any international control mechanism that might be established, to establish procedures for a ceasefire, to identify international guarantees for the sovereignty, independence, neutrality and territorial integrity of Cambodia, to identify conditions conducive to the return of refugees and displaced persons and to identify the principles that should govern post-settlement reconstruction assistance. I should say that those reconstruction principles were unanimously agreed in the committee that was jointly chaired by Australia and Japan.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Moreover, the conference explicitly resolved that it not be wound up at the end of last week but that the co-chairmen-the foreign ministers of France and Indonesia-should hold consultations within the next six months on reconvening the conference when conditions seem more propitious. The co-chairmen have also been given continuing authority to facilitate discussions between the various parties and to reconvene committees as appropriate in the meantime.</PARA>
<PARA> Australia played a very active role throughout the conference, putting very strongly the view that it was important to maintain the momentum of the conference process in order to reassure the Cambodian parties of the commitment of the international community to a comprehensive settlement, to keep focusing on confidence building measures, including measures involving further work on the structure and role of the proposed international control mechanism, and to design such measures to help move the Cambodian parties to the point of willingness to make the necessary compromises with each other that they are manifestly unprepared to at the moment.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;A couple of days ago Senator Boswell asked me a question about imports of canned pineapples and what I intended to do about that matter. It had been reported in the press that the Australian pineapple processing industry was concerned at processed pineapple imports from developing countries. Canned pineapple imports in 1988-89 were 10.4 million litres valued at $6.7m. Imports increased 30 per cent in volume and 21 per cent in value compared with the position in 1987-88. In the same year, 1987-88, total sales were valued at $183m and exports from Australia were valued at $18.8m-about three times the value of imports.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Australian pineapples are processed at the Golden Circle Cannery at Northgate in Brisbane where production is predominantly of pineapple products. Based on 1987-88 canned pineapple production, imports represented only about 13 per cent of the domestic market. Canned pineapple products are principally imported from the developing countries of Thailand, the People's Republic of China, Indonesia and the Philippines. In 1981 Golden Circle rejected a request by G. J. Coles &amp; Co. Ltd to package pineapple under the Coles Farmland label. Golden Circle insisted that it would only market product under its own brand name. Coles and other supermarket chains subsequently placed orders with overseas suppliers that were prepared to meet their requirements and this has contributed to the increase in imports.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Last Thursday Senator Messner asked me a question about self-assessment of corporate tax. The Treasurer's office has given me a reply. I have shown it to Senator Messner, and I seek leave to incorporate it in Hansard.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Leave granted.</PARA>
<PARA> The answer read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA> (i) to (iv) The Government is to introduce a full system of self assessment for company taxpayers. Under that system, companies, in addition to calculating their taxable income as they do now, will also calculate the tax payable and pay that amount to the Tax Office. As companies are subject only to a single rate of tax, the additional calculation for them will be straightforward.</PARA>
<PARA> As announced in the Budget, under these arrangements the Tax Office will no longer issue notices of assessment. Instead the system will be along the lines of that applying to fringe benefits tax. Under the new arrangements, where a return is lodged by a company, the Commissioner of Taxation will be deemed to have made an assessment to which all of a taxpayer's existing rights of objection and appeal will apply. In other words, the changes will not adversely affect taxpayers' rights under the present law.</PARA>
<PARA> In themselves, therefore, these are not significant changes from the existing self assessment system for companies, but they do present an opportunity for major improvements in efficiency. Reflecting that, it is expected that company returns of the future will seek far less information than in the past. And in further developing these new proposals, the Commissioner of Taxation will be consulting with appropriate parties.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to answer three questions asked of me in recent days by Opposition senators. The first is a question asked by Senator Chapman on 1 September concerning uniforms of service personnel. I am advised by the Minister for Defence as follows: occasions arise where members are not able to be provided with their full entitlement of uniforms and personal equipment. This usually occurs for one of the following reasons: firstly, the individual's size or shape may preclude issue of standard size items from within Army stocks; for example, a shoe larger than size 14 requires special purchase from a manufacturer. Secondly, some items of clothing and accoutrements, such as hat badges and corps embellishments, vary in supply availability due to quality assurance, funds availability and manufacturing supply problems. The soldier in this case is quite tall and has in fact outgrown his polyester uniform, which was withdrawn from him in May 1989. This soldier is entitled to a replacement polyester uniform at Commonwealth expense and he will be so issued. Army is presently faced by shortages in a range of clothing and personal equipment and is taking action to remedy this by transferring funds from other votes.</PARA></TALK.START>

The Minister for Defence has expressed interest in facilitating access by tourists to the many defence facilities which are now being developed in northern Australia. He believes that this will not only provide an added attraction to tourists to our Top End, but also enhance the community's understanding of our defence posture and capabilities. Obviously this proposal will need to be carefully studied to ensure that any access granted to tourists is compatible with the requirements of security and efficient operation of the bases and facilities involved. Mr Beazley is asking his Department to look into these issues and develop some proposals.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The third question, from Senator Newman, concerned arrangements for the use of Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) aircraft during the pilots strike. A series of negotiations took place in the week 21 to 25 August with both airlines over the arrangements under which RAAF aircraft would be used in cooperation with the airlines to assist in maintaining civil air services during the pilots dispute. These negotiations took place both in meetings in Canberra and by phone with airline head officers interstate between Commonwealth officials and airlines management. Agreement was quickly reached on the principle that the airlines would provide fuel, rations, ground handling, et cetera. Discussions proceeded on the rates of payment to cover maintenance.

It was a question about Coolangatta Airport. I seek leave to incorporate in Hansard the answer that I am now in a position to give.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Leave granted.</PARA>
<PARA> The answer read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA>As those with an interest in aviation would be aware, responsibility for the management and operation of Coolangatta Airport was transferred to the Federal Airports Corporation on 1 January 1988.</PARA>
<PARA>Given that the Government has only relatively recently established the FAC to take responsibility for the commercial operation of Australia's major airports, it makes no sense to be talking about selling these assets. The Government has no need nor intention of seeking private equity for the development of Coolangatta Airport or to seek to privatise the airport.</PARA>
<PARA>The second issue raised in the article was that of international flights to Coolangatta. The Federal Government has retained the responsibility for decisions on which airports shall be international airports.</PARA>
<PARA>Australia already has a large number of international gateways and Queensland is already served by international airports at Brisbane, Cairns and Townsville.</PARA>
<PARA>Brisbane Airport is only a short distance from the Gold Coast. Major improvements are currently underway at Brisbane Airport which, when completed, will ensure that there is adequate capacity to handle international passengers and aircraft requirements for many years.</PARA>
<PARA>International airport facilities are costly to develop and maintain. An increase in the number of these facilities in the southeast Queensland region would lead to increased costs, which would need to be recovered from the travelling public.</PARA>

I am now also in a position to give a detailed and considered answer to Senator Colston's very carefully considered question. I seek leave to incorporate that answer in Hansard.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Leave granted.</PARA>
<PARA> The answer read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA> The budget surplus of $9 billion will be a result of the responsible decisions taken by the Government to restrain the rate of growth in outlays. For example, since the Government's first budget of  1983-84, outlays as a percentage of GDP have decreased from 29.6 per cent to 23.7 per cent in 1989-90. I might add that this Government inherited a $9 billion deficit from the previous Government.</PARA>
<PARA> It is nonsense to claim that monies collected from the excise on petroleum comprises the major part of the surplus. Excise duty on petroleum in 1989-90 is estimated to be $7 billion. This revenue forms only part of the Government's total tax structure. Other sources include income tax, company tax, sales tax and customs duty on imports. Together they provide finance for all areas of the Government's expenditure commitments. The Government must then balance competing expenditure priorities in the light of its overall economic and social objectives. These include health, welfare, defence and general purpose assistance to the States and local government.</PARA>
<PARA> The Government has allocated $1,341.2 million for roads in 1989-90, an increase of $120 million over funding provided in 1988-89. This represents an increase in money terms of nearly 10 per cent compared to the CPI increase of 7.6 per cent. This is a good result in light of the significant decrease in outlays achieve by this Government. It is all the more significant when viewed against the background of the need to reduce government spending as part of our strategy to tackle the major economic problems posed by our level of overseas debt and trade deficit.</PARA>
<PARA> This Government has demonstrated a consistently high commitment to roads-21 per cent higher than the previous Government-and one that is providing a steady improvement in the overall condition of our road system.</PARA>

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the paper. </PARA>
<PARA>Some years ago it was my privilege to be a member of the Senate Select Committee on Private Hospitals and Nursing Homes. I served on that Committee for a number of years. Therefore, I would like to say a few words about the report entitled A Home By Design: Nursing Home Design Principles. In the course of the Committee's work it visited many nursing homes. We found that many were privately owned and many were church owned. They were all endeavouring to provide care for people in our community who need considerable assistance in their daily personal activities. </PARA>
<PARA> Nursing home annexes are attached to many hospitals throughout Queensland and much care is given by the nursing staff. We have to accept that families are not always able to give the care that is necessary as their parents get older. Sometimes they find that it is necessary to put them into a nursing home. That applies particularly when nursing homes are available in their own home districts. At Kingaroy we have the Oran Nursing Home which is run by the Lutheran Church. We have a privately owned nursing home. Farr Home is attached to the hospital. The care that is given to the people in all those annexes and nursing homes is very much appreciated. </PARA>
<PARA> I take this opportunity to pay tribute to the nurses for the work they do. As the report says, while the majority of people living in general purpose nursing homes are over 70 years of age there is a small number of younger residents aged between 16 and 50. They may need care as a result of problems at birth. Children and young people need to be cared for. I am sure many families appreciate the fact that, as they get older, they can be placed in nursing homes where they will be given much care and attention. </PARA>
<PARA> The report concentrates on the design of nursing homes. As the years go by, designs improve all the time. The cover of the report gives one an idea of the very fine outcome standards for Australian nursing homes. People enter nursing homes for various reasons. Nursing home life offers a means whereby aged people with ongoing nursing and personal care needs are able to obtain the support they need to continue their lives in a way that is acceptable to them. The quality of care a resident receives from nurses and other staff in the nursing home can mean the difference between enduring life or enjoying it. I think that is very important. </PARA>
<PARA> Care in a nursing home is constant because ever so many people are in their beds and have to be well looked after and cared for by the nursing staff. The duty undertaken by nursing home proprietors and staff to care for residents often goes beyond the legal duty to exercise due care in order to avoid causing them injury. Of course, that would be well known to anybody who had been a nursing sister over the years. Nurses have to be so careful that their patients do not get bed sores; they have to look after them; and they have to treat them very well. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course, people who are working in nursing homes are obliged to display compassion and kindness as well as adhering to ethical and moral codes in providing services to aged or disabled residents. I certainly believe that people who have relatives in nursing homes appreciate the loving care and attention that is evidenced on so many occasions. Now and again perhaps the standards in some of the nursing homes are not quite what the Government may want. But I believe that much money, care and attention go into them and I know that that is appreciated by the residents. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the report. </PARA>
<PARA>I seek leave to incorporate my tabling statement in Hansard. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The statement read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA> Animal experimentation is the fourth report of the Senate Select Committee on Animal Welfare. </PARA>
<PARA> At the beginning of the inquiry into animal welfare, the Committee decided to divide its reference into discrete areas. It has already reported on live sheep exports; dolphins and whales in captivity and kangaroos. A report on sheep husbandry, the Committee's fifth report, will be tabled in a few weeks. The Committee is conducting hearings on intensive animal industries and on the racing industry. </PARA>
<PARA> Opposition to animal experimentation has a long history, going back 200 years or more in Britain. During the resurgence of interest in animal welfare in the mid 1970's, it was one of the first areas on which attention was focussed by the animal welfare movement. </PARA>
<PARA> The movement in Australia generally opposes the use of animals in experiments. Some parts of the movement are implacable in their opposition and advocate an immediate ban on it. Some animal welfare organisations see the abolition of animal experimentation as a long-term goal and, in the meantime, are trying to improve animal welfare by reforming the system. </PARA>
<PARA> The animal welfare movement questioned both the ethics and the efficacy of conducting animal experimentation in biomedical and other research. On the other hand, the scientific community pointed to many benefits for humans and animals which have been derived from animal-based research. It added that cures for many of the current scourges for which there is little or no treatment will depend on experiments on animals. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee considered carefully the ethics of animal experimentation. It was not convinced that, on ethical grounds, there is justification for banning experiments on animals, as advocated by some animal welfare organisations. However, as sentient beings, animals need to be treated with respect. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee took considerable evidence on the efficacy of animal experimentation. The evidence and the scientific literature clearly demonstrated the value of animal experimentation. </PARA>
<PARA> Having said that, the Committee notes that animal experimentation is not the panacea for all the ills of humans and animals. Many diseases are caused or worsened by environmental conditions and lifestyles. Their treatment is often more in our own hands rather than in biomedical research. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee supports the continuation of animal experimentation, provided that every effort is made to find alternatives; including the reduction in and replacement of the use of animals, and the refinement of experimental design to reduce the pain and distress. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee notes that little research has been done in Australia to find alternatives to the use of animals in Australia. Funding of research into alternatives has been given a low priority by funding bodies. Most experimenters have been reluctant to venture into this area because of the difficulty in securing funding. </PARA>
<PARA> Consequently, the Committee recommends that the Commonwealth Government establish a separate fund for research into the use of alternatives to animal experimentation and that grants be disbursed from the fund by a board composed of representatives of the scientific community, animal welfare organisations, the Australian Council for the Care of Animals in Research and Teaching and government authorities. </PARA>
<PARA> The use of animals in psychological experiments was strongly criticised by animal welfare organisations. The Committee's attention was drawn to psychological experiments conducted on animals in Australia and overseas which caused significant distress to the animals involved. </PARA>
<PARA> Some experiments in psychology overlap with other disciplines, such as physiology. It is not always easy to define clearly what is a psychological experiment. There also seems to be a greater awareness among scientists that some types of psychological experiments are unacceptable to the public or are no longer regarded as necessary from a scientific point of view. Consequently, the Committee does not believe a statutory ban on psychological experiments to be appropriate. However, the Committee believes that ethics committees should scrutinise protocols for psychological experiments with great care. </PARA>
<PARA> With regard to experiments on wildlife, the Committee believes that endangered species should only be subject to experiments which are designed to conserve that species. For other wildlife species, purpose-bred animals should be used wherever possible. Where this is not possible, ethics committees must ensure that the scientific merit and value justify the use of such animals. </PARA>
<PARA> The use of toxicological tests such as the LD50 and the Draize tests has evoked widespread criticism. Neither test has been used much in Australia and steps have been taken in some States to reduce their use even further. The classical LD50 test is no longer required for drug evaluation by Australian authorities. The Committee recommends a ban on both the classical LD50 and the Draize tests. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee visited animal houses in a number of institutions to inspect the standard of facilities. Conditions in these animal houses varied from good to very bad. Animal houses have traditionally been given low priority in institutional budgets. Consequently, many animal houses need renovation and new equipment. It was pleasing therefore, that during the course of the inquiry the Committee was informed of the improvement of facilities or the construction of new animal houses at a number of universities. </PARA>
<PARA> High standard animal house facilities are important not just for animal welfare but also for obtaining reproducible scientific data derived from experiments on animals. The effects of environmental variables on animals have ramifications for research. Each variable might produce a biological response which could affect experimental data. This could jeopardise the outcome of scientific projects and waste valuable resources. </PARA>
<PARA> The breeding of animals for use in experiments has always been decentralised, except in Perth where the Animal Resources Centre provides most of the animals needed by Western Australian institutions. Decentralisation has led to a large number of animal houses vying for scarce resources, diseconomies of scale in production, inefficiencies and inadequate staffing structures. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee believes that a rationalisation of breeding units is essential to provide high quality animals efficiently within available resources. There should be no more than four or five major breeding units to serve all institutions around the country. It would still be possible for institutions to breed small numbers of specific strains of a species, something which would not be cost-effective for a major breeding unit to do. Such a rationalisation in the number of breeding units is probably inevitable, but the Committee believes that a planned contraction would serve the scientific community better. </PARA>
<PARA> The use of animals obtained from pounds is a controversial issue in Australia and overseas. It is permitted in all States except in South Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee concludes that dogs from pounds may be used in experiments provided that where registered dogs are surrendered to pounds, their owners give written consent to their use by institutions. The Committee accepts the argument that if a dog is used in an experiment from which it will not recover consciousness, there is no difference between euthanasia in a pound and destruction at an institution. If by the use of pound animals, which will be destroyed anyway, there is a reduction in the destruction of purpose-bred animals, then animal welfare is enhanced overall. </PARA>
<PARA> There is a need to improve training of both animal house staff and experiments. The Committee believes that all animal house staff should have relevant technical qualifications or be enrolled in appropriate TAFE courses. Although most institutions have policies supporting the need for qualified technical staff, financial constraints have made attendance at TAFE courses impossible for some animal attendants. The Committee does not believe that financial stringency should prevent the training of animal house staff. It recommends that all unqualified staff be required to undertake technical training courses in animal care at TAFE colleges. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee also draws attention to the lack of training available for experimenters in Australia. The need for training of experimenters is becoming more widely acknowledged, both in Australia and overseas. At present, most young experimenters learn experimental techniques and associated requirements from their supervisors. This is not entirely satisfactory as bad habits and out-of-date knowledge might be passed on to the young experimenters. There is also a need for experimenters to keep abreast of new developments in laboratory animal science, both to improve animal welfare and scientific procedures. The Committee supports a proposal for a course in laboratory animal science at the University of Sydney and recommends that funds be made available for its establishment. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee also recommends that funds be made available to establish a chair in animal welfare and behaviour at the University of Queensland. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee welcomes the establishment of the Australian Council for the Care of Animals in research and Teaching (ACCART). ACCART is an independent resource and information centre. It has already published a newsletter which has received international acclaim and is in the process of publishing a number of monographs. ACCART will also provide a forum for Australian and overseas experts to focus attention on a range of animal experimentation matters. Through seminars and conferences, run either by ACCART itself or in association with specialist bodies, complicated or controversial issues can be discussed to enable experimenters to keep abreast of developments in these fields. </PARA>
<PARA> In the final four chapters of the report, the Committee discusses the structure of animal welfare administration in Australia and the structure for the administration and control of animal experimentation. The two are inextricably linked and the administration of animal experimentation needs to be seen in the wider context of the administrative structure for animal welfare. </PARA>
<PARA> Under the Commonwealth Constitution, animal welfare is mainly a State responsibility. Before 1985, the State Governments played a low-key role in animal welfare. From that year, the States began to take a more active role. Legislation in three States-New South Wales, Victoria and South Australia-was upgraded in 1985 and 1986. All three States appointed animal welfare advisory councils, whose membership covered all major interests in animal welfare. This opened the way to a more participative approach to the administration of animal welfare. </PARA>
<PARA> Two other governments have moved to upgrade relevant legislation. The Queensland government advertised for written submissions early this year for a review of its animal protection legislation. A review of legislation in the Australian Capital Territory was completed early this year. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee recommends that all States and Territories upgrade prevention of cruelty to animals legislation, appoint animal welfare advisory councils and establish government animal welfare units to administer the legislation, along the lines of the three States which have already done this. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee supports the idea of the formation of a council of Commonwealth, State and Territory ministers responsible for animal welfare, once all States and Territories have undertaken the recommended reforms. The Joint Animal Welfare Council should form the standing committee of officials to support the ministerial council. </PARA>
<PARA> Although the Committee sees the need for the Commonwealth Government to have an animal welfare advisory council to advise it on animal welfare matters for which it has responsibility, the Committee does not support the proposed national consultative committee which is to be an advisory body to the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy. The Committee believes that it is inappropriate for some State Government representatives to be on an advisory body to a Commonwealth minister when responsibility for much of animal welfare is a State responsibility and the States involved have their own advisory committees. </PARA>
<PARA> Before 1985, there was, in effect, a self-regulatory system operating for the administration of animal experimentation. Although funding bodies, such as the National Health and Medical Research Council, required recipients of grants to comply with the `Code of practice for the care and use of animals for experimental purposes', there was no monitoring to ensure that compliance was achieved. </PARA>
<PARA> With the upgrading of legislation in three States in 1985 and 1986, government controls were imposed on animal experimentation, including the licensing of experiments and/or institutions, the mandatory appointment of ethics committees, the appointment of government inspectors and the incorporation of a code of practice into regulations. </PARA>
<PARA> This approach by the three States has often been called `enforced self-regulation'. It allows experiments to assume primary responsibility for the conduct of animal experimentation and the care of animals used in experiments. The institutional ethics committees are given the main supervisory role within a legislative framework. Through licensing, accreditation and monitoring by inspectors, the government ensures that the experiments and ethics committees are fulfilling their responsibilities. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee supports the general approach taken by the three States and recommends that the other States and Territories adopt a similar approach to the control of animal experimentation. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee believes that the State and Territory Governments should control animal experimentation and monitor compliance with the code of practice. It is not the role of funding bodies to undertake this function. Funding bodies are not equipped to monitor compliance and their scarce resources are better used in funding research. State and Territory governments have both the responsibility and the means to maintain control of animal experimentation. </PARA>
<PARA> There has been some dispute between the CSIRO and a State Government as to whether Commonwealth experimenters are subject to State laws dealing with animal experimentation. To avoid further disputes and to enable organisations such as the CSIRO to promote uniform standards and rules throughout all their offices in different States, the Committee recommends that the Commonwealth enact legislation to cover all Commonwealth employees who conduct animal experimentation. The Committee also recommends the appointment of an inter-departmental committee to co-ordinate and oversee animal experimentation in Commonwealth institutions. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee addressed several matters in the final chapter of the report relating to the code of practice and ethics committees. In particular, it recommends that future revisions of the Code of Practice be carried out by a national conference consisting of representatives of governments, institutions which conduct animal experimentation, experimenters, animal house staff, specialist societies, animal welfare organisations, educational organisations and funding bodies and that final approval for those revisions be given by Commonwealth, State and Territory governments which include the Code of Practice in regulations. </PARA>
<PARA> I commend the report to the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It gives me great pleasure to speak today on the report of the Select Committee on Animal Welfare entitled Animal Experimentation and to support the Chairman of the Committee, Senator Devlin. I and Senator Barney Cooney have the distinction of being two of the longest serving senators on that Committee. Without casting any aspersions against my good friend Senator Cooney, I think I can proudly lay claim to having attended more hearings and inspections associated with the report than any other senator. I think only the former Committee Secretary, Paul Barsdell, would have attended more hearings and inspections. Obviously, as Secretary of the Committee, he attended them all.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The report is a very important document. In years to come it will play a significant role in the direction that the animal welfare debate in this country takes. It not only sets down, I believe most thoroughly, the recent past situation regarding the use of animals for scientific purposes but also serves to record the Committee's general philosophic approach to the moral issues involved in the animal welfare debate. I regret the ignorance of those who believe that there is not much substance in animal welfare issues, because it is one of the most important moral and philosophical arguments that society is faced with today. This has been demonstrated to me time and time again on this Committee. I have been forced to challenge my preconceptions and critically assess my attitudes to a wide range of issues. I know that others on this Committee, both present and former members, have been similarly challenged. </PARA>
<PARA> In passing, I would like to pay tribute to a man I am proud to call a friend, the former Chairman of this Committee, Senator Georges, whom Senator Devlin has already mentioned. We attended many animal house inspections together in the early stages of the hearings into the subject of this report. While we had very different backgrounds, attitudes and opinions, I learnt to develop a healthy respect for his approach to animal welfare issues, and particularly the question of animal experimentation. I would be very interested to learn of his views on this final document now that it has been tabled here in the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA> Before moving to the substance of the material at hand today, I would like to record my thanks to the former Secretary of the Committee, Paul Barsdell, whom the Committee Chairman has already mentioned, and my appreciation of his work. His work was extensive; his interest in the subject matter at hand went well beyond the requirements of his position. Through it he has done a great service to the Senate and to the value of the Senate committee system. Because of his work, he and the Committee are held in high regard in the scientific community. His professional approach has been favourably commented on by many people. For my part as a member of the Committee, I thank Paul very much for what he has done. </PARA>
<PARA> I also thank the other members of the Committee secretariat-former researcher, Doug Hynd, and current staff, Barbara Allan and Doris Pratezina. This Committee takes great pride in its camaraderie, and it is a committee I greatly enjoy. In fact, the other night we had a very enjoyable dinner to wish Paul well on his new committee appointment. But I do not think that has always been so. I must confess that at one stage, having seen almost every animal house in Australia and, I suspect, some that Paul invented, I was thinking that Paul had been a little overzealous in his desire to get the real story on animal experimentation. That is now in the past, and today the Senate is presented with a most authoritative document. </PARA>
<PARA> When the Committee first started to examine this issue there was a great deal of community disquiet about the use of animals in experiments. What early submissions lacked in fact was more than made up for in emotion. I regret that the early submissions from some universities were little better. Clearly, in the eyes of some academics the Committee had no business in questioning their activities. I regret that some attempted to maintain that attitude throughout the entire hearings. One of the first steps undertaken by the Committee was to establish a national survey of research institutions to quantify and qualify the numbers of experiments, their types and their usage of animals, so that we had some idea of the extent of the industry and its problems. We received 50 replies to those questionnaires, and they formed a valuable basis on which the Committee could proceed for the next two years. I believe the appendix to the report listing the witnesses who appeared before us gives some indication of the breadth and extent of the inquiries. Some 160 witnesses are listed in that appendix. </PARA>
<PARA> I cannot profess to cover a full range of the recommendations canvassed in the report here today; nor do I intend to do so. The recommendations are there for anyone to read. I hope they will be read rather than just skimmed through. Much rather than proceed through the various recommendations, I would outline some of the reasons why the Committee came to these conclusions. In doing so, I would like to draw the attention of the Senate to paragraphs 1.21, 1.22 and 1.23, which serve to summarise the Committee's attitude on the subject and the sentiments which I believe the scientific community would do well to adhere to. The first two paragraphs state:</PARA>
<PARA>There is a general feeling within the scientific community to withdraw behind barriers when faced with violence or other illegal actions. That attitude is quite understandable. Yet it has been the secretive approach in the past and the reluctance to public information about their use of animals in experiments which have led to public misapprehension about the nature of animal experimentation in this country. Secrecy breeds suspicion and the media feed on suspicion. What might have been a misunderstanding becomes a crisis. </PARA>
<PARA> The most potent weapon in the armoury of research institutions is public opinion. If the public is satisfied that animals are being used humanely in experiments, there is little threat to such use. It is important, therefore, for institutions to be open and forthcoming about their experimental practices. Responsible animal welfare organisations should also be able to inspect institutional facilities. This would help to allay suspicions that animals are being housed in poor facilities or are not being given proper care. </PARA>
<PARA>Paragraph 1.23 states:</PARA>
<PARA>Institutions and government have a responsibility to ensure that animal experimentation is conducted humanely in accordance with approved rules and guidelines. By fulfilling that responsibility and by keeping the public informed of the extent and nature of animal experimentation, public disquiet should be kept to a minimum. </PARA>
<PARA>On that issue the Committee definitely condemned the use of violence to attain the objectives which some groups in the community were seeking to attain when evidence was first put together in relation to this report. There is in Australia a great need for a more responsible and ethical approach to be taken toward the use of animals for scientific purposes. For example, to date there has not been very good or accurate record keeping. We took evidence that showed at times a worrying lack of detail when it came to which animals were bred, used and required. In one submission from a leading university the records were so scant as to be almost unbelievable. Therefore, the first recommendation of the report talks of the essential need for various State and Federal governments to publish data on animal usage. One would assume that to be a necessarily basic requirement. The Committee found the situation to be quite the reverse. </PARA>
<PARA> On the question of animal houses, the report notes that in research units in hospitals there was a great variation between the various institutions. I would suggest that the Committee was not at all times shown areas that might have been less than standard. I would suggest that at least the existence and potential threat of the Committee making an inspection were sufficient inducement for a general raising of overall standards. Senate committees, whether they be select committees or otherwise, when carrying out inspections could improve the overall interests of that industry-in this particular case, the animals in science industry-by getting it to shape up a lot better than in the past. Paragraph 9.81 on page 165 of the report states:</PARA>
<PARA> Few institutions were able to supply the Committee with a copy of the standard operating procedures governing animal care within the breeding and holding units. In most cases procedures did exist but were not written down. Staff were either expected to know what needed to be done or to respond to oral instructions. </PARA>
<PARA>Again that was indicative of the casual approach all too prevalent in some institutions. </PARA>
<PARA> One area of great concern to the Committee was the use of animals, especially dogs, taken from pounds. The number of pound animals used is unknown. In some States-for example, South Australia-their use for scientific purposes is prohibited. In Sydney the use of pound animals is significantly higher than in other cities and they are used both for teaching purposes and for experiments. Valid arguments were put for the use by students. Professor Rex from the University of Queensland compared training in the United Kingdom and Australia and pointed out that students in the United Kingdom practised surgery only on cadavers. He suggested that, as a result, Australian veterinary graduates were better qualified than their United Kingdom counterparts. </PARA>
<PARA> The use of pound animals for animal experiments was not so clear-cut. It was suggested by more than one witness that pound animals could not always yield useful data and experimenters had an obligation to ensure that the pound animal was suitable for that particular experiment. There were also ethical considerations, and the very real concerns that family pets might well land up in experiments through error or events outside the control of the pound or the owner. The Committee felt therefore that the minimum holding period a pound held an animal before surrendering it to an institution should be seven days, except when an owner surrendered a pet, in which case written permission should be sought for its use in research. </PARA>
<PARA> The question of the use of cats was somewhat different from the use of dogs, given that is often harder to determine whether a cat is straying or merely `taking the night air'. Various allegations were made on this issue and for that reason the Committee has recommended that institutes wanting to use cats for research be required to either breed them or purchase them from an institution where they are bred for that purpose. The question of a code of practice for the use of pound animals is presently being examined by the Animal Research Review Panel in New South Wales and many concerns expressed to and by the Committee will no doubt be covered by this group. </PARA>
<PARA> Again, as with other aspects of animal welfare, it was indicated to the Committee that the level of husbandry provided to the animals made an enormous difference to their welfare. Accordingly the Committee has recommended that unqualified staff of animal houses be required to undertake technical training courses in animal care. It was quite interesting that most of the animal houses we went to had girls, who became quite attached to the animals, looking after them. Perhaps that is indicative of some parts of the human race being more caring than others. </PARA>
<PARA> It was pointed out to the Committee that not all researchers using animals in experiments had necessarily any expertise in animal handling and similarly many small animal houses also would find it extremely difficult to afford the employment of a qualified veterinarian. It was suggested therefore that institutions using animals ought to ensure reasonable access to such a person. The Committee indicated that a centralisation of breeding units would reduce this difficulty and ideally in future years animals would all be bred in purpose built facilities with professional staff. </PARA>
<PARA> A significant chapter in this report is chapter 13, which deals with animal welfare administration in Australia. The Committee felt it timely to consider administration of animal welfare, given that the administration of animal experimentation is intertwined with the more general subject. Since the commencement of this Committee a great many changes, both attitudinal and administrative, have taken place in animal welfare generally and within the scientific community. Indeed the Committee saw evidence of this with return visits of various witnesses to address the Committee. </PARA>
<PARA> In light of recent moves by the Federal Government to establish a national consultative committee on animal welfare (NCCAW), it was also felt necessary that the Committee's views on this subject be highlighted. I have been quite open in my opposition to NCCAW. I think at best this new group will duplicate the work of both the Senate Committee, without the powers of examination and community reporting, and the Standing Committee on Animal Welfare (SCAW), while at worst it will restrict debate on the issue, given that legislative responsibility for animal welfare is a State matter and one on which the States have been proceeding with some pace in recent years. I suspect that certain groups in the animal welfare arena which have supported such a council will come to realise their mistake. </PARA>
<PARA> On the question of Federal involvement in animal welfare matters, the Committee's attitude is clearly set out in chapter 13 and it recommends that States be encouraged to upgrade and unify their legislation, to establish animal welfare advisory councils and departmental animal welfare units such as has been done with great success in New South Wales, Victoria and South Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> The question of codes of practice and ethics committees is discussed extensively in chapter 16 and follows on from recommendations in chapter 15 for adoption by all States, the Territories and the Commonwealth of a regulatory system for animal experimentation based on the systems operating in New South Wales, Victoria and South Australia. The system is based on legislation, codes of practice, ethics committees and government monitoring. As the report notes, codes of practice are a key element in the legislative package. Regrettably, some institutions would not adhere to codes of practice if they were not backed up in law. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee supports the suggestion of a national conference, comprising various groups such as the Australian Council on the Care of Animals in Research and Teaching, the Australian Vice-Chancellors Committee, the Australian Society for Laboratory Animal Science, the National Farmers Federation, the Australian Veterinary Association, the National Health and Medical Research Council, the Australian and New Zealand Federation of Animal Societies, and the Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, to review every three years, or sooner if required, the code of practice for animal experimentation. It was obvious to the Committee that compliance with codes of practice did not always occur. I personally found at times the arrogance of some researchers offensive and indeed, in the odd rare case, the entire institution had an inappropriate attitude to compliance. The Committee is of the firm view that it is the responsibility of the various government authorities to ensure that all institutions comply with regulations. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee regards ethics committees as `the linchpin in the system'. The effectiveness of ethics committees determines the success of the system. In some States they are the only control over animal experimentation. The Committee examined the membership structure of ethics committees and noted that it was important that they be representative of community concerns, and not a whitewash for the research being undertaken. </PARA>
<PARA> I have only briefly skimmed the surface of this report. As I said at the beginning, the report is a most authoritative document and one which I believe will become a useful tool in the administration of animal experimentation not only in this country but also overseas. I believe the very presence of the Committee and this inquiry has raised significantly the standards of animal care within the scientific community. I am confident that this report will provide the blueprint for further improvement and will bring Australian research institutions to the forefront in animal welfare administration. I commend the report to the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I too wish to comment on the Senate Select Committee on Animal Welfare report entitled Animal Experimentation, which has been quite some time in the making. It is the fourth report handed down by the Senate Select Committee on Animal Welfare. It follows on from the controversial kangaroo report, the report on the live sheep trade, and the whales and dolphins report, which was also rather controversial. Of all the matters that have been discussed in the past, this is probably the most controversial. All matters regarding animal welfare, I suppose, are controversial in one way or the other because members of the general public get quite upset when they see animals being treated in a cruel manner. Things are no different in relation to animal experimentation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I too would like to congratulate the staff of the Committee on the amount of work that they put into this quite detailed report. I particularly pay tribute to Paul Barsdell, who has made quite a name for himself in animal welfare circles. As the previous speaker, Senator Brownhill, said, Paul has been the linchpin of the Committee and I would like to wish him well with his new committee. </PARA>
<PARA> The animal experimentation debate has been around for quite some time. In the United Kingdom anti-vivisection organisations have been in existence for something like 200 years. The argument is not new and the area has always been controversial. I believe that our Committee, in conducting this investigation, has brought the matter out of the cupboard and into the open. By doing so I believe that it has had a very good effect on the animal welfare debate, and particularly the animal experimentation debate, in Australia. At times during my speech I will comment on the same things Senator Brownhill did, as I did not consult with him before making this speech. A questionnaire was sent to some 50 institutions and during the course of the investigations some 162 witnesses gave evidence. I too was interested to note that the debate made the institutions think more about the ethical matters involved in the animal experimentation debate. If our Committee did nothing else, I believe that because of our existence we encouraged organisations and institutions that conduct animal experiments to set up ethics committees which include, as Senator Brownhill said previously, lay people from the community who have an interest and who can make sure that the experiments that are conducted are worthwhile and are conducted in a proper manner. </PARA>
<PARA> The animal experimentation issue has been brought to the attention of the public. It has brought out into the open and dispelled some of the sensational views that have been expressed by various people who purport to represent animal welfare groups. In my opinion and that of the Committee, such issues have been blown out of all proportion by some in the media. I think most people who watch television would remember some of the video clips that were shown on some of our current affairs programs that really brought the attention of the public to some of the more controversial parts of animal experimentation such as experiments on monkeys, burning of pigs, Draize testing-matters that we found when we were conducting our inquiry were rare if not totally absent from Australia but which nevertheless brought to the attention of the Australian people concerns in relation to some of these experiments. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee commenced its investigations into animal experimentation matters in 1984 but it is only over the last two years that we have really got our teeth into the matter. As a former farmer and one of those people who travelled around Australia with the Committee, I must say that I was very well educated in ways I never expected in different aspects of breeding animals. For instance, I remember very vividly our visit to the veterinary science school at the University of Sydney. When we walked into the establishment there were some 19 or 20 horses in various stages of dissection. It was a shock to the system to see headless horses all over the place. Rat houses and mice breeding establishments were the order of the day, as were dog pounds, catteries, cages full of monkeys, and sheep, cattle and rabbits. We certainly looked at a mixed bag of animals in various stages of experimentation. One or two aspects concerned me. I remember particularly the condition of one dog pound in Sydney which I believe certainly needed upgrading. I also remember at Monash University talking to the animal house keeper who was very concerned about the attitude of some of the experimenters to the animals. One particular dog was left in a very poor condition over Christmas without any attention, food or water after suffering quite a traumatic experiment. </PARA>
<PARA> One thing that always comes up in animal welfare debates and that has to be addressed is whether we really need to have animal experiments at all. That was one of the views that were put to us by the Australian and New Zealand Federation of Animal Societies. As Senator Brownhill said earlier, sections 1.21, 1.22 and 1.23 of the report open up the whole debate and place it out there for everybody to see. In this day and age I believe that we owe a lot to animals in relation to what has been achieved by our scientists in using them in experimentation for the good of human beings. Where would we be without the millions of mice and rats that have been used for experimentation purposes for finding a cure for cancer? There is no doubt that, in the investigations into acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) millions of animals, particularly mice and rats, will be used in experimentation. Research into heart disease, one of our biggest killers, uses vast numbers of dogs and pigs for experimentation. We were briefed very well on the use of dogs and pigs. </PARA>
<PARA> Just to give some idea of the number of animals that are used, in Victoria in 1986-87 something like 226,500 animals-from mice and guinea pigs through to pigs, primates and domestic poultry-were used in experiments. That was just in the State of Victoria. If we look at the universities that breed their own animals, in the University of Sydney, University of New South Wales and University of Queensland, the central animal houses issued 96,000 animals in 1984 and the experimental and teaching universities consumed a total of 373,800 in 1984. We are talking about something that is not insignificant. Large numbers of animals of all types are being used around Australia for the good of human beings. The main thing that the Committee concluded was that, whilst we accept that animals have to be used, it is the conditions under which they are used that matter, and the recommendations accordingly reflect that view. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the interesting aspects of our inquiries was the evidence given about the use of specific pathogen free, or SPF, animals which are bred to be free of bacteria which could affect experiments. It is possible, by using such animals and comparing results achieved in Australia with results achieved overseas, to reduce the number of animals used for experimentation. The results so gained stand up to scrutiny. Recommendation 549 states:</PARA>
<PARA>The Committee RECOMMENDS that the Commonwealth Government establish a separate fund for research into the use of alternatives for animal experimentation and that grants be disbursed from this fund by a board composed of representatives of the scientific community, animal welfare organisations, ACCART and government authorities. </PARA>
<PARA>That, in itself, will have a great effect on the animal welfare debate in the future. </PARA>
<PARA> Perhaps one of the most controversial matters in the animal experimentation debate has been the use of Draize testing and the LD50 testing. Draize testing, as some of us might know, is designed and used to test the irritation of chemical compounds to the eyes. One of the graphic pieces of video film that one sees when animal experimentation is talked about on current affairs programs is rabbits having their eyes smeared with chemicals until they are irritated. I am pleased to say that Draize testing has virtually been phased out in Australia. One of the recommendations made by our Committee is that it should be completely banned. The other test, the LD50 test, is used to determine the level at which the general measure of toxicity in a dose will kill 50 per cent of the target group of animals. This test has also been the subject of very wide criticism by animal welfare organisations. The Committee recommends a ban on the LD50 test in Australia but that acute toxicity tests be allowed with ministerial approval. Both of these recommendations are quite significant. </PARA>
<PARA> Another matter of controversy which comes up when talking about animal experimentation is the use of native animals. We made the following recommendation:</PARA>
<PARA>The Committee RECOMMENDS that ACCART in co-operation with the relevant bodies with specialist knowledge draw up appropriate guidelines and standard operating procedures for the capture of wildlife and their housing, nutrition and management in captivity. </PARA>
<PARA>It is essential that we are able to use native animals for experimentation, not only for the benefit of human beings but also for the benefit of the animals themselves. We were privy to some of the experiments that are used. I will not go into them in detail because they were quite intricate. But the Committee was very interested to see that native animals were used in this way to benefit human beings, particularly in terms of blood pressure and heart disease. </PARA>
<PARA> The report also deals with the incidence of pain and stress. This is something that, I believe, will be talked about for a great length of time. This matter was raised by everybody at our hearings. It is interesting to note that there is even an International Association for the Study of Pain. If I speak for much longer, I will be subjecting the Minister for Consumer Affairs (Senator Bolkus), who is in the chamber, to a lot of pain. But I will continue and try to explain to the Senate some of the interesting aspects of this part of the report. A discussion on pain presents difficulties in respect of both definition and communication. It was interesting to note that Dr Margaret Rose, whom we got to know quite well, said:</PARA>
<PARA>I think it is important to note that in relation to pain we tend to use four terms . . . `pain', `suffering', `anxiety', and `stress'. </PARA>
<PARA>Those words were put forward on just about every occasion that people gave evidence about experimentation. It is very difficult to measure pain. Our recommendations and conclusions were that the matter of pain should be encompassed in a code of practice. We drew the following very strong conclusion:</PARA>
<PARA>Experiments which may cause pain of a kind and degree for which anaesthesia would normally be used in the area of medical or veterinary practice most closely related to the proposed procedure and species, must be carried out using appropriate anaesthesia. </PARA>
<PARA>Part of the report deals with native animals in Antarctica. Now that the Government has sought to declare Antarctica a world park, the recommendation that a code of practice be drawn up, particularly for Antarctica, is most important. </PARA>
<PARA> As Senator Brownhill said earlier, we received evidence from many bodies. It would be fair to say that, as a result of our hearings, universities and veterinary surgeons have banded together in a more efficient manner. I was very pleased to hear that the Australian Veterinary Association has formed a national executive and that it wishes to approach all animal welfare matters in a much more professional manner. As has been said, all universities concerned with animal experimentation have formed ethics committees. I believe that the Australian and New Zealand Federation of Animal Societies (ANZFAS) has gone to a great deal of trouble. I would like to give credit to that body which has put so much evidence before us, not only on animal experimentation but also on other matters associated with animal welfare. It has gone to a great deal of trouble and effort. This body even brought in experts from around the world to put their opinions to us. It is because of interested bodies such as the Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (RSPCA) and ANZFAS that we were able to put together a report that, I believe, will be used by many people in the years ahead. </PARA>
<PARA> In conclusion, I briefly mention the use of dogs and cats in experiments-a matter that caused a great deal of concern to the people who gave evidence to us. Senator Brownhill mentioned the use of pound dogs. I noticed, when I was in the United Kingdom recently, that pound animals are not allowed to be used for animal experimentation. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee considered that animals which are to be disposed of anyway would be of more use if they were saved and used for animal experimentation, thereby cutting down on the need to breed animals for that specific purpose. Dogs in particular are very helpful in the investigations into heart disease. Senator Brownhill touched on the matter of cats, and the reasons we recommended that cats be bred rather than impounded. I certainly think that that would be supported by the Chinese community. The whole debate is summed up in the three major recommendations-13.46; 15.57 and 16.15-that appear on pages xvii and xviii. </PARA>

<PARA>It was interesting to note, during our investigations, that New South Wales, with its codes of practice and in all matters relating to animal welfare, was the trendsetter for the rest of Australia. Recommendation 15.57 states:</PARA>
<PARA> The Committee recommends that the system of controlling animal experimentation in New South Wales, Victoria and South Australia be extended to the other States and Territories. This system is based on upgraded legislation; incorporation of a code of practice in regulations; the accreditation and licensing of institutions in which animal experimentation is conducted; and the appointment of inspectors to monitor the work of ethics committees, animal house facilities and practices, and the conduct of animal experimentation. </PARA>
<PARA>That too is very important. In my State of Tasmania, the new President of the RSPCA, Edyth Langham, has been calling on the Government to upgrade its Cruelty to Animals Act, which is lacking in quite a few areas. If Tasmania adopted the systems in place in New South Wales, Victoria and South Australia it would go a long way to satisfying those concerned people in Tasmania. The other most important recommendation-recommendation 16.15-states:</PARA>
<PARA>The Committee recommends that future revisions of the Code of Practice be carried out by a national conference consisting of representatives of governments, institutions which conduct animal experimentation, experimenters, animal house staff, specialist societies, animal welfare organisations, educational organisations and funding bodies and that final approval for those revisions be given by Commonwealth, State and Territory Governments . . . </PARA>
<PARA>The hardest part of that would be getting them all together. If that is achievable it will go a long way to making the animal welfare debate and particularly animal experimentation that much better. There is no question that we have to tighten up controls. We have to minimise cruelty. We have to take away the suspicions of the past because these experiments and so-called acts of cruelty have been conducted behind closed doors. That is why this matter has become so contentious. Particularly in the United Kingdom, there have been acts of vandalism and criminal acts against animal experimentation houses. In fact, some of them have been burnt down. People's cars have been vandalised. People's lives have even been threatened. That has not been the case in Australia. We are aware that some animal housekeepers and experimenters have been threatened. Thank heavens we have not seen any gross acts of vandalism or criminal activity. The evidence in this document brings everything out into the open and allows people to debate this matter publicly, to answer the queries and respond to the accusations made. A forum such as a Senate Select Committee is, as Senator Brownhill said earlier, the only way that animal welfare matters can be considered. This is a service to not only the experimentation industry in Australia but also the animals. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The reports I have tabled propose the construction of an office building of 6,900 square metres to provide accommodation for several Commonwealth agencies at Logan City, Queensland and the proposed fitout of the Civil Aviation Authority headquarters building in Canberra. The first report proposes the construction of a three-storey office building to provide accommodation for the local offices of the Department of Social Security, the Commonwealth Employment Service and several other Commonwealth agencies. The Committee inspected the existing offices of the Department of Social Security and the Commonwealth Employment Service and found both offices to be of a poor standard and inadequate to meet the needs of the agencies, and obviously its clients. With respect to the proposed building, the Committee recommends that additional public toilets be provided on the ground floor than presently proposed by the Department of Administrative Services, and that measures be introduced to ensure the security of staff and records.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In recent times two particular issues have kept reappearing before the Committee when it is considering proposed government building projects. These issues concern the provision of car parking spaces and child-care facilities. The Committee notes in the report that the Department of Administrative Services is to review its existing policy where parking facilities are generally provided only for official vehicles at government buildings. With respect to the provision of child-care facilities, the Committee recommends that the current policy, which is that child-care facilities not be provided in Commonwealth offices, be reviewed. The estimated cost of the building is $9.6m at April 1989 prices. It is anticipated to commence construction in November this year with completion scheduled for January 1991. </PARA>
<PARA> The second report proposes fitout works for the Civil Aviation Authority headquarters building in Canberra. The fitout of 16,500 square metres of floor space will provide a suitable standard of accommodation for the majority of central office staff. The Committee believes that relocation of Civil Aviation Authority staff into a central location will result in a more efficient use of resources and will improve staff morale. The estimated cost of the proposed work is $13.4m at July 1989 prices. I commend both these reports to the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Committee was considering Opposition amendments 11, 12 and 13 when we were interrupted by the adjournment last evening. These amendments are to clause 10 of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission Bill 1989 which occurs at pages 8 and 9 of the Bill. The discussion that has occurred and which was drawing towards a conclusion last evening related to section 96 grants. Following observations made by the Minister I looked at the Constitution. Clearly there are two areas where funding will come to Aboriginal organisations. The first is by virtue of placitum (xxvi) of section 51 of the Constitution-the famous placitum that was the subject of the 1967 referendum in which the words `other than Aboriginal race in any State' were removed from the Constitution thus enabling the Commonwealth to proceed conjointly with the States to do a number of things.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The other part of the Constitution with which we are concerned in these amendments is, of course, section 96. After some preamble, that section states that the Parliament may grant financial assistance to any State on such terms and conditions as the Parliament thinks fit. If I have followed the Hansard and the Minister's statement correctly, he has been saying, `The provisions in this Bill are an indication of what the Parliament thinks fit to do'. I think he is saying that by providing this mechanism this is the way the Parliament wishes to deal with section 96 grants in this area. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to be quite clear that we are not incorrect on this matter and that the three or four subclauses with which we are concerned give to the proposed Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission (ATSIC) the power to negotiate with the States, the power to enter into agreements with the States for the payment of a grant to the States. For `States' on each occasion I read `Territories' as well. We have read that statement to mean that the grants to which the provision refers would be grants made under section 96 of the Constitution. It would be helpful if the Minister could clarify that point because that forms part of the argument that we were discussing before the debate was adjourned last evening. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The point I was trying to make yesterday was that this funding is not like section 96 grants in that it requires the agreement of the other party. Section 96 grants gained some notoriety by the fact that they are almost irresistible grants of financial assistance which are made quite often unilaterally by the Commonwealth. They impose terms and conditions in order to secure the full payment of the moneys that are granted. That is not the situation here. This situation requires the agreement by the level of government concerned to the payment of a grant.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Under proposed section 10 (2) (b) the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission will have an appropriation of money sanctioned by this Parliament-as I think I pointed out-under proposed section 55 (1). Those moneys that are appropriated by the Parliament to the Commission can then be made the subject of an agreement for payment to a State or to the Northern Territory under section 18. That is the way in which those grants work. It is not a situation such as normally obtains under section 96 where we have that unilateral approach by the Commonwealth which is generally seen to be an irresistible imposition of terms and conditions by the Commonwealth. Here we have a consensual arrangement and the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission using funds which have been appropriated by the Parliament to enable those payments to be made and which I have no doubt would be subject to review during the Estimates process. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the Minister for his explanation but it addresses a slightly different point to the one which interests me. Section 96 grants are made now, and have been for some years, in the Aboriginal affairs area and other areas. I recall having been involved in the Budget cycle, having prepared the grants, having prepared the legislation, having introduced it, having debated it from either side of the chamber and having taken action after the States grants were approved by the Parliament. The question which we are asking is: are we correct in assuming that the States grants that have been made up until now will not be made after ATSIC begins generally other than through the ATSIC mechanism? We are not trying to put a value on that but States grants Aboriginal assistance may in fact pass through the ATSIC mechanism if this legislation is agreed to. That is what we want to understand.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As I understand it there would be no inhibition on that being a means by which some money currently being provided to the States from the States grants could be made available to them. But it still remains true that if that mechanism were to be used, namely that ATSIC was the funding or granting body, the agreement of the State would be required. We would need to enter into those sorts of arrangements that are envisaged by proposed section 18. I take it to mean that it would not preclude or be exhaustive or exclusive of the possibility of the Minister, in this case through the Department of Education, Employment and Training, making a grant under section 96 in a more direct way. In other words, this is not the only way-if that is the fear-by which the States could receive moneys to further Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander development through programs which require expenditure of money which could usefully come from Commonwealth coffers. There is, nevertheless, that subtle difference in moving from a section 96 payment simpliciter to the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission actually providing the money by way of agreement under proposed section 10 (2) (b).</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the Minister but again we are not asking whether there would be an inhibition on the making of section 96 grants. I understand there would not. We are asking: Do we understand the rhetoric of the Government? Do we understand correctly from what has been said by Government spokespeople on various occasions that it would be the intention of the Government-quite apart from whether there is an inhibition or a capacity-that the grants which hitherto have been made as section 96 grants would generally be made hereafter as grants by ATSIC for the States?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the Minister for his answer. What he said underpins part of our reason for moving these amendments and for moving the next group of amendments. It may represent a difference of view across the chamber. There is another matter that I raised in the opening remarks on these amendments to which no response has been given; that is, the failure of the Government, on a matter of significance relating to the way in which grants are made to the States and Territories, to consult adequately with the States and the Northern Territory on this clause and on other clauses which relate to their potential funding. I reminded the Minister that many of the States and Territories have been unhappy about that failure to consult. I remind him further that the matter was raised a little over a year ago, I think at a meeting of the Australian Aboriginal Affairs Council by some of his State colleagues, who indicated that they were unhappy. That unhappiness is not acknowledged in the second reading speech, neither has there been any reasoned response to the concerns they expressed at that time. I believe that we need at least to acknowledge that the history as I have set it out is broadly correct. If it is not correct, I would like the Minister to set out the way the Government asserts it is not correct. Our State colleagues would very much like to see that response.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Naturally, the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs (Mr Hand) has raised the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission (ATSIC) proposals with all the State Ministers from time to time and with a number of State Premiers, I understand, in routine meetings. To be more specific, at the Australian Aboriginal Affairs Council meeting in November 1988 the AAAC passed a resolution calling on the Minister to meet with State and Territory Ministers who wished to do so and to make available members of the ATSIC task force for discussions. The Minister indicated his willingness to meet the terms of this resolution. I have to tell Senator Baume that the response of the States has been somewhat half-hearted. I know that the Minister attempted to arrange further meetings with all State Ministers after the February AAAC meetings in Canberra on deaths in custody, but apparently without success. The Minister met with representatives of two States and a Territory-New South Wales, Western Australia and the Northern Territory-in Sydney on 27 April 1989. The Minister has made every attempt to fulfil the spirit of the resolution of the AAAC meeting in November 1988. So far he has not had the meetings with the State Ministers that we might have anticipated would flow from that resolution, but not through any fault of his.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Justice (Senator Tate) has just told us that the resolution at the Australian Aboriginal Affairs Council (AAAC) was actually moved in November 1988, and that fits in with what I said-that it was a year ago. It is now September. At that stage our State colleagues had not been consulted about clauses such as the ones before us, which are likely to affect their financial capacity very significantly. In fact, the resolution passed in November was an expression of distress and concern, and was preceded by quite angry expressions by State colleagues of the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs (Mr Hand), including those from Labor States. That is what happened.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I want to know not what has happened since the State Ministers faced up to the Federal Minister and told him that they were unhappy but what happened before that. Why was there no consultation with some of the other major players? Senator Boswell has already set out for this Committee on several occasions some of the very significant contributions which the States make to the advancement of Aboriginal welfare in this country. It is incredible that in a formal sense the State Ministers had to proceed to this resolution last November at the AAAC meeting, calling on the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs to consult with them. The fact is that there have been few consultations with the States since then. The Minister for Justice mentioned New South Wales, Western Australia and the Northern Territory. So the States of Queensland and South Australia-States with major Aboriginal populations-have still not had consultations with the Minister. </PARA>

<PARA> The Opposition remains convinced that the amendments which we propose are necessary. I say again what I said to the Committee yesterday: if it were the view of the Committee that ATSIC should have the capacity to plan and make decisions about States grants and about relations with the States, at the very least those arrangements should then be given effect through the Minister on a government to government basis. I understand that it is not constitutionally required, but I think it is required as a matter of constitutional propriety-an entirely different matter, a matter of intergovernmental propriety. I say this through Senator Tate to Mr Hand with the best spirit in the world: it will otherwise be very hard to argue that we are not creating a black parliament within Australia, because the making of States grants is a parliamentary function. I ask only that if they are to be made they be made with some maintenance of Minister to Minister and government to government contacts. The Opposition presses its amendments. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1"> -Last night Senator Coulter quite correctly picked up a problem which would confront State departments of Aboriginal affairs. If I am not incorrect, we were seeking to find some common ground or a form of words that would allow these amendments to be carried. Senator Peter Baume proposed that, even if the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission (ATSIC) were to make the allocations, those allocations of Commonwealth funding should go through the Federal Government to the State Minister. That is about where we were last night before the adjournment debate took place. I pointed out, and Senator Coulter picked it up, that if the Government were to allocate money only through ATSIC to the Department of Aboriginal Affairs, the down side would be that State governments that run effective, and in some cases very good, Aboriginal affairs departments would abdicate their responsibilities in Aboriginal affairs. They could well say, `The Constitution was amended in 1967 and Aboriginal affairs are now for the Federal Government to run'.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I do not think the people of Australia really knew they were giving that power to the Commonwealth. I think they voted on whether Aboriginal people should be allowed to vote. Any right-minded person could not but support that proposal. Now Aboriginal affairs have been handed over to the Commonwealth, but most State governments have stayed in the ring and have their own departments responsible for Aboriginal affairs. But some States are working only on the funding they are getting under section 96 grants. That is not the case with my State, as I said last night. It has allocated $38m of Queensland taxpayers' money to Aboriginal communities. We run a very grave danger of removing the power of State governments over Aboriginal affairs-and the States have developed great expertise over a number of years-if we allow these grants to be allocated from ATSIC to State governments. The Committee should not think that this provision will not be used as a tool to control State governments. Deals will be done-`We'll give you this if you do this'. Sovereign State governments will not put up with it. They will walk away from it. That is where we were last night. I think Senator Coulter had those fears. I think Senator Peter Baume is coming up with a form of words that will be acceptable to Senator Coulter. I do not know whether he has worked out those words yet, but perhaps we could start from there. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As Senator Boswell indicated, last night we were discussing the fact that there is both an up side and a down side to what is included in clause 10 (2)(b). The Minister has indicated that it certainly is potentially possible for all grants eventually to be channelled through the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission (ATSIC). I suspect that that would happen over some years under circumstances in which ATSIC established that it was capable of doing that and that the consequences of the movement of funds through ATSIC to the States and Territories were in the interests of Aboriginal people. As the Minister for Justice (Senator Tate) has pointed out, the actual grants of money to ATSIC will remain under the control of this Government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Another point I did not mention last night-and it is something that has concerned me in my State of South Australia-is that it seems as though the State Department of Aboriginal Affairs is moving more towards mainstreaming services to Aboriginal people, which is really running counter to the direction in which ATSIC is going. I understand that the same situation obtains in New South Wales, where the tendency at the State level has been to mainstream services to Aboriginal people. I suppose to some extent that will be a counterweight to the fears I expressed last night. </PARA>
<PARA> Another matter which is evident to me-and I was waiting until Senator Peter Baume had completed his questioning of the Minister on clause 10 (2)(b)-relates to clauses 10 (2) and 10 (3). Clause 10 (2)(c) states:</PARA>
<PARA>to enter into an agreement (other than an agreement referred to in paragraph (b)) with a State or Territory;</PARA>
<PARA>The only difference between paragraphs (b) and (c) is that (b) says that it is `an agreement for the payment of a grant' and (c) says `to enter into an agreement (other than an agreement referred to in paragraph (b))'. Presumably the agreement refers to an agreement which does not involve an agreement for the payment of a grant and is, therefore, an agreement in relation to something which does not involve money. Yet that particular matter is one on which the Government is choosing to impose an overview of the Minister. I am referring to clause 10 (3), which the Opposition is seeking to remove. It states:</PARA>
<PARA>The power of the Commission to enter into agreements of the kind referred to in paragraph (2)(c) shall not be exercised without the written approval of the Minister. </PARA>
<PARA>In line with what the Minister is saying, it seems to me that potentially he is seeking very wide powers for ATSIC-something which I am supporting. It is a little surprising that in those agreements in which grants are not involved, agreements of a different kind, the Government is seeking to have an overview by the Minister to the extent that those agreements can be entered into only with the written approval of the Minister. If the intention is to impose some sort of accountability, I could understand clause 10 (3) referring to clause 10 (2)(b). But, in fact, it does not. It refers to paragraph 10 (2)(c) where, as I read it, money is not involved. I would like the Minister's comment on why he sees subclause (3) as so essential if it is not a matter of financial accountability. If the Opposition is seeking to delete paragraph 10 (2)(c), why is it deleting subclause 10 (3)? Is it simply a consequence that if the clause to which it refers is deleted--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Coulter is correct in reading clause 10 (2) (c) as having to do with agreements that do not involve the payment of a grant to a State. I am informed that there might be, for example, an agreement between the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission and a State government for the joint administration of housing loans, or some such thing, in which case the agreement would be entered into, but with that supervisory role of the Minister, as indicated in subclause 10 (3), in that his approval would be required. It is ultimately a question of accountability. The Opposition does not need a form of words in relation to paragraph 10 (2) (b) because, if we are correct that clause 55 is the basis of grants of an appropriation which would allow ATSIC to enter into an agreement for the payment of a grant to a State, the Estimates process and the whole Appropriations process would require, as we all know from Estimates committees, full responsibility to be taken for those appropriations. So paragraph 10 (2) (c) operates within a context where the approval of the Minister is required because of the need to ensure that the agreements between ATSIC and the States fall within a general program which is appropriate within our federal system.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA>That while ATSIC might propose a States-grant type arrangement, the grant and any agreement should each be finalised by the Minister. </PARA>
<PARA>I think that would alleviate some of the problems that we will have from State governments as Federal moneys which were normally allocated through section 96 grants will now, under this legislation, go through ATSIC. Senator Coulter expressed fears last night which he referred to as the `down side' or the `flip side'. If an amendment of the sort that I have just proposed were accepted by the Australian Democrats, I think that would put a buffer in there. </PARA>

Moreover, the ATSIC budget will come before the Minister and, through the Minister, back to the Parliament so that essentially the ability to make a bid for one of those grants to the State through the Budget process will be there and the overview will be in place, through the Parliament through the Budget process, although not specifically at the time the decision might be taken. Nonetheless, it will be competent for the Minister to say, `No, you cannot make that sort of grant'. So we do not find that alternative approach acceptable.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA> (14) Page 12, paragraph 18 (1) (a), line 40, leave out the paragraph. </PARA>
<PARA> (15) Page 12, paragraph 18 (1) (b), line 41, leave out ``State, Territory and''. </PARA>
<PARA> (16) Page 13, after subclause 18 (3), add the following new subclause:</PARA>
<PARA> ``(4) The Commission may recommend to the Minister that specified loans or grants of money should be made to:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) a State, the Australian Capital Territory or the Northern Territory; or</PARA>
<PARA> (b) a State or Territory body;</PARA>
<PARA> for the purpose of furthering the social, economic or cultural development of Aboriginal persons or Torres Strait Islanders.''. </PARA>
<PARA>I remind the Committee that it is desirable to group the amendments wherever possible if we are to keep the debate within an orderly frame. These three amendments have been moved to clause 18 of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission Bill. Clause 18 provides to the new Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission a capacity to make loans or grants of money on such terms and conditions as it determines. Subclause (1) specifies that it may do so to:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) the States and the Northern Territory;</PARA>
<PARA> (b) State, Territory and local government bodies;</PARA>
<PARA> (c) Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander corporations; or</PARA>
<PARA> (d) any other incorporated bodies;</PARA>
<PARA>for the purpose of furthering the social, economic or cultural development of Aboriginal persons or Torres Strait Islanders. </PARA>
<PARA> Clause 18 has two other subclauses. I notice that the Opposition has a proposed amendment to subclause (2), which will be part of the Opposition's group 13 amendments. We are still on the group 3 amendments, so we will come back to that at a later stage. I just indicate that that is on the list. </PARA>
<PARA> Our third amendment proposes the addition of a new subclause (4). The first amendment proposed that we leave out clause 18 (1) (a) which seeks to give the Commission power to make, on such terms and conditions as it determines, loans or grants of money to the States, the Australian Capital Territory and the Northern Territory. The Opposition has also moved an amendment to clause 18 (1) (b). We seek to leave out the words `State, Territory and' and retain the words `local government bodies' simpliciter. The third amendment in this group is the insertion of new proposed subclause (4), which would appear at the end of clause 18 on page 13. Proposed subclause (4) states:</PARA>
<PARA>The Commission may recommend to the Minister that specified loans or grants of money should be made to:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) a State, the Australian Capital Territory or the Northern Territory-</PARA>
<PARA>I interpolate here that we did not forget to include the Australian Capital Territory-</PARA>
<PARA> or</PARA>
<PARA> (b) a State or Territory body;</PARA>
<PARA>for the purpose of furthering the social, economic or cultural development of Aboriginal persons or Torres Strait Islanders. </PARA>
<PARA>First, I will talk to the structure of the amendments. It is not the intention of the Opposition, as the Committee will see if it looks at our amendments, that it should be impossible for loans or grants of money to made to a State, the Australian Capital Territory or the Northern Territory or a State or Territory body for the purpose of furthering the social, economic or cultural development of Aboriginal persons or Torres Strait Islanders. That is not and has never been the position of the Opposition. It is just that the mechanism that we propose in that subclause is the mechanism to which I have referred throughout the debate on the previous group 3 amendments. That principle is that the loans or grants should be made by the Minister. The Opposition has sought to insert subclause (4) to enable that to occur. We could then remove from clause 18 (1) (b) the references that I have mentioned and delete clause 18 (1) (a) because they will be subsumed within new subclause (4). I do not want anyone reading the amendments to imagine that we are trying to make it impossible for loans or grants of money to be made to a State, the Australian Capital Territory or the Northern Territory. In fact, proposed new subclause (4) is designed to preserve the position of the States, the Australian Capital Territory and the Northern Territory. </PARA>
<PARA> I reiterate that we base much of our argument on section 96 of the Constitution, which allows the Commonwealth to make grants to the States on such terms and conditions as the Parliament determines. The Minister for Justice (Senator Tate) has made it clear in response to questions that this is the way that the Parliament so determines it shall be done, but the effect will be to provide to the new Commission a capacity to move into the place of government in making section 96 grants or the equivalent of grants. When we were discussing the previous clause, the Minister spoke about agreements. But I remind the Minister that this time we are talking about grants. This time the section 96 analogue is much more exact. It does not require the making of an agreement first. It simply empowers the new Commission to make loans or grants. So the situation here is much more analogous to the section 96 grants provided for by the Constitution. As we have said before, to go down this road, to give to the Commission a function which has previously for almost 90 years remained with the Parliament--</PARA>

We believe that that is where the power should be. We believe that, in spite of what the Minister says about the preparation of Estimates and the examination by Estimates committees, the proper way for States grants legislation to be dealt with is the way in which we have traditionally dealt with it-that is, by means of a Bill for an Act that comes to this place and is debated and voted upon, like all other proposed Acts of Parliament.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Crichton-Browne says that section 96 was put into the Constitution quite deliberately.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It was my own Party, but of the three States I have mentioned one had a National Party Government, one had a Labor Party Government and one had a Liberal Party Government. So my dislike for what they did was quite ecumenical, and the difficulties they made for me were, as it were, non-party political in their origin. They simply did not like to deal with Commonwealth government and we had different ideas about what the constitutional amendment of 1967 had meant. That has been a recurring problem. One of the States actually said that it meant that the Commonwealth had to do everything. We had to say, `No, it is a matter of conjoint powers in this area now'. We were told by the State that that was nonsense. A former State Premier, now serving in this Parliament-there is only one-once told me that the function of the States is always to take the socks off the Commonwealth. Having been a Commonwealth Minister, I have no doubt that he is correct.</PARA></TALK.START>

I said to the relevant Minister that it was my department and that was how I chose to do it. That shut him up.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I come back to the amendments. In the previous group of amendments we were talking about the making of agreements. The Minister correctly pointed out that an agreement involved two parties, but this clause of the Bill is different. It is now talking about loans and grants. The section 96 analogy is quite appropriate. The amounts which are granted in these State grants will not now appear as appropriations in Appropriation Bill (No. 2). They will be voted by the Parliament as part of the funds of ATSIC. We do not yet know how those funds will be presented. The difference is a difference which every senator should appreciate. Our powers in relation to Appropriation Bill  (No. 1) differ markedly from our powers in relation to Appropriation Bill (No. 2). </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="XF4">Senator Crichton-Browne</NAME></TALKER>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ME4">Senator PETER BAUME</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This question of which is the appropriate Bill in which matters should appear has concerned Senator Crichton-Browne in relation to the appropriations for the Parliament. I put to Senator Coulter and other members of the Committee that if we are unhappy with any elements in ATSIC's vote, and if that appears as part of Appropriation Bill (No. 1), all we can do from this place is make a request for an alteration. I remember that former Senator Sir Reginald Wright fought long and hard in this place for proper separation of items between Appropriation Bill (No. 1) and Appropriation Bill (No. 2). I put it to the Committee that one of the consequences of going down this track is that certain matters will be moved from Appropriation Bill (No. 2) to appear in the estimates of ATSIC's funds and as such will be much less amendable by the Parliament.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I return to the amendments. These amendments would require the Commission, if it decided it wanted to make a loan or a grant, to recommend to the Minister what grants or loans should be made to the States and Territories and it would then be for the Minister to arrange for the moneys concerned to be voted. That would occur through Appropriation Bill (No. 2). In that way the Parliament would have proper oversight over the moneys, as it has had for 89 years. </PARA>
<PARA> I come back to the other point that I made to the Minister earlier. As the Bill is drafted, the Commission is not obliged to make any grant or loan-not a single cent-to any State or Territory. It might well decide to do away with all the State grants going to Senator Coulter's State, to Senator Boswell's State or to Senator McKiernan's State. The Commission is not obliged to pay a single cent to any State or Territory. Under clause 10 it can negotiate agreements with the States. I agree; Senator Tate has made that clear. But refusal by a State to negotiate or accept ATSIC's terms could easily be met with a refusal to pay any money to the State in order to help its Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander citizens. The scope which that will provide for disruption to the Aboriginal programs for which a State has responsibility would be considerable. </PARA>
<PARA> For all those reasons the Opposition believes that the three amendments which it has proposed are reasonable and necessary. I commend them to the Committee.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We return to the argument we had with the previous amendments-that is, we are going through a complete devolution of the power of the State governments. I support Senator Peter Baume because he has been a Minister for Aboriginal Affairs. He gave us some anecdotal evidence of his experiences when he was a Minister. We have to deal with facts. I come from a State that is very pro State rights, and I know that Senator Crichton-Browne represents such a State also. We face the problem that State governments which believe that they are doing an excellent job on Aboriginal affairs will be seen as absolutely downgraded by clause 18 (1). It refers to loans and grants for special purposes and states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>Subject to subsections (2) and (3), the Commission may, on such terms and conditions as it determines, make loans or grants of money to:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) the States and the Northern Territory;</PARA>
<PARA> (b) State, Territory and local government bodies . . . </PARA>
<PARA>.Community governments do get Federal allocations, so I suppose that clause 18 (1) (b) would be all right as far as local governments are concerned. But it is certainly an affront to the State governments that they will have to deal with the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission (ATSIC) rather than have ministerial contact. Again I say to Senator Coulter that it is not the State governments that will suffer. Ultimately, it is the Aboriginal people who will suffer as State governments move away from having departments of Aboriginal affairs. </PARA>
<PARA> Unfortunately, Senator Coulter missed going to Queensland. I would have been delighted if his time had allowed him to go to Queensland with the Select Committee on the Administration of Aboriginal Affairs to see what the Queensland State Government has done for its Aboriginal people. Some of the members of the Committee from other States acknowledged privately-I do not expect them to do it publicly; these were members of a different political persuasion from mine-that the communities in Queensland were far better run and had better facilities than those in most of the other States. </PARA>
<PARA> I say to Senator Coulter with all the force I can muster that he is playing a very dangerous game. I cannot see anything wrong with the Federal Government under this legislation allocating its proportion of taxpayers' money through ATSIC. If that is what it wants to do that is fair enough. But surely we can come to some common ground in the interests of Aboriginal people that those allocations will be made on a government to government basis. It is not hard. It does not require an amendment. It does not require us to pull ATSIC to pieces. </PARA>
<PARA> Under the formal words that Senator Baume proposed in the previous amendments, the Commission will still be making the allocations to the various States but it will be doing it in the traditional way that this Parliament has followed for the last 89 years-that is, on a government to government basis. I know that when I go back to my home State and tell the Aboriginal affairs Minister that he is no longer to have any dealings with the Federal Minister for Aboriginal Affairs he will be absolutely horrified. His natural reaction will be to ask, `What do they expect from us? We have just given seven million acres to the Aboriginal people. We have given them all the communities and the islands. We have established local governments throughout these communities and given them the power to make their own decisions. While we are giving them the power to allow them to do this, we are being treated with absolute contempt by the Federal Parliament'. I have raised this matter before. I know the regard that the Australian Democrats hold State governments in, but it is not up to the Democrats to rewrite the Constitution. The fact is that State governments exist under the Constitution. Whether the Democrats want or have no regard for State governments is of no importance; the fact is that under the Constitution they have the power to exist. Senator Coulter has to recognise that-not from a party political point of view, but as a fact of life. They exist for the betterment of the Aboriginal and Islander people. Senator Coulter is ignoring these facts to the detriment of the people who will be terribly affected. I ask Senator Coulter to reconsider his attitude, particularly on this clause, to see whether he can find it in his heart to recognise that State governments exist and provide services and that those State and Territory government services will be reduced if we proceed down the course of taking the power to allocate funds away from the State governments and Ministers and giving it to ATSIC. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;What Senator Boswell has just said is a non sequitur because he is seeking to remove paragraphs (a) and (b) of clause 18 (1), which gives grants to the States, the Northern Territory and local government bodies. Clearly, the recognition that those bodies exist and have certain rights and powers is written into that clause. Senator Boswell has several times had a go at the Australian Democrats in relation to our attitude to State governments and States' rights. `States' rights' is a term much loved by the Federal Opposition. Quite a substantial body of legal opinion says that the constitutional position is that the States have those rights which have not yet been taken up by the Commonwealth. Certainly, our position is that in many areas the Commonwealth should exercise its powers far more widely than it has hitherto. We believe the Commonwealth has much wider powers, particularly in environmental protection. Indeed, we have urged the Federal Government to exercise its powers under section 51 (i) and section 51 (xx) of the Federal Constitution, the trade and commerce power and corporations power, to properly protect the environment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Specifically on the matter of the States, we would prefer that government be much closer to the people and, as I believe is the fundamental position of the Labor Party, we would prefer much more powerful and larger regional governments and the Commonwealth Government, with the State governments disappearing altogether. That would be a much better administrative structure for Australia, and that is the position of the Democrats. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like the Minister's comment on the amendment proposed by the Opposition because it seems to me that clause 10, which we were debating earlier, allowed the Commission to enter into agreements to do certain things, and this is the complementary one which allows it specifically to do that, having entered into the agreement. That is the way I would read it. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Clause 18 epitomises all that I find objectionable about the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission Bill in the sense of the assumption of responsibility it takes unto itself. I have wider objections to it which go to the heart of the problem, that is, the Bill will do more to destroy the Aboriginal community, their well-being, future growth and development than anything else I can imagine. But as I said last time I spoke on this issue, as long as we have a Minister who is ideologically driven by a personal ambition to stamp his social mark on the Aboriginal community, I expect that we will be visited by other Bills like this in due course.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Bill fundamentally dismantles the three tiers of government, their composition and their intrinsic relationship with each other. The Bill-naked, unclothed and in the light of day-fundamentally sets upon the community of Australia, black and white, a new political system, a parliament for Aboriginal people. That is the Minister's view of self-determination. As Senator Peter Baume said before, it will do anything but that because the people of the regions and the zones will end up representing absolutely nobody. Certainly, they will not be representing the people in the way in which they are used to being represented. </PARA>
<PARA> I was horrified to hear the Australian Democrats' spokesman, Senator Coulter, in his glib and predictable way, talk about States' rights. That is the indulgent form of the expression we hear these days from this new brand of politician. They should refer to States' responsibilities and the rights that accompany the responsibilities. To hear the Democrats say that the power of the States is that power which has not yet been assumed by the Commonwealth really sums up their attitude towards the federal system of government in Australia. It is summed up also by their policy, which talks about State boundaries being an accident of history and which says that they ought to be dissolved and replaced by local government regions. In other words, they propose doing away with the States. That is in their platform. </PARA>
<PARA> As the Minister for Justice, Senator Tate, will know better than most, the Australian Democrats time after time have introduced into the Parliament legislation which fundamentally seeks to usurp the responsibilities and the role of the States. The legislation for uniform land rights for the Aboriginal community in Queensland, introduced by Senator Macklin in about 1982, is probably still sitting on the Notice Paper somewhere gathering dust, like most of the Democrats' decaying and failed proposals. It seems to me that the Democrats do not understand the history of Federation. They do not acknowledge that this creature of the Commonwealth Parliament was arrived at by agreement by our founding fathers through the imprimatur given to them by the various States-the founding States, the original States. The founding fathers were very clear and distinct in ensuring that the powers given under the Commonwealth were to be clear and defined and that residual power was to rest with the States. </PARA>

It was never intended that the insidious, pernicious intrusion into their rights by what some describe as the enlightened High Court of Australia would ever take the powers away to the extent it has because, of course, the Constitution would never have been consummated.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As a bit of political trivia for Senator Coulter, it was only as a result of the fact that we had so many eastern States goldmining prospectors in the western goldfields that Western Australia ended up voting for the Constitution. It was the eastern Staters who had planted themselves in Kalgoorlie and Coolgardie that swamped the positive and responsible reflex of traditional Western Australian people who in the end ensured that the Yes case was carried, notwithstanding the best endeavours of Lord Forrest in those days to persuade the local people it was right because he had been promised a side deal-and that was self-determination in Western Australia-by our dear father and mother country. That is how we got the Constitution. We got it no other way than by the collective wisdom of the various States coming together. These days some assume that all wisdom, knowledge and understanding flow from Canberra back to the States which have mendicant, subservient, second-class parliaments that really ought to deal with the inconsequential matters of life. Of course, the situation is anything but that. </PARA>
<PARA> This legislation tears at the very fabric of the three tiers of government in Australia. It seems to ignore the fact that local government, for instance-and it is a sin of not only this Bill but also successive governments-is a creature of State legislation. It ignores the intrinsic relationship between Commonwealth, State and local governments. It is totally inimical to good government in this country. </PARA>
<PARA> I have no doubt that the Bill will be divisive and destructive and will achieve absolutely no purpose other than to give a warm inner glow to those who believe that self-determination, whatever that means, is more important than the fundamentals that go to the well-being of the Aboriginal community. It is not without significance that the Government, supported ably by the Democrats, has directed all its energy into this legislation because it came to the conclusion at the end of the day that there were no politics in uniform land rights, notwithstanding the fact that they were fundamental to the platform of the Australian Labor Party when it was elected in 1983 and remain fundamental to the platform of the Democrats in 1989. They were also fundamental to the platform of the Labor Party in Western Australia when it was elected. Of course, it stepped back from the proposition. </PARA>
<PARA> I am only sorry that this Bill will not be thoroughly defeated, but I conclude by saying to Senator Coulter: let there be no secret about where the Democrats stand in respect to States. It is in their platform. Let there be no secret about where the Labor Party stands. The temporary Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) said in the Boyer lectures that he believed in the abolition of the States. This legislation will go a long way down the road to undermining the States' constitutional responsibility, to no good end. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, I will give Senator Crichton-Browne a name. He specifically mentioned uniform land rights and the situation in Western Australia where, to quote his words, the Western Australian Government backed down on land rights. The reason for that was the Australian Mining Industry Council (AMIC) ran a successful and very expensive advertising campaign to defeat land rights in Western Australia and politically the Government was forced to back down. That is precisely what Senator Crichton-Browne is on about. He is on about keeping the States in a situation where they are not strong enough because they can be struck off one against the other. That would not be possible if the Commonwealth Government were to exercise properly its powers in this respect.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Of course we support, as Senator Crichton-Browne has said the Labor Party does, uniform land rights. Let us make no bones about the hidden agenda which Senator Crichton-Browne and people such as him have when he extols the virtues of so-called States rights. It is not States rights he is on about; it is protecting the powers of rich people who can then override the interests of the States, not only with respect to Aboriginal affairs but with respect to things such as petrochemical plants-major industrial developments-where one State will give in to a proposal rather than see it go to another State. We desperately need much stronger Commonwealth powers to be exercised in those areas. Let us not have too much more argument about States rights. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I did not take a point of order when Senator Coulter reflected upon my motives. I found his remarks inaccurate rather than offensive because I am not very often desperately hurt by the piercing shafts of the Australian Democrats. But at least I would like to have the record put right. To my knowledge, the Labor Party of Western Australia, whose platform called for uniform land rights, did not introduce land rights legislation into the State Parliament because the then Premier-some would say, perhaps unkindly, the now discredited then Premier-made a pragmatic political judgment that he was in the wrong canoe in the same way that he aborted his legislation in respect of electoral reform, over which the Hon. Arthur Tonkin, the then Minister responsible for electoral reform, resigned. I suppose Senator Coulter would blame the Australian Mining Industry Council (AMIC) for that. The truth of the matter is that on both occasions the Premier put his nose to the wind and sniffed from whence it was coming. It was nothing to do with AMIC, mining companies or friends of friends; it was a political reality that when he did his polling he discovered he was on a loser. Always inclined to be a winner, he did not back bad causes. When he did back bad causes, he packed his bags and went to the Vatican.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not have a tremendous amount to say because I regard this small group of amendments as being consequential on the three amendments we have just voted down. They are really all part of a parcel and were grouped together originally by Senator Peter Baume.

<PARA> Basically, the political fear expressed most eloquently by Senators Boswell and Crichton-Browne is that somehow-and I think Senator Crichton-Browne himself used the term-the responsibilities of the States, rather than their rights, will be diminished by the way in which this series of clauses in the Bill is put together. Once again, I remind the Committee that, if one looks at the objects clause of this legislation, one sees precisely that the intention of the Parliament is made clear: that whatever ATSIC may or may not do, it should not detract from the responsibilities-and that term is used in clause 3 (d)-of the State, Territory and local governments to provide services to their Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples.

It would be very said if, as Senator Boswell indicates, States were to give up their responsibilities in this area because they thought that the Commonwealth should take an exclusive funding role for the provision of services to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. I do not see this particular provision as exacerbating the situation. Senator Boswell indicates that it is already under way in some States; that is unfortunately their political decision. I do not see that the mechanism provided here for ATSIC to make moneys available by agreement with the States need exacerbate that effect. In fact, it might lead to a cooperative and joint approach which can only be to the benefit of the Torres Strait Islander and Aboriginal peoples of Australia. It is the intention of the Government, obviously, to oppose these amendments.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister has not responded to a number of matters which I raised and to which the Opposition would like some response. However, may I begin by returning to the Minister's reference to clause 3 (d). The words he used came from the following passage:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>to ensure co-ordination in the formulation and implementation of policies affecting Aboriginal persons and Torres Strait Islanders by the Commonwealth, State, Territory and local governments,</PARA>
<PARA>I note the words `Australian Capital Territory' have not been added there, and perhaps they need to be. The passage continues:</PARA>
<PARA>without detracting from the responsibilities of State, Territory and local governments to provide services to their Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander residents. </PARA>
<PARA>I just note those words. In fact, that is not relevant. No-one is suggesting that this clause would, in some way, require the States to detract from the responsibilities of State governments to provide their own services. Senator Tate-That it would have that effect was Senator Boswell's theory. </PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ME4">Senator PETER BAUME</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It would, if the States grants programs were unilaterally discontinued by ATSIC. I will suggest to the Minister how that might happen. ATSIC might well decide that the State of Tasmania received so much by way of States grants money, but it could be better applied if ATSIC spent it directly. ATSIC might make that decision and say that it was a proper exercise of its power. It might discontinue that money. If that happens, the programs in that State which are dependent upon States grants will be put in jeopardy. That is not inconsistent with the objects clause. That money has been provided to the State of Tasmania, as it were, in addition to money it might spend to discharge its own responsibilities as set out in that clause.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The points which I was making and to which I sought answers from the Minister remain unanswered. First of all, is it correct that, if this clause stood, moneys which are now provided for by way of States grants Bills and moneys which appear in Appropriation Bill (No. 2) will no longer do so? The Minister said in response to earlier questions, I think yesterday, that the moneys would appear in the ATSIC estimates and was asked whether they would not appear in Appropriation Bill (No. 1). I want that made clear because it has a consequence for the capacities of this chamber, because of other provisions in the Constitution with which the Minister is much more familiar than am I. That should at least be answered so it is on the record. A number of people will want to read the record, and we want a statement on the record here for the future. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Further, I would like confirmation of our concern that, given a less advantageous scenario, clauses 10 and 18 together might well lead to a States grants program being discontinued, because there is nothing here to require ATSIC to continue with States grants programs. These are merely enabling clauses to provide ATSIC to do so if it wishes, but the programs, which have been very considerable over a number of years-perhaps 15 or 20-may well be discontinued by the Commission in the exercise of its powers and the pursuit of its functions. The concern has been expressed to us that the refusal by a State to negotiate the ATSIC terms could easily be met with a refusal to pay anything to that State.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The last point on which the Opposition would like some comment is this: Are we correct in assuming that this clause was not discussed with State and Territory Ministers prior to its appearance in the Parliament in the draft of the Bill last year, and that it was part of the material about which the Ministers expressed their concern at the Australian Aboriginal Affairs Council meeting in November to which the Minister has already referred?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Peter Baume is quite right-this is an enabling piece of legislation. It does not attempt to guarantee or to put particular grants to the States in place forever. The idea that the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission would walk away from all these grants is somewhat far-fetched. Technically, in a legal sense, the States will be in as much or as little jeopardy or peril as they presently are as far as States grants are concerned. Obviously, whether they continue to be offered will depend on the will of the body bestowing the grants-the Government or the Commission. That will always be the case. Commonsense would indicate that those various grants to the States will continue, but of course not in an absolutely fixed form forever.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The third question related to consultations. I have already explained that I do not have a clear knowledge of the sorts of discussions that might or might not have taken place between the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs (Mr Hand) and the State Ministers up to the November Australian Aboriginal Affairs Council meeting in 1988. The fact is that since that time some eight months have elapsed and the Minister has been willing to talk with State Ministers in regard to their concerns about ATSIC in the terms of the resolution passed at the meeting. He has continually sought meetings with those Ministers but has been able successfully to hold such meetings with only two States and one Territory. All discussions require two parties, and for one reason or another the other States have not thought it necessary to come forward and hold those discussions in the terms of that resolution. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It emerges clearly from the explanation of the Minister for Justice (Senator Tate) that the capacity of this Parliament to amend or to vary States grants in the Aboriginal area will be quite markedly reduced by the passage of this legislation in the form proposed. The Minister has said that it will not reduce our capacity to examine them by way of the Estimates process. That is not contested, but all senators know, and the Committee will be aware, that our capacity to amend anything in Appropriation Bill (No. 1) is extremely limited. Further, I remind the Committee that this is the democratic parliamentary chamber of Australia-not the other place, which is always the executive chamber, always controlled by the government of the day. If there is to be any examination other than just an examination of a formal nature such as occurs in the other place with set piece speeches and predictable votes, it will take place in the parliamentary chamber-and that is the Australian Senate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There are Bills which the Australian Senate cannot amend. The Government is proposing that certain functions be passed from a Bill which we can amend and from a process which we have been able to amend to a process which we are no longer able to amend. We believe that to be a retrograde step and something that we will live to regret. </PARA>

Our concern is to try to ensure that the Parliament does not lose its capacity to oversight these appropriations. The Minister has made it clear that we can examine them. I ask the Minister: When did we last amend Appropriation Bill (No. 1)? When did we last move a request that was acceded to?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have spoken to the Minister for Justice (Senator Tate), who will be back in the chamber in just a moment. In the meantime I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>(17) Page 85, clause 221, lines 33 to 35, leave out the clause. </PARA>
<PARA>Those honourable senators who are following the debate may wish to turn to page 84 of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission Bill 1989. This draws attention once again to the enormity of this legislative package. Not only do we have three Bills but in this particular Bill we are going to 89 pages of legislation. I refer honourable senators to clause 221. It is the Opposition's view that this clause should be omitted. Clause 221 as it is proposed will repeal various sections of the Aboriginal Affairs (Arrangements with the States) Act 1973. Honourable senators may realise that this is the legislation under which arrangements were negotiated between the Commonwealth and the States in relation to Aboriginal affairs, arrangements which have been the basis for many of the agreements which have now lasted for some years and which underlie the sharing of services, the funding of services and the sharing of responsibilities. It is proposed in the clause that these parts of the Aboriginal Affairs (Arrangements with the States) Act 1973 be repealed and this is done as part of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission (ATSIC) package. It is really part of the group of amendments which we have been discussing for the last hour or two. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition wishes to oppose this proposal. Under the sections of the Act which this clause would repeal, the Governor-General and the Governors of the States may enter into arrangements relating to their respective responsibilities for Aboriginal affairs administration. Such arrangements have been made between the Commonwealth and all States, except the State of Queensland. That is another story. We deal directly with Queensland but not with the benefit of an arrangement made under this particular Act. I ask the Committee to consider that not only has the Commonwealth decided to repeal sections of this Act which identify the respective responsibilities of the Commonwealth and States for Aboriginal affairs legislation but that it was done without any consultation of any kind with the States. This proposal appeared in the ATSIC Bill of last year and the first the States knew about it was when the Bill appeared in Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> This is at the very least evidence of clumsiness. It is probably evidence of quite gross discourtesy by the Commonwealth towards the State governments that, having entered into agreements in good faith and having operated those agreements, some of them for many years-I remind honourable senators that the Act to which it refers was an Act from 1973-it will repeal that Act and will bring this provision into this Parliament without having consulted with the States which are to be affected. Without any consultation with the States, clause 10, and presumably clause 18 which we have just discussed, were all inserted in the ATSIC Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> Presumably the effect of this clause is that the Commonwealth wishes unilaterally to abjure the arrangements. On its own that is a very significant act of government. At the very least the Commonwealth would have consulted with State Premiers; the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) would have consulted with State Premiers to say that he would abjure certain arrangements which have been in existence for years. It was not done. Presumably the result of the passage of this clause will be that the States will henceforth have to negotiate with the ATSIC commissioners to obtain money for the States in ways which we have set out in the debate which has now gone on for some time. </PARA>
<PARA> I think it is important for the Committee to dwell for a moment upon the discourtesy and the clumsiness which this history of events, this record of events, sets out. We invite the Minister to tell us why this was done unilaterally. Why is it that the States first knew of this when the first Bill appeared in the Parliament in 1988? Was there some benefit from ambush? Is there some strategic necessity that the States not be advised in advance of a matter as significant as this? We have been concerned about some of the other clauses, but this seeks unilaterally--</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ME4">Senator PETER BAUME</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is a total breach of faith, as Senator Stone says. We have a major concern about the process which was followed as it is revealed and set out in this particular clause of the ATSIC legislation. However, as a matter of law the arrangements which have been made continue in force. There are still arrangements between the Commonwealth and the States. Those arrangements do not disappear. The Minister has never referred to this. Perhaps the Minister has not actually considered what will happen to the arrangements presently in existence if the enabling Act is repealed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Senator Stone" NAMEID="LJ4">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="LJ4">Senator Stone</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;But presumably, those arrangements-and I have not looked at one for a long time-have clauses which actually provide for consultation between the Premiers or the relevant Ministers of the States and the respective Commonwealth Minister.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ME4">Senator PETER BAUME</NAME></TALKER>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ME4">Senator PETER BAUME</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Whether they are still extant, and whether they were followed. I suspect that the answers will be that there are consultative mechanisms but that they were not followed and the States were not involved in any consultation-that the consequences are quite disastrous but the arrangements themselves may well continue. If that is the case, perhaps the Minister can tell us whether the arrangements will continue or cease to operate and, if so, from what date. Perhaps he can tell us the consequences of this particular clause being agreed to.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Minister actually told State Ministers at the AAAC meeting, the ministerial council meeting, on 18 November last year, that there was no intention-these were the Minister's words-to vary States grants. However, if this clause is retained and various sections of the Aboriginal Affairs (Arrangements with the States) Act 1973 are repealed, and if clause 10 stands-and we have already voted on that-and clause 18 stands, the matter will pass out of the Minister's hands. It will not matter what the Minister thinks because ATSIC will then have the powers conferred on it by the statute. Fine intentions butter no parsnips, as people say. The Minister may say that there is no intention to vary the arrangements, but if this clause is agreed to and clause 10 stands--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Fine words, are they? I thank Senator Stone-the matter will pass out of the Minister's hands. The Minister cannot tell this Committee what the intentions of the commissioners may be. Further-and this is a very important point-a document was sent to the States on 5 January 1989. That document purports to offer certain reassurances to the States. Let us listen to what the document says. It has quite a few numbered paragraphs. Paragraph 21 states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Commonwealth/State Arrangements. The ATSIC Bill repeals the States Grants (Aboriginal Assistance) Act 1976, and the substantive provisions of the Aboriginal Affairs (Arrangements with the States) Act 1973. </PARA>
<PARA>I interpolate that any concerns we have with the States Grants (Aboriginal Assistance) Act we will deal with at a later time. I return to the document:</PARA>
<PARA>This has led to a concern that States and the Northern Territory will somehow be disadvantaged. </PARA>
<PARA>Paragraph 22 states:</PARA>
<PARA> These concerns are again without foundation. The substantive provisions of the legislation to be repealed are incorporated in clauses 10 and 17 of the ATSIC Bill--</PARA>
<PARA>The reference to clause 17 should probably read `clause 18', but it depends which version of the Bill one has. I have confirmation that it is in fact clause 18. The document continues:</PARA>
<PARA>and specifically provide for the negotiation of `arrangements' between the Commonwealth and the States, and for States Grants programs. The current `arrangements' established under the 1973 Act are moribund, and in need of overhaul. </PARA>
<PARA>That is the view of the Commonwealth. Paragraph 23 states:</PARA>

Under the ATSIC legislation as it stands a State Minister will have to go with cap in hand to a clerk, a commissioner or some employee of ATSIC. The approach will not be made on a direct Minister to Minister basis. We have been arguing about that for the last two or three hours. Unfortunately, we have not been able to get Senator Coulter to support our proposals. The situation gets worse with this particular clause. We are told that the State governments were not told about this provision before the legislation came out. In fact, the Minister told the State Ministers at the Australian Aboriginal Affairs Council meeting on 18 November that there was no intention to vary State grants. If this clause is retained in the legislation the matter goes completely out of the Minister's hands. Not even the Federal Minister will have the right to grant allocations to the States. All allocations will be made through ATSIC. We can expect trade-offs-`We'll give you this if you do that', and `We want you to spend your money, not our money'. If ATSIC said, `We want you to do this and we'll provide the funds for it', that would be fair enough, but that will not happen. What will be said is, `We'll give you so much money if you will go ahead with a particular project'. There will be trade-offs and they will not be in the best interests of the Aboriginal people.

Senator Tate says that it is not establishing a black parliament. It is a black parliament, all right. It is not only a black parliament that is being set up; it will be a parliament that will put itself above a democratically elected State Government. Even worse, if this clause is allowed to stay, it will put itself beyond this Federal Parliament, beyond this Senate. Under this clause ATSIC will make the allocations, not the Federal Government and not the State governments. That is usurping the power of a democratically elected government and a democratically elected Senate. The House of review will have no input. It can do nothing other than sit back and watch some kind of quasi, black parliament. I make no excuse for saying that. However I do not want to be racist. In fact, I have been trying to avoid that connotation throughout this debate. But that is what we are setting up. Let there be no mistake about that. It will be an Aboriginal parliament that will be able to bypass this Federal, democratically elected parliament.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I might be able to help the Committee. There has been some misunderstanding about the nature of the Aboriginal Affairs (Arrangements with the States) Act 1973. It deals with that time in the history of the rearrangement of responsibilities within the Federation for the welfare of Aboriginal people. It provides for the assumption by the Commonwealth of responsibilities and for the employment of persons who were engaged by State governments in the provision of such services. It is to those arrangements that section 5 of that Act refers. I am advised that it does not refer to the making of financial grants of assistance to the States. As I said earlier, it is to do with the consequence of the referendum which it was thought might require the Commonwealth assuming some of the departmental functions around the Federation. Having said all that, I do not believe that this clause in the Bill is necessary. Having given it some thought during the last quarter of an hour I accept the amendment as proposed by Senator Peter Baume to delete the clause.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA>Amendments No. 18 and No. 19 are amendments to clause 12 on page 9. Amendments No. 20 and No. 21 are amendments to the same clause on the following page. Clause 9 relates to ministerial directions. Our amendments are concerned with the power given to the Minister to issue directions. The first of our amendments requires some explanation. I can see the departmental officers smiling and I understand why. They would say, `You have been insistent upon a limitation of the power to issue directions being general directions when it was the case of the Aboriginal Development Commission', and so we did. But we are saying when it comes to ATSIC that that is not any longer an appropriate limitation. I do not want to argue that point but it really is the point of the argument. The amendment seeks to leave out the word `general' as it appears in clause 12 (1) at line 34. I will explain that. While it may have been appropriate for the provision appearing in the Aboriginal Development Commission Act-and I think we argued the same thing in the debate on the Aboriginal Development Commission Amendment Bill which we recently considered in this Committee-to restrict the Minister to giving the Commission general directions, it does not follow that that is an appropriate course to be followed for ATSIC. ATSIC is a differently constructed creature. It is a Commission with different powers. ATSIC is intended to cover the whole field of Aboriginal administration. We have only to go to the Minister's second reading speech, to the speeches of honourable senators who have taken part in an earlier debate on the second reading and to look at the speeches at the second reading stage here to understand that it is envisaged that ATSIC will have a very extensive role across the whole range of Aboriginal administration in this country. The purpose of ATSIC is to bring together under one heading services which were not previously operating together. </PARA>
<PARA>Sitting suspended from 6.30 to 8 p.m. </PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ME4">Senator PETER BAUME</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Before the sitting was suspended for dinner I had offered some argument in support of the amendments. Specifically, I had made the point-and I will not rehearse the whole argument again-that the giving of directions, other than general directions, is appropriate because of the very broad ambit and the very great reach of the proposed Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission (ATSIC). If there is to be an acceptable degree of ministerial control of ATSIC, and if there is to be an acceptable degree of accountability for the actions undertaken by ATSIC, the Minister really needs to have a power to direct the Commission.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The question is: How much ministerial control is appropriate? The Opposition believes, as it does with the Aboriginal Development Commission, that no Minister should be able to direct the Commission as to the content of any advice that the commissioners may wish to give to him. We believe that any proposal for directions must provide adequate protection for sacred, secret information. I do not have to go over that argument; it is one which we raised when we were debating the Australian Institute of Aboriginal Studies Bill. I think we even raised it when we were discussing this legislation on Friday. </PARA>
<PARA> We therefore moved, as our first amendment in this group, that the word `general' be left out for reasons which I have stated. We have argued for the second of these amendments-that is, the amendment to clause 12 (2), lines 38 and 39-that we leave out `by the Commission to a Minister, Department of State or authority of the Commonwealth', and just say `to the Minister'. We believe it is appropriate that ministerial directions should relate to the content of advice, information or recommendations that may be given back to the Minister. We are not saying that advice should not be given to other bodies. But, as this is written, a ministerial direction may say that the Minister could otherwise direct the Commission to give advice to the Australia Council in relation to the Aboriginal Arts Board, or that it could authorise the Minister to give advice to that department of state-I think it is the Department of Administrative Services-which has the carriage of the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody, and so on. That is why we have moved that amendment. </PARA>
<PARA> The other two amendments relate to clause 12 on page 10 of the Bill. Clause 12 (3) states:</PARA>
<PARA> Subsection (1) does not empower the Minister to give directions relating to the content of any advice, information or recommendation that may be given by the Commission to a Minister, Department of State or authority of a State or Territory, except for the purpose of protecting the confidentiality of information given to the Commission by the Commonwealth . . . </PARA>
<PARA>We do not understand why that subclause is necessary; we do not know why it is needed and we believe that it should be deleted. </PARA>
<PARA> In relation to clause 12 (5), we have suggested that the wording is not appropriate. Without going over the arguments again, I refer honourable senators to the debates we have already had where we have sought to deal with this question of culturally sensitive or secret and sacred information. We have been trying to get a form of words which would be acceptable to the Committee. I believe that we were able to reach an accommodation in some of the other areas and we are trying to do it again. We think the words that have been included in the Bill would be improved by deleting subclause (5) and substituting the subclause which we have proposed. Subclause (5) would then read:</PARA>
<PARA>A copy of a direction laid before the Parliament in accordance with subsection (4) shall not disclose any matters the disclosure of which in that manner would be inconsistent with the views or sensitivities of relevant Aboriginal persons or Torres Strait Islanders. </PARA>
<PARA>We believe that that is an appropriate move. </PARA>
<PARA> In relation to subclauses (3) and (5) of clause 12 on page 10 of the Bill, I draw the Minister's attention to a report by the Senate Standing Committee for the Scrutiny of Bills which, in 1989, made the following observations:</PARA>
<PARA> Clause 12 relates to the Commission performing its functions and exercising its powers in accordance with general directions given by the Minister. </PARA>
<PARA> Subclause 12 (3) states that the Minister is not empowered to give directions relating to the content of advice that may be given by the Commission to a Minister, Department of State or authority of a State or Territory</PARA>
<PARA>`except for the purposes of protecting the confidentiality of information . . . </PARA>
<PARA> Subclause 12 (5) states that a direction laid before Parliament by the Minister `shall not disclose any matters known to the Minister to be held sacred by Aboriginal persons or Torres Strait Islanders . . . </PARA>
<PARA>The Scrutiny of Bills Committee then commented in the following terms:</PARA>
<PARA> The Committee fully appreciates the concerns of the Minister in this area, but in order to keep Parliament as fully informed as is reasonable in all the circumstances, felt that the Minister shall include a brief statement as to the general nature of any direction relating to sacred matters. </PARA>
<PARA>The Scrutiny of Bills Committee reported that the Minister responded. Leaving out the introductory paragraph, the Minister said:</PARA>
<PARA> This is an entirely legitimate concern, but is based on a misinterpretation of the clause in question. Subclause 12 (5) does not provide an exemption from disclosure where directions relate to sacred matters (a highly unlikely event), but rather provides that the mandatory publication of all directions (whether they relate to sacred matters or not) shall not disclose information of a sacred nature. </PARA>
<PARA> Consequently, the Parliament will always be informed, at least in general terms, of any directions made by the Minister. </PARA>
<PARA>The Opposition has looked at the subclause. I note that subclause (5) has what I consider to be a fatal weakness. I draw this particularly to the attention of Senator Coulter. If honourable senators look at the second line in subclause (5) they will see that it  refers--</PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Senator Coulter" NAMEID="TF4">

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Coulter has anticipated me; it contains the words `known to the Minister'. I take it that the honourable senator realises the weakness of the words as written. This subclause would provide an absolute defence, should this ever be tested, for the Minister to say that such a matter was not `known to the Minister'. Why are the words there?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In any event, I do not want to become too difficult on this matter. We believe that there has been a common purpose in the Committee to look at these various provisions covering confidential or sensitive material in each of the Bills that have come before us. Amendment No. 21 has been moved in the same spirit and for the same reasons as we have put forward previously. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have listened carefully to Senator Baume's explanation of the reasons behind the suggested amendments. But, to be frank, I just cannot give such weight to the different scope of the functions and powers that might be exercised by the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission (ATSIC), as compared with the old Aboriginal Development Commission (ADC), that would require such a degree of accountability to be taken by way of ministerial control and that would justify the giving of more specific directions than are envisaged by clause 12 (1), as drafted. Apart from saying that ATSIC will have a wider range of functions and powers, I do not think that Senator Baume advanced any other reason. I cannot see how what he admits is a balancing act between the self-management of the Commission and the need to be accountable leads to his conclusion that specific directions could be justified.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> All we are trying to do in clause 12 (3) is carry into effect the provisions in section 11 (2) of the Aboriginal Development Commission Act, except that we have divided them into two proposed subsections-12 (2) and 12 (3). I think that, once again, there is not sufficient difference between the ADC and ATSIC to justify the amendments that Senator Baume seeks to move. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="NJ4">Senator TATE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Section 11 (2). Section 11 (1) reads:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>The Commission-</PARA>
<PARA>that is, the ADC-</PARA>
<PARA>shall perform its functions and exercise its powers in accordance with such general directions as are given to it by the Minister in writing. </PARA>
<PARA>That is simply reduplicated in clause 12 (1). Section 11 (2) of the ADC Act reads:</PARA>
<PARA>Subsection (1) does not empower the Minister to give directions relating to the content of any advice, information or recommendation that may be given by the Commission to a Minister, Department or authority of the Commonwealth or of a State or Territory. </PARA>
<PARA>Clearly, subclauses (2) and (3) have been divided to cover the same ground as section 11 (2), except for the fact that clause 12 (3) as proposed allows the Minister to give direction relating to the content for the purpose of protecting the confidentiality of information given to the Commission by the Commonwealth or an authority of the Commonwealth. That is the only exception. So this is all very much in accordance with well-developed practice in relation to the Aboriginal Development Commission. </PARA>
<PARA> I think that we will try to redraft clause 12 (5). I would like to see the matter such that-I made a note of it during the dinner break-if the sensitivities or views of relevant Aboriginal persons or Torres Strait Islanders relate to material information that is considered sacred or otherwise significant to them, it ought to be protected. I think that embraces the sort of terminology we have used over the last several days in the debates on the various Bills. I am not quite sure whether the parliamentary draftsman, who is available to both the Government and the Opposition, has had a chance to put some words together, but I consider that there could be some modification there. Perhaps I could work on those words while other senators contribute to the debate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Dealing with suggested amendments Nos 18, 19, 20 and 21 by the Opposition, I agree with the Minister for Justice in relation to the first one. I have difficulty in seeing a difference between `general directions' and `directions'. When one puts in a term such as `general', which is of a non-specific nature, it is open to interpretation. I think that one could argue a great deal, and very unprofitably, about what is a general direction, a specific direction and a direction unspecified. So it seems to me that `general directions' is a slight but not a significant qualifier. There seems little point in leaving it out because I think that either wording would allow either situation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I have some difficulty with the word `content' in clauses 12 (2) and 12 (3), because content could be the subject around which the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission was providing advice. In other words, the Minister might say, using the example we were using last night, `I'm going to give you directions in relation to building a sewer pipe on an Aboriginal settlement in Western Australia'. Strictly speaking, that is the content of the advice which the Commission will be providing. If the word `content' stands in the Bill, it seems to me that the use of that word, strictly interpreted, would prevent the Minister from giving any directions, because he could not give directions on the very thing about which he was seeking some sort of advice or information. I would like the Minister's comment on that. I would prefer the far more general words `relating to the nature of any advice'. The word `content', to me, has a more specific meaning, and I do not think that is what is intended. </PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Senator Peter Baume" NAMEID="ME4">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ME4">Senator Peter Baume</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think the word `detail' is what you wanted-going to the detail of any advice. That narrows it, you see.</PARA></TALK.START>
</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="TF4">Senator COULTER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is a difficult area. I think I can see what it is that the Government is attempting to achieve. It does not want a situation where the Minister can foreclose options in relation to advice which the Commission might provide, so the Minister is precluded from directing in the very specific sense. If he does not like the advice, he will send it back until he gets the advice he wants. But I do not think the word `content' actually achieves that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Turning particularly to the words which the Opposition's amendment seeks to delete, I have some difficulty with this because when they are deleted the proposed subsection reads:</PARA>
<PARA>Subsection (1) does not empower the Minister to give directions relating to the content of any advice, information or recommendation that may be given to the Minister . . . </PARA>
<PARA>The Minister intended there is the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs. But it leaves entirely open the possibility that the Minister could give directions relating to content, in the sense in which I think it is meant, in relation to advice which the Commission might give to some other Minister, department of state or authority of the Commonwealth. I do not think that is what the Opposition is seeking to achieve. So I would have some difficulty with that. The word `content' in subclause (3) again causes me to hiccup a little. I wonder whether some other word might be more appropriate. </PARA>
<PARA> Dealing with the final amendment to subclause (5), I must say that I like the intent of the Opposition's amendment, because in general ignorance of the law is not a defence. It might be an excuse, but it is not a defence. The inclusion of the words `known to the Minister' provide, as Senator Peter Baume said, a complete let-out that should not really be there. The onus should be on the Minister if there is a breach of sensitivity, using Senator Baume's words. If there is a breach of sensitivity, the Minister should establish why it occurred. He should not simply be able to say, `Well, I did not know'. So I would support the intention of that amendment. If the Minister seeks to use different words more in line with words which have been used elsewhere, that would be quite acceptable to the Australian Democrats. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;All I can say to Senator Coulter is that the terminology employed as to `content' as opposed to `general directions' is one that has been well sanctioned by usage over some nine years now.

Since it has not given any cause for questioning or raised misgivings in people's minds over the last several years when it has been used in relation to the Aboriginal Development Commission, I believe that from a drafting point of view we would be safest to continue with the terminology which has proven to be well understood in the course of the operations of the ADC.</PARA></TALK.START>

They all deal with the question of the Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission (ATSIC), which is the subject of division 6 of the Bill. The amendments relate to pages 23, 24 and 25 of the Bill, beginning at clause 44. The Opposition remains concerned about the unique arrangement whereby the Chief Executive Officer, as proposed, is to be something like a permanent head-as we understand that term-but is to appear to be a servant of and responsible to elected commissioners. It is quite interesting to look at the series of Bills which have preceded the one before us. Clause 37 (1) of the 1988 Bill read:</PARA>
<PARA>There shall be a Chief Executive Officer of the Commission who shall be appointed by the Minister. </PARA>
<PARA>Clause 44 of the 1989 Bill reads:</PARA>
<PARA>There shall be a Chief Executive Officer of the Commission. </PARA>
<PARA>I interpolate that we have yet to deal with one government amendment. This is the point at which it would appear that the Government now proposes to put back the words `who shall be appointed by the Minister'. I draw it to the attention of honourable senators that the Government had taken out the words `appointed by the Minister' and now wants to put them back in. No-one has explained why. The 1989 Bill already has a new subclause 44 (2) which actually says that the Minister is to appoint the CEO. It says:</PARA>
<PARA>The Minister shall consult the Commission before appointing a Chief Executive Officer other than the first Chief Executive Officer. </PARA>
<PARA>I understand the special problem that is related to the first Chief Executive Officer. Further, we know that when this Bill was in the House of Representatives the Government amended clause 44 yet again. It added clause 44 (5). This clause requires the Chief Executive Officer, `when requested by the Minister, to provide information or advice to the Minister on any matter specified by the Minister'. </PARA>

I did not need to mention this the other night, but if the Minister at any time requests information from the Commission itself the Chief Executive Officer will carry the delegation from the Commission on a day to day basis. That has been the case with other commissions and we expect that it would be the case now. The chief executive officer would normally do that job. But subclause (5), which has been added, could be called the `pimp clause', because it would require the Chief Executive Officer to answer questions on anything. I say to Senator Coulter that we are back to the question, which we have covered several times, of the phrase `on any matter specified by the Minister'. It is very interesting that it came in only when the Bill returned to the House of Representatives. If we look at clause 44 (5) we find that the Chief Executive Officer shall do this:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>In spite of any policy determined or direction given by the Commission for the purposes of subsection (4). </PARA>
<PARA>We have thrown into relief the question we wish to put before the Committee. The question is: Whose executive officer will this person be? Will this person be the Chief Executive Officer of the Commission or a servant of the Minister? The more carefully one reads the clause and some of the subsequent matters the more concerned one becomes. </PARA>
<PARA> Statutory authorities of the Commonwealth practically always have the right to appoint their own chief executive. We are not saying this is always the case. I remind the Committee that when Mr John Menadue recently departed from Qantas Airways Ltd it was not the Minister who took that action. It was the board of Qantas which took that action, however wise or otherwise it might have been. Mr Menadue, as Chief Executive, was a servant of the Qantas Board. He was hired and fired by Qantas. That is the normal way in which chief executive officers relate to the boards of statutory authorities. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I did not say `always', and I am aware of some of the exceptions. Some of them are what might be called political appointments. Perhaps the Government has that in mind here, but that sits very poorly with any claim for self-management. I separate for one moment the question of the first Chairman, because I understand that there is a special situation that may apply during a transitional period. For example, to put it very simply, if no executive officer can be appointed at all except by the Commission, the Commission itself would have to start without a chief executive officer. The Minister, who may say he wants a transitional arrangement, may have a reasonable case for the appointment of a first Chief Executive Officer, provided it is understood that he would proceed from there to a proper appointment within a given time.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Here we are with this proposed clause and the Opposition has to decide what should be done. Subclause 44 (4) makes it clear that although the chief executive officer shall be appointed by the Minister-if the Government has its way-he is under the direction of the commissioners. He is appointed, hired and fired by the Minister, but answerable to the commissioners. This point is of immense importance when the question that must be answered is: Who advises the Minister and who administers legislation of the portfolio?</PARA>
<PARA> The Senate Select Committee on the Administration of Aboriginal Affairs actually looked at this matter. I refer honourable senators to paragraphs 2.9 to 2.22 where the question of ministerial advice came up and the rather awkward situation was canvassed by the Senate Select Committee. We think that the Government proposed subclause 44 (5) possibly as its response to the Senate Select Committee. One may say that subclause 44 (5) actually acknowledges that some of the concerns raised by the Senate Select Committee are valid. But the solution that has been proposed with subclause 44 (5) is quite bizarre. The Chief Executive Officer will be a creature with two heads and will have legally imposed duties which could actually be in conflict. </PARA>
<PARA> If the Minister asks for information, as the clause is drafted the CEO is required to give that information. For example, the CEO may be asked how the ATSIC board voted on this or that issue or which commissioners voted. According to the clause, he has no recourse but to answer those questions. He may have to answer a question such as what policy he intends to recommend to the board on a certain matter, and so on. The CEO will be obliged to reply, as will other officers of ATSIC who are answerable to the Chief Executive Officer. </PARA>
<PARA> If the Minister does not ask for information but asks for advice from the Commission, the same situation applies. The Minister has a choice of being advised by either the Commission or the CEO and his officers. If we are serious about Aboriginal self-management, we should not have this alternative route by which the Minister can go behind the commissioners to get information and advice from the Chief Executive Officer. The CEO's advice could be the same as the commissioners' advice. It may not be. If it is the same, the new provision is nugatory. He might give advice which conflicts with that of the commissioners or he might even give advice on a matter which is yet to be considered by the commissioners. It really is quite confusing. One could quite easily imagine a compliant, complacent CEO who owes his position to the Minister telling the Minister just what the Minister wants to know when what the Minister really requires is information from the Commission which tells it as it is. </PARA>
<PARA> At the very least the operation of new subclause (5) should be modified by a new subclause (6) requiring that the Minister should not be able to specify the content of any advice. I go back to what we have done before when we have had the same thing. The Minister can ask for general advice, but not for the content of specific advice because the difficulties are so great. We think it would be best if new subclause (5) which the Minister put into the Bill in the House of Representatives were defeated. It was an attempt to square the circle. If that is not possible, subclause (6) gives some little hope that the CEO could operate with a certain measure of integrity. </PARA>
<PARA> I now come back to the basic question. We do not think the Minister should appoint the Chief Executive Officer in any event. This brings us into conflict with the Government. I know we are not considering Government amendment No. 4, but it might be an appropriate time for me to raise the matter. If it were agreed to-and it is the one Government amendment we have not voted on-it would make it quite clear that the Minister would appoint the Chief Executive Officer. Surely, if we are on about Aboriginal self-management-we have been told that is so-the new Commission, in which we are investing so much, should have the capacity to appoint its own CEO. Again, I accept the fact that the Minister may have a special situation for the appointment of the first Chief Executive Officer. </PARA>
<PARA> Although we have several amendments, I will run through them. We want to change subclause (2) so that instead of saying, `The Minister shall consult the Commission before appointing a Chief Executive Officer'-that is, before the Minister appoints him-it will say, `The Commission shall consult the Minister before the Commission appoints a Chief Executive Officer'. We want to give expression to our view that it is properly a Commission appointment. That is the effect of our amendment (22). It is not inconsistent with the view we have been putting throughout that, if we are serious about a self-management Commission, allowing it to appoint its own Chief Executive Officer is not inappropriate. Because of that, a number of other amendments become necessary.</PARA>
<PARA> Amendment (23) is a proposed amendment to clause 47. It is really a consequential amendment because it then says that the Commission should grant leave of absence to the Chief Executive Officer, not the Minister. Why the Commission? If our first amendment is carried, the Commission will appoint the Chief Executive Officer, so the Commission should grant him leave of absence on such terms and conditions-that is our next amendment-as the Commission determines. (Extension of time granted) I do not want to take too much longer, but I will just keep the flow running. Amendment (24), again for the same reason, is an amendment to clause 49 seeking to leave out the word `Minister' and insert `Commission Chairperson'. For exactly the same reason, the reason I have argued, it does not require further argument from me, but it is part of the same question: Whose creature is the executive chairperson?</PARA>
<PARA> Likewise, amendment (25) proposes leaving out `Minister' and inserting `Commission Chairperson' in clause 50. It is precisely the same problem. Amendment (26) proposes leaving out `Minister' and inserting `Commission' in clause 47. Amendments (27) and (28) cover the same thing in relation to clauses 48 and 51. Clause 51 deals with the question of termination. Whereas the Government has proposed that the Minister may terminate the appointment of the Chief Executive Officer, our amendment, quite consistently with our other amendments, would reverse the situation and say `The Commission may, after consulting the Minister'. After all, if the Commission is to have the right to hire, it should have the right to fire as well. Amendment (29) is to exactly the same purpose. We want to put the power in the hands of the Commission, not the Minister. We are doing all this in the name of Aboriginal self-management. The same arguments apply to amendments (30) and (31). </PARA>
<PARA> I thank the Senate for letting me complete that explanation. I commend these amendments. They are consistent with Aboriginal self-management. We cannot understand why the Government thinks it necessary-apart from any recommendation it might make for the transitional period-to appoint the Chief Executive Officer of a Commission which it claims will be one to give expression to Aboriginal self-management. It makes a mockery of it if the Government then takes from that Commission the capacity to employ its own senior executive. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1"> -Opposition amendments (22) to (31) moved by my colleague Senator Peter Baume should not give Senator Coulter any reason not to support them. Senator Coulter has been consistent in wanting to see the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission (ATSIC) under self-management. There is no way in the world that a commission such as this could claim to have self-determination or self-management if the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs appoints the executive officer. For all sorts of reasons enunciated by Senator Baume, it just will not work. If the Commission is to work and to truly represent self-management and self-determination, it has to have the capacity to appoint its executive officer. If it cannot do that successfully, the whole ATSIC proposal falls to the ground. I could wax lyrical on all the things that could or could not happen. If the Minister has the right to hire and fire the executive, that person becomes a servant of the Minister; and I do not think we need that. I am sure we do not need that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Many of us on this side of the Parliament have misgivings about the whole concept of ATSIC. I think the Australian Democrats and the National and Liberal parties are determined that if ATSIC has any chance of working-and, quite frankly, I do not think it will work in an iron lung-we have got to give it a go; and the only way we can do that is to let the Commission have the right to determine whom it hires and fires and who its executive officer will be. I say to Senator Coulter, the Democrats spokesman, that if this amendment is not carried the confidence that he is putting in ATSIC will be misplaced and ATSIC just will not work. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;If I indicate the Government's thinking at this stage it might help Senator Coulter in his response to our point of view and that of the Opposition. The Government can see the sorts of arguments that are being put in trying to deal with the fact that the Chief Executive Officer of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission (ATSIC) will be in a peculiar and interesting position, but it is a position which, when one looks at subclause 44 (5), is an essential part of the Minister maintaining the flow of information such as enables him to discharge his responsibility to the Parliament. I know, for example, that during the various stages of Estimates committees and at Question Time in this chamber when honourable senators quite properly sought information as to matters which transpired at Aboriginal Development Commission meetings or relating to various decisions made by the Commission or its various staff or personnel in various parts of Australia, it was extremely difficult to obtain that information. I think some sort of provision to enable the information or advice to be obtained by the Minister so that he can properly discharge his responsibilities to the Parliament is a sound provision.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> To go to the chief matter, the question of the appointment of the Chief Executive Officer: the chief executive officers of various enterprises and authorities of the Commonwealth may be appointed by boards, but generally where those enterprises are conducting a business operation of some sort or another. Like Senator Baume, I do not want to generalise across the whole range but generally one finds that the boards of government business enterprises appoint their chief executive officers, although I am advised that it is not particularly standard in other kinds of statutory authorities. The sorts of powers that will be vested in the Chief Executive Officer, the powers of the Secretary under the Public Service Act, include, for example, the ability to create, abolish and reclassify positions, transfer Senior Executive Service officers, recommend SES appointments and promotions, appoint non-SES officers under delegation from the Public Service Commissioner, promote and transfer non-SES officers, take disciplinary action, grant leave, retire non-SES officers, and give permission to undertake work outside the service. They are the sorts of matters which the Chief Executive Officer will have as part of his responsibilities, as would a secretary. In that situation it was thought appropriate that the Minister should appoint the Chief Executive Officer. </PARA>
<PARA> Circulated amendment (4) of the Government should have been in the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission Bill. It was left out by error. As Senator Baume quite properly points out, it is hinted at in clause 44 (2), which says:</PARA>
<PARA>The Minister shall consult the Commission before appointing a Chief Executive Officer . . . </PARA>
<PARA>That indicates that it was always intended that the Minister should appoint a Chief Executive Officer. Our circulated amendment to 44 (1) was intended to achieve that. As Senator Baume himself alluded to this matter, there may well be a need conceded by all sides for a Chief Executive Officer to be appointed prior to ATSIC really getting under way. In that situation the Minister has asked me to bring forward for the consideration of the Committee an amendment to clause 44 as follows:</PARA>
<PARA>Page 23, subclauses 44 (1) and (2), lines 21 to 23, leave out the subclauses, insert the following subclauses:</PARA>
<PARA> ``(1) There shall be a Chief Executive Officer of the Commission who shall be appointed by the Minister. </PARA>
<PARA>``(2) The Minister shall not appoint a person as the Chief Executive Officer, except as the first Chief Executive Officer, unless the Commission agrees to the appointment.''. </PARA>
<PARA>The effect of this, when one combines it with clause 45 (2) (b) (i), which indicates that the first Chief Executive Officer can hold office for a term not exceeding two years, is that the first Chief Executive Officer to be appointed by the Minister during the preliminary period prior to ATSIC getting off the ground, would hold that appointment for a period of no more than two years. The Minister will have an untrammelled capacity to appoint the first Chief Executive Officer. From then on, the Chief Executive Officer could be appointed by the Minister only where he has the agreement of the Commission. In other words, there would have to be a mutually acceptable candidate for the position of Chief Executive Officer. The Minister has indicated that he would like the Committee to consider that particular proposal in the spirit of compromise. It takes up the point made by Senator Peter Baume as to the initial transitory period and, from then on, requires that the Chief Executive Officer be a mutually acceptable person-somebody to whom both the Minister and the Commission can agree. Mr Temporary Chairman, I am not sure how to proceed. There are amendments before the Chair from Senator Peter Baume. Shall I foreshadow moving these amendments? They come first in chronological order; that is the only thing. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It would seem to me that the middle course suggested by the Minister for Justice (Senator Tate) would overcome the problem raised by Senator Peter Baume. That is, the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs, after consultation with the Commission, where the Commission may provide advice unacceptable to the Minister, could still simply ignore that advice. The alternative situation is that the Commission, after consulting the Minister, may go ahead and ignore the Minister's advice. The Minister for Justice is saying that there could only be an appointment where there was agreement between both parties that that person was acceptable as the Chief Executive Officer. It seems to me that would satisfy the concerns of both sides.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I would like to know from the Minister whether he is prepared to carry through that same agreement notion in the other clauses to which Senator Baume has drawn our attention, in which he is seeking to reverse the roles of the Minister and the Commission. For instance, under amended clause 47 the Commission may grant leave of absence to the Chief Executive Officer in place of the Minister. Would the Minister agree that a compromise might be that the Commission, with the agreement of the Minister, may grant leave of absence, and so on? In that way one could come to a middle position on each of these situations, which in my view would satisfy both sides. </PARA>
<PARA> Having said that, I notice that in the Opposition's list of suggested amendments clause 44 (5) is not listed for deletion. Senator Baume has drawn our attention to it. If clause 44 (2), as amended by the Opposition, is acceptable perhaps clause 44 (5) can stay in. If the clause stands as printed, perhaps clause 44 (5) should come out. They are alternative clauses which suggest that the Chief Executive Officer could act in a capacity contrary to the wishes of the Commission. I think that is what is concerning Senator Peter Baume, but he has not suggested on his printed page that we delete clause 44 (5). We need to look at clause 44 (2) first, as we can consider whether clause 44 (5) should come in or out only in the light of what we do about that. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Coulter is quite right. We should look at clause 44 (5). I need a few moments to do that, and I will try to come back to his point. I recall that in an earlier clause which we considered, perhaps in one of the earlier Bills, we limited the capacity of a Minister to provide information or advice to any matter relevant to the functions of the body. Clause 44 (5) again refers to the provision of advice `on any matter'. That is the very minimum position. We may indicate that we will oppose clause 44 (5), in which case we will ask the Chairman to put it as a separate question.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> However, I remind the Committee that the Opposition's amendments Nos (3) to (10) inclusive to the Aboriginal Development Commission Amendment Bill, which provided that the Commission should appoint after consultation with the Minister, exactly what we are recommending here, were agreed to. Those amendments related to clause 12 of that Bill. Clause 12 related to the appointment, leave of absence, resignation and termination of appointment of the General Manager. I put it to the Committee that we have in the last few days accepted the course of action which has been proposed by the Opposition in relation to the Chief Executive Officer of the Aboriginal Development Commission (ADC). We agreed to those amendments. The Opposition is simply asking now, in the major amendments here, that we agree to that course again. The principle on which we argued-and I will not go over and over the same ground-is as relevant now as it was last week. That is, there is no overwhelming reason that I can see why any but the first Chief Executive Officer should not be appointed by the Commission if we are serious about self-management. Of course, the Chief Executive Officer will have certain responsibilities in relation to staff, but I imagine Mr Menadue did as well. I have heard no convincing reason which would lead me to suggest to the Committee that it is proper for us to vote against the amendments in relation to this Bill when we voted in favour of them when dealing with the ADC Amendment Bill. I invite honourable senators to look at those amendments. </PARA>

The Opposition has not won many of them, but we accept that. That is the first point. I am seeking here nothing more than we have already done in this package.

<PARA> That brings me to the proposal of the Minister for Justice (Senator Tate) and of the Minister he represents. It is a not unreasonable proposal. The Opposition will press its view that, clearly, if we are serious about Aboriginal self-management-we can talk later about voting procedures and a lot of other things-it is appropriate that generally the Chief Executive Officer should be appointed by the Commission. That being the case, the Opposition would not support-and I am talking now to the paper which the Minister circulated-the proposed subclauses in the form in which they have been given to us. Were our amendments to be successful, it would still leave unresolved the problem of the first Chief Executive Officer. If, at that stage, the Minister asked us whether we would consider proposed subclause (2) in appropriately different words which said something to the effect that the Minister shall appoint the first Chief Executive Officer, the Opposition would look at it. It is proper that the Commission not be without a Chief Executive Officer at a critical time. I may have something to say about that a bit later. </PARA>
<PARA> I accept the Minister's assurance that the appointment would be limited to two years. That is not unreasonable. I say to the Minister: it really depends on how we resolve the first group of amendments. If we resolve them in a way that the Opposition thinks they should be resolved, we should then seek from the Minister another form of words to meet the needs that he has expressed for the appointment of a first Chief Executive Officer. This would be done in what would then be the amended context of the appointment of a Chief Executive Officer generally. That would then leave Government amendment No. 4 to be resolved. It is a pity that the Minister cannot include Government amendment No. 4 in our group of amendments as it is on the same subject. This cannot be done because we want to oppose the Government's amendment. I will indicate in a few moments the way in which we would wish to deal with clause 44 (5). </PARA>

I also understand the concerns expressed by the Government about accountability. The alternative method of dealing with this, as suggested by the Minister for Justice (Senator Tate), seems to me to be a reasonable compromise, namely that both parties-the Commission and the Minister-be locked together and mutually agree on the appointment of a Chief Executive Officer. If we pursue that course, would the Minister find a similar arrangement acceptable in relation to the other clauses which the Opposition is seeking to amend-in other words, that there be an agreement between the two parties regarding the various actions that are to be taken rather than simply a straight transfer of power? It seems to me that if one could accept that compromise all the way through, one would achieve the objective of accountability, which the Government is quite rightly seeking, and also the objective sought by the Opposition, which is that the Commission have real power in this area and be able to initiate the appointment, dismissal, leave of absence and various other matters covered in these clauses. They could be initiated by the Commission or the Minister but the other side must agree. It seems to me that that would be a reasonable compromise position.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Before the Minister for Justice (Senator Tate) responds, let us think about the question of termination. Let us assume that the Minister agrees to follow Senator Coulter's course. A situation could arise in which the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission (ATSIC) may lose confidence in its Chief Executive Officer. It may wish to terminate the employment of that officer and may not have the agreement of the Minister so to do. While I understand Senator Coulter's argument for the employment of a Chief Executive Officer, I do not agree with it. I think the decision that the Australian Democrats took on the Aboriginal Development Commission-that the Commission should appoint its own-was a more appropriate way to go. If employment can be terminated only by agreement between both parties and that agreement cannot be reached, ATSIC might be unable to sack its Chief Executive Officer if it thought that to be a necessary step.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I can go only on the experience available, but I am not happy with the way in which the Aboriginal Development Commission dealt with some of its senior officers last year. Nevertheless, if I believe in self-management, it is better that Aborigines have the capacity to deal with their own executives than have to get the agreement of the Minister so to do. We could end up in a situation that we had not intended. The same might apply to leave of absence. If we said that leave of absence had to be granted by agreement but that agreement could not be obtained, we could have a Commission unable to give leave of absence to its Chief Executive Officer. This is why the course the (Australian) Democrats took last week on the Aboriginal Development Commission Amendment Bill was a better course. It is more consistent with the concept of self-management. I still believe that it is the course to follow. I do not know how we will resolve the various difficulties if the Minister responds favourably to the Democrats' proposed subsequent amendments. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On the whole, I agree with Senator Coulter's line of thinking. For example, I think the best way to approach clause 47 would be to say that the Minister may, after consulting the Commission, grant leave of absence to the Chief Executive Officer. It would be quite ludicrous to have a need for agreement. Matters such as leave of absence, appointment of an acting Chief Executive Officer, as set out in clause 48, and other terms and conditions, as set out in clause 52, ought to be able to be dealt with by consultation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The termination of appointment is a little more difficult. Let us assume that the appointment is made by agreement. It might be, as Senator Baume put it, that if one or other of the parties feels that the Chief Executive Officer is not the sort of person that it wants, the agreement will collapse and, therefore, the appointment should be able to be terminated. But the termination of appointment can be made only on specified grounds set out in clause 51 (1) such as incompetence, misbehaviour, or physical or mental incapacity. They are the discretionary grounds for the termination of appointment. Mandatory grounds are outlined in clause 51 (2). Honourable senators have to recognise that objective grounds are outlined in that clause as to the reasons which might be properly put forward for the termination of the appointment of the Chief Executive Officer. I think the terminology used in clause 51 (1) should remain. Subclause (1) states:</PARA>
<PARA> The Minister may, after consulting the Commission, terminate the appointment of the Chief Executive Officer because of incompetence, misbehaviour or physical or mental incapacity. </PARA>
<PARA>I think those words can remain. In other words, agreement is required for the appointment of the Chief Executive Officer. From then on, the Minister needs to consult the Commission at every stage in relation to other matters set out in division 6 in relation to the Chief Executive Officer. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Having been a Minister for Aboriginal Affairs, certain matters attract my attention straight away. An obligation to consult does not mean very much. A Minister could consult the Commission and then ignore it. In fact, I have seen many times this requirement to consult. It does not mean that there is a requirement to get agreement. It simply will not do. Consultation does not of itself solve the problem. It does not really add anything to the formula that is already in existence. It certainly does not overcome the problem which I have outlined. If there is agreement between the Commission and the Minister, there is no problem. The problem arises where they are in disagreement. I predict now to the Committee that there will be many occasions when a Minister and the Commission will be in disagreement. I imagine there could be such occasions concerning the Chief Executive Officer. There was a crisis relating to a chief executive officer last year in the Aboriginal Development Commission (ADC). It will not be the last. This kind of thing will recur.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I am not trying at this stage to prevent a proper course of action. I cannot understand why the Minister wishes to reserve to himself the right to hire and to fire the Chief Executive Officer. I have heard no compelling argument for it. This proposition sits as badly with the concept of Aboriginal self-management here and it is as unnecessary as it was with the Aboriginal Development Commission Amendment Bill. We would not wear it then. We described it in that Bill as an attempt to limit the powers of the ADC, which is what it was. I say to Senator Coulter that this is an attempt to limit the powers of the Commission in favour of the Minister of the day. I also say to the honourable senator as to his own formulation of what might be appropriate: the hiring matter is one thing but some of the subsequent matters need further attention. I put to him, from experience, that a suggested amendment to consult will not solve the problem. It is not adequate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think we have had an interesting committee debate in relation to this Bill. Senator Peter Baume has put forward some interesting points arising out of his own experience. I would be willing to say to the Committee that if the Government's proposals-to insert new clause 44 (1) and new clause 44 (2) requiring that the Minister, except for the appointment of the first chief executive officer, appoint a person as chief executive officer only with the agreement of the Commission-are agreed to by the Committee, all the other matters in division 6 which confer on the Minister some sort of power in relation to the chief executive officer, whether it be as to leave of absence, the appointment of an acting chief executive officer, the termination of appointments or other terms and conditions, should be done only with the agreement of the Commission.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In other words, to be consistent in division 6 the new clauses 44 (1) and 44 (2) will include that the Minister shall make appointments, grant leave of absence, appoint an acting chief executive officer, terminate an appointment and determine the terms and conditions only with the agreement of the Commission. It will take some time to get the consequential amendments written up. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I just ask the Minister: what are the compelling reasons for the Government taking the threshold step and wishing to say, `We wish to appoint the chief executive officer'? I suspect that it is that the Government may not actually trust the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander commissioners always to make a choice of which the Government approves. I do not believe that there are special statutory duties that can only be fulfilled by a Government appointee. So before I respond to the Minister's suggestion, I would like to know on the threshold question why this must be a ministerial appointment.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have tried to explain that the Government believes that it is important that the Parliament have a Minister who is responsible to it, who can answer for the appointment of this chief executive officer and for the way in which the duties of the chief executive officer in an important body, such as the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission, carries out his or her duties. The Government's desire to have that ministerial, as it is now, pre-eminence but within a mutually acceptable agreement with the Commission, is the appropriate way in which the matter should be structured. My advisers tell me that in relation to section 48 relating to the appointment of an acting chief executive officer it may be important when we have a deadlock and no agreement can be reached as to the appointment of the chief executive officer--</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There could be an acting chief executive officer to appoint somebody after consultation rather than with agreement. In other words, there may be a situation where we could not leave the Commission without somebody fulfilling those duties over a period of time whilst an agreement was reached. That might take some time because of the need to carry out a full process which leads to a mutually acceptable person being appointed. As I am now advised, the better amendment to section 48 (1) would be that the Minister may, after consultation with the Commission, appoint a person to act as the chief executive officer. But with that variation and with what I have already indicated concerning other matters, a mutually agreed position will have to be reached as to appointment, termination of appointment, the granting of leave of absence and the terms and conditions under which the chief executive officer will hold office.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Section 48 really does not help us very much. I cannot believe that the Minister says that the reason it is necessary is that the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander commissioners may be unable to reach a decision. I could resolve that. I am reminded of the words of the Lord Chancellor in Iolanthe when to solve the problem that occurred at the end of that opera he said, `As an old legal draftsman, just add one word'. So we simply say, `The Commission shall appoint a person to act as his chief executive officer'; it simply imposes an obligation. Why do we keep coming up with hypothetical situations in which we are saying, `You must understand that the black commissioners may not be able to handle this'?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will answer Senator Peter Baume's question in the way in which I see the threshold matter. Senator Peter Baume has argued, as I have indicated to him already, extremely persuasively for his position. I think there is an enormous amount of merit in what he is saying. Throughout this debate people on his side of the Senate have argued that we must not create a black parliament. Those people have been arguing very strongly that ATSIC is not a parliament and that it does not have the same powers as the parliament does. There is another principle which needs to be observed here: that is the one of being responsible to this Parliament through the Minister. My threshold position is one of trying to balance on the one hand the very valid arguments that Senator Peter Baume is putting-that is, the same arguments that I have already put myself in relation to self-determination and self-management-with the other point which the Opposition has been so insistent upon throughout this debate: that ATSIC is not a parliament and it has to be answerable to this Parliament. It seems to me that the compromise that was suggested by the Minister-where the two sides agree on those things-is the appropriate balance and is the threshold, as far as I see it. It is a balancing act between two principles, both of which have been eloquently enunciated by the honourable senator's side in this debate.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="YE4">Senator BOSWELL</NAME><ELECTORATE>(Queensland)</ELECTORATE><TIME.STAMP>(9.21)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1"> -I think that Senator Coulter said it all when he said that it was a compromise. He has used that word the last two or three times that he has risen to speak. Compromises are usually the worst solution; they are neither right nor wrong and they lead to the worst possible result. In other words, a bad decision is better than no decision. At the moment we are trying to compromise the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission (ATSIC). We have probably debated only 10 per cent of the Bill.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I cannot understand Senator Coulter. When we debated the Aboriginal Development Commission Bill he agreed that the Commission should have the right to appoint its own executive officer. I suppose he is trying to compromise. I do not know why he does not stick to his guns and give ATSIC the same rights that he gave the Aboriginal Development Commission only a couple of days ago. In fact, if I can recall correctly, when this question was being debated Senator Coulter said, if I can quote him, that he hoped Senator Tate would observe his remarks about self-determination right through the ATSIC Bill. I say to Senator Coulter, with the best will in the world, that if he wants ATSIC to work-quite frankly, it is on his shoulders and he carries a very heavy responsibility on behalf of the Australian Democrats and 360,000 Aboriginals-the only way in which it will work, if it works at all, is by trusting the Aboriginal people. We all acknowledge that mistakes will be made, but it will only be by the mistakes that the Aboriginal people make that they will learn. </PARA>
<PARA> They will never learn at all if the Minister is in there protecting them, propping them up and supporting them, because the Aboriginal people will just fall back and say, `Oh well, the Minister is running this. He has his own boys in here. We will just turn up for the ride'. That is exactly what we do not want to happen. I have seen this happen many times in Aboriginal communities: Aboriginal people are going well, making their own decisions and then someone-generally it is the Queensland Government-pulls white advisers out. As soon as that happens, the Commonwealth puts another white adviser in to organise one of its programs. I have seen that happen so many times: Aboriginal people are sitting there doing the right thing and making their own decisions and all of a sudden someone comes in, and the Aboriginals lie back in the traces and say, `Oh well, he will do it'. </PARA>
<PARA> I reiterate that the only way ATSIC has a chance of working is if we give the Aboriginal people the responsibility, that is, we give them the right to do their own hiring and firing. Senator Coulter wants to have two bob each way. He says, `I would like to trust them, but I do not think that they are good enough'. What the Nationals and the Liberals are saying is, `Let us give them a go. They may make mistakes, but by making mistakes they will get better'. If the ATSIC proposal is to work, we have to give these people self-determination, which means running ATSIC and appointing their own officers. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ME4">Senator PETER BAUME</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As the Chairman has pointed out, the second amendment is merely a consequential amendment to leave out the words `63 or'. It is quite obvious that this is a consequential amendment and that the substantial amendment is amendment No. 32. This amendment seeks to leave out clause 63. Clause 63 requires the Minister to explain inconsistencies between approved estimates and regional council draft budgets. The whole regional council budget process appears to be founded on a political theory or belief in bottom-up grass roots democracy. There is a strong faith in the idea that the elected regional councils will truly, accurately and fairly represent and reflect the wishes of the people represented by the elected councillors.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Later we will be spending some time on the whole electoral process. I remind Senator Coulter of some of the concerns he expressed on more than one occasion during the sittings of the Senate Select Committee on the Administration of Aboriginal Affairs. We will have time to go over that later. It makes one wonder about the validity of the assumption that the elected regional councils, as they are planned to be elected, will truly, accurately and fairly reflect the wishes of the people who are represented by the elected councillors, but that is another question. The Government proposes this process and justifies it because it is thought to promote Aboriginal self-determination, as the Minister has said, or to quote clause 3 (a) of the Bill:</PARA>
<PARA>to ensure maximum participation of Aboriginal persons and Torres Strait Islanders in the formulation and implementation of government policies that affect them;</PARA>
<PARA>We have already referred to the fact that that is government with a small `g', meaning more than one level of government; but that is an argument that we have already had. The Opposition's concern is that regional councils may not be truly representative. I invite the Committee to cast its mind back to the experience we had with the National Aboriginal Conference (NAC). That experience strongly suggests that regional councils may not be representative. Certain councillors of the NAC were elected on quite factional votes-on votes related to kinship and often on votes not related to any involvement or demonstrated capacity. I am speaking from experience. I can identify people. I can think of representatives in certain States who were there because they came from large and extensive kindreds who could be got out on election day. Further, there were very small turnouts, and again that is a matter that will be referred to later. </PARA>
<PARA> But even if the elected councillors are representative-and I applaud the idea of a proportional representation system here-the councillors may well align themselves with factions within a regional council. The danger we face is that of the winner takes all. It may operate to the detriment of any minority within a regional council. I remind honourable senators of the experience we had on the mid-north coast of New South Wales where some Aboriginal associations of Kempsey were funded. It turned into a factional battle with winners and losers. Far from an attempt to deal with the whole community, we had the winning faction making sure that all the resources and money were confined to the members of that faction-whether it was housing, vehicles or anything else-and we had the losers responding with quite a dramatic show of force: axes were put through the sides of motor cars and quite violent means were employed. That Kempsey situation became quite electric, and that was because the money that was given out at that time was used in a way that provided spoils to the victors and vae victi-woe to the vanquished. </PARA>
<PARA> So there are many concerns about a distribution of resources and how decisions might be made within the regional councils. Again, that is something that the regional councils themselves will have to work through. The only warning I give to the Government, from experience, is that there will be great bitterness. While it will be directed to the regional councils, it will also be directed to the Government. If people now in receipt of assistance suddenly find that that is cut off for factional, family or regional reasons within a regional council area, there will be great bitterness. Anyone with any practical experience within the area of Aboriginal affairs could not argue that these things will not happen or have not happened. I have too much specific experience of these matters on which to draw. </PARA>
<PARA> There could be many reasons, then, why the noble ideals of the regional councils-the function of Aboriginal grassroots democracy-might work suboptimally or might not work very well at all. But in clause 63 the Government seems to put all its eggs in the self-determination basket. It is one thing for the Minister to be able to vary the proposed regional council budget, but if this clause becomes operative and the Minister has to put a statement before the House explaining why he has varied a regional budget, it may well expose him to ridicule, because some of the reasons will be quite difficult to explain. If I were doing it-and I put my mind back to the Kempsey situation-I would have to say, `I am varying the budget because the people up there are not playing fair. They are depriving 30 per cent of their community of access to any resources at all'. That is an actual example I can use from history, and not so long ago. </PARA>
<PARA> I am just wondering why the Minister should have to lay those kinds of details before the Parliament. It will probably make more difficulties for the Ministers than it will resolve. Looking at the noble ideals one might say that, if the Minister wishes to intervene, he has to explain his reasons. I just warn honourable senators that the reasons for which the Minister will intervene will be few and will relate in the end to the kinds of rather unhappy circumstances to which I have referred in my remarks. I suggest that this clause could well be left out. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am afraid that I found it a little difficult to follow Senator Baume's drawing on the memories that he has of the time when the National Aboriginal Conference (NAC) was in existence. I believe that then we had single member electorates with a first past the post system of voting, whereas with the regional councils at least we have a multi-person electorate with a Senate-type system of voting. Perhaps the principles of winner take all and woe to the vanquished will not be so easily brought about in that system of voting. I acknowledge that there are always dangers of some favouritism in the way in which a regional council might recommend that the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission (ATSIC) make moneys available to those organisations which might provide services to the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. Let us not forget that that is the function of a regional council.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The simple purpose of clause 63 is to put a constraint on the Minister so that he does not ignore the regional councils and simply override them without coming into the Parliament and saying why he is overriding them. There may be difficult situations such as those outlined by Senator Baume where it might be thought that a sensitivity of language is required in explaining to the Parliament why a view was taken as to the way in which funds might be distributed in a region other than in accordance with the recommendations of the relevant regional council. I am sure that Senator Baume would not find it difficult to find a form of words which conveyed the true reason-there is no need to hide the sorts of concerns he was expressing; I think they ought to have been expressed-if a similar situation were to arise in the future, and I believe it could be done in a way which allowed the Parliament to make a judgment as to whether the regional councils were being regarded with contempt or disdain or as of no consequence in the preparation of the Estimates. So I believe it is simply a question of controlling the Minister, of making sure that the Minister, in being accountable to Parliament, fully acknowledges and perhaps gives primacy to the recommendations of the regional councils and really has to explain why it is thought to be necessary to depart from those recommendations. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am absolutely delighted to hear the Minister for Justice (Senator Tate) extol the virtues of the Senate proportional representation system and explain how representative it is. I cannot help but remember the arguments we had over the Australian Capital Territory electoral processes and the way in which the Australian Democrats' attempt to get that more representative system was not accepted by the Government. Beyond that, I accept the arguments that the Minister then went on to put. It seems to me that one of the aspects of accountability has to be openness. Indeed, if the circumstances that Senator Baume has outlined are to occur, it is appropriate, with or without nice words, that that be explained and made quite clear. It may well be, as the Minister says, that half the population in a particular regional council is holding the other half to ransom with lumps of four-by-two or something like that. It gives the other half an opportunity to say, `Well, that is not true; the Minister has been misled'. Unless there is some openness in the explanations as to why the Minister is varying the Budget, then those who feel either advantaged or abused by those decisions have no opportunity to intrude and cause them to be varied.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As I recall, this clause arose out of one of the concerns expressed by the Senate Select Committee on the Administration of Aboriginal Affairs. The Committee was concerned that regional councils should be accountable in the drawing up of their budgets and subsequently in the discharge of those budgets. If the Minister chooses to vary those budgets he has to be accountable too. That again is giving effect to the principle of self-determination by those regional councils. The openness which this process involves is the most important principle here. It is the openness which allows both sides to see quite transparently what is being done, on the one hand, by the regional councils and, on the other hand, by the Minister to ensure that fairness and justice prevail. </PARA>

<PARA> ``(b) land and such personal property as the Commission considers appropriate;</PARA>
<PARA>for the purpose of enabling Aboriginal persons or Torres Strait Islanders who are members of those corporations to occupy that land.''. </PARA>
<PARA>The purpose of this group of amendments relates to the acquisition of land by the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission (ATSIC). These clauses are so drawn that they would not prevent the acquisition of land for purposes which are proper purposes to be occupied or used by Aboriginal people. We believe that, as presently drafted, paragraph 6 (2) (c) simply says that the Commission may acquire, hold and dispose of real and personal property. We believe that, if the Commission used that power in a certain way, it could become a de facto national Aboriginal land council. The Minister may well say that was never the intention. We simply look at the statute and ask: How could it be used by a commission that wished to acquire, hold and dispose of land that way? It could become a de facto Aboriginal land council nationally. It would be possible under the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission Bill for the Commission to devote funds provided to it for land acquisition and to use them for acquisition by the Commission itself on a large scale. I imagine that the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs (Mr Hand) would tell us that that is not the intention. The fact remains that the legislation as it is written would enable ATSIC to act in the way described above. </PARA>
<PARA> If we combine that paragraph with the other wide powers proposed for ATSIC, the Commission could become a very influential agency in the general Australian economy. If we look at the Aboriginal Development Commission Act and get some guidance from that, we find that under section 27 of the Aboriginal Development Commission Act the ADC can acquire interests in land and then vest those interests in Aboriginal corporations. I emphasise the words `and then vest those interests in Aboriginal corporations'. However, the ADC can do this-and I quote from the ADC legislation-only `for the object of enabling Aborigines to occupy land'. There is a separation in the ATSIC Bill of clauses 6 and 14, and there is the omission of the words `for the object of enabling Aborigines to occupy land' from clauses 14 and 15. Without those words, I think it would be possible for the Commission at large to become a very large autonomous land-holder for its own purposes. </PARA>
<PARA> It would be fair at some stage during this Committee consideration for the Committee to examine the extent to which it would wish to see the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission as a large autonomous landholder in its own right. It is my belief that that is not an appropriate way to go. If we look at the amendments that have been moved here to clause 6 we see that ATSIC has the capacity to acquire, hold and dispose of land. In clause 7, where we add a new subclause (4), we then qualify the right to hold land in the following way:</PARA>
<PARA>Nothing in this section or in any other provision of the Act shall be read as conferring on the Commission a function of acquiring land except for its administrative purposes or for the purpose of the performance of functions expressly conferred on the Commission by this Act. </PARA>
<PARA>We are not seeking to prevent the Commission from acquiring land. I go back to the experience with the ADC. The ADC acquired Bonner House in Woden. It acquired it for two reasons. It was used for investment as part of the capital fund and it was used for the administrative purposes of the ADC. It is perfectly proper that the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission should be able to acquire land for its own administrative purposes. We do not object to that at all. Neither would we object to it acquiring land for the performance of functions expressly conferred on the Commission by this Act. Simply to allow it to acquire land at large from its own very large budget may be quite inappropriate. It is fairly common knowledge that the interim commissioners are going to include certain people who have been very active in the national land rights movement and who are committed to this course of action. I will name them later if honourable senators want me to. </PARA>
<PARA> We believe that what we are concerned about is not fanciful; it comes from a reading of the clauses of the Bill. I put it to the Committee that these two amendments will not prevent ATSIC from acquiring or holding land but will limit the circumstances under which it shall do so. The other two amendments which have been moved together are amendments to clauses 14 and 15. Each of them relates to a capacity of ATSIC to hold grants of interest in property or to give grants for the acquisition of property. We have included them within the same groups of amendments because they relate to the same general matter. </PARA>
<PARA> I refer honourable senators to the Aboriginal Development Commission Act. This is a model that we can look to. In that legislation interest in land can be granted to an Aboriginal land trust-other than an Aboriginal land trust established under the Northern Territory Land Rights Act-or interest in land could be granted to an Aboriginal corporation. The words in section 23 of the ADC Act state:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . for the purpose of enabling Aborigines who are members of that corporation or land trust to occupy that land. </PARA>
<PARA>There have been several ATSIC Bills. Let us look at the 1988 ATSIC Bill. It omitted any reference to what might have been the purpose of the grant of interest in property or grants for the acquisition of property. It seemed to follow that a grant of an interest in property could be made to an Aboriginal corporation for any purpose. The Opposition seeks to move an amendment to clause 14 to insert the words `for the purpose of enabling Aboriginal persons or Torres Strait Islanders who are members of those corporations to occupy that land'. All we are saying is that by all means there should be capacity to acquire grants of interest in property. But it should be for the purpose of enabling appropriate Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islanders to use that land. If it is not the intention of the Minister to promote a national system of land rights by the back door let us make that explicit. </PARA>
<PARA> I have illustrated already that the kind of words we are trying to add are words which are already contained in the Aboriginal Development Commission Act. They were put into that Act for very good reasons. They have not prevented the ADC from proceedings to acquire or hold land. Compared to the 1988 Bill the 1989 Bill which we are now considering inserts a new subclause 14 (4) which is a tightening up of the business enterprise grants conditions. It is drafted in such a way as to provide the capacity for ATSIC to make grants of interest in property for purposes other than business enterprises. When we read that subclause we are quite concerned about it. Under clause 88 of the ATSIC Bill, which again is related, an Aboriginal corporation is defined as any body corporate owned or controlled by Aboriginal people. If we come back to clause 14 with that definition in mind ATSIC could make grants of interest in property to any Aboriginal corporation for any purpose other than for a business enterprise because that is controlled by subclause 14 (4). </PARA>
<PARA> Let me tell the Committee what some of these bodies might be. Eligible corporations to hold land provided by ATSIC could include each of the regional councils to be set up under the Bill. They are going to be body corporates owned or controlled by Aboriginal people. It could include the Northern Territory land trusts or land councils. Honourable senators may wish to refer to paragraph 22 (1) (c) of the Northern Territory (Land Rights) Act. It could include the New South Wales land councils. It could include Aboriginal legal, medical or similar services if they are incorporated. This could happen the way the Bill is written. Any of them could hold land. It could include bodies such as the Aboriginal Coalition. It could include the National Aboriginal and Islander Health Organisation if it was incorporated. It could hold large amounts of land. It could include an Aboriginal incorporated company-say, a shelf company. It could include an Aboriginal council or association which is formed under the Aboriginal Councils or Associations Act. As presented to us it is clear that ATSIC would be able to grant property interests to a very wide variety of Aboriginal organisations. All they have to do is be incorporated. </PARA>
<PARA> If it was the desire of the commissioners to pursue an agenda of extensive land acquisition other than the kind of land acquisition which we have indicated in our amendments it would be possible for the commissioners to do so under the Act as it is written and presented. A de facto national Aboriginal land rights scheme could thus be developed by recourse to this clause. I am setting this out for the future commissioners in case they had not realised that this capacity exists. We have not tried to prevent, with our amendments, the acquisition of land for the purpose of enabling Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islanders who are members of the corporations to occupy that land. We are not trying to stop that. We have tried to insert those words at least to put some limit on the capacity to acquire land which would seem reasonable and proper. The same thing was done in amendment No. 37 where we sought to define a purpose, enabling Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders who are members of the corporations to occupy that land. I may have some more to say about the amendments but I introduce them with those comments. </PARA>

<PARA> Opposition amendment No. 35 taken by itself, again, does not mean a great deal. Of course, taken with amendments Nos. 36 and 37, the amendment takes on a particular meaning. Therefore, amendments Nos. 36 and 37 show the substantial difference between the intention of the Opposition and the intention as expressed by the Government in this legislation. Several times while Senator Baume was speaking, he used the terms, `occupy the land' and `use the land'. One of the things that I find quite objectionable about many people in Australian society is that if Aboriginal people do not `use' land in the same way as Europeans `use' land-which usually means exploiting the land in some way-they are regarded somehow as lesser individuals for that attitude to land. </PARA>
<PARA> The difference is something that we must recognise. Aboriginal people have a different relationship to land and they may simply want to hold land in the same way as European people may want to hold a sacred object, a church or something else, and not actually use it. It might have a heritage value or something like that. They would not use it in the sense of exploiting it. Therefore, I find the intention behind amendments Nos 36 and 37 rather objectionable because they suggest the imposition on Aboriginal people of a European-type attitude to land. Surely that is not what ATSIC is about. </PARA>

The reasons for varying the budgets will be able to be laid before both Houses of Parliament. There will be an open disclosure of the whole process. It seems to me extremely unlikely that, through this mechanism, Aboriginal people will acquire large blocks of land simply to be left lying idle. </PARA>
<PARA> I find it rather peculiar for the Opposition to complain if some blocks of land bought for speculative purposes are not actually occupied, because we cannot get the Opposition to agree to a register of foreign ownership in this country. The Opposition will not even agree to inquiring into foreign people coming in and speculating in Australian land, so I find it objectionable that the Opposition should complain if Aboriginal people were to buy some pieces of land, not occupy them and use them purely for speculative purposes. Why should they not do so? Why should they not take advantage of that system? But I do not see that as a very significant occurrence in view of the protections which are laid elsewhere in the Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> In summary, I cannot see the point of the amendment to clause 6 (2) (c). I have indicated that I oppose amendments Nos 36 and 37. As Senator Baume has said, those words take on some significance only if other amendments are accepted. I do not accept those other amendments. However, I do not find at all exceptional the proposed additional subclause to clause 7. It takes on a repugnance only if we proceed, as I indicated, with amendments Nos 36 and 37. Of course, if those amendments are not accepted, Senator Baume may not want to proceed even with the addition to clause 7. Under those circumstances, he may choose to withdraw that amendment. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have the same difficulty as Senator Coulter as regards narrowing the range of those Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders who might be aided by the ability in the Commission to purchase land to those who might occupy that land. I was not quite sure whether the word `occupy' was being used as an alternative to the word `residency' or whether there was some wider scope that could be envisaged by it. That needs to be explained by Senator Baume. Does it require some sort of demonstrated physical presence on the land, if not the building of a structure or some fixture over a period of time? If so, given the huge expanses that we are concerned about, or possibly concerned about, in what way would an occupation be demonstrated?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In any case, it may well be that there are occasions where, as Senator Coulter quite correctly pointed out, the reason for the purchase of the land might be to advance a social, cultural or spiritual interest of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people which precluded occupation by those persons of the particular stretch of land or property or area that was being purchased or considered for purchase. As I say, it might very well be the values which suggest that it would be a good thing to purchase the property which militate against anybody setting foot on that land. I believe it is too restrictive. For example, one might also want to hold the land for some land-based enterprise-perhaps some sort of food gathering or horticultural activity of a type which does not, in our terminology, amount to an occupation but which does, nevertheless, involve a certain use of the land as we would see it. It seems to me that this unnecessarily narrows the range of legitimate reasons which might commend themselves to the Commission and, therefore, I indicate that the Government cannot accept amendments 36 and 37. </PARA>
<PARA> I cannot see the point of amendment 34 to clause 6 as suggested by Senator Baume. I think `may acquire' means that the Commission has the capacity to acquire but it is not compulsory that it acquire. There are two senses of `may'. One is conferring a discretionary power rather than a mandatory requirement-`may' do something rather than `shall' do something. But in this instance it tends more to the meaning of having a capacity to do something. I think that the amendment is simply unnecessary. I agree with Senator Coulter that if amendments 36 and 37 are rejected by the Committee, amendment 35 could be accepted by the Government. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As I said in the debate last night, a number of issues go to the fundamental principles of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission Act. I draw to the attention of the Committee the importance of always being mindful of the preamble to the legislation which is listed at the front of the Bill. We are considering four proposed amendments by Senator Peter Baume. Amendment No. 34 relates to division 1, the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission itself; amendment No. 35 specifically relates to the functions of the Commission; amendment No. 36 specifically relates to grants of interest in property; and amendment No. 37 specifically relates to grants for acquisition of property. These amendments seek to change very fundamental parts of the legislation. As Senator Peter Baume said in his initial comments, we have to be mindful of whether or not the legislation creates a vehicle for a national land rights network, particularly in the various States of Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We all know that the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act makes specific provisions for land rights in the Northern Territory. Senator Peter Baume has already highlighted the area where this legislation could be read in conjunction with the grants to either a Northern Territory Aboriginal land trust or the land councils of the Northern Territory. The legislation would, therefore, have a very wide application with regard to other land that does not necessarily have to be subjected to the determinations and hearings of the land commissioners in terms of the special needs, identifications and traditional establishments that are so important under the Aboriginal Land Rights Act of the Northern Territory. But, of course, this digs deeper because it could well have that same application in every other State of the Commonwealth of Australia. The preamble to the Bill states very specifically:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . AND WHEREAS the people . . .  known as the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples of Australia were the prior occupiers and the original owners of this land . . . AND WHEREAS they were dispossessed . . . have no recognised rights over land yet recognised . . . AND WHEREAS . . . reach a lasting and equitable agreement with them on the use of their land . . . AND WHEREAS it is the firm objective of the people of Australia that policies and programs be maintained and developed by the Governments of the Commonwealth, the States and Territories, that will overcome the economic and social disadvantages of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples . . . AND WHEREAS it is appropriate to establish measures for the furtherance of the aforementioned objective . . . </PARA>
<PARA>The legislation, as it is drafted, provides the very mechanism whereby the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission (ATSIC), could provide, as Senator Peter Baume has outlined in considerable detail, by making grants to the various bodies that can be incorporated under various forms of legislation-Commonwealth, State or Northern Territory-a mechanism whereby a national Aboriginal land rights network would be established. </PARA>
<PARA> In response to Senator Coulter, who argued that there could well be a need for this in many cases, I want to make the very important point that ATSIC is dealing with funds derived from the Australian taxpayer. This is very different from many other measures and needs. We constantly have to bear in mind that the budgetary and financial provisions that are going to flow to ATSIC, and will subsequently lead to what could be the development of quite extensive land acquisition programs, will be provided by the Australian taxpayer. It could well be that those funds, under the priorities determined by a commission, will not be used for the pressing social, economic development and education needs of Aboriginal people in Australia. By applying funds to a land bank that would be built up, advantages may well be gained for many Aboriginal people. But I would argue very seriously that that would not be the priority that the Australian people, through the taxpaying system of this country, would want to see in place. </PARA>

Senator Coulter took exception to the objective that Aboriginals should not be able to own land unless they occupied it. He told the Committee that land has different significance to Aboriginal people than it has to white people. We can accept that. Senator Baume pointed out-and I think this is the crux of the matter-that under the legislation as it stands at the moment, ATSIC could buy, purchase, control or put all its funds into land acquisition.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Last night I rose in the adjournment debate to talk about a particularly vexing problem for the Northern Territory in respect of stock routes and excisions. Tonight I rise to talk about a problem which the Territory has at the moment, which is of far greater proportions, and that is the airline pilots dispute. As a number of honourable senators have already said in this Parliament-my colleague in the House of Representatives, Warren Snowdon, and Senator Tambling on the other side of this chamber-this strike is having catastrophic effects on the Northern Territory.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I hope that the airline pilots, who are a very privileged group of workers in this country, are paying some heed to the enormous damage that they are doing to this country while this dispute continues. I assume that they still want to call themselves Australians. I might add that one of the unwritten conditions of the very privileged awards that they have-with all this talk of going overseas and selling themselves at a moment's notice for twice the money-as well as the very good working conditions, is the great privilege of being Australians and living and working in this country. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the interesting things about the current state of the pilots dispute is that charter companies are making a great deal of money out of it. Indeed, they are taxing their aircraft and pilots to the limit. They have taxed their pilots to the point where they cannot continue to run all the very profitable charters. The charters are having a very small but definite impact on ameliorating the strike to some extent. I noted, not just in the Northern Territory but around Australia, that a significant number of these charter companies are operating what could be called strike-breaking flights with pilots from Ansett Airlines of Australia and Australian Airlines at the controls. </PARA>
<PARA> It is interesting to note the actions that are being taken by these pilots. In the memo sent out by the Australian Federation of Air Pilots (AFAP) to its members two months before this strike started, advising them how to prepare for it financially, although lawn mowing business, painting the house and other things were mentioned, flying strike-breaking flights for charter companies was not. Nevertheless, a significant number of Ansett and Australian pilots are currently doing that. Perhaps I could suggest to them that, rather than flying with rubberband airlines, they would be far better off going the whole hog-getting back into big planes and flying for Ansett and Australian again. </PARA>
<PARA> The difficulty is that in terms of the current state of the dispute we have been hearing a great deal from the Opposition about what it would not do about it. The total state of disarray of the Opposition on this question is illustrated only too dramatically by the performance of its current leader, Andrew Peacock. If anyone doubts that, I commend to him the reading of the full transcript of the press conference on this dispute that the Leader of the Opposition gave the other day. A greater collection of nonsense one is never likely to see in one's life. He dug himself deeper and deeper into a hole. </PARA>
<PARA> I am reminded by the current performance of this Leader of the Opposition-in terms of his indecision and his complete lack of ability to get the two conflicting forces in his coalition on side-of a former conservative leader, Bonar Law, who, when he was having similar problems with his colleagues in 1912, uttered the immortal words, `I am their leader, I must follow them.' I think Andrew Peacock is following in that mode. </PARA>
<PARA> Many people have spoken on the radio about how to solve this dispute and a number of suggestions have been made, including the use of the Crimes Act against the pilots. I canvassed in some detail some of the sanctions that are already available through the Industrial Relations Commission or the courts in a speech last week and so I will not go over that list again. Suffice to say there are a number of problems in attempting to employ any one or a combination of those sanctions against the pilots. These difficulties arise largely from the fact that the pilots are no longer employees. Further action against the pilots union-for example, deregistration-may be feasible but would be likely to have little effect. </PARA>
<PARA> It must be noted, as I noted previously, that legislation introduced on a number of occasions by the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate (Senator Chaney) would be completely ineffective for similar reasons. Action could still conceivably be taken against the pilots under the Trade Practices Act 1974 and the Crimes Act 1914. The basis of such action would not be any employer-employee relationship, but the continuing interference with interstate trade. It is probable that a dispute involving direct and/or secondary sympathy actions would be dealt with under the provision of the Trade Practices Act 1974. </PARA>
<PARA> In the case of action taken by pilots, section 45D (1A) provides the basis for bringing the dispute before the Federal Court. That section specifically makes it unlawful for two or more persons to combine to prevent or hinder interstate and/or overseas trade. Actions by other workers in sympathy with any action taken by the pilots would, in all probability, be caught by section 45D (1). Sections 45D (5) and (6) deem the relevant unions to be a party to any such action carried on by their members, unless the union can establish that it took all reasonable steps to prevent that action. </PARA>
<PARA> Under section 80 of the Trade Practices Act 1974 the court has the power to issue injunctions restraining persons from engaging in conduct constituting a boycott. Section 82 allows for actions for damages. Finally, section 76 allows for the imposition of pecuniary penalties. Maximum fines for each offence under this section are $50,000 for individuals and $250,000 for organisations. Actions under sections 45d and 45e are, however, subject to certain limitations. First, subsection 76 (2) provides that actions for pecuniary penalties under sections 45D and 45E cannot be brought directly against individuals. This gives some protection to individual unionists but not to their unions, nor does it protect the individuals from actions for damages or from contempt proceedings involving the breach of an injunction or other order of the court. </PARA>
<PARA> General statutory defences are available to actions brought under sections 45d and 45e, and there are specific defences to any action taken under section 45d (1a). Court decisions, including the Mudginberri case with which I am familiar, have severely limited the scope of the general defences to the point where the defences under section 45 (3) have generally been regarded as having no effect. Thus, the specific defences to actions under section 45d (1a) are unlikely to come into play in most disputes. It is not entirely clear that this is the case in the present dispute. Some attention has been given to the use of the Crimes Act in the current dispute as recently suggested by spokesmen for the tourist industry. As I pointed out in this House last week, using the Crimes Act was seriously considered by Bill McMahon, in the 1966 28-day Qantas strike. The problem here, however, is not necessarily one of jurisdiction but of the procedures required to invoke section 30j and the criminal penalties-maximum imprisonment of one year-that apply under that Act. The issuing by the Governor-General of a proclamation under section 30j would have much in common with the declaration of a state of emergency. Such an action, together with the possible gaoling of pilots, might be seen as excessive and would be seen as excessive by me. Amendments to the Crimes Act 1987 allow for fines as an alternative remedy to gaol. </PARA>
<PARA> The pilots have gone a long way towards convincing me that they are a special case. I have studied the history of the industrial record of that union, both here and in the United States of America. Some very interesting parallels are drawn between the operations of pilots' unions in Australia and in the United States. Indeed, as many senators would know, the working conditions under which Australian pilots fly are based on the working conditions of their North American counterparts, in particular, the incentive bidding system which is still used in this country. As I said last week, to quote the then President of the Pilots Federation, Captain R. Holt, when he introduced Reg Swartz to the annual conference of the Federation following the major dispute of 1966, `This Federation is unique in this country. We can do anything we like.' That has been the attitude consistently expressed by the Pilots Federation ever since then-that it is a unique body requiring special treatment. I agree with it. I think that it does need special treatment!</PARA>
<PARA> I am about to suggest a potential course of action that a future government could reasonably consider-not to resolve this current dispute, which I think will be resolved but not in the pilots' favour, but to prevent this kind of catastrophe from recurring. Indeed, governments must give consideration to this kind of action because of the role that aviation now plays in the Australian economy. The big difference between the disputes of 1966 and the industrial action taken from 1959 through to the 1960s, the early 1970s and now is that the airline industry in Australia plays a crucial role in our economy such as it has never played before. That handful of workers-1,600 of them-who are capable, at the snap of their fingers, of bringing the Australian airline industry to a complete halt and who are capable of inflicting such catastrophic damage to this country's economy and international reputation, have never been in this sort of position before. Times having changed as they have, a new look needs to be given to the way in which we deal with the aviation industry in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> Tourism, for example, in terms of what has changed, has now become this country's greatest export earner. It earned $6.5 billion last year. The damage that has been done to long term tourism by this dispute is almost beyond calculation. In the Northern Territory where I come from thousands of forward bookings have been cancelled. A Japanese or American tourist with a couple of weeks recreation leave a year will not run the risk of running into this sort of problem again by booking next year's holiday to Australia in advance. It will be years before the ill-effects of the greedy actions of this small group on their fellow Australians are rectified. </PARA>
<PARA> The American experience has many parallels with the Australian experience. The most serious industrial action taken in this country in the airline industry to date was the strike in 1966. Interestingly enough, the most catastrophic strike in America's airline industry history was also in 1966. Perhaps the two strikes were not entirely unrelated. The other parallels that exist between the United States and here are of course the procedures used by the unions of playing one carrier off against another and then using the previous settlement as a starting point for the next. The other parallel between the two countries is that American pilots are very highly paid-as are their Australian counterparts-compared with other skilled people in the work force. </PARA>
<PARA> Therefore, government needs to have a complete and fresh look at the relevance of the airline industry to Australia and at the lessons that have been learnt from this dispute. The dispute is having a terrible effect on this country's economy and on the jobs of thousands of workers. To start with, 21,000 of the fellow workers of these pilots in the aviation industry will be thrown on the scrap heap if the strike continues for much longer. From the public statements that I have seen none of this seems to concern anyone in the Pilots Federation. </PARA>
<PARA> A new look needs to be taken at the relevance of this industry. We need a determination by future governments that this situation will never happen again. It may be necessary for future governments to enact special legislation, which can be done under the trade and commerce or corporations powers, to deal with this kind of dispute. I suggest that such legislation could be modelled on the United States Railway Labor Act of 1926 which specifically limits the right of parties to engage in collective bargaining in the interstate rail and air industries in the United States. Resorting to statutory cooling off periods of the type provided for in that Act may be of some assistance not only in resolving the current dispute, if such legislation had been in existence-I am not suggesting that it is practicable to introduce it at this point in the dispute-but also in dealing with similar claims by pilots if and when they arise in the future. </PARA>
<PARA> Two further advantages of such legislation are that it could be quarantined to the airline industry, as it is quarantined to very specific industries in the United States, and any sanctions contained in it need not involve imprisonment. Such legislation could be introduced without establishing a new range of sanctions and penalties which could be used against the trade union movement generally. The Railway Labor Act 1926 regulates labour management relations in the railroad and airline industries only in the United States of America. The legislation was extended to cover interstate airline operations in 1936. Recognising the peculiarities of the two industries, bargaining units operating under the Act are organised on a craft basis, not on an enterprise basis as is a common feature of industrial relations practice in the United States. </PARA>
<PARA> I will refer briefly to some of the detail of this legislation and explain why it operates in such a special way in respect of United States airlines. My source is the International Encyclopaedia for Labour Law and Industrial Relations, volume 10. It is a complex law but, in essence, it provides for a period of private settlement between the parties. If that fails the involvement of a national mediation board (NMB) is brought into play. During all the processes involved under this Act, long cooling off periods of between 30 days and 90 days are provided for. The matter then proceeds to arbitration, which, in the history of this procedure in the United States, is usually rejected by one or other of the parties to the dispute. I will quote directly from paragraphs 793 to 797 of the encyclopaedia as to what then happens:</PARA>
<PARA> If, as usually happens, one or both sides refuse to arbitrate, the NMB has two choices. One possibility is for it to withdraw from the conflict. If it does that, then no change in the status quo may be made for another 30 days. After that 30 days, the parties are free to resort to unilateral action and economic sanctions. </PARA>
<PARA>In other words, strikes. It continues:</PARA>
<PARA> The other option for the NMB is to notify the President of the United States that in its opinion the conflict threatens to deprive a section of the nation of an essential transportation service or that it threatens to `interrupt substantially' interstate commerce. </PARA>
<PARA>I think that both those conditions could be applied to the current dispute. It continues:</PARA>
<PARA>If the NMB chooses the latter course, the President, in his discretion, may create an emergency board and no change in the status quo is permitted until the ensuing special emergency dispute procedure has been exhausted. </PARA>
<PARA>I will briefly advise what the history of using this law is in the United States. The encyclopaedia continues:</PARA>
<PARA>Each year at least 500 contracts regulated by the RLA are amended or revised without resort to any of the formal steps involving NMB participation. In those cases in which NMB mediators do participate, over the years about 97 per cent have been resolved without a work stoppage. In Fiscal Year 1981, the NMB resolved 164 mediation cases. </PARA>
<PARA>. . . </PARA>
<PARA>As of the end of Fiscal Year 1981, in the 47 years of the NMB's existence, 193 emergency boards had been created. </PARA>
<PARA>That is, by the President of the United States. It continues:</PARA>
<PARA>According to the agency's evaluation of that experience: `In most instances the recommendations of the boards have been accepted by the parties as a basis for resolving their disputes without resorting to a final test of economic strength'. In addition to providing the parties with an opportunity to weigh the emergency board's recommendations and to afford the nation's chief executive an opportunity to informally cajole the parties into reaching a settlement, the 30-day waiting period following the emergency board's report also provides Congress with an opportunity to adopt special legislation dealing with the issues underlying the dispute. On occasion Congress has intervened at this point and imposed a legislative solution to the conflict. </PARA>
<PARA>The main feature of the Act, for the purposes of the discussion tonight, is that it places a legislative limitation on the extent to which contracts of employment can be reached through a process of free collective bargaining. Whereas strikes and lockouts are not unlawful-in fact they are a legitimate and integral part of the collective bargaining in most industries in the US-in the case of interstate transport, Congress has formed the view that the public interest needs to be protected from the undoubted industrial muscle of both the employers and the unions in this industry. Congress's response to what it saw as a special problem was to enact special legislation obliging the industrial parties in these sensitive industries to settle their differences `peacefully'. In doing so, the Congress recognised that even with the United States system's wealth of experience with collective bargaining, there are certain cases where market forces cannot be allowed free rein. The Opposition parties and members of the H. R. Nicholls Society have frequently pointed to the United States model as providing a useful basis for deregulating the Australian labour market. However, in the case of the present pilots dispute, they have failed to apply the same approach to the special circumstances of the domestic airline industry as was thought necessary in the United States. </PARA>
<PARA> In the heart of the sanctions package contained in the Australian Government's 1987 Industrial Relations Bill was the proposition that those who remain within the official industrial relations system-that is, organisations registered under the Conciliation and Arbitration Act-should be bound by the rules of that system. Registered organisations of employers and employees would be subject to sanctions and compliance measures contained or connected with the official system. Organisations which chose to remain outside the system or which were expelled from it would be liable to the sanctions of the general law of the land but not to the sanctions which form part of the official system of conciliation and arbitration. The 1987 Bill which would have brought consistency to the application of statute and common law in the area of sanctions was withdrawn because employer organisations either did not understand the Bill, could not explain it to their members or wanted to maintain the current legal position that puts registered organisations in double jeopardy by the use of the same legal sanction under both statute and common law. </PARA>
<PARA> This failure to rationalise the industrial sanctions has significantly undermined what would have been a major weapon in the current dispute: the threat of deregistration of the union. When I was reading the material on the subject, it was with great interest that I noted that after years in the wilderness the Australian Federation of Air Pilots was re-registered in 1986 by Mr Justice Jim Staples. He must be having a big laugh about it now. Perhaps it could be called Staples revenge. By remaining within the official system a union is effectively leaving itself open to two sets of sanctions: common law and statutory law. Unless there is a serious possibility that a union will fall apart in the wake of deregistration-that is, by having its membership taken up by other unions as was the case with the Builders Labourers Federation-the threat of deregistration is virtually no threat at all. </PARA>
<PARA> Much the same position applies where the union can organise mass resignations of its members. As we have seen in the present dispute where the employees bring the employment relationship to an end, the official sanctions are of limited value. I might add that the number of unions in this country whose members are well paid enough to play such a trump card is very few indeed. Even ignoring the Chaney Bill's many defects, that Bill does nothing to resolve the current dispute and it provides no long term remedy against future industrial action that may be perpetrated by the pilots. </PARA>
<PARA> Returning to the American model, it may be possible, and it certainly should be investigated in my view, to enact an Australian version of the Railway Labor Act 1926 and to quarantine that Act to the airline industry. I do not think a case could be made in Australia to apply it to the railway industry because that legislation does not have the same operative effect here as it does in the United States. This could be done by using the trade and commerce and/or corporations powers contained in the Australian Constitution. Under these powers a continuing employer-employee relationship is not required and the limited reach of the existing Act to non-employees could be extended without prejudicing the right of other registered organisations by further complicating the sanctions provision. </PARA>
<PARA> At the same time by confining the operation of a special Act to a particular organisation which has been removed from the system by deregistration or which has tried to avoid its responsibilities under the system, the Government would put new teeth into the deregistration sanctions. Given the alacrity with which the Commission cancelled the relevant pilots awards, there is little doubt in my mind that in this case had deregistration been a real threat the Commission or the court would readily have acted on any request to deregister the pilots union. Once deregistered the union would be liable to the unique set of sanctions contained in a railway labour-type Act. Fines and not draconian penal sanctions could be applied against the union and its members if they refused to observe the statutory cooling-off periods. The aircraft would consequently remain in the air while the dispute was arbitrated by a special panel similar to that employed under the United States legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> The pilots have stated again and again and, indeed, have indicated in every industrial dispute that they have pulled since 1959 that they want to be treated as a special case. I think there is a case for treating them as such and for agreeing to their request by the enactment of special legislation which would allow their wish to be granted whilst at the same time protecting the public interest without further adding to the morass of overlapping industrial sanctions. The one thing that has changed in the industrial disputation in this industry since the early 1950s is the absolutely crucial role that aviation now plays in Australia. The pilots are in a unique position. They run a closed shop union. It is a very tight shop indeed. The pilots are virtually irreplaceable which is their main bargaining strength and they have never hesitated to use it by playing one airline off against the other. In the past, as has been the case in the United States, one airline always crumbles. As soon as it does the new award that is negotiated under that agreement is then used as the basis for the next claim against another airline immediately, which is usually not very far down the track. That has been the history of this union in Australia for years. </PARA>
<PARA> The performance of the Opposition on this subject has been abysmal. I commend to all Opposition members, because some of them have perhaps not done so, a reading of the full transcript of their Leader's major press conference just the other day when he provided the Opposition's position on this particular dispute. I could not believe that someone could be in parliament for as long as the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Peacock) has been and make such a fundamental mess of what is without doubt the most pressing and crucial issue that is facing Australia today. It was with a sense of disbelief that I read Andrew Peacock's comments about this dispute. He wandered into the press conference, draped himself with all of his elegance and flair across the rostrum, and said to the assembled troops, `Well, boys, I told you I would have regular press conferences when I became Leader of the Opposition and here I am'. He was then completely thrown by the very first question he was asked which, funnily enough, was about the airline pilots dispute. He just dug himself deeper and deeper into a hole. </PARA>
<PARA> This episode reminded me of a conversation I had some years ago now with the former Leader of the Opposition, the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard), on the steps of the old Parliament House. I was Leader of the Opposition in the Northern Territory at the time. I was doing an interview with a number of television channels on the Chamberlain case. John Howard, who I had never met and who was then shadow Treasurer, walked out of the front door of Parliament House and stood on the steps while I completed the interview. I have no doubt in my mind that there is no reason why John Howard would remember this conversation. Why would he? But I do. After the interview finished I walked over, shook hands with him, introduced myself and we had a chat on the steps. I remember saying to John Howard then, `You know, as someone who has been in Opposition for many years myself, I can tell you that you blokes will be in Opposition for a very long time if your party doesn't wake up to itself, get rid of that goose you have running your party at the moment and put you in'. Perhaps John Howard does remember that conversation. All I can say is that I believe that my political judgment at that time was absolutely correct. It is as correct now as it was then. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My remarks this evening are about India and Australia-India relations. The Senate Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade is currently conducting a timely inquiry into Australia's relations with India. The Committee should finish its report before December this year. The Committee's three major terms of reference are Australia-India trade, India's defence capabilities and foreign relations in South Asia generally.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As a senator actively engaged in this inquiry, I made my own arrangements to travel to India for three weeks last June and July. This visit to India was equally divided between Delhi, the capital, and the States of Uttar Pradesh and Rajasthan. In Delhi I met government and military officers in the Departments of Defence, External Affairs, Commerce and the Planning Commission and some members of Parliament. I also met with some institute representatives and journalists concerned with trade or with defence and strategic assessments. I am particularly grateful to the Australian High Commissioner to India, His Excellency Graham Feakes, who with the assistance of his staff accompanied me and facilitated my arrangements in Delhi. </PARA>
<PARA> In Uttar Pradesh my wife and I were guests of the State Government and in particular our host was Dr Ammar Rizvi, Minister for Public Works, Chief Whip of the Congress Party and formerly a long time Uttar Pradesh Minister for Education. I visited universities and colleges in Lucknow, Pantnagar and Agra. In many meetings and conversations I extended my questions from the Delhi agenda to the context and to the insights and sense of priorities of this important province. Uttar Pradesh is a large Indian State, of course, with a population of 100 million people. In Rajasthan, our host was the Speaker of the Legislative Assembly, the Hon. Giriraj Prasad Tiwari. This Parliament in Jaipur is located in the former city palace of the `pink city'. I met parliamentarians of all parties and other influential residents of the city. Besides Jaipur, I visited by car Bharatpur in the east of Rajasthan and Ajmer in the centre and met with a wide range of civic and educational leaders. Again I reflected on the defence, trade and foreign relations questions of the Delhi agenda, but this time in the provincial context of these three areas of Rajasthan. </PARA>
<PARA> My visit to India this year, apart from a brief reconnaissance in Delhi in 1987, was my first substantial return to the subcontinent in more than 20 years. In 1966-67, I was the leader of an Australian universities student delegation to India, Sri Lanka and Nepal, and I spent two months in India during that Australian summer. My travels then included the southern States, Maharashtra, Rajasthan, Delhi, the States of the Indo-Gangetic plain from Punjab to Bengal, and the northern State of Kashmir. Perhaps I saw much more then as I travelled as a student, third-class on the trains, immersed among the people. Moreover, this original visit followed a year of university studies on the history and politics of India and Pakistan. Before returning this year I revised those studies and my foundation experiences in travelling in this important part of the world. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me draw to the attention of honourable senators some of my observations about India this year. At the outset, I wish to draw to the Senate's attention three notable speeches, three key speeches, all of which I would propose as essential reading for Australians wanting to come to grips with what is happening in India and with Australia-India relations. The first speech is by Rajiv Gandhi, the Indian Prime Minister. For five years he has led the Government of India since the assassination of his mother, Indira Gandhi, in 1984. At the end of his most fruitful and most authoritative year as Prime Minister-that is 1985, his first year in office-he was called on to give the inaugural address to the Centenary Session of the Congress Party in Bombay. It was 28 December 1985. It is a gutsy speech. It is a refreshing inspiration to truth and justice for India. After 100 years of Congress policies, Rajiv as Prime Minister is declaring that the Party and Government is failing the people of India, and he is calling for a revolutionary effort by his colleagues to overcome vested interests. His call is to serve the people. I seek leave to incorporate a summary of the speech in Hansard. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The speech read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA> In his inaugural address to the Congress Centenary Session in Bombay on December 28, 1985, Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi surveyed the history of the party and recalled its struggle for independence and for making India a modern self-reliant nation. </PARA>
<PARA> However, towards the end of the address he frankly criticised the administration, industry, trade unions, the education system, justice, the Congress Party and the Opposition. The following are his observations:</PARA>
<PARA> Institutions: Too often, behind their imposing facades, the spirit and substance lack vitality. </PARA>
<PARA> Justice: The poor have little hope of timely redress. </PARA>
<PARA> Industry: We have industrialists untouched by the thrusting spirit of great risk-takers and innovators. </PARA>
<PARA> Trade Unions: They now protect the few who have, oblivious of millions who have not. They feel little concern for the creation of national wealth, only for a larger and larger share. </PARA>
<PARA> Universities: Teachers seldom teach and students seldom learn. Strike, mass copying, agitations are more attractive alternatives. </PARA>
<PARA> Government Servants: We have government servants who do not serve but oppress the poor and the helpless, police who do not uphold the law but shield the guilty, tax collectors who do not collect taxes but conive with those who cheat the State. </PARA>
<PARA> Congress Party: Good Congress workers are handicapped for on their backs ride the brokers of power and influence, who dispense patronage to convert a mass movement into a feudal oligarchy. </PARA>
<PARA> Corruption is not only tolerated but even regarded as the hallmark of leaderships. </PARA>
<PARA> Opposition: Non-congress parties have shown a cynical disregard for sensitive issues of national security. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Gandhi called for less consumption and more production and told the partymen to re-establish contacts with the masses. </PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="PJ4">Senator TEAGUE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the Senate. The single most distressing observation to make about India today is that Rajiv Gandhi's most important speech has fallen on deaf ears. Little progress towards the Rajiv reforms has been made in the past three years. Vested interests are even more entrenched. The Prime Minister seems to have given up on his proposed reform of the Congress Party. The Opposition is no better. Whilst the Opposition leader, Mr V. P. Singh, Rajiv's former Defence Minister, has put up some sharp and credible criticisms of the current Government, nevertheless the Janata Dal coalition offers no significant positive alternatives. In the States, the Opposition has made many gains, but for the coming national election, which is expected in October or December, Rajiv Gandhi is likely to be re-elected, but with a reduced majority. The overwhelming body of opinion in India is that the Prime Minister will continue with popular endorsement for another five-year term. Of course, his biggest asset is that his grandfather was Jawaharlal Nehru and his mother Indira Gandhi.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Rajiv's win will, in large part, rest on his strikingly new and positive policies towards the village councils all over India, the panchayat councils. He promises direct rather than indirect grants to the panchayat. Secondly, he promises open village council elections, the introduction of genuine democracy for the first time to the panchayat councils. These twin promises are keynotes to Rajiv's coming election victory. Rajiv's strategy is to restructure Indian politics by going around the vested interests even in his own Party, by denying power to the vested interests that have frustrated his December 1985 vision, and by giving power directly to the grassroots, to the ordinary people of India. This panchayat strategy has replaced his hope to reform the Congress Party. </PARA>
<PARA> However, there is one important power over Congress that the Prime Minister still holds, and in the next month he is likely to exercise this power because it can work alongside the panchayat reform. I refer to the Prime Minister's power of preselecting candidates for the coming election. I think that he will take many by surprise by putting up his own new alternatives to stand for the Congress I ticket, with the calculation that only a minority of those rejected will stand for the election independently with any prospect of success. I believe that the Prime Minister's power of preselection will cause a lot of excitement in the next few weeks. </PARA>
<PARA> The second speech to which I draw attention is the Tata Memorial Lecture of 12 April this year delivered in Bangalore by Dr Abid Hussain. Dr Hussain is a member of the Planning Commission of India and I have very much valued my discussions with him in Canberra in May and again in Delhi during my visit. Dr Abid Hussain is the most authoritative and perceptive Indian decision maker I have met. He has a most informed knowledge of his own country's political and economic development and his nature is generous and not arrogant towards others. In his Tata speech he elaborated on the foundations and objectives of India's upcoming five-year plan. The title is Eighth Plan: Some Strategic Perspectives. I seek leave to incorporate a few paragraphs of this speech in Hansard. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The paragraphs read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA> The Eighth Plan is the eighth opportunity for us to restructure our society and influence our polity. It provides yet another occasion for articulating our loftiest hopes and noblest aspirations. It offers yet another chance to tackle our age-old problems with a renewed sense of commitment and vigour. It is yet another time for us to reflect on where we are going wrong and on what we should be doing different to promote growth and enhance equity. It is yet another moment to offer to our people a freshness of vision, a boldness of intent and a clarity of purpose to get the nation moving unitedly. </PARA>
<PARA> Seven Plans have come and gone by. Much has been achieved. The successes have been striking and cannot be wished away even by the prophets of statistical doom, of whom there is a surfeit in India. But the failures have been glaring. Our age-old problems of poverty and destitution, of hunger and malnutrition, of disease and squalor, of illiteracy and ignorance, of feudalism and inequality, of oppression and brutality persist. Economic progress is indeed taking place. The Indian economy is on a 5% growth trajectory. Industry and agriculture have taken impressive strides. A burgeoning middle class and a vibrant entrepreneurial class has come into being. But the pace of advance is still lethargic and more importantly, does not appear to be resulting in social well-being of society at large. The ghettoes of caste and tradition are getting fortified, just as prosperity is spreading. </PARA>
<PARA> While the signals for economic take-off have never been as promising as they are now, there seems to be a retrogression in social values and mores. Economic prosperity is breeding a dangerous kind of insularity, a pernicious kind of social Darwinism and a destructive kind of religious, linguistic and ethnic fundamentalism. The state, impressive as it appears with its bulging industrial muscle and growing agricultural prosperity, has been infiltrated by forces insensitive to the well-being and interests of the impoverished majority and is increasingly being alienated from its own people. The featherbedding combination of the bureaucrat and the politician is proving deadly and has succeeded in putting brakes on the forces of reform and change that found full expression in the Prime Minister's Congress Centenary Speech of 1985. </PARA>
<PARA> Quite simply, the design and working of the state apparatus and of its apparatchiks at all levels permits neither sustained rapid growth nor redistributive social justice in tangible measure. It is on this one single issue-of alternative and responsive state structures-that we need to focus our intellectual energies if planning is to be at all meaningful and if it is to make a real difference to peoples' lives. Just as Mr Gorbachov has realised that perestroika without glasnost is not possible, we too must appreciate that economic growth and social justice in India just cannot be sustained without root and branch reform and cleansing of our moribund administrative and political systems. </PARA>
<PARA>. . . The Eighth Plan strategy is designed to accelerate the growth rate of the economy from the 5% achieved in the 1980s to at least 6% . . . A 6% growth rate has certain macroeconomic implications that we need to understand and build a consensus on. First, it means a whole new approach to subsidies, which have been garnered by sections of society that can without it, whether it relates to fertiliser, food, export and credit subsidies. Targetting of subsidies is essential. Second, it means a containment in government's own consumption expenditure. Third, it means a vastly different policy regime for public enterprises that will involve a mix of closure, privatisation and transparency of all non-commercial obligations. Fourth, it implies a stepped up savings performance which in turn will demand a fresh look at the capital market. Finally, it means a 10% volume growth in exports, which is roughly double the Seventh Plan performance. This is feasible given sector-specific and firm-specific incentives. </PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="PJ4">Senator TEAGUE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the Senate. Let me emphasise that in 1984 in India an economic policy revolution was begun based on a new entrepreneurial economic plan of which Dr Abid Hussain was one of the principal architects. The plan was embraced by Rajiv Gandhi immediately on his succeeding his mother in office, although the plan was in train before then. He has put his strength behind the plan's aim to lower tariffs, increase exports and bring the disciplines of international competition to challenge-indeed, goad-the Indian economy towards improved performance. The eighth plan takes up this economic blueprint for a second successive five-year period.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The third speech to which I draw attention is that of the Australian Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) in his successful visit to Delhi in February this year. I refer actually to both his general speech of 9 February and his speech on 10 February to the India-Australia Joint Business Council. Mr Hawke's description of Australia-India relations and of the positive prospects for increased trade between our nations is a bipartisan matter in this Parliament. Government and Opposition alike want to build strongly on the vastly improved relationship between India and Australia which has so constructively developed since Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi's successful visit to Australia in 1986. All the promise that we expressed to him then from both sides of Parliament has been fulfilled, and to the genuine mutual benefit of both countries. Much more is in prospect. I will not foreshadow the analysis of these developments in Australia-India relations, which will be set out in the Senate Committee's report. </PARA>
<PARA> More briefly, I should refer to two recent books which ought to be widely read. One is by an Australian historian, Dr Robin Jeffery, titled What's Happening in India, published in 1986, which uses as its springboard the contemporary tensions, opportunities and wealth of the Punjab. The other is the book by Indian journalist, M. J. Akbar, titled India: the seige within. This is understandably popular in Indian Government circles as it is a bold self-justification of an aspiring, expansive `greater India'. It is a disturbing book for neighbouring Pakistanis because it represents all the more evidence for being anxious that increasing numbers of Indians are rejecting the 1947 partition of the subcontinent as a mistake which was against the pre-Mogul destiny which India, now that it is `free', should be able to again pursue. I am not a convert to Akbar's nationalism, but it must truly be understood. </PARA>
<PARA> I now turn briefly to some general conclusions about Australia-India trade. Currently, Australia exports half a billion dollars worth of goods to India. India exports a quarter of a billion dollars worth to Australia. The prospects for growth in this two-way trade are very positive indeed. We need to look far beyond simple commodity trade in wool, coal, iron ore and wheat to see the real growth prospects in Australia's high-tech products, telecommunications, education services, construction consultancies and financial services. On our part we need to go beyond traditional Indian goods such as textiles, clothing and footwear and tea and coffee, to chemicals, computer software and manufactured goods wherever India puts up products competitive both in quality and in price. As one senator who, over the last 10 years, has helped to build the enormously increased trade between China and Australia, I should add that our recent success in east Asia to develop improved markets should not blind us to the parallel opportunities in south Asia and in India in particular. Australian analysts and planners such as my friend Dr Ross Garnaut should ensure that we keep east Asia and south Asia in a proper perspective. Our vision for Australian trade must encompass both-indeed, all fruitful markets anywhere in the world. </PARA>
<PARA> I will refer briefly to India's enhanced defence capabilities, which will be carefully addressed in our Senate report. Over the past year increased attention has been given to India's increased naval expenditure; the two aircraft carriers and the plan to acquire three; the leasing of a nuclear powered submarine and the plan to acquire six; the test firing of the Agni intercontinental missile, which has a range of 2,500 kilometres; the decade and more that has elapsed since India first tested a nuclear explosive device; the constant speculation that India has become the sixth or seventh nuclear armed nation; and the continuing equipment and training of the third largest army in the world and one of the most lethal air forces. All these military acquisitions need to be taken into account when we come to assess the defence capabilities in the nations bordering on the Indian Ocean, a region in which Australia and our neighbours of the Association of South East Asian Nations are very much placed, let alone Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh and the other countries of the south Asian region. </PARA>
<PARA> It is my observation that India justifies her strong military policy with reference to several very plausible arguments that we in Australia must realistically face. One is that, if nuclear capability is the currency of world power, India sees no reason why she should not acquire that nuclear capability. Another argument is that the nuclear non-proliferation treaty was designed by the nations of the world to stop horizontal proliferation and in particular to prevent India from acquiring nuclear weapons. India is, therefore, subjectively quite committed never to sign the nuclear non-proliferation treaty. </PARA>
<PARA> A third common argument in India looks to the track record in defence needs since India's independence in 1947. There was the major war with China in 1962 and three wars with Pakistan. It is India's view that there is a need for that country to be prepared against the worst case of a combined or allied attack by both China and Pakistan together. A fourth argument that is much mentioned in India is that the military budget is a low percentage of gross national product and is comparable with the percentage in most countries of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development. Another argument that is much used in India is that India in its general values is still much guided by the principles of the first Prime Minister, Jawaharlal Nehru, and the other guiding spirit, Mahatma Gandhi, who espoused so directly the principles of peace and international cooperation. </PARA>
<PARA> Each one of those five arguments commonly put in India can be questioned. I do not accept any one of the five arguments with any kind of complacency. Part of our need in Australia is to apply objective evidence to each of the five arguments or assertions that are commonly made in India. There are also a number of counter-arguments and other considerations that we in Australia would need to take into account. Firstly, there is no defence plan in India. There is no White Paper on defence. There is no explicit government policy as to what India's defence capability seeks to achieve. Secondly, we need to be concerned about continuing our strong commitment to support the nuclear non-proliferation treaty. It is a bipartisan matter in this Parliament not only for us to strengthen that treaty, as we did in its recent confirmation discussions, but also to follow up the comprehensive set of disarmament measures to which Australia is committed. Happily, India shares some of those disarmament objectives but not, I am afraid, all of them. </PARA>
<PARA> Another consideration is that Australia is deeply committed to doing all that we can do to reduce tensions in south Asia and to discourage any arms race in the region with either conventional or nuclear weapons. We should not lose sight of the fact that Australia is also concerned on account of India's interventions into the affairs of other countries in the region, that India is seen too much by its neighbouring countries as a regional bully that has over-exerted its own policies and backed up its foreign policies with military strength. Examples of this are the intervention with Pakistan in the formation of Bangladesh; the occupation at the moment of the northern part of Sri Lanka by the Indian Army, despite the President of Sri Lanka directly requesting the Indian Army to leave; the difficulties with Bangladesh; and the closing of the borders between India and Nepal-not to mention some differences of opinion between India and Bhutan or the paratroopers who were flown in to stop a coup in the Maldives. </PARA>
<PARA> These military activities and interventions by India all pale into insignificance given the enormous tension that still exists between India and Pakistan and the hot war that is currently under way on the glacier to the north of Kashmir. In regard to these interventions, Australia and all nations are rightly concerned that India's professions of justice and fairness with regard to the sovereignty and independent foreign policies of neighbouring countries are being followed up in practice by fair dealing. </PARA>
<PARA> Australians rightly should be concerned at India's ambitious, but often ambiguous, objective not only to become a regional power in south Asia but also to join the superpowers. Many people in India believe that their country should aspire to be in the top club of the most powerful nations in international affairs. Indians refer to the United States of America, the Soviet Union, China and themselves. It is still frequently lamented that, for example, India is not a member of the United Nations Security Council. India has often explicitly aspired to be the exclusive military power in the Indian Ocean. These considerations, along with our scepticism of the arguments that I first rehearsed, and that are frequently put in India, all need to be considered together in our assessment of the meaning and possible outcomes of India's enhanced defence capabilities. </PARA>
<PARA> In conclusion, I wish to express my thanks to those hosts who welcomed me and my wife during our visit to India. I also wish to thank the Australian High Commissioner and his staff in Delhi and the wider circle of the Australian Foreign Office who, in briefings and in other ways, made my visit more successful. I wish to thank a wide range of Australian academics and business leaders involved in Australia-India trade and members of the research staff of the Parliamentary Library who assisted me in preparing for this visit. I look forward to the presentation later this year of the report of the Senate Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade on Australia-India relations. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Tonight I want to analyse the decisions and the findings of the Pharmaceutical Benefits Remuneration Tribunal. Although I have previously spoken on this matter, I feel that it is necessary to reiterate and add to what I have said. I have already asked for the Tribunal to be recalled and for its devastating and disastrous decisions and effects on the pharmaceutical industry to be reconsidered. I again wish to state that I have a vested interest, through my wife who is a local part time pharmacist. A number of my constituents who are pharmacists have really got-to quote them-their `backs to the wall' as a result of these findings. They are really desperate people. Their livelihoods, their means of earning a living, are now at stake. These comments have been made not by one or two pharmacists but by a significant number of pharmacists in Tasmania, and their concerns are echoed right around Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The findings on which the Tribunal has based its decisions are flawed. The Tribunal presented a database which included information from about 150 selected pharmacies throughout Australia. But many of the 150 selected pharmacies did not respond. The main reason for this lack of response was the lack of time involved and the amount of detail that was required to complete the surveys. Actually, there were two components to the survey: firstly, 120 pharmacies were asked to complete an individual work measurement recording exercise. One pharmacist who started to participate stated that he and three of his staff members each spent six hours attempting to complete this survey and it was still far from finished. After 24 hours of work by four people, the task was still far from finished. Secondly, the survey required the gathering of other information that involved the services of pharmacists' accountants. There was no question of the Tribunal covering the costs involved in accountants completing the survey. These costs involved many hours of work by a pharmacist, his staff and his accountant. </PARA>
<PARA> A large number of pharmacists found that it was quite uneconomic to complete this first part of the survey. The second aspect of the survey was a sub-sample of 30 pharmacies selected from the original 150. These 30 pharmacies were requested to complete a 1988 pharmacy costs of goods sold survey. They were asked to supply the following:</PARA>
<PARA> All supplier invoices and statements relating to goods and services purchased for the above pharmacy for the 12 months ended 30 June 1987. </PARA>
<PARA> All supplier invoices and statements relating to goods and services purchased for the month ended 29 February 1988. </PARA>
<PARA> Where the information is not already shown on the invoices or statements separate details of all-</PARA>
<PARA>remember the period that I mentioned-</PARA>
<PARA>special pack buys</PARA>
<PARA>discounts</PARA>
<PARA>rebates</PARA>
<PARA>surcharges</PARA>
<PARA>special promotions; and</PARA>
<PARA>any other payment or deduction which had an impact on your purchase price and cost of goods sold for the year ended 30 June, 1987 and the month ended 29 February 1988. </PARA>
<PARA>Just imagine going through all those invoices in a busy pharmacy. The time involved in gathering all this information was monumental and quite unreasonable, yet the time given to complete the survey forms was minimal. One pharmacist selected in my electorate was given 10 days to supply this sort of detail which covered an extended period. Naturally, many of the pharmacists did not have the time to respond. Granted, the Tribunal offered an extension, but no offer to compensate for the cost of the time involved was forthcoming. There was a token gesture-a reverse charge telephone call was offered by the consultants, Deloitte Consulting Group Pty Ltd. The cost of the freight of the invoices I have mentioned was also offered but no coverage of the cost of pharmacist hours lost, accountants' costs and staff costs was forthcoming. </PARA>
<PARA> It is believed by many pharmacists that those who responded to the survey were either extraordinarily efficient or extraordinarily inefficient or they did not need to supply many scripts. Thus 0.3 per cent of the pharmacists in Australia responded to this survey. Is this a sufficient base on which to restructure the entire pharmaceutical industry? It is an unacceptable criterion for assessing pharmacists' income. The Government has supported the database findings because it thinks it will save money on the pharmaceutical benefits scheme (PBS). However, it is cutting the gross remuneration to or gross income of the pharmacies. </PARA>
<PARA> A business cannot readily change its fixed costs but it can change its variable costs. Naturally, the first variable cost to be changed will be the labour component. I have already mentioned this in my previous address. But I think the Senate needs to know that, throughout Australia, there are 16,000 pharmacy assistants whose jobs are now threatened. If General Motors-Holden's Ltd, the Ford Motor Co. of Australia Ltd, or even Mitsubishi Motors Australia Ltd were facing stand-downs of this magnitude, the headlines of the newspapers would be screaming. </PARA>
<PARA> The effect of the Tribunal's decision is that an average pharmacy will lose $26,000 to $30,000 in a year. These are the wages for two or maybe even three assistants, depending on their ages. We have not even begun to discuss the pharmacists who will close their shops. A figure of over 100,000 has previously been stated. Many country and smaller pharmacies that employ one, two or three staff members will become family businesses. The staff will be retrenched and the wife withdrawn from home duties to work in the pharmacy. The pharmacist himself could possibly not draw a salary and the business may make only a small profit or loss, or he might eventually decide to close. This is the possible scenario being painted for many pharmacists right across Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> Many pharmacists have invested up to $500,000 in buildings, stock and fixtures and fittings to set up as a business. This $500,000 does not include goodwill. The Government argues that goodwill should not be included as an asset in the funds-employed component of the formula used to determine the remuneration. After what the pharmacies are going to go through, it is probably true that the goodwill of pharmacies will not be worth anything as a result of this Tribunal hearing. The Government falsely argues that goodwill is an intangible asset-we all know that-with varying definitions and methods of treatment, that its value is generally subjective, and that inclusion of goodwill in the funds-employed component would lead to excess payments to pharmacists. Goodwill should be taken into account when calculating a reasonable return on an investment. In moving into his practice, a pharmacist has to pay out. It is reasonable that it is taken into account. A country that does not allow a reasonable return on a business will find that that business is stifled over time. It will not enhance the overall economic state of the country. It is true that pharmacies are being offered $50,000 to amalgamate. So $50,000 for a $500,000 business does not really sound like a generous offer to me. </PARA>
<PARA> In many cases there are requests for amalgamation where there is enough business at the present time for two pharmacies or more. In Deloraine, which is a small country town in my own State of Tasmania, there are two pharmacies. Both earn modest incomes and the pharmacies provide jobs for five to six assistants plus the pharmacists. They are being asked to amalgamate; yet the three banks in the town are not being asked to join forces. The pharmacists are being singled out. </PARA>
<PARA> If the $20m saving forecast by the Tribunal is to be achieved, it will be at the expense of retrenchments of many thousands of pharmacy assistants, and these assistants are usually young and female. This is an age group that already has a very high and unacceptable unemployment rate. At the moment Tasmania has, I think, a 12.4 per cent unemployment rate compared with the national average of 7.5 per cent in the 15- to 19-year-old age bracket. In 1987, this rate was as high as 19.4 per cent in Tasmania. A return to these sorts of figures could easily eventuate if the Tribunal's findings are implemented. </PARA>
<PARA> The Tribunal has further ignored the increased cost of running this type of business. In the last five years, the cost of pharmacy goods has risen by 101.5 per cent and labour costs by 87 per cent. Yet the pharmacists' gross income has increased by a very much smaller margin. It appears that the pharmacists are being singled out for quite punitive treatment by this Government. Now, to add insult to injury, the Government is going to abide by the decisions of the Pharmaceutical Benefits Remuneration Tribunal. The database finding is compounding the damage to pharmacists. The Government has already cut the real income of pharmacists by some 12 per cent last year and is planning to cut it by a further 8 per cent or even more this year. This has already caused the closure of many pharmacies. The Government is preventing pharmacists from sharing the gains they have achieved for the community in developing more efficient pharmaceutical services-for example, through computerised information on therapeutic drugs. </PARA>
<PARA> A further bone of contention is the value that the Government places on the pharmacist-proprietor. The Federal Government has submitted that the proprietor's notional salary should be $15 per hour. This is less than half of the equivalent hourly rate for middle range government salaried pharmacists. Is it reasonable that pharmacists should be discriminated against in this way compared with other professions? I believe that discrimination, even within a profession-the private sector versus the public sector-is quite unreasonable. The $15 an hour rate is considerably less than even tradespersons charge nowadays. Is this fair recompense? Certainly not, particularly considering that they provide a community service which is important to the health of our nation. </PARA>
<PARA> Another one of my constituents-and I believe that taking examples is important because only in this way can we sheet home the gravity of what has been perpetrated on these people-is a small country pharmacist who has given me the following facts: He works 51 hours per week over seven days. He provides home delivery services after hours, sometimes travelling 52 kilometres to make a delivery. Most of his clients are age pensioners and many have limited access to transport. He dispenses between 11,000 and 12,000 prescriptions per year and has recently installed a computer at a cost of $6,250 to provide an even better service to the community, for no extra remuneration. Dispensing prescriptions provides around 55 per cent of his sales, the majority of his other sales also being in health related areas. So nearly all of his dispensing involves PBS items. Award wages for the hours worked, including penalty rates, are approximately $43,000. This includes holidays and sick pay. But this particular pharmacist does not get the $43,000. His trading profit for 1988-89 will be $28,000, without deducting the proprietor's salary. The latest Tribunal findings will cost him between $5,000 and $6,000 a year, because he is a small pharmacist, which will leave him around $22,000 a year as a professional with life or death responsibilities being faced every day in the execution of his duty. </PARA>
<PARA> The restructuring of the dispensing fee and the abolition of the present 25 per cent mark-up on the wholesale price of drugs will mean that many pharmacists will actually be losing money on the dispensing of many expensive items. For example, the Government works on a price list for wholesale drugs. The wholesalers charge a 6.2 per cent surcharge in order to encourage the purchase of bulk quantities and the surcharge is rebated if the quantities are high enough. But not every pharmacy can afford to buy in bulk. Thus, if a drug which costs $100 is ordered, the surcharge being $6.20 and the dispensing fee from the Government being $4.20, a loss of $2 occurs. This could be handed on to the consumer, but he certainly will not appreciate it. </PARA>
<PARA> A consequence of this situation will be that many pharmacists will not stock the expensive sorts of drugs. The consumer will be encouraged to go to the public hospital to obtain a drug, at great inconvenience to many of these old people. A drug that could be affected in this way is Renitec. As I have mentioned previously, this is what is known as an ACE inhibitor. It is a new, expensive drug which is commonly requested for hypertension. The drug which is replacing four or five other drugs which have been previously prescribed. It is expensive cost-wise, but it does not have the same side effects of the previously prescribed drugs, and it helps in preventing the hospitalisation of patients. The cost to the public health system will far outweigh the savings that the Government feels it is going to obtain by implementing the Tribunal's findings, especially if these expensive drugs are available only from the public hospitals. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government says that it cannot circumvent the Tribunal's decisions. In the past, when it has suited the Government, tribunals' decisions have been ignored. Two years ago, the Government circumvented the then tribunal and reduced the wholesale price of drugs. This was outside the bounds of the tribunal. The Government also stepped in to stop the massive increases that judges were granted by a tribunal set up to investigate the salaries of this august body. </PARA>
<PARA> At the moment, the Minister for Housing and Aged Care, Hon. Peter Staples, is considering asking pensioners to pay $2 or $3 for each of their scripts. There are 150 million pensioners' scripts dispensed each year. The Government will earn $300m from this. Is Mr Staples considering using this to give the pensioners a pay increase? Is this the intended plan of the Government in enforcing the Tribunal's decision? What sort of pension increase will there be?</PARA>
<PARA> The Pharmaceutical Remuneration Benefits Tribunal has caused and is going to cause untold financial damage to pharmacists, their businesses and employees, and to the economy if these findings are allowed to stand. I hope that the Government will intervene, overturn these decisions and implement something that is more reasonable to the pharmacists, to the community and to the health care of ordinary Australians throughout this nation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There has been a major meatworks in Portland for many years. It is known as Thomas Borthwick and Sons (Australasia) Ltd. It has been a profitable enterprise. When it is operating, hundreds of people work there. Their pay has provided good times for Portland. On 29 April 1988 Borthwicks dismissed its work force. It said that livestock was too expensive and in any event was in short supply. At the time of its shutdown in April 1988 Borthwicks had been operating for some years according to an agreement with the Australasian Meat Industry Employees Union. That agreement provided for wages and conditions very similar to all other export works in Victoria. In October 1988 Borthwicks spoke of reopening the meatworks. It said that those it employed would have to accept lower wages and conditions than those operating in April.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> When this declaration was made in October 1988 Borthwicks was owned by Australian Meat Holdings. Australian Meat Holdings was once shared by Tancreds, Elders IXL Ltd, Smorgon Consolidated Industries and Metro Meats Ltd., but during most, if not all, of the events I am to relate it was solely in the hands of Elders IXL. People who traditionally worked at Borthwicks declined to accept the reduced conditions offered by Elders IXL. The matter was taken before Commissioner Caesar. During one hearing he made a statement which the employer and employees interpreted differently. Talking about the construction of an award, the statement was:</PARA>
<PARA>On that construction then the present application in the form set out in relation to Borthwicks amounts to a roping-in application. </PARA>
<PARA>In all the circumstances I will adopt the submissions of both Mr Burdis and Mr Rothman and adjourn the matter to a date to be fixed to allow the proper serving of the parties. </PARA>
<PARA>In the meantime I strongly recommend that the current practices carried out by the employers of meatworks labour in Victoria continue until any proceedings before the Commission require them to change. This recommendation applies to all employers of meatworks labour in Victoria including Borthwick Pacific. </PARA>
<PARA> The Australasian Meat Industry Employees Union, which represented the employees, took this to mean that conditions applicable to export meatworks throughout Victoria would apply to Borthwicks. The employer thought differently. The Full Bench of the Australian Conciliation and Arbitration Commission took over the dispute. The union was anxious to have the matter disposed of. The Commission sat during January. It concluded taking evidence on the Australia Day holiday, 30 January 1989. The urgency in taking evidence did not produce an expeditious decision. The Australian Conciliation and Arbitration Commission, which took evidence in January, had become the Australian Industrial Relations Commission by the time it handed down a decision on 23 March 1989. It urged the parties to draw up a new award. The last paragraph of the decision reads:</PARA>
<PARA> In our view, conferences should now take place between the parties on the terms and conditions of employment which should apply under the new award to operate at Portland. Deputy President Riordan-</PARA>
<PARA>he was appointed pursuant to section 34 of the old Act-</PARA>
<PARA>will be available to assist the parties in these conferences. In the event that full agreement is not achieved on the terms and conditions of the proposed award, this Bench will reconvene to consider the procedure to be adopted in the resolution of the matter. </PARA>
<PARA>The parties were unable to come to terms. The Industrial Relations Commission brought down an award in June 1989. This was roughly six months after the dispute giving rise to it was notified. The rancour left by the dispute would be less had the award been delivered earlier. Time allows divisions to harden. The award contained disappointments for the union. However, in clause 35 it did provide for seniority. Elders IXL did not comply with that clause. The union complained to the Commission, which said it could do nothing. </PARA>
<PARA> Elders IXL advertised for employees under the new award. People applied. The company sent them to a particular doctor in Portland. He reported to Elders on their physical ability to carry out the work required. Elders did not pay for the certificates. The candidates were told to use their Medicare entitlements. This caused concern because the Medicare scheme is not intended for the purpose to which it was put. One applicant was diagnosed as having a murmur in the heart. This caused him and his family a great deal of worry. Investigations by other doctors showed the diagnosis to be wrong. The situation produced was most unhappy. </PARA>
<PARA> Much has been said about the need to free up the labour market. The call has been for workers and management to negotiate enterprise agreements. Unions have been allotted a minor role in the scheme of things. But for the unions conditions provided by Elders IXL at Portland would be the poorer. A situation has been created where people looking for work must use Medicare to pay for a report from the single doctor to whom the company sends them. This fits awkwardly with the concept of a caring employer. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1"> -I apologise for taking up the time of the Senate at this hour of the night. I would not have done what I am going to do but for the comments made by Senator Collins which took 26 minutes of our time. It was simply an undisguised and unveiled attack on Mr Peacock, the Liberal Party leader. The honourable senator's speech was in the guise of making comment about the solution of the present strike which is crippling this country, but there was no constructive comment at all in the 26 minutes from the former not only failed State member of parliament but failed Leader of the Opposition in the Northern Territory. It was just a diatribe against Mr Peacock.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I can understand why the Australian Labor Party is doing this. It is way behind in the polls and it is going to stay that way. We have been subjected to the most intense attack through the press and from the Labor Party of any leader of any party I have seen in my lifetime. But it does not matter. Mr Peacock has broad shoulders; we all have broad shoulders. It is not only Mr Peacock's qualities and the policies of the Liberal Party that are putting us ahead. It is also the high interest rate regime-under which people cannot buy houses-and the high taxes, that this Government has imposed on the community that have dug the grave for this tired Government. The reason why we have a strike at the moment is that we have failed policies, and the belief that in some way we can run a centralised wage policy and control every matter in a complex economic environment to run the whole nation's economy by some government official or through some bureaucracy. We simply cannot do it. </PARA>
<PARA> Interestingly enough, from my reading I find that it was only in 1944 that the doctrine was laid down in the British Parliament whereby it was possible for governments to control and manage an economy entirely. Of course, if we go back historically before that governments did not believe that they could control the economies. They did not have this universal belief. The tide has gone out. It has had more than a fair trial. We have seen 40 or 50 years of governments trying to control every cent that is spent and guide the economies. Even the Soviets, who are not terribly fast learners, have realised it has failed. The Labor Party has still not caught up with what the Soviets and the Chinese have learnt. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not want to debate the solution to the problem that the Liberal and National parties will impose. We are not in government. Furthermore, had we been in government the situation would never have arisen. We now have to resolve the situation. It is only going to be resolved through negotiation. I would like to spend one minute reflecting on what the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) is proposing. The Prime Minister has said-I have heard him say this repeatedly-that there is a 6 per cent maximum within the guidelines that the pilots could be awarded. He has forbidden the airlines to negotiate on terms other than that. What is the Prime Minister saying? Apart from all the abuse that is being heaped on a professional body with all its skills he is saying to them-I have heard him say this-that they can all leave Australia. What is going to happen if they all leave Australia?</PARA>
<PARA> Quite clearly the Prime Minister sees himself as a latter day President Reagan, in the way President Reagan dealt with the air traffic controllers. He wants to fire them all and recruit fresh ones. The only way he is going to get fresh pilots is to bring them in from overseas. Does the Prime Minister really want to drive more than 1,600 of our finest airmen in this country out of Australia? That is what he is talking about. We have 1,600 of the top professionals in their field who are as good as or better than any other pilot corp in the world. The Royal Australian Air Force has the best pilots. Between 450 and 600 of the most capable RAAF pilots have joined that pilot corps in the last three or four years. </PARA>
<PARA> Pilots are a national resource. One day I want to make a speech in this Senate about the importance of pilots to this country, because I believe that they are a national resource. The way they are trained, developed, brought on line and employed deserves a great deal more attention than any government gives to it. I come back to what Mr Hawke wants to do. If he wants to drive the 1,600 pilots out of Australia, he will eviscerate completely Australian aviation. We will have nothing at all left. Mr Hawke will be doing what the Pol Pot regime tried to do to the educated class in Cambodia, formerly called Kampuchea. It is precisely the same thing. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not know that answer. It is the most obvious thing that should happen. If we drive these pilots out and recruit from overseas, there are certain practicalities we need to consider. The training requirements are enormous and we do not have any pilots who can act as training captains because they have all resigned. We have a recency requirement in this country that a pilot needs to have flown within 30 days to hold currency on his licence. That will expire very shortly for most pilots unless they are brought back quickly. How are we to train 1,600 pilots from all around the world? What is the cost? What is the time? It is not a matter of days, as the aNiMaLs-that is, the National Media Liaison Service-are telling the people of Australia through the press corps at the moment. It is a matter not of days or weeks, but of months-probably four to six months. It would be a huge cost. What would we have at the end of the day?</PARA></TALK.START>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="YH4">Senator MacGIBBON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is right. It does not work like that because Australian airlines work with a rostering pool. The degree of training is such that any captain in a company can be assigned to fly with any first officer and any flight engineer. The airlines can do that because those people are trained in the company system. They can mix anyone, the most junior pilot who has a licence with the most senior captain, and they will get a safe and effective crew. If we are to pick up pilots from all around the world and run them through a crash training program, we will lose all that flexibility in crew training and manning. Again, that will result in great operational limitations and huge costs, not only to the airlines, but also to fare paying passengers. To think that the solution is to bring in 1,600 pilots from overseas is just cloud-cuckoo-land. I come back to the point that there must be negotiations. We have said that time and time again.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I will now deal with the point of Senator Collins's speech in which he raised the red herring of the Railway Labor Act of 1926 in the United States of America. The first point I make about that is that there is simply no time now when we are in this situation to introduce legislation. If we want legislation, we should introduce it before there is a strike rather than when we are dealing with it. It is just not practical to introduce legislation now. The second point I would make about it is that I do not know the Act except from Senator Collins's explanation of it. Senator Collins said that the Railway Labor Act of the USA was an interstate Act relating to transport. The year 1926 occurred 63 years ago. My knowledge of the United States transport scene tells me that the legislation has not worked at any time in any way at all. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Collins told us that there had been a huge strike in the United States in 1966, at the same time as we had a strike in Australia. I do not remember that but I do remember-you probably do also, Mr President-the huge strike of Northwest Orient Airlines within the last five or six years. Northwest Orient is one of the big operators in the United States, in both internal and overseas airlines systems. Those involved did not go on strike for two or three weeks or two or three months. They went on strike for something like 10 or 12 months; it might even have been 15 or 16 months. It was a huge strike. The Railway Labor Act of 1926 did nothing to mitigate the intensity of that strike. </PARA>
<PARA> At present, Eastern Air Lines is on strike-again, one of the very big airlines of the United States. The strike started somewhere around the middle of March this year. So far as I know, it is still running. I make the point that Senator Collins has probably just picked this thing up out of a book. What he is proposing clearly has never worked in the United States and I do not believe that it would work in Australia. We have to get a system that the Liberal and National parties propose of having voluntary agreements. Parties join such agreements of their own volition. If one party or the other breaches it, that party can be sued for breach of contract. We do not wish to coerce everyone into voluntary agreements. If people wish to stay in the present system, some penalties have to be introduced into the arbitration system. That is what I think poor Senator Collins, in his blind way, was groping towards. He was trying to say that we have to get some penalties into the system. If Senator Collins had had his wits about him, he would have voted-on the two occasions on which we introduced it-for the Bill that would have provided those penalties. </PARA>
