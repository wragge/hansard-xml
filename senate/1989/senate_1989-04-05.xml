<TITLE>Violent Television Programs</TITLE>
<PARA>To the Honourable the President of the Senate and members of the Senate in Parliament assembled:</PARA>
<PARA> The petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth, that:</PARA>
<PARA> We are concerned about the increase in violent television programmes for children and particularly those programmes promoting violent toys that are available for sale in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA> Your petitioners therefore humbly pray:</PARA>
<PARA>That you support the Broadcasting (Prohibition of Violent Programmes for Children) Act 1988 which has been presented by WA Independent Senator for Nuclear Disarmament, Jo Vallentine. This act aims to prohibit the broadcasting of children's TV programmes that are violent and that promote toys modelled on characters, weapons or other war accessories which are also available for sale in Australia.</PARA>

<TITLE>X-rated and Violent Video Material</TITLE>
<PARA>To the Honourable the President and members of the Senate in Parliament assembled.</PARA>
<PARA>The humble petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth that:</PARA>
<PARA> The Parliamentary Joint Select Committee on Video Material has concluded that ``Adverse effects upon people, and especially upon children, of exposure to material containing various degrees of violence, pornography or obscenity have been demonstrated''.</PARA>
<PARA> The majority of the Select Committee strongly opposed the proposition for a new NVE (non-violent erotica) category, which would have entrenched X-rated video pornography.</PARA>
<PARA> All six State Governments have, through their Attorneys-General, expressed unanimous opposition to the circulation of X-rated videos.</PARA>
<PARA> We consider the continuing distribution of X-rated videos from the A.C.T. to be reprehensible and to be contrary to the well being of the Australian community in general.</PARA>
<PARA> We strongly request urgent Government action to prohibit the distribution of X-rated and excessively violent material.</PARA>
<PARA> And your petitioners as in duty bound will ever pray.</PARA>

<PARA> That X-rated videos harm the community, especially women and children, as outlined in evidence given to the Joint Select Committee on video material. Your petitioners request that the Senate should:</PARA>

<TITLE>Sydney (Kingsford-Smith) Airport</TITLE>
<PARA>To the Honourable the President of the Senate and members of the Senate assembled in Parliament; the humble petition of the undersigned showeth:</PARA>
<PARA> That Kingsford-Smith Airport is becoming increasingly congested and existing facilities are inadequate to handle the number of aircraft or their passengers.</PARA>
<PARA> The Federal Government's plans to divert aircraft from Mascot to Bankstown and/or increase landing charges for peak periods will do little to relieve congestion and will place enormous financial and other burdens on commuter airlines and their passengers.</PARA>
<PARA> We therefore call on the Federal Government to take heed of airline and travel industry warnings and-</PARA>
<PARA> 1. give immediate approval for the construction of a third runway at Mascot.</PARA>
<PARA> 2. upgrade existing radar and other traffic control facilities to enable Australia's high safety record to be maintained.</PARA>

<TITLE>Home Ownership</TITLE>
<PARA>To the Honourable the President and members of the Senate in Parliament assembled. The petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth that:</PARA>
<PARA> Recent huge rises in mortgage interest rates have pushed the cost of buying their own home beyond the reach of most Australian families.</PARA>
<PARA> Those Australians already paying off home mortgages are now suffering severely and unfairly through increased mortgage payments or longer repayment times so that many will never pay off their mortgage and go further and further into debt unless interest rates fall substantially.</PARA>
<PARA> Now, therefore, your petitioners request that the Senate in Parliament assembled require the Hawke-Keating government to cease its excessive reliance on high interest rates as its major economic policy weapon and instead to use other measures which would allow interest rates to return to levels that do not force most Australian home-seekers out of the housing market-and many Australians out of their homes-so that the traditional right of home ownership is returned to average Australian families.</PARA>

<PARA> The petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth:</PARA>
<PARA> That your petitioners are offended and outraged by the direction of the AIDS Programme in Tasmania, in that it actively promotes Homosexual Acts and in particular anal intercourse, and that taxpayers money is being used to fund literature which directly promotes homosexual behaviour as a normal and desirable human activity.</PARA>
<PARA> Your petitioners therefore urgently and strongly request that the Federal Government and the Minister for Health review the National AIDS Programme and withdraw funding for this literature, and from any other aspects of the AIDS Campaign which encourages or condones anal intercourse.</PARA>

<PARA> (i) that on Friday, 31 March 1989, the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) officially opened the new RAAF Base at Tindal in the Northern Territory,</PARA>
<PARA> (ii) that this $230 million base will house a squadron of 12 top-class F-18 Hornet fighters,</PARA>

<PARA> (iv) that this is symptomatic of the overall drain of experience from the RAAF which, according to Wing Commander Fox, will take `years and years' of training to remedy, and</PARA>
<PARA> (v) that 73 pilots have already quit the RAAF this financial year, and more have indicated their intention to leave;</PARA>

<PARA> That the Senate-</PARA>
<PARA> (a) notes that the Chief District Forester of the Bega region, Tony Howe, publicly admitted on ABC radio on 20 March 1989 and on Channel 10 on 28 March 1989 that pulpwood for woodchips was being extracted from Coolangubra, which is listed on the interim register of the National Estate;</PARA>
<PARA> (b) notes that, if this is true, then Harris-Daishowa is breaching a condition of its licence agreement, section 6c, which prohibits it from extracting pulpwood from areas listed on the interim register;</PARA>
<PARA> (c) notes, further, that, in view of the above, the Forestry Commission either knew about the breach and did nothing about it or was entirely ignorant of the conditions of the licence and therefore is incompetent to deal with the management of the forests under its care;</PARA>
<PARA> (d) urges the Australian Government immediately to revoke the licence of Harris-Daishowa, or at the very least to attach stringent environmental conditions to the licence;</PARA>
<PARA> (e) notes that the South Coast Trades and Labor Council reaffirmed its opposition to woodchipping not only because it destroys the environment but also because it destroys the resources which are the basis of a value-added timber industry, and calls for a regional economic development package to coincide with a phasing out of the woodchip industry; and</PARA>
<PARA> (f) reminds the Government that the hardwood forests of the southeastern corner of New South Wales are a fast-diminishing national resource which belong to all Australians, present and future, and that if the woodchip licence is renewed, this will represent a loss of 530 000 tonnes per annum from the State's forests for the next 15 years, an area equivalent to 75 000 hectares.</PARA>

<PARA> (c) notes that there is no relief in sight from these high interest rates for homebuyers because the economy is badly overheated and the Government continues to sit on its hands rather than implement microeconomic reform.</PARA>

<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The speech read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA> Mr President, the main purpose of this Bill is to give effect to elements of the Government's Master Plan for Passenger Processing as they relate to the Migration Amendment Act (No. 2) 1988 which, as I will explain, cannot be proclaimed in its present form for some time. </PARA>
<PARA> Section 6aa of that Act was intended to implement part of the Master Plan by allowing any visa, issued after the commencement of that provision where a person enters Australia in certain circumstances, to operate as an entry permit upon that person's entry. The Act was to be proclaimed when the computer support systems for such visas were in place. </PARA>
<PARA> The computerisation of visa issue is now in place at most, including the major, overseas posts; however, some posts are not yet so equipped and will remain so in the near future. Given the pivotal role of electronic records and systems in my Department's task of processing passengers for entry to Australia, it is necessary to take full advantage of the computer technology already installed at overseas posts at considerable cost. </PARA>
<PARA> As section 6aa currently refers to all visas issued after its commencement, the Act cannot be proclaimed and the procedural and administrative benefits to be conferred by it are not available in relation to a large number of visas which could otherwise be operating in accordance with section 6aa. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr President, for these reasons this Bill is essential from an administrative point of view in order to amend the Act so that section 6aa may be proclaimed and thus brought into operation immediately. I commend the Bill to the Senate.</PARA>

<PARA> That this Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>I seek leave to incorporate my second reading speech in Hansard. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The speech read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA> Mr President, the Bill gives legislative effect to a number of the major policy changes which I announced in this chamber on 8 December last year. These changes flow from the review of immigration undertaken last year by the Committee to Advise on Australia's Immigration Policies under the chairmanship of Dr Stephen FitzGerald, the intensive analysis of policy options which followed the tabling of the Committee's report on 3 June, and the wide-ranging community consultations which also took place. </PARA>
<PARA> Before I address the Bill in detail I would like to give Senators a broad overview of it. There are three major features of this Bill. The first is a radically revised approach to immigration decision-making. Currently the Minister for this portfolio has decision-making discretions which are totally unfettered. That is, the migration legislative scheme is essentially machinery legislation. It gives the Minister in this portfolio power to determine who can enter Australia and who must leave. There is no provision in this scheme for Parliamentary guidance of the exercise of the power. A Minister can make decisions on these matters virtually at his or her discretion. Thus, legally, a Minister has the power to determine and change policy in the immigration field as he or she wishes independent of the Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> Further, unlike any comparable area of administration, the decision-making powers conferred by the Act are vested in the Minister. The Minister thus has the power to reverse any decision made by an officer of the Department. This in turn can result in a Minister becoming involved in the minutiae of the portfolio, at the cost of developing overall policy in the depth which, in my view, is essential. </PARA>
<PARA> The wide discretionary powers conferred by the Migration Act have long been a source of public criticism. Decision-making guidelines are perceived to be obscure, arbitrarily changed and applied, and subject to day-to-day political intervention in individual cases. </PARA>
<PARA> Accordingly I am proposing in this Bill a decision-making system in which policies governing entry to and stay in Australia will, for the first time, be spelt out in the migration legislative scheme. Parliament, then, through its powers of disallowance will be able to monitor those policies. I am also vesting most of the decision-making powers currently conferred on me in the Secretary of the Department. </PARA>
<PARA> The second major feature of the Bill is the introduction of a new two-tier review system. There has been dissatisfaction with the former review system, with the end result that in some instances, a number of applicants have considered that the only way they can gain an independent review of their case is to pursue judicial review. I have therefore proposed in the Bill a two-tier review system. The first tier will be review by specialist officers of the Department, specifically authorised and guaranteed independent by legislation to undertake this task. Applicants dissatisfied with a decision by that tier will be able to appeal to a second tier of review. This tier will be a statutorily based independent review body: the Immigration Review Tribunal. I am confident that this proposal will not only ensure independent review, but will be fair, economical, informal and quick. Thus, applicants will be the main beneficiaries of this new system. </PARA>
<PARA> The third major feature of the Bill is that it spells out mechanisms for ensuring that planned immigration program intakes are not exceeded. Senators will understand that though the rights and entitlements of the individual must be protected, it is equally important that the restrictions which have to be imposed on the overall numbers and categories of people entering Australia in the public interest, also be spelt out in the regulations. In this way the Government will be able to balance the entry requirements against the overall planned intake levels and quickly correct any unforeseen fluctuations. </PARA>
<PARA> Other significant features of the Bill include provisions for shifting the cost of detention and deportation onto the offender, and for making commercial immigration advisers accountable to their clients. Let me now address the main features of the new decision-making regime in more detail. Under current legislation, the issue of visas and entry permits is governed by a wide discretionary power. Guidelines governing the exercise of this power are set out in policy and are scattered through Departmental instructions. As these guidelines are policy rules they are not binding in law upon the decision-maker. This uncertainty can be both unsettling for the applicant and disruptive of the efficient management of the immigration program. </PARA>
<PARA> My approach to resolving these problems consists of two basic steps. First I have made provision in the Bill for listing in regulation the various classes of visas and entry permits used in controlling the flow of people into Australia. For the information of Senators I am tabling a provisional list of the visa classes to be included in the regulations. A corresponding list of classes of entry permits will also be included in the regulations. I should emphasise that the list of visa classes is simply a list of the various categories of visas which are currently in use by the Department. Senators will see from the list that it simply describes the various categories of people coming to Australia, for example, aged parents, skilled workers, entertainers and so on. </PARA>
<PARA> The second step is to spell out in regulation the decision-making criteria which apply to each of these classes of visas and entry permits. For example the regulations will say who may enter Australia as an aged parent, who may enter as a brother, as a skilled worker, and so on. This means that both the rights and entitlements of the individual, and the necessary public interest restrictions on entry will be clearly stated in the legislative scheme. </PARA>
<PARA> It is true that the regulations determining who can enter and stay in Australia for each visa and entry permit class have not been drawn up. I am planning, however, to have the regulations governing many of the major classes drawn up by the time this Bill is proclaimed. Senators will see from the provisional list of visa classes I have tabled, the order of priority I have decided upon. </PARA>
<PARA> I should emphasise that in drawing up these regulations I intend to reflect only current Government policy, which in turn reflects the Government's public response to the CAAIP Report, and the extensive community consultations which took place. In presenting this Bill I am not, therefore, asking for a ``blank cheque'' to place new policies into regulations, but a legislative base on which to order and rationalise existing policies. </PARA>
<PARA> Senators will be aware that given the scope, the complexity and the inter-relationships of immigration rules, translating them into regulation will be an extremely lengthy process: in part this will reflect the fact that the approach is a completely novel one, and will involve the development of new skills and processes. Accordingly it will take up to 18 months to complete regulations for all classes of decisions. </PARA>
<PARA> I decided therefore that in order to accelerate the process, I would put the Bill forward at this stage to obtain legislative backing to what is a fundamental re-thinking of the administration of the Migration Act. My intention is, given that legislative backing, to draw up regulations for the major classes of decision as a matter of urgency, so that these can be implemented and have the force of law as soon as possible, rather than wait for every minor issue to be resolved. </PARA>
<PARA> Accordingly when the Bill is proclaimed, there will still be some gaps in the policy criteria as set out in the regulations. These areas will continue to be discretionary until policy criteria for these areas can be incorporated into regulation. </PARA>
<PARA> It is also the Government's intention that should there be a need to make a change in policy direction, there be public debate on that matter before it is mirrored in legislation. The Government will, of course, continue to hold its wide-ranging discussions each year prior to determining the size and the composition of the annual intake. </PARA>
<PARA> It has been suggested that the criteria for decision-making should be built into this Bill. I make two points. First, as I have already pointed out you would have to wait a very long time before legislation could be introduced. Second, the important difference is not whether decision-making criteria are in the Bill or in regulations. It is that legislation will replace the current system of ad hoc policy making. This will, as I said earlier, give Parliament the involvement hitherto denied it. </PARA>
<PARA> I have also heard many arguments that Ministerial discretion should be retained in all cases. In the final analysis, these arguments are little more than a plea for special treatment. Hundreds of thousands of decisions are taken within the immigration jurisdiction each year. Of these, the Minister can only decide a tiny fraction personally. My concern is to ensure equity and consistency in decision-making. I believe this is best done where a Minister concentrates on determining overall policy directions, and limits decision-making to those classes impacting most on national well-being. </PARA>
<PARA> The second major element in the new decision-making regime is the introduction of an independent two-tier system of review of decisions. Although there has been a formal mechanism for the review of immigration decisions since 1982, its basis has been administrative, not legislative and its powers only recommendatory. The doubts recently raised about the authority to collect fees for such review have demonstrated the frailties of an administratively based system. Further, the absence of a demonstrably independent system of review, drawing its powers from statute, has led as I said initially, to dissatisfied applicants pursuing the costly and lengthy route of judicial review. </PARA>
<PARA> The system of review developed in the Bill is designed to provide a mechanism that is fair, economical, informal and quick. First-tier review will be by specially appointed review officers within the Department. The Bill provides that they should operate as a discrete and independent unit and not be subject to direction on individual decisions. Review officers will not be limited to an examination of cases on the papers, and communication of the basis of unfavourable decisions to clients will be an important aspect of their role. </PARA>
<PARA> Second-tier review will be by a statutory body within the immigration portfolio, to be known as the Immigration Review Tribunal. Its members will be appointed by the Governor-General and it will have its own administrative infrastructure, unlike the current Immigration Review Panels. </PARA>
<PARA> Informality and the absence of legalism will be the key to the Tribunal's operations. It is designed to permit claimants to put the merits of their case in a factual and straightforward way, without the need for formal representation. The means of achieving this is the non-adversarial structure for case determination. The Department will not be represented at the hearing of the case, unless called as a witness by the Tribunal. The matter to be resolved is between the claimant, and the Tribunal as decision-maker, bound by legislation and guided by policy. </PARA>
<PARA> The Immigration Review Tribunal will work broadly as follows: First it will examine the papers relating to a case, namely the material put forward by the applicant and the material prepared in the course of the primary decision and the first-tier review processes. If the Tribunal can make a decision favourable to the applicant on that material, it will do so, and that will be an end to the matter. If, however, the Tribunal cannot make such a decision on the papers, then it will invite the applicant to give oral evidence before it makes a final decision on the appeal. In these circumstances applicants may be accompanied by an advisor, for example a friend or their solicitor. This adviser will not, however, be able orally to address the Tribunal on behalf of the applicant. </PARA>
<PARA> The jurisdiction of the new two-tier system will extend to certain classes of decision prescribed in regulations and will be phased in as regulations setting out detailed decision-making criteria are introduced. Broadly speaking the people who will be able to appeal under the new two-tier system will be the same categories of people who could have appealed to the Immigration Review Panel. </PARA>
<PARA> There is provision in the Bill for the regulations to specify whether the Tribunal should have determinative or recommendatory powers in relation to a particular class of decision. Review will, however, normally be determinative, and I have no intention at this stage of prescribing any categories of decisions for which the Tribunal will only have recommendatory powers. The recommendatory powers have been introduced only to allow for the possibility that in the future, criminal deportation decisions which are recommendatory may be transferred from the Administrative Appeals Tribunal to the Immigration Review Tribunal. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill also provides for the Minister to declare a decision non-reviewable if a change in the decision would prejudice the security, defence or international relations of Australia, or if reviewing it would require consideration of deliberations or decisions of the Cabinet or a committee of Cabinet. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister may also over-ride a decision of the Tribunal. This power may only be exercised, however, in cases where the Minister wishes to substitute a more favourable decision. Further, where the power is exercised, the Minister must provide a detailed statement to Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill includes a specific provision for the early setting up of the Immigration Review Tribunal. It is my intention that these particular provisions will come into effect around the beginning of September ahead of the rest of the Bill. Accordingly members of the Tribunal can be appointed, procedures developed, training of members in immigration policies and procedures undertaken, and so on, well in advance of the rest of the Bill being proclaimed. This means that as soon as the Bill is proclaimed the new review system can come into operation immediately. </PARA>
<PARA> I propose that the fee for application for review by the second tier, the Immigration Review Tribunal, shall be no more than that levied by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal, while the fee for the first tier, the statutory independent units in the Department, will be less than that. </PARA>
<PARA> Immigration is an unusual jurisdiction in that delay in decision-making can work to the advantage of the applicant, at least where the applicant is already in Australia. Delay is compounded where the same matter is repeatedly reopened through fresh applications, reviews and appeals. The new review system proposed in the Bill aims to ensure that cases are resolved fairly and speedily. It provides that once a decision is taken, and where relevant reviewed, the applicant should leave Australia within a set period. After the case is determined, a further application may only be made where the circumstances of the person have changed significantly. A decision on any such further application will not be reviewable. If the person fails to leave within the period provided, the Secretary would be required to issue a deportation order. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill provides for mandatory deportation for the following reason. The central issue in relation to a person is whether they have any claim to remain in Australia. This issue will have already been tested in the decision-making and review processes. No fresh decision on any claims to remain in Australia is therefore required. All that is at issue is the simple question of fact: has the decision process been completed and has the statutory period for voluntary departure expired. </PARA>
<PARA> The second major feature of the Bill is its mechanisms for ensuring that immigration objectives are achieved in an orderly manner. Individual immigration decisions must be taken in a fair, consistent and accountable manner. At the same time, we should not lose sight of the fact that these decisions are simply the component elements of an overall program designed to serve national objectives. </PARA>
<PARA> International law recognises the sovereign right of nations to determine who may enter and remain within their territory. Australia cannot simply open its doors to all those who wish to enter, either temporarily or permanently. The Government has an obligation to the Australian people to have regard to the domestic labour market, public health and safety, and the capacity of the economy to provide adequately for the needs of the population. While Australia has a vigorous immigration program, annual intakes must be kept within planning figures, and the profile of those selected as immigrants and temporary entrants should conform with program objectives. </PARA>
<PARA> Demand within the immigration program far exceeds the number of available places. There are well in excess of one million enquiries annually whereas this year's program for permanent entry provides only 140,000 places. </PARA>
<PARA> The case in relation to temporary entry is rather different. Here, demand is normally actively encouraged. Australia's vigorous marketing of tourism, and of education and health services are examples. However even in this area, demand in certain categories may become problematic where numbers are out of step with other national objectives. </PARA>
<PARA> Effective management of intake levels is essential to ensure planned program outcomes are not exceeded. Governments have traditionally relied on their ability to turn the tap on and off. The alternative is an immigration program out of control. The Bill also addresses this management issue. It includes a provision to suspend receipt and processing of applications in any class until a nominated date. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill also provides for the application of a competitive points test in the selection of some classes of permanent entrants. To contain demand for entry in each class subject to the points test, a floating passmark will be used to select only those applicants scoring the highest points related to the number of available places. </PARA>
<PARA> The system will operate as follows. Applicants in the points-tested visa classes will be scored against set criteria. Depending on the mark achieved, applicants will be treated in one of four ways. If they achieve a sufficiently high score, referred to as the priority mark, they will move on to the next stage of processing. If they achieve a lower mark, referred to as the pool entry mark, they will be placed in a pool for further consideration against a variable passmark, determined on the basis of the number of available places and the marks of applicants in the pool. If they fail to reach this passmark, their applications may be rolled over for reconsideration when the mark is next varied. Applicants who fail to meet the pool entry mark will be rejected immediately. The various marks may be altered from time to time by gazettal. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill also provides for the operation of this selection system to applicants for prescribed classes of entry permits. Where the system is used for applicants in Australia, there will be no pooling system and no rolling over of applicants within the pool. Rather, an applicant who fails to achieve the priority mark will be rejected outright. This approach is necessary in order to avoid delays in processing within Australia and the manipulation of the system by persons simply seeking to engineer a protracted stay. </PARA>
<PARA> I should now like to provide Senators with some explanatory background for the other provisions of the Bill which I mentioned at the beginning of this speech. </PARA>
<PARA> A feature of the Bill which I mentioned at the outset was the provision in relation to compliance with the requirements of immigration legislation. The detention and deportation of prohibited non-citizens, renamed in the Bill as illegal entrants, is at considerable cost to the taxpayer. Often detainees and deportees have been working illegally in Australia, and have accumulated considerable assets. The Bill provides for freezing the assets of a deportee, within a framework of adequate protection to the individual. Provision is made, naturally, for people to retain sufficient funds for basic living costs and legal expenses. </PARA>
<PARA> Where a person is deported, the Commonwealth can recoup the costs of detention and deportation from the person's assets. This will improve debt recovery and help defray the cost of detention by producing revenue estimated at $0.2 million in a full year. The Bill also prohibits the subsequent issue of a visa at any stage to a person deported unless that person has met or has made satisfactory arrangement to meet any outstanding debt to the Commonwealth. </PARA>
<PARA> Another important provision of the Bill is that relating to persons providing immigration advice for a fee. This is a burgeoning enterprise, where clients are susceptible to inflated charges and false claims of influence. The current legislation simply requires the notification of an intention to act as a migration agent. These provisions are outdated and the Bill provides for their repeal. The Bill substitutes provisions whereby the operation of persons providing advice for a fee will be governed by sanctions aimed to ensure a responsible commercial relationship. Advisers will be committing an offence where they claim they can influence or have influenced the making of a certain decision, either in their own right or through a third person. The Bill also requires advisers to provide a detailed statement of account. Where the adviser has made false claims, or failed to furnish an account, no fee is due.</PARA>
<PARA> Mr President, the Bill also addresses other initiatives I announced on 8 December last year in response to the report of the Committee to Advise on Australia's Immigration Policies. Among those are the balance of family test which applies to some parents; tighter provisions for the assurance of support; and the release of illegal entrants on bonds which would be forfeited in the event of non-compliance with their conditions. The existing provisions for the grant of resident status to people temporarily in Australia are to be strengthened by requiring applicants on the basis of marriage, being the dependent child or aged parent of a citizen a resident, to be holders of a valid temporary entry permit. </PARA>
<PARA> Other provisions of the Bill will allow for the search of persons at entry about whom there is a reasonable suspicion that they will on or after entry become an illegal entrant or will breach a condition of entry, or otherwise where a person has been arrested or taken into custody pursuant to the Act. The purpose of the search is to ascertain if the person is carrying a concealed weapon or documents material to their status. Section 16 of the Act will be amended to remove existing doubts as to whether the `intention' of persons deceiving officers must be proven. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill also contains a general provision for the charging of fees. The Government has accepted the user-pay principle where it is more fitting that the user, rather than the taxpayer, bear the cost of a particular service. Fees are set according to the cost of the service, and often are well below the true cost. Fees would only be charged in relation to specific services and processing activities, such as application, sponsorship, assurance of support, and each tier of review. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government will not be amending section 36a of the Act which allows for undocumented arrivals to be deemed not to have entered Australia. Removing this provision, which halts refugee claimants at Australia's frontier would, on the experience of other countries such as Canada, the Federal Republic of Germany and Switzerland, attract to Australia tens of thousands of frontier claimants, many of them dubious-and thereby effectively shift our major refugee effort from overseas to onshore. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr President, the Bill contains many other detailed provisions which I do not have sufficient time to outline. These are set out in the explanatory memorandum which has been prepared to accompany the Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, Mr President, this Bill represents, as I have already said, a fundamental change to the administration of the Migration Act. This change in turn represents the most significant review of immigration policy and procedures taken over the past decade. </PARA>
<PARA> It is clear that the approach to the determination and expression of policy, to the reviewing of decisions, and to the overall determination and control of the size and composition of the entry of people into Australia, particularly the migrant intake, which flows from the present migration legislative scheme is no longer appropriate. The current legislative scheme reflects an era when the overall numbers of people entering Australia were far smaller than they are today, when the rights of individuals were not protected by administrative law, and the general administration of the Migration Act and the formulation of policy reflected the unfettered nature of the decision-making powers conferred by the Act. </PARA>
<PARA> Developments in administrative law and the need to control the flow of people into Australia in accordance with overall economic and social policies, have led to costly tensions between these objectives and the current legislative scheme. And as I pointed out, the vesting of the decision-making power in the Minister can result in the Minister becoming bogged down in individual cases, rather than concentrating his or her efforts on the development of broad policy. </PARA>
<PARA> This Bill resolves these tensions, and, further, gives Parliament power to monitor the changes in policy direction which inevitably emerge from day-to-day administration of the Migration Act. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill is a package and its constituent elements are closely integrated. If this total package is not adopted, then the Government would be faced with the piecemeal introduction of some of its provisions. The end result would be that the current situation would simply continue. This is unsatisfactory from the point of view of those affected directly by the operation of the Act, and from the point of view of determining policy and protecting the wider public interest. I commend the Bill to the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA> The speech read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA>The Student Assistance Amendment Bill seeks to make a number of minor changes to the Student Assistance Act 1973. This Act provides the legislative basis for AUSTUDY and the post-graduate awards scheme. </PARA>
<PARA>The Bill will replace the expressions ``advanced education institution'' and ``university'' with references to ``higher education institution''. This reflects the Government's decision to abolish the binary system of funding higher education. </PARA>
<PARA>The Bill will repeal the requirement that departmental assessors under the Act, referred to as ``authorised persons'', be ministerially appointed. This requirement gives unnecessary administrative complexity to the appointment of over 300 officers, very few of whom are at senior level. The Bill proposes instead that authorised persons be identified as officers whose departmental duties include making decisions on AUSTUDY or postgraduate awards. </PARA>
<PARA>The Bill seeks to modify the appeal procedures under the Student Assistance Act. It will remove restrictions on students authorising someone else to act on their behalf in seeking a review of a departmental decision. It will also permit students to expedite their appeals to the Student Assistance Review Tribunal by waiving their right to receive background papers at least 14 days before the hearing. </PARA>
<PARA>The Bill will extend the Act's recovery and waiver/write off provisions to apply to charges incurred because of delays in repaying student assistance overpayments. This would mean that such amounts are treated in the same way as the overpayment that led to the charge being incurred. </PARA>
<PARA>Finally, the Bill will make some drafting changes to the provisions of the Act relating to AUSTUDY. These changes will enable the regulations made under the Act to be redrafted in a simpler manner. The Government appreciates the concern that has been expressed on occasions about the complexity of the AUSTUDY rules. We are looking at ways of simplifying the regulations to make them more accessible to students, student counsellors and the community in general. </PARA>

<PARA>I seek leave to have the second reading speech incorporated in Hansard. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The speech read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA> This bill proposes to amend the Customs Tariff (Uranium Concentrate Export Duty) Act 1980, to incorporate into that Act the tariff proposal tabled in the House of Representatives on 23 August 1988, as part of the 1988-89 Budget. </PARA>
<PARA> That proposal, which increased the export duty on uranium concentrate produced in the Alligator Rivers region in the Northern Territory region from $1.02 to $1.15 as from 23 August 1988, is incorporated in clause 3 of the Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> Clause 4 of the Bill provides an exemption from the increased levy where uranium concentrate was loaded on to a vessel, or was part of a consignment, the loading of which was commenced prior to the 23 August 1988 commencement of the Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> The levy, which applies only to exports of uranium concentrate produced in the Alligator Rivers region of the Northern Territory, is imposed to partially offset the special costs of environmental monitoring and research activities undertaken by the Commonwealth to protect the Alligator Rivers region. The increase in the level of the levy reflects the Government's position that the costs associated with protecting the environment from the potential adverse effects of uranium mining should be borne as far as is practicable by the industry carrying out those operations, and not the ordinary taxpayer. </PARA>
<PARA> Successive Governments throughout the 1980's have recognised that the Alligator Rivers region, which includes Kakadu National Park, requires special measures to ensure that its sensitive environment receives adequate protection from the possible adverse effects of uranium mining. </PARA>
<PARA> The significance of the Alligator Rivers region should not be underestimated-those parts of the area within Kakadu National Park stages 1 and 2 have received international recognition by being placed on the world heritage list. Australia has specific obligations under the world heritage convention to ensure these areas are not degraded. </PARA>
<PARA> The Commonwealth's contribution to the protection of the Alligator Rivers region is through the operation and research undertaken by the Office of the Supervising Scientist, and other Commonwealth agencies, and by providing funds for the provision of services by agencies of the Northern Territory Government on behalf of the Commonwealth. </PARA>
<PARA> The services provided by the Northern Territory on behalf of the Commonwealth include the application of national codes of practice relevant to nuclear materials, safety, health and mining regulations and environmental monitoring. The costs of these services are offset by contributions from the Commonwealth in the annual revenue grant to the Northern Territory Government. </PARA>
<PARA>The Supervising Scientist's research program has continued to make significant and innovative progress in the fields of geomorphology, aquatic biology, environmental modelling and environmental physics. The detailed development of a set of biological toxicity testing protocols represents an important advance in the environmental control of waste water release. Field trials continue on the design of residual structures important in safe rehabilitation on long lived hazards such as tailings containments. OSS research has enabled scientists to distinguish between certain types of radioactivity that are derived from a uranium mine from those arising from the general background environment. Site-specific mathematical and computer techniques have been developed that will enable prediction of the extent of possible flooding of parts of the Ranger mine site. </PARA>
<PARA>The Government's continued commitment to the Alligator Rivers region will ensure that the natural beauty of the region, and the Kakadu National Park, remain for the enjoyment of generations of Australians in the future. </PARA>
<PARA>Financial Impact Statement</PARA>
<PARA>The proposed increased duty is expected to raise an additional $0.8 million during 1988-89. </PARA>
<PARA>Based on current projected imports the levy in total will recover $4.5 million during the 1988-89 financial year, although yearly fluctuations in exports will cause the total amount raised by the levy to vary. </PARA>

<PARA> That the following matter be referred to the Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs for inquiry and report by the last sitting day of 1989: The extent and nature of any practice among banks which does or may contravene the fundamental fiduciary duty of banker to client. </PARA>
<PARA>Translated into layman's terms, I intend, by this motion, to refer to the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs the allegation that in many ways banks are excessively placing their own interests first. This has given rise to a crisis in respect of confidence concerning banking. It urgently warrants parliamentary and government attention. Reducing it even more to its fundamentals, this motion asks the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs to look at banks in Australia in 1989. Honourable senators will know that I bring this motion before the Senate as a result of considerable discussion and deliberation and presentation of materials to the Senate over the last six months. It has led me to the point at which I believe that a full-scale Senate inquiry into banking in Australia is warranted. </PARA>
<PARA> At the time that I was elected to the Senate 18 months ago as an Australian Democrats senator for New South Wales I was very clear on what my role in this place was. I had been thoroughly briefed by my predecessors that it was to keep the bastards honest. The only thing I was not clear about was how many there are. They are everywhere. It is in the spirit of that charter of keeping them honest that I place this proposal before the Senate this morning. I am disappointed, to say the least, to anticipate that it will be defeated by the combined vote of the Opposition and the Government. I emphasise that it is a simple proposal to place, in the public interest, before a parliamentary committee for thorough investigation, an issue of a crisis in respect of confidence in banking. As I say, I anticipate that it will be opposed by the combined vote of the Government and the Opposition. </PARA>
<PARA> I was moved to put this proposal before the Senate because approximately six months ago a constituent approached me with two extremely serious allegations, namely, that corrupt practices were widespread in one of Australia's banks. That allegation brought to me on that occasion related specifically to the Commonwealth Bank of Australia. The allegation was that corrupt practices were widespread through the Commonwealth Bank of Australia. The second aspect of the allegation, was that these matters had been well known to the Australian Federal Police for some years and that the AFP, to use an expression that I have used previously, had failed in its duty in this matter. Quite obviously, these are extremely serious allegations. </PARA>
<PARA> I deliberated over them for approximately six weeks. I examined the evidence that had been brought to me by the constituents who made these allegations. I took legal advice; I consulted with my colleagues. The first thing I did was to seek in early December 1988, by a confidential memo to the Minister for Justice (Senator Tate), a briefing on these matters by the Australian Federal Police. I said, `Minister, I have got these allegations before me. Please can I be briefed on these matters by you and the Australian Federal Police?'. The memo was not even replied to, so I followed up with a verbal request for a briefing, which was denied. The briefing was denied on the ground that certain investigations were current. That tended to confirm the first of the allegations that there were before the Federal Police some allegations of corrupt practices within the Commonwealth Bank. That was cited as the reason for my not being briefed about it. This was in December 1988. </PARA>
<PARA> I made my first statement and revealed these allegations to the Senate on 8 December 1988 because I was unable to pursue the matter privately and satisfactorily with the Minister. I asked a series of questions of the Minister for Justice, Senator Tate. Frankly, I found his responses to those questions unacceptable. They tended to reinforce my doubts, and I had better explain why I found them unacceptable. One of the questions I asked the Minister was whether he was aware of serious allegations concerning corruption and malpractices in the Commonwealth Bank. In responding to that question, the Minister said that the Australian Federal Police had informed him that there was one such allegation and that he had been informed of that in April 1988. </PARA>
<PARA> I had in my possession a letter on the letterhead of the 60 Minutes program, signed by the program's producer. I was briefed to the effect that the program had a substantial file on these allegations. The allegations involved 32 senior officers of the Commonwealth Bank, including its former Managing Director. They were serious allegations. They obviously attracted my attention, and the attention of the 60 Minutes program, which had assembled a lot of information but had been advised legally not to proceed unless it had the protection of certain documents which it sought under the Freedom of Information Act. It sought those documents from the Australian Federal Police.</PARA>
<PARA> Seven months latter the police replied that they had investigated whether such documents existed and whether they were relevant to these allegations. They said they had identified 149 pages of documents, 40 of which they judged to be directly relevant to the allegations directed at 32 senior officers of the Commonwealth Bank, but they refused to provide them with the exception of half a page. They quoted the reasons why they refused to release them. One reason was that they might be embarrassing to overseas countries. Indeed, they must have been very embarrassing documents if the police were able to exempt themselves from providing them to the producers of the 60 Minutes program on the grounds that they were documents of considerable potential embarrassment to overseas governments and, presumably, therefore, to the Australian Government. So the program was denied access to those documents. </PARA>
<PARA> In the briefing to the Minister for Justice they told him that there had been one allegation about corrupt practice in April 1988 but they did not tell him that there had been allegations directed at 32 senior officers, including the former Managing Director of the Commonwealth Bank, and that they had assembled 149 pages, 40 of which were relevant. In my judgment, that has to be an example of partial and inadequate briefing to the responsible Minister. It tended to confirm the second of the allegations that had been placed before me-namely, that the Australian Federal Police had been less than diligent in the pursuit of these matters. The expression that had been used to me was that there was a cover-up on. They are not my words; that is the expression that had been used to me, and this was the reaction to legitimate questions. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am coming to that question of gullibility, or credibility of documents. I had sought a briefing from the Federal Police and had been denied it. I had asked questions of the Minister for Justice and got answers that I found unsatisfactory. I tabled in the Senate the copy of the 60 Minutes letter and the response from the Federal Police. I do not know whether honourable senators have looked at it. In a series of subsequent questions I asked the Minister whether he believed that he had been adequately briefed and he said yes. On 15 December I made a second statement to the Senate. I posed further questions to the Minister. I tabled six affidavits-including the ones I have just referred to, relating to allegations of corrupt practices with in the Commonwealth Bank-in relation to seven cases.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Quite predictably, the allegations were denied by the Managing Director of the Commonwealth Bank, Mr Don Sanders. Frankly, I was not surprised that they were denied. He told me-and I use Mr Sanders's words-that he was surprised by my allegations. He was bewildered by them. I said to Mr Sanders that I was surprised by his surprise, for the simple reason that surely his legal officers would have told him at that time, that very day in the Supreme Court of New South Wales, there were at least three cases running on civil action against the Commonwealth Bank and I knew there were other cases running in other supreme courts around Australia, and if his legal officers had not told him about that, he, like the Minister, was only partially briefed. If his legal officers had not told him that in the previous year the Federal Police had identified 149 pages of documents, some of which were directed at allegations about his predecessor, the Managing Director of the Commonwealth Bank of Australia, he was, like the Minister grossly inadequately briefed. Frankly, I found it extremely difficult to accept as a fact that he found these allegations bewildering and that he was surprised by them, I believe that his dismissal of the allegations, although predictable, was unacceptable.</PARA>
<PARA> As a result of the tabling of these affidavits, between 15 December and 2 March, over the Christmas break, my office had literally thousands of phone calls. I am not exaggerating. I now have 150 cases that I consider to be credible. Senator Stone may not judge them as credible but I have made my judgments about them. I consider them to be credible cases of people who say that their banks have treated them very badly and abandoned the fiduciary relationship, the fundamental relationship of law that says that banks should consider the interests of the client to be at least equal to the interest of the bank. I have 150 such cases. I have tabled 27 of them in the Senate. They are a sample only. They range from millionaires to battlers, and they range across all the major banks in Australia. This flood of responses has led me to the conclusion that we have a major problem that should looked at by a Senate committee. That is what has led me today to propose that the Senate committee look into this matter. </PARA>
<PARA> Not only have I tabled the 27 affidavits in relation to 33 sample cases but also I am not exaggerating when I say that I have discussed this matter with hundreds of people, either on the phone or face to face. I have discussed it with lawyers, Queen's Counsel, journalists, bank managers, and ex-bank managers. I am utterly convinced that there is a problem of major proportions within banking in Australia which certainly warrants the reference of the question to the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs. It comes down to a general position of a dramatic shift in the ethos of banking in Australia in the last five to 10 years. Since deregulation in 1984 there has been intensification in competition between banks. Banks have become profit oriented; they have become oriented towards their own interests and less towards the interests of their clients. There has been a serious erosion of the fiduciary relationship and it has reached crisis proportions. Even if the Senate does not accept it today, the community knows that there is a crisis of confidence about banking. It will address itself to this crisis in other ways when this proposal is defeated by the combined vote of the Opposition and the Government today. The community will know who is pursuing its interests on this matter both inside and outside the Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> As I said, there were totally predictable denials by Mr Sanders and Mr Allen Cullen, the executive officer of the Australian Bankers Association, but they were superficial. It is not good enough for Mr Cullen to say that banks are squeaky clean and that there is no corruption in banking. That is as credible as my saying that there is no corruption in politics; it is as credible as police commissioners saying that there is no corruption in the police force. There has been corruption in banking since the invention of the shekel 5,000 years ago, and since the invention of commerce. Banks are about money; corruption is about money. Corruption in banking is inevitable; it is merely a question of degree, it is a question of whether we focus on it and it is a question of whether we see it as a major national crisis. </PARA>
<PARA> As I said, I have had discussions with the Minister on this question. When I proposed that the whole matter go to a Senate standing committee, the Minister said, `Give me more time so I can take it to Caucus'. I did that. It was to be debated on 3 March; it is now 5 April. The extra time has been given. Presumably, it has gone to Caucus. If it has not, it is not my fault. I presume it has gone to the Caucus; the Caucus has seriously considered this proposition and decided against it for its own reasons. Its reasons are obvious because of what the Minister for Social Security (Mr Howe) has done in recent days. He has put the welfare of banks before the welfare of social security pensioners in this country. I will come to that point in a moment. The Government has its own agenda about banking and presumably the Opposition has its own agenda about banking. </PARA>
<PARA> I briefed Mr Andrew Peacock in the presence of Senator Messner, who will defend the Opposition's position in a moment. I have no doubt that he took it seriously. He told me that he would have access to all the affidavits that I had tabled, yet I am led to believe that yesterday in the party room his argument was that the Opposition could not interfere in this process because some of these matters were before courts. Of course, they are before courts. There will always be conflicts between clients and banks before courts. If we wait for that to stop before we perform our duties as members of parliament, we will be here until the end of time. The fact is that I was approached by people whose matters are before the courts. I said, `Have you discussed this with your lawyer?' and they said, `Yes'. I did not table their affidavits until I was certain that they had discussed it with their lawyers. Their lawyers believe that it will not interfere with the pursuit of their matters before the courts. The fact is that the banks win in courts. Banks have unlimited resources and access to the best legal minds, and they settle out of court before they even get to the court if there is anything of significance to be said. So that is a spurious rejection by Mr Peacock. It is just meaningless. It is grasping at straws. The Opposition will do anything to not have to take on the banks. </PARA>
<PARA> I had long discussions yesterday with Mr Allen Cullen and senior representatives of banking. They said, `But Senator McLean, did you investigate these matters that came before you?'. What more can I do with the limited resources that I have got than to talk to hundreds of people, to accept a thousand phone calls, to go through mountains of documents and to accept affidavits on oath? Do they really expect me to tell my constituents, when they come in prepared to swear something to me and to ask me to table it in the Parliament and put it before a Senate standing committee, `I do not believe you'? Do I begin from the fundamental assumption that people are lying to me when they swear on oath? Of course, that is a ridiculous proposition. I begin with the fundamental assumption that they are telling the truth when they swear on oath. </PARA>

<PARA> Let us move on and look at some of the recent evidence of the attitude of the Government, the Opposition and the banks towards the Australian people. Let us go back a couple of days to when the Minister for Social Security said that he was prepared to condone banks getting access, by garnishee, to up to 14 per cent of pension payments. The law of the land which he is responsible for administering says that that is inappropriate. I know that there are divided opinions on this matter, but the law of the land says that that should not happen. If the intention of the law is to protect the accounts of the recipients of social service benefits, I believe it is the Minister's responsibility to ensure that the law is tested in a court or, alternatively, to change the law. Yet he condones the possible garnisheeing of up to 14 per cent of pension payments. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us look at articles in the Australian recently which suggest-and this is an explanation given by banks-that people who pay their Bankcard account promptly actually force up the rate of interest paid by those people who delay their payment. It is extraordinary logic for banks to be projecting to the public as justification for excessive interest rates on Bankcard. The banks are saying that the fact that some people pay promptly is responsible for the higher interest rates paid by the slow payers. It is an extraordinary situation. What about the attempt to justify special charges directed at people who have small bank accounts? Because one has a small bank account, one incurs a special charge. This does not even touch on the whole question of banks justifying increases in mortgage rates on housing month after month at a time when they are experiencing record profitability. </PARA>
<PARA> On the one hand, we have these actions of the banks, and on the other hand we sit in our homes and watch television advertisements which say that if we get on a camel or get into a four-wheel drive vehicle and drive into the Simpson Desert, everything will okay as long as we have our Bankcards in our hands. That is how good the banks are. It is a load of rubbish. That image of banks is projected at us through their advertising campaign. Yet we have these patterns of behaviour displayed week after week, month after month, and year after year. They are directed in the interests of the banks and contrary to the interests of their clients. They are condoned today by the Government and the Opposition.</PARA>
<PARA> I am simply saying to people in Australia who use banks that there is a crisis of confidence in banks. They know that to be true, and I know that to be true. I am saying, `Let's put the matter before a Senate standing committee to see whether there is any substance in these allegations of corrupt practices'. That will be rejected here today by the combined vote of the Government and the Opposition in the same way as my request for the Australian Federal Police to get a briefing on the allegations was refused. It will be rejected in the same way as my request for the Minister for Justice to intervene in this matter. He, I am told, induced Caucus to oppose this motion today. That is the situation we are confronted with in this chamber of the Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> There is a plan B. There is another option, which is to go to the streets with these matters, to fill up the town halls of our capital cities, to say to people, `Come and tell us what you think about banks. You might not have been able to go to a Senate standing committee because that right was refused, but at least you can come to a public meeting at a town hall'. Honourable senators can bet that all sorts of legal writs will be filed on people for stating their opinions about banks publicly because they could not come before a legally constituted Senate inquiry into this matter. It is a massive travesty of justice. It is a gross misjudgment of this issue by both the Government and the Opposition. We are determined to make it a major issue as we move forward to the coming election, which may be only months away. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;At the beginning it is worth looking at the modus operandi of the Australian Democrats in Australian politics and in this Parliament. I do not want to get too personal but I will deal with a few of them. Until he was removed at the last election-fortunately-we had the incomparable Senator Vigor. Senator Stone did not have Senator Vigor inflicted on him, but he made the rest of them look pretty good. We have League of Rights economics preached at us by Senator Coulter-ultimately derived from Major Douglas and transmitted to Senator Coulter via the League of Rights-a great deal of which appears to have been adopted by Senator McLean today. We have plant variety rights Powell. Senator Haines, more so now than in the past due to her doomed attempts to win a seat in the House of Representatives, takes every opportunity to win a little publicity. Now we have Senator McLean doing the same thing.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator McLean is, as I said, picking up a line of argument which is unsubstantiated in any meaningful way but which is popular with a minority of people out in the country-that is, that banks are crook and banks are evil. I do not pretend that banks do not make mistakes. No human institution is free of fault or error. Nor do I imagine that banks are philanthropists. Banks are in business to make some money for themselves and some dividends for their shareholders. Senator McLean said that banks have become profit oriented. I thought they always were. But what Senator McLean is alleging goes well beyond saying that banks make mistakes or that banks are not philanthropists. He is alleging criminal activity. Allegations have been passed on to him by a variety of people and, on his own admission, he has made no attempt to check those allegations with the institutions against which the complaints were being levied. They are allegations not of mismanagement or of error; they are allegations of criminal activity. He uses the privilege of the Senate with absolutely no attempt to check out the facts. He uses the institution of parliamentary privilege to make those allegations public. </PARA>
<PARA> I suspect that because of his background-that is a background in which he has absolutely no knowledge of the private sector or of business-Senator McLean is particularly susceptible to some of the allegations which were being made. Banks make mistakes and so do individuals. Plenty of individuals borrow recklessly, and they get themselves into trouble. I regret to say that it is pretty clear that a number of financial institutions, including some banks, lend recklessly. There has been a pretty obvious example of that in Victoria over the last couple of years. That, however, is a different thing to criminal activity. Individuals make mistakes. I personally know people engaged in agriculture who in 1984 and 1985 were complaining about the short-sighted attitude of banks which would not lend them enough money. We were at the time approaching the end of a boom in agricultural land prices. It was argued by these people that banks should lend them additional funds, not on the reasonably assessed capacity to service the borrowings that they would have but on the increasing market price of the land. I have no doubt that similar things happened with the share market boom which finally collapsed in 1987. These people complained, `The banks will not lend me enough because they look at my capacity to generate income instead of the equity'-as it turned out, the illusory equity which they held in the land. </PARA>
<PARA> A few years later, of course, the land boom collapsed, as all booms collapse. The people then complained that they could not service the volume of debt, which they had previously alleged was inadequate and niggardly, that the banks had already provided. The banks took action to recover some of the loans which the borrowers were by then incapable of servicing. That appears to be the basis of the complaints in almost all of the cases that Senator McLean has referred to. I am not being particularly critical of the individuals concerned, but when that happened they were insolvent and on the road to bankruptcy-and they blamed the banks. It is not that unusual for people to blame somebody else when they are caught by bad luck, in many cases of course, supplemented by their own unrealistic expectations. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator McLean has acknowledged that in a number of these cases civil actions are running. It is in the civil courts or the criminal courts that allegations of misconduct or of criminal action should be pursued, not in the Parliament. Although more substantial evidence may come to light as a result of civil actions, I do not think anything that Senator McLean has presented could really be regarded as solid evidence. There are assertions by a number of individuals-assertions which he himself admits he made no attempt to check out-but they are unsupported, to the best of my knowledge, in any serious way by any independent evidence. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator McLean is running a conspiracy theory here. He has been associating with the League of Rights on these issues. He described the meeting in Adelaide as a fairly diverse group, an extraordinary collection, or something. I do not think it is an extraordinary collection at all. It was a collection of people who are at best ignorant and, at worst, something very much worse than that. As part of his conspiracy theory he is suggesting that the National Farmers Federation (NFF), which was party to a joint investigation of a number of the cases that he has put before us here, the Australian Bankers Association and the Australian Federal Police (AFP) are all involved in a cover-up. The Australian Bankers Association, the NFF and the Federal Police are a fairly diverse group. None of them is free of error or fault. But I find it implausible, extraordinary and ridiculous to suggest that those three organisations would be, for reasons which nobody can even hint at, collaborating in a cover-up to protect some particular banks against allegations of malpractice or criminal activities. </PARA>
<PARA> The only other point I want to make is that it is always easy for any politician, particularly a politician who belongs to a group, or is an individual, who will never be called upon to provide the funding for the various good ideas which they have, to get a bit of publicity and perhaps a bit of support for himself by presenting himself as standing up for the battler and the little man or woman against big institutions, be they government, the trading banks, the Bankers Association or whatever. But Senate inquiries are not free. The taxpayers pay for Senate inquiries. In my opinion, the Senate has already been irresponsible on a number of occasions in setting up inquiries into matters which were either too trivial or too silly to justify the expenditure of Commonwealth taxpayers' money on them and, in some cases, of course, were designed to do nothing other than attract publicity for the proposer of the inquiry-a category into which this one also probably falls. </PARA>
<PARA> These inquiries are not free, and the Senate cannot hold inquiries into everything. It should not hold inquiries into matters which have been raised on such flimsy `evidence' as has been presented by Senator McLean in support of the allegations which he has retailed into the Parliament. These are allegations which, I say again, he himself admits he made no attempt to verify. I understand that some of them concern matters which are already before the civil courts. The civil courts or the criminal courts, depending on what the allegations are, are the proper places for these matters to be determined. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The proposal before us today to refer to the Senate Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs on investigation of banks was, as Senator McLean pointed out in his remarks, raised directly with the shadow Treasurer, Andrew Peacock, and me at a joint meeting that we had some month or two ago. Senator McLean produced information, some of which has found its way into the records of the Senate. He left the information with us so that we could further examine the matter in terms of the kinds of complaints that were set out therein. Naturally, at the time we met with Senator McLean we were interested in the issue. We certainly wanted to find out more about the allegations. We set about doing so by investigating the papers and the information that he had left with us.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It seemed at first that three broad categories of problems arose from the papers left with us. Firstly, there were allegations by those swearing the affidavits that there was, on the part of the banks, deliberate asset stripping of specifically targeted businesses. Secondly, some clients had been involved, according to their allegations, in foreign borrowings and there had been a non-disclosure by banks of risk information relating to borrowing in those foreign currencies. Thirdly, there was what was termed `premature foreclosure' on rural property holdings. Of course, all of those three areas are areas of concern. If the allegations that were set down in the information could be substantiated, of course there would be substantial reason for further investigation. We are certainly sympathetic to the concerns of all those people who have found themselves in unfortunate situations but, for a number of reasons, we cannot support the motion that Senator McLean is putting forward today. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me now mention a number of questions which I think have to be resolved before we could agree to support the motion before us today. First and foremost, only part of the information has yet been provided by Senator McLean. Of course, there is conflicting information, some of which we have investigated, which discloses an alternative view of the facts in many of the cases outlined. Therefore it would be necessary for any Senate committee to establish itself as a court of law, if you like, to investigate both sides of those various questions. We are not talking here about points of law; we are talking about facts. We are talking about points of fact which would be evidence that would have to be debated, discussed and adjudicated upon by the Senate committee in order to determine the truth of the original information. </PARA>
<PARA> Secondly, we ask the question: Would any such inquiry achieve anything meaningful at all? I think the answer to that would be a resounding no because, simply, the Senate committee would be faced with an enormous task of becoming an adjudicator, becoming in effect a court of law having to sit on many hundreds of cases such as already admitted by Senator McLean, that it would end up with a never-ending job of trying to come to some conclusion about the issues which he has raised. Quite clearly, in the end that task is beyond the capacity of a Senate committee. Of course, Senate committees were never designed to become courts of law. </PARA>
<PARA> Thirdly, as the Minister for Finance has pointed out, the legal system is the proper place to review such disputes, such conflicts of information. As we know, there are many cases already before the courts, some heard, some not heard, some partially heard. Some have been settled by banks in favour of complainants as a result of a good case being made out. But quite clearly there are circumstances where that may not occur. It would not seem to be the proper role of a Senate committee to sit and review cases such as that. </PARA>
<PARA> Fourthly, it is quite possible that, by taking this action, the Senate would be doing more harm to the system and to the interests of those complainants who have come to Senator McLean than it would do good. It is quite possible that many of the issues raised would show some of the complainants to have been very poor businessmen. It may be shown, for instance, that much of the detailed information available would disclose that their careers perhaps should be subject to greater scrutiny than they have been already. There are not necessarily going to be circumstances which arise which lead to decisions in favour of those individual complainants in the way in which Senator McLean may well contemplate. </PARA>
<PARA> For that reason, what is really an inadequate vehicle for the investigation of these issues should not in fact be placed in a position where it could damage the interests of the very people Senator McLean is seeking to help. In fact, one could be so uncharitable as to suggest that this is really a cruel hoax on the people who have brought their complaints to Senator McLean, in the sense that he wishes to use these people in some kind of way to gain publicity for himself and for the Australian Democrats, knowing full well that the issues can never properly be resolved by a vehicle established by this Senate.</PARA>
<PARA> Of course, that is the essential element, the essential point, of this debate. I would like to clarify that a little more. This issue boils down to the question of the adequacy of Senate committees to do the kind of job which Senator McLean is claiming they should do. The answer is a resounding no. It is totally inappropriate for Senate committees to adopt the kind of investigation the honourable senator is proposing. If we look at the proposed terms of reference to the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs, we can see that even more clearly. It is proposed that the Senate committee would inquire into:</PARA>
<PARA>The extent and nature of any practice among banks which does or may contravene the fundamental fiduciary duty of banker to client. </PARA>
<PARA>This refers to `any practice among banks'. Obviously there are going to be some practices which reflect on the operations of banks. Nobody is infallible. Obviously there are going to be some practices which reflect on the capacity of individual clients of the banks. Both of those sides of the question would have to be examined. They should be all subject to the evidentiary rules of law which would have to be considered by non-judicial people-mere politicians, not judges-sitting on a Senate committee, people who are not familiar with the law, in many cases not trained in anything except a rudimentary sense to be able to make and apply proper legal judgments. </PARA>
<PARA> That is surely argument enough to cast aside what I suggest is the rather ill-considered proposition that comes from the Democrats. There is nothing in this proposition that is going to alleviate the hardship of those people who have found themselves in the unfortunate circumstances which have led them to come to Senator McLean with their complaints. Many have lost their properties. Many have lost their businesses. Many of them have lost more than that. Those points have been made clear in many of the documents that Senator McLean has put forward. But no one word that will be put in evidence to the Senate Committee, not one decision or conclusion to which a Senate committee comes, will assist those people any more than they have been assisted already by various other means. Their answer will flow from proper legal determinations taken in courts of law or resolved in other fashions. This Committee is simply not the body to help. It is not a way in which those people can seek redress and support in the situations in which they unfortunately find themselves. I believe it to be cruel for any senator to suggest that there might be some result which flows from a Senate committee decision which might assist those individuals. That is really playing those people for fools. </PARA>
<PARA> That is the essence of our complaint about this motion and why we will not support it. There are perhaps some other observations that ought to be made. Of course, I did not expect the Minister to make them. Many of the predicaments which some of Senator McLean's constituents have found themselves in have arisen through the direct policies of this Government. We have seen in recent times the highest interest rates in living memory. There is nothing more conducive to the failure of a business-such as a rural activity, for instance-than out of control interest rates where the financing of, if you like, one's basic capital is subject to huge rises in annual costs to service those loans. I instance the case of many people on the west coast of my own State of South Australia who have suffered because of enormous increases in interest rates-some as high as 23 per cent-on rural loans. In those circumstances those people find that every three years their total debt owing to the bank doubles. That would mean that within three years, in many cases, their equity would have totally disappeared. This has arisen as a direct result of the Hawke Government's policies. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="9I4">Senator MESSNER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is a totally different issue and, unless Senator McLean can see that, there is something wrong with him.

As Senator McLean well and truly knows, it has controlled interest rate policy in this country and has demolished many businesses. Perhaps in a calmer moment he might acknowledge that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The fact is that there has been an inappropriate policy mix in this country for some years. Even the Governor of the Reserve Bank of Australia has pointed out in recent days that the Government has failed on micro-economic policy. It has failed to reform the waterfront, failed to reform industrial relations and failed to get rid of stupid, inefficient and uneconomic work practices, which add so much to the cost of production in this country and which damage our ability to sell on the world markets and to employ Australians. Those are the things that are at the core of the problem that has brought constituents to see Senator McLean. Many of the people whom Senator McLean has mentioned have found themselves in the vice, caught by rising interest rates and falling demand for their products and in a situation where the value of their properties has declined and their equity has been wiped out. Much of it is directly attributable to the Hawke Government's policies. Perhaps we could set up a Senate committee to investigate that. That might produce a more worthwhile answer than Senator McLean's suggestion. </PARA>

They have brought about the highest tax rates as well as the highest interest rates in history, which are doing so much to damage incentive in this country.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I will sum up the position of the Liberal and National parties. We certainly appreciate the difficulties experienced by many people that have been brought to our attention by Senator McLean. However, we do not believe that the Senate inquiry would be the best course to follow, for the following reasons. First, it would not offer any real help to the aggrieved parties. Secondly, in the form envisaged by Senator McLean it could only merely duplicate what is already known. It could only amount to the presentation of information which has already been put forward in the Senate-unless, of course, the inquiry establishes itself as a court of law, and that is beyond its capacity. Thirdly, the legal system is certainly the best place for individuals to pursue their cases where there is any suggestion of malpractice. Certainly, as I said earlier, I know of cases in which settlements have already been entered into by the banks with complainants to ensure that justice is done. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, I believe that the Senate inquiry could do more harm than good for the constituents of Senator McLean. It is certainly not an area where we can help in these particular circumstances. I conclude by saying that I believe that to lead these people to believe that their problems can be solved by a Senate inquiry is a cruel hoax. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The motion before the Senate from Senator McLean, to have these matters referred to the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs, is both ill-conceived and-I will go farther and say-mischievous. Senator McLean embarked upon this matter some time ago, during the previous Budget session, when he tabled in this place a number of affidavits from people alleging themselves to be aggrieved borrowers from the Commonwealth Bank of Australia. In the context of those affidavits, Senator McLean launched himself upon the view that we had a whole series of misdoings by the Commonwealth Bank and its officers, ranging from extremely bad advice and bad banking practice at one end-at the more minor end of his charges-to corruption, personal peculation, fraud, connivance with other persons or persons unknown, and, not least, corruption involving-at the furthest extreme of Senator McLean's increasingly wild allegations-the overt cooperation and collaboration of members of the Australian Federal Police.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This morning we heard Senator McLean extend those wild claims even further-I think to his personal shame; but that is by the way. That was where the matter began. I will have something more to say about that later. But I wanted to begin by spelling out how this matter began in that manner and how the skein has gradually unravelled until we now have a much wider patchwork of matters which Senator McLean wishes us to refer to the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator McLean's next move was to table in this place a further set of allegations, again almost entirely by way of affidavit, after the Senate resumed for the current session. But because I suspect Senator McLean has found some degree of reserve on the part of even the people he has been taking some advice from, such as his own colleagues in the Australian Democrats, as to the sustainability of these extraordinary charges that he has been making, Senator McLean has seen fit, in the motion now before us, to widen very considerably the ambit of the topic into which he wishes the Senate Committee to inquire to include not merely these specific instances of peculation, fraud, maladministration and corruption, which was where his allegations began, but also such matters as the whole question of how the banks conduct their affairs in this country. </PARA>
<PARA> In the course of his remarks this morning he referred, for example, to interest rates on Bankcard, special charges imposed or sought to be imposed by some of the banks on the accounts of very small depositors and the exorbitant level to which housing loan interest rates have now been pushed up. Of course, I would be the first to agree with him on that. But I do not think it has anything to do with the banks; it has a great deal to do with the policies of this Government, which Senator McLean and his colleagues have been supporting consistently for the past six years. Senator McLean has widened the ambit of his proposed inquiry to take account of those matters. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that even he, when he wakes up in the middle of the night and wonders just how he came to be involved in this and whether he has been wise to pursue these kinds of wild allegations, has had a touch, just a twinge, of doubt as to whether the nonsense he has been talking will not result, if the Committee ever did get around to inquiring about them, in his emerging with the proverbial egg all over his features. Therefore, in order to give the inquiry some semblance of respectability, he has sought to widen it to take into account the whole practices of the banking system. Senator McLean may or may not realise it, but what he is really calling for is another royal commission of inquiry into the banking system of Australia. The last of those was in 1935. </PARA>

If Senator McLean were to come into this place and argue that we are long overdue for an inquiry into the banking system of this country because it is 54 years since we last had one, at least we would have some kind of respectable basis on which to have a discussion. In those circumstances, of course, the worst way of holding such an inquiry would be to have it held by a committee of this place. As I said, on the last occasion on which we had such an inquiry, in 1935, it was a royal commission. Mr Chifley was a member of that commission; so was a subsequent Governor of the Reserve Bank of Australia, Sir John Phillips, now deceased.

I cannot speak too strongly in my condemnation of Senator McLean's behaviour in this place in respect of this. It seems to me that what he has done, and is prepared to do without the slightest compunction, is to get up in this place and smear all manner of people, both collectively and in many cases individually, in the interests of his grubby little political exercise.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Let me mention one or two of the people whom he smeared. In his remarks supporting this motion this morning he has personally smeared Mr Tim Besley, the previous Managing Director of the Commonwealth Bank of Australia. He has smeared Mr Don Sanders, the current Managing Director of the Commonwealth Bank of Australia. Without naming the individuals concerned, he has smeared in a general reference 42 senior officers of the Commonwealth Bank. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I accept the correction. Senator McLean says 32. Only 32 senior officers of the Commonwealth Bank has he smeared. I hope he takes comfort in the correction. He has had not the slightest compunction in saying in this place this morning that before putting down these allegations in the Senate last December he made no attempt to check them with the people whose bona fides and professional careers he was traducing by doing so.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Let me just say something about the Commonwealth Bank of Australia. I hold no particular brief for the Commonwealth Bank. I think that over the years it has been a less well run bank in many respects than its private sector competitors, although I am bound to say with considerable pleasure that in recent years it has lifted its game considerably following a major reorganisation in which I personally had some hand in my last year in the Treasury and in which I take some pride. Because of my past associations and as a result of my then office as Secretary to the Treasury, I sat on the board of the Commonwealth Bank for 5 1/2 years. I know something about the institution as an institution. I know something about the way such an institution works, a matter about which quite clearly Senator McLean is totally and palpably ignorant, as we all know he is about most matters economic or financial. </PARA>
<PARA> I also know something about some, although not 32, of the most senior officers of that bank. I know something particularly about the present Managing Director, Mr Don Sanders, who has been personally known to me for nearly 33 years. For most of that time during his distinguished career he was a senior officer and eventually became Deputy Governor of the Reserve Bank of Australia until a year or so ago when he was appointed Managing Director of the Commonwealth Bank of Australia by the present Government. I simply want to put on the record without dwelling on it that, in my opinion, when Senator McLean casts the kind of personal slur that he has this morning on the personal standing and character of Don Sanders, it is a disgrace to him personally, to the party that he represents and, I suppose, in one sense to the procedures of this place that he should be permitted to do so. But I do not want to pursue that generalisation. </PARA>
<PARA> After receiving these allegations last December Senator McLean chose to put them down in this place without even asking for a comment about them from the Commonwealth Bank. He made no inquiry of the Commonwealth Bank as to whether it had any comment to make about the allegations concerned. When I made that point this morning in the course of Senator McLean's remarks by way of interjection, what did Senator McLean say? He said, `What a ludicrous idea that I should actually take these complaints to the Commonwealth Bank and ask it for its views. Is that what you normally do when you are dealing with an adversary?'. That was his word. I take it that Senator McLean will not correct me on that. In other words, Senator McLean had already convicted the Commonwealth Bank. It was already his adversary in this matter. </PARA>
<PARA> I spent a fair bit of time in public life as a bureaucrat, as a public servant, and it has always seemed to me that before someone gets out, particularly into an area like the Senate of the Commonwealth of Australia, and starts launching accusations of the most serious kind involving individuals, which accusations, if they were to be believed, would result in total discredit and destruction of the careers of those individuals, he should make at least some attempt to check the facts. While not necessarily in any way suggesting that Senator McLean would have been bound to accept the views or comments given to him by the Commonwealth Bank had he bothered to check his facts, I nevertheless put it to him through you, Mr Deputy President, that his failure even to seek the comments was totally disgraceful. </PARA>
<PARA> After Senator McLean had made his allegations to the Senate, those allegations were naturally immediately brought to the attention of the Commonwealth Bank. I have recently received from the Managing Director of the Commonwealth Bank copies of letters which Mr Sanders wrote in February and, in one case, March of this year to Senator McLean setting out the detailed results of the detailed internal inquiry which the bank then conducted into the allegations that Senator McLean had made. I understand that as at 22 March Senator McLean had not even acknowledged receipt of those letters from the Managing Director of the Commonwealth Bank, the institution whose probity in this matter he is seriously attacking and criticising. I do not want to take up the time of the Senate-in any case I would not have the time to do so-because the four letters concerned are extremely lengthy and cover in considerable detail the particular complaints made by some of the complainants concerned. Mr Sanders, in his letter to me forwarding this material, said:</PARA>
<PARA>The bank is very reluctant to make public its dealings with customers but in the circumstances we feel obliged to do so. </PARA>
<PARA>I fully understand that feeling on his part. After all, the customers in these cases had not the slightest compunction in making what they alleged to be their own circumstances known to Senator McLean. Senator McLean had not the slightest compunction in tabling those by way of affidavits in this place, thereby making them known even more widely. Mr Sanders's letter continues:</PARA>
<PARA>We therefore make the information available to you with no restriction as to use. </PARA>
<PARA>It is on the basis of that freedom that I feel able to seek leave of the Senate to have incorporated in Hansard the four letters concerned. </PARA>

<PARA>Dear Senator McLean</PARA>
<PARA>RE: ALLEGATIONS AGAINST COMMONWEALTH BANK OF AUSTRALIA BY DONALD M. BENSON</PARA>
<PARA> Mr Benson's complaints in the material tabled are numerous, but are summarised in the tenth paragraph of his Affidavit affirmed on 14 December 1988 and tabled by you the following day. </PARA>
<PARA> As stated in the letter dated 26 September 1988, various allegations made by Mr Benson had been examined as well as the general conduct of dealings between the Bank and the companies in which Mr Benson and his son were interested and my deputy was satisfied that a sympathetic and correct approach had been adopted by the Bank in its dealings with Mr Benson and his companies. </PARA>
<PARA> The same letter noted that there are many aspects of the points raised by Mr Benson which are in conflict with the Bank's records. While I do not consider it is necessary or appropriate to deal seriatim with the many points raised by Mr Benson, the nature of his allegations, as summarised in the tenth paragraph of his Affidavit beforementioned, makes it appropriate that his complaints be put within the context of the dealings by companies with which he is concerned with the Bank. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Benson and his wife, B. L. Benson, first furnished relevant security to the Bank on 10 February 1984 when they executed a mortgage over a property known as ``Cryon Park'' to secure advances to one of their companies, Don Benson Pty Limited. In October 1984 Mr and Mrs Benson executed a guarantee to secure advances to another of their companies, Polygraph Products Pty Limited.</PARA>
<PARA> Early in December 1986, when making a visit to the factory of Polygraph Products Pty Limited, officers of the Bank became aware that certain businesses and assets thought to have been owned by Polygraph Products Pty Limited were variously owned by a company then called Mornway Pty Limited, which has since changed its name to Australian Drafting Supplies Pty Limited, or by Don Benson Pty Limited, or by Mr Benson and his son, W. P. M. Benson in their personal capacity. </PARA>
<PARA> By letter dated 9 December 1986 to Polygraph Products Pty Limited, the Bank stated it would require execution of equitable mortgages by all companies concerned and the execution of Traders' Bills of Sale by the Bensons personally as owners of various parts of the business. One of the effects of that security would be that each of the companies and individuals within the Benson family group would become liable for the debts of each of the other of them. </PARA>
<PARA> On 20 August 1987 the aggregate of the debts to the Bank on the accounts of Polygraph Products Pty Limited was in excess of $540,000.00. On that day the directors of the company delivered to the Bank a copy of a report of that date made by Messrs Hamilton Taylor &amp; Brien, Chartered Accountants, who had undertaken an investigation of Polygraph Products Pty Limited at the request of its directors. That report contains the following statement:</PARA>
<PARA> ``The estimated deficiency of assets to meet liabilities for the company, subject to the various matters dealt with in the notes on Annexure ``A'' hereto, is $731,635.00. It is apparent in this regard the company is hopelessly insolvent.''</PARA>
<PARA> The minutes of a meeting of the directors of Polygraph Products Pty Limited held on 20 August 1987 records:</PARA>
<PARA> ``A letter report from Hamilton, Taylor &amp; Brien was tabled and the contents in relation to the company's current financial position were discussed. The directors note the apparent insolvency position and it was resolved:</PARA>
<PARA> ``To attend at the company's bankers, being the secured creditor, to request they take action under the terms of the security, it being the opinion of directors that the company should cease trading and not incur any further credit''.''</PARA>
<PARA> Having regard to that report and resolution and bearing in mind that all companies and individuals within the Benson family group are liable for each other's debts, it is apparent that there is no substance in Mr Benson's reference in his Affidavit to ``the buoyancy of the business'' or in the assertion that he had ``a viable business''. </PARA>
<PARA> On 27 August 1987 the Bank received a report from KMG Hungerfords, Chartered Accountant, now KMG Peat Marwick Hungerford, on Polygraph Products Pty Limited and its associated companies, in which it noted the indebtedness of the Benson group to the Bank was $911,349.00. That report expressed the opinion ``It is imperative to take immediate action to appoint either an agent for the (Bank as) mortgagee in possession or a receiver and manager over the assets of Polygraph Products Pty Limited.'' In relation to the other companies in the group, those accountants said ``It appears to be prudent to allow the directors a period of 2-3 months in which to arrange alternative financing.''</PARA>
<PARA> The Bank acted on those recommendations and ultimately allowed Mr Benson and his family more than nine months to attempt to arrange alternative finance. Those attempts at refinancing, either from another bank or other financial institution, continued until 2 June 1988 by which date it became apparent that the latest of the attempts to refinance made by the Benson group had not succeeded. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bank arranged for an auction of the Cryon Park property to take place on 9 November 1988. There was no bid at the auction. The conduct of Mr D M Benson and other members of his family prior to and at that auction was considered to have had the effect of deterring potential purchasers. On that basis the Bank decided to proceed with obtaining Orders for Possession of the ``Cryon Park'' property which is owned by D M Benson and his wife and of another property known as ``Hidden Valley'' owned by Polygraph Products Pty Limited, the latter property being vacant land. </PARA>
<PARA> The return date for both Summonses for Orders for Possession was 15 December 1988. The occupiers of ``Cryon Park'' were Mr D M Benson, his wife, their daughter, their son-in-law and an infant grandchild. Immediately prior to the hearing of those Summonses, Mr D M Benson and his son, W P M Benson, in their respective capacities as individuals and as directors of Polygraph Products Pty Limited acknowledged receipt of a letter dated 14 December 1988, a photocopy of which is attached. The effect of that letter is to allow the occupants of the properties to remain in possession until after the Bank obtains a purchaser for them, provided the occupants co-operate with the Bank in relation to any such sale. The Bank was granted Orders for Possession of the property and agreed that it would not enforce those Orders before 31 January 1989. Mr Benson and his families are still in possession of the properties. </PARA>
<PARA> The highest offer the Bank has received for the properties was well below both the amount owing to it and the independent valuation obtained by the Bank. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bank and its staff have done nothing to warrant the complaints and allegations made by Mr Benson. On the contrary, the Bank has been very considerate in the measure of latitude it has extended to Mr Benson and his companies. The Bank commenced its actions to enforce its securities over the assets of Mr Benson and his family's group of companies at the express request of a meeting of directors of Polygraph Products Pty Limited which meeting was chaired by Mr Benson. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bank has been generous in its forbarance since August 1987 and has given Mr Benson and his family ample opportunity to either repay or refinance the liabilities of the group to the Bank. Those liabilities now aggregate in excess of $990,000.00. The Bank is still exercising restraint while it attempts to obtain the maximum feasible price for the properties mortgaged to it. Mr Benson and his companies remain entitled to sell the properties and meet their liabilities from the proceeds of sale, or by any other means available to them. </PARA>

<PARA>Re: ALLEGATIONS AGAINST COMMONWEALTH BANK OF AUSTRALIA BY WADE E. COX</PARA>
<PARA> The allegations by Mr Cox, so far as they relate to the Commonwealth Bank, seem to be that the Bank made an unauthorised disbursement of $75,000 and thereby induced a critical liquidity crisis in the operations of the business of his firm and destroyed its capacity to complete the feed lot operation for which money had been borrowed. </PARA>
<PARA> The disbursement referred to was made by the Bank on 22 July 1985 to Dalgety-Winchcombe FGC a Division of Dalgety Farmers Limited (Dalgetys). The Bank does not hold written instructions to pay to Dalgetys the subject $75,000 or indeed any amount, out of the moneys advanced at that time to Mr Cox and his partners. However, the Bank's records evidence that the payment was made with the verbal authority of Mr Cox given before the payment was made. </PARA>

<PARA>fund feed lot $60,000</PARA>
<PARA>fund irrigation system $60,000''</PARA>
<PARA> The Bank acknowledges that, at the time the application for finance was first made, part of the amount of $60,000, described as to ``fund feed lot'' was intended to meet the cost of structures which would make up a feed lot and the amount was not necessarily to be wholly applied to the purchase of livestock for that feed lot. That common understanding between Mr Cox and the Bank is reflected in his letter dated 24 July 1985 in which he states ``you are advised that the $60,000 to fund the feed lot was for silo construction etc as well as stock purchases from Dalgetys''. </PARA>
<PARA> The misunderstanding which developed between Mr Cox and the Bank seems to have arisen from the fact that, after the initial submission by the Bank's Kiama branch to its Regional Office, Mr Cox called at the Regional Office, on 16 May 1985, to discuss his financial needs. As a result of those discussions, changes were made in the details of the finance approved from that which was originally requested. Those changes included increasing the amount to be paid to Dalgetys from the sum of $110,000, shown in the original application for finance, to the sum of $125,000 specifically requested by Mr Cox on 16 May 1985 and approved by the Bank on that day. The sum of $60,000 to ``fund feed lot'' remained unchanged. </PARA>
<PARA> At the request of Mr Cox, made at the interview on 16 May 1985, the Bank informed Dalgetys' Sydney Representative by telephone that facilities had been approved to Mr Cox to pay out his then existing debt to Dalgetys of $125,000 and to fund the feed lot to the extent of $60,000. The purpose of that telephone call to Dalgetys was to enable Mr Cox to purchase stock at the Braidwood sales the following day. Mr Cox purchased cattle at that sale taking his then total indebtedness to Dalgetys to $237,599.10. That level of indebtedness was allowed in anticipation of Dalgetys receiving from the Bank sums aggregating $185,000 which the Bank, on the previous day at the specific request of Mr Cox, had informed Dalgetys was available for that purpose. </PARA>
<PARA> The misunderstanding between the Bank and Mr Cox was continued when, by a letter dated 11 July 1985, the Kiama branch of the Bank informed Mr Cox that, amongst other things, the amount approved to pay out Dalgetys was $110,000, instead of the increased amount of $125,000 approved by the Regional Office at the request of Mr Cox. In that same letter, in relation to the $60,000 to fund feed lot, it was noted-</PARA>
<PARA> ``we understand this has already been utilized and reflects in your current debt to Dalgetys''</PARA>
<PARA> When the branch wrote its letter dated 11 July 1985 to Mr Cox and his partners, it overlooked that the amount initially to be paid to Dalgetys had been increased by the Regional Office at the request of Mr Cox to $125,000. The branch was also not aware that, at the request of Mr Cox, the Regional Office had informed Dalgetys that the $60,000 to fund feed lot had been approved and was available to enable Mr Cox to purchase stock at sales the following day. </PARA>
<PARA> When the Kiama branch paid only $110,000 to Dalgetys, Dalgetys brought to the attention of the branch that it should have received $125,000 as approved by the Bank's Regional Office at the request of Mr Cox. At the same time, Dalgetys produced an invoice for the sum of $84,137.50 for stock purchased by Mr Cox on his account with Dalgetys, after the Bank had informed Dalgetys that the sum of $60,000 to fund the feed lot had been approved. On receipt of that information and invoice, the Bank paid to Dalgetys the further sum of $75,000, being the additional sum of $15,000 which should have been paid at the outset plus the $60,000 for purchase of stock for the feed lot. </PARA>
<PARA> All moneys paid by the Bank to Dalgetys were paid for the specific purpose for which they were borrowed. Those moneys were paid in circumstances in which, at the request of Mr Cox, the Bank had telephoned to inform Dalgetys that the moneys were available for that purpose and had confirmed that information to Dalgetys. In these circumstances, the Bank is satisfied the payment of not only the initial $110,000, but also the additional sum of $75,000, was authorised verbally by Mr Cox. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bank denies that any payment by it to Dalgetys was unauthorised. It also denies that any such payment induced the liquidity crisis which Mr Cox claims was induced. In this regard it is noted that, by letter dated 24 July 1985, Mr Cox, after being informed by the Bank that the $60,000 to fund the feed lot had been approved and that the branch understood it had been utilized and reflected in his firm's debt to Dalgetys, stated ``the irrigation system money (which was also $60,000) was to be utilized, firstly for some cattle purchases until November 1985''. </PARA>
<PARA> It is apparent from the foregoing that not only was the $60,000 approved to fund feed lot used by Mr Cox to purchase cattle, but it was also his intention to use the further $60,000 approved to fund an irrigation system, for the purchase of further cattle at least until November 1985. </PARA>
<PARA> It is always a matter for regret when a respected businessman such as Mr Cox, with apparently good potential, does not succeed in a move to expand his business. While the Bank will do what it reasonably can to tide a customer over temporary financial difficulties, ultimately it must require repayment to it of moneys lent. If that cannot be achieved from income produced or refinancing, then sale of the business on a voluntary or involuntary basis becomes necessary. In this case Mr Cox chose to sell his business. </PARA>

<PARA>Parliament House</PARA>
<PARA>CANBERRA ACT 2600</PARA>
<PARA>Dear Senator McLean</PARA>
<PARA>Re: ALLEGATIONS AGAINST COMMONWEALTH BANK OF AUSTRALIA BY DEREK GILLILAND TRADING AS THE GREAT AUSTRALIAN HAT COMPANY</PARA>
<PARA> I have had an investigation carried out into the allegations contained in the papers tabled in the Senate by you on 15 December 1988. I would be happy to discuss them with you, when you can find the time. </PARA>
<PARA> You drew particular attention to claims made by Mr Gilliland, who traded under the name ``The Great Australian Hat Company''. In view of the serious nature of those claims I feel I should put the result of our investigation on record and let you know that we have found no hint of substance in any of the assertions made by Mr Gilliland against the Commonwealth Bank and its staff. </PARA>
<PARA> In view of the selected details of his dealings with the Bank, given in the statement made by Mr Gilliland tabled by you, it is appropriate that I provide you with relevant details to give a balanced view of Mr Gilliland's dealings with the Bank. </PARA>
<PARA> On 2 February 1988, Mr Gilliland approached the Booragoon branch of the Commonwealth Bank with a tentative proposal that it provide his firm with an unsecured overdraft limit of approximately $50,000-00 and take over the firm's banking from another bank. </PARA>
<PARA> On 15 February 1988, Mr Gilliland formally applied to the Bank for an overdraft limit of $100,000-00. Further information was requested so a decision on his application could be made. </PARA>
<PARA> By 17 March 1988 the additional information requested by the Bank had not been provided, but as a measure of assistance, an overdraft limit of $30,000-00 was approved against the security of a Bill of Sale over the business of his firm. </PARA>
<PARA> Five days later, Mr Gilliland requested an extension of the $30,000-00 limit by $10,000-00 pending completion of an application by him to the Small Business Development Corporation of Western Australia for a State Government Guarantee for $100,000-00. The Bank complied with that request. </PARA>
<PARA> By 29 April 1988, the debt on the subject account, which still had an approved limit of only  $30,000-00, had reached $72,162-00. That debit over the approved limit had been allowed having regard to Mr Gilliland's assurance that certain funds were due to him and his undertaking not to issue further cheques until the funds then expected had been received. </PARA>
<PARA> By 3 May 1988 the debt on Mr Gilliland's account had reduced to $57,977-75, but a cheque for  $53,572-24 had been presented and dishonoured with the answer ``Present again-arrangements incomplete''. Mr Gilliland was critical of the Bank for not providing further support for his business. Upon receiving a certain deposit and upon being satisfied that a further deposit would be likely to be received within a few days, the Bank paid the cheque for $53,572-24 thereby committing itself to a short term debt of over $100,000-00.</PARA>
<PARA> On 6 May 1988 Mr Bevan, the Manager of the Bank's Boorangoon branch, received a telephone call from the Premier's Department of Western Australia. Mr Gilliland was said to have contacted that Department through the then Premier, Mr Burke, and influenced it into accepting that his application to the Small Business Development Corporation was one of urgency. At the request of Mr Brian Slerempel of the Small Business Development Corporation, a meeting with Mr Bevan and Mr Gilliland took place at the offices of the firm. At that meeting Mr Bevan gained the impression from Mr Slerempel that Mr Gilliland's application was receiving favourable consideration. </PARA>
<PARA> By 24 May 1988 the Bank had been informed that the Small Business Development Corporation had declined the application to it by Mr Gilliland. The debt to the Bank had risen to $108,979-00. As the guarantee from the Small Business Development Corporation, which the Bank had anticipated would be security for its overdraft to Mr Gilliland, would not be available, the Bank informed Mr Gilliland that it required him to reduce the debt on his firm's account to the agreed limit of $30,000-00 as a matter of urgency. </PARA>
<PARA> While awaiting action by Mr Gilliland, the Bank continued to support him by paying essential cheques, such as those for wages and materials, to such an extent that by 14 July 1988 the debt on the account had risen to $119,000-00. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bank's concern with the conduct of Mr Gilliland's account is shown by the letter dated 14 July 1988 to Mr Gilliland from our Chief State Manager's Department in Perth. A copy of that letter is attached. On 18 July 1988 Mr Gilliland informed the Bank he had had enough of the business and wanted to retire as soon as possible. He said that a representative of his brokers had been to his premises that morning and expected to be able to conclude a sale within three or four weeks. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bank continued to support Mr Gilliland by paying cheques drawn by him, which took the debt on his account to a total of $241,043-88 by the time he completed the sale of his business on 18 October 1988. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Gilliland's assertion of a conspiracy between the Bank and Mr Gannon is categorically denied. Mr Gannon was an employee of the Commonwealth Banking Corporation until July 1970. The Bank had no part in the introduction of Mr Gannon to Mr Gilliland. Indeed Mr Gilliland had informed the Bank, following receipt of its letter dated 14 July 1988, that he was proposing sale of the business and had engaged the services of Charthill Professional Pty Limited, as his broker, and that is the party which introduced Mr Gannon to Mr Gilliland. </PARA>
<PARA> The only pressure brought to bear by the Bank on Mr Gilliland was its attempts to keep the debt on his account within reasonable bounds. The Bank was not concerned whether Mr Gilliland obtained additional finance elsewhere to keep his account with the Bank within the approved limit of $30,000 or sold his business, both of which options had been pursued by him. </PARA>
<PARA> The relevant Agreement to Purchase Business shows, Mr Gilliland sold his business to Gannon Nominees Pty Ltd for a gross purchase price of $990,400-00 payable by the instalments set out in Schedule A of the Agreement, a copy of which Schedule is attached. Out of the deposit paid at settlement the debt to the Bank was repaid. So far as the Bank is aware, the balance of the purchase price remains owing to Mr Gilliland as set out in Schedule A of the Agreement.</PARA>
<PARA> In conclusion, Mr Gilliland was not forced to sell his business by the Bank. What the Bank did do was to approve a limit of $30,000-00, allow a temporary excess to $100,000-00 against the expectation of a guarantee from the Small Business Development Corporation which did not eventuate. In the interests of allowing Mr Gilliland to find other ways to get his business in order, the Bank then allowed the debt to increase to meet wages and the purchase of essential goods and to further increase to more than twice the amount that Mr Gilliland originally requested only 8 months earlier. This finance was extended to a business which had never been contemplated as an ongoing bankable risk for such an amount, simply to give Mr Gilliland the best chance to solve his problems. I am satisfied, and I trust this information will enable you to agree, that the Bank provided a generous measure of support to Mr Gilliland and there is no basis for his assertions against it. </PARA>

<PARA>Dear Mr Gilliland</PARA>
<PARA> I refer to our telephone discussion today wherein I agreed to meet cheques drawn in favour of Bohaul and Fremantle Estate Agency for $2,771.75 and $2,437.50 respectively, and acknowledge that these cheques together with several smaller cheques would take the balance of your firm's account to $119,000DR. </PARA>
<PARA> You in turn acknowledged that no further excesses would be permitted on the account (which, in any event, is substantially in excess of agreed arrangements) and furthermore that you would be immediately undertaking an intensive drive on your current debtors to reduce significantly the overdrawn balance within the next week. </PARA>
<PARA> In this latter regard it is imperative that provision be made to meet future outgoings, particularly those of an essential nature such as wages. </PARA>
<PARA> In authorising these cheques and yesterday your wages cheque, you will appreciate that I have overridden the authority of our Branch Manager. This was done because of the urgency of the decision required and because of the essential nature of these cheques which, if unpaid, would have jeopardised future operations.

<PARA>Senator The Honourable P. A. McLean</PARA>
<PARA>Parliament House</PARA>
<PARA>CANBERRA ACT 2600</PARA>
<PARA>Dear Senator McLean</PARA>
<PARA>RE: ALLEGATIONS AGAINST COMMONWEALTH BANK OF AUSTRALIA BY MR A. T. RIGG</PARA>
<PARA> The investigation I have had carried out into allegations made by Mr Rigg, contained in papers tabled by you in the Senate on 15 December 1988, has been completed. That investigation has satisfied me that although the Bank made one transactional mistake, the mistake has been rectified and there has been no impropriety or precipitate action on the part of the Bank or its staff. </PARA>
<PARA> The assertions by Mr Rigg in the first three sentences of the first paragraph of his Brief to you and the content of paragraphs numbered 2 and 3 in that Brief are entirely correct. The remainder of the assertions, at best, are only partly correct. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Rigg has omitted to mention a material part of the relationship between him, his wife and their company, Tony Rigg Welding and Manufacturing Pty Limited (the company) and the Bank. More importantly, he has mis-stated the basis on which the Bank appointed a receiver of the rents of the property mortgaged to the Bank. That appointment was made because Mr and Mrs Rigg, as mortgagors of the relevant property, failed to pay money they owe to the Bank, not because the company failed to pay money it owes to the Bank. </PARA>
<PARA> So that you may understand the relationships between Mr and Mrs Rigg, the company and the Bank, the relevant aspects of those relationships need to be set out. </PARA>
<PARA> At all times since the incorporation of the company, Mr and Mrs Rigg have been the only directors and the only shareholders of the company. On 5 June 1985 the Bank approved a Bill Facility to Mr and Mrs Rigg for a gross amount of $485,000-00. That sum included $303,500-00 to construct factory industrial units on property owned by Mr and Mrs Rigg at Lot 6 Princes Highway, South Nowra. Security for that facility was, and remains, a mortgage over a house property owned by Mr and Mrs Rigg and over their factory property in South Nowra. </PARA>
<PARA> At the same time as the Bank provided the Bill Facility of $485,000-00 to Mr and Mrs Rigg, it approved an overdraft facility of $40,000-00 to the company. The security to the Bank for the overdraft facility is the mortgage over the house and factory properties owned by Mr and Mrs Rigg. The company has not guaranteed or otherwise furnished any security to the Bank for moneys owing by Mr and Mrs Rigg to the Bank. In other words, Mr and Mrs Rigg are liable to the Bank for all moneys owing by them and by their company to the Bank, but the company is liable only for those moneys which it owes to the Bank as principal debtor. </PARA>
<PARA> By February 1986, it became apparent that construction of the factory industrial units could not be completed for Mr Rigg's original estimate of $303,500-00 and that overruns in that construction would be 66% above his original estimates. Mr Rigg attributed that overrun to increased labour costs, to the cost of earthworks for drainage not originally provided for, to the cost of brickwork and to wet weather problems which caused a delay of three months between September 1985 and February 1986. </PARA>
<PARA> To assist Mr and Mrs Rigg, the Bank at their request, increased its Bill Facility to them by $265,000-00. The total of facilities approved by the Bank for Mr and Mrs Rigg and their company, which was accepted by Mr and Mrs Rigg on 7 April 1986, was increased to $792,000-00, being  $40,000-00 by way of overdraft to the company and the balance to Mr and Mrs Rigg personally. The approval of these facilities was subject to a number of conditions which included clearance of the then existing Bill Facility of $485,000-00 by April 1987 from sale by Mr and Mrs Rigg of another factory site at Pitt Street, Nowra. No reduction in those facilities has been made. </PARA>
<PARA> The nature of a Bill Facility is such that Bills of Exchange are drawn by the customer, in this case Mr and Mrs Rigg, to mature on a stipulated date, generally not exceeding 90 days to maturity. Bills drawn by Mr and Mrs Rigg were for periods ranging from 15 days to 90 days, with most of them being for periods of either about 35 days or about 65 days. On or before the day of each drawdown of the Bill Facility and on or before the day each Bill matures, the drawer is required to provide the Bank with a Bill or a replacement Bill as the case may be. When a Bill of Exchange matures and a new Bill of Exchange is provided by the customer to the Bank, the Bill Facility is said to be ``rolled over'', i.e. the matured Bill is replaced by a Bill, usually for the same amount, with a maturity date for a period up to a further 90 days. </PARA>
<PARA> On every occasion, from and including August 1985 to and including November 1987, when a Bill was about to be drawn down or was due to mature and be rolled over, Mr and Mrs Rigg were written to and requested to attend at the Nowra branch of the Bank to sign a fresh or replacement Bill of Exchange. On every occasion on which a Bill was drawn down or rolled over on maturity, Mr and Mrs Rigg were written to and informed in detail of the amount of the Bill, its maturity date, its duration, the amount of fees and the net amount credited or debited and specifying the account to which the creditor debit had been made. </PARA>
<PARA> With the exception of the first draw down on 14 August 1985, on all draw downs and rollovers of Bills, which happened on 34 separate occasions, all proceeds of the Bills and the amount of fees on rollovers of the Bills were credited or debited respectively to the account of the company and written notice was given to Mr and Mrs Rigg. </PARA>
<PARA> On the one occasion, in March 1987, when the Bank requested Mr and Mrs Rigg, in writing, to provide it with a ``cheque from the account normally used to cover fees and discounts'' for the then next rollover of a Bill, Mrs Rigg provided the Bank with a cheque drawn on the account of the company, i.e. the account of which the Bank had consistently credited proceeds of Bills and debited fees on rollovers of Bills with the full knowledge and concurrence of Mr and Mrs Rigg. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr and Mrs Rigg have now asserted that the Bank had no authority to credit the proceeds of Bills which were drawn by them to the account of their company and they further assert they have no liability to the Bank as drawers of the last Bill for $750,000.00 which matured on 22 December 1987 and remains unpaid. Mr and Mrs Rigg, presumably in their capacity as directors of the company, now also assert, that their company is not liable to the Bank for any part of the fees on rollovers of the Bills because the Bank had no authority to debit those fees to the account of the company. The Bank is quite prepared to have the issue of the liability of Mr and Mrs Rigg determined by the Supreme Court in the proceedings which have been commenced for that purpose. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bank did make a mistake in that it debited to the account of the company, the amount of the Bill drawn by Mr and Mrs Rigg, which matured on 22 December 1987. That mistake has been rectified without detriment to the position of Mr and Mrs Rigg or their company. In this regard, the demand made on Mr and Mrs Rigg by letter dated 15 March 1988 for payment of $1,032,398.67 was for the right amount. It is the default in complying with that demand on which the Bank relied to appoint a receiver of the rents of the property owned by Mr and Mrs Rigg. </PARA>
<PARA> In this matter, as in other matters you tabled in the Senate, the Bank is concerned that it needs to have had resort, even by merely appointing a receiver of rents, to its securities when its customers are unable to meet their liabilities. </PARA>
<PARA> There has been no impropriety or undue haste in the Bank's resort to its securities. The debt to the Bank is now more than twice what it was initially intended to be. The customers incurred expenses in constructing their factories which they did not foresee. The Bank assisted them by increasing the level of accommodation to them and by extending the expected term of the accommodation by over two years. That measure of support by the Bank for its customers when they encounter difficulties is totally inconsistent with the accusations which have been made against the Bank. </PARA>
<PARA> It should also be noted that the Bank has made no move to take possession of or to sell either of the properties which are mortgaged to it. Two years after Mr and Mrs Rigg agreed to sell property to reduce the level of their indebtedness to the Bank and more than 12 months after default by them, the Bank is still giving them an opportunity to sell their properties, or to otherwise service their liabilities to the Bank, rather than the Bank take action to sell those properties as mortgagee. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="LJ4">Senator STONE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the Senate. The letters in question are the results of the Commonwealth Bank's own internal investigations of the allegations made against the bank by four clients of the bank. I will not name the particular unhappy individuals concerned. I think they have brought no credit on their own heads in the long run by embarking upon this venture. They have done themselves no good by putting themselves in the hands of a political novice such as Senator McLean. The plain fact of the matter is that any objective reading of the documents concerned will show the kind of people with whom Senator McLean has been dealing. It will show the degree of substance in the complaints that those people have been bringing forward. Material of this kind, having been brought to Senator McLean's attention, is exactly the kind of material that he could have received if he had inquired of the Commonwealth Bank in the first place. Perhaps it is the kind of sobering dash of facts, added to all the earlier wild fantasies to which he has been succumbing, which has given him some pause for thought, when he wakes up in the middle of the night, as to whether this matter upon which he has embarked was quite as wise politically, even as he first thought it to be.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator McLean, partly no doubt with those self-doubts in mind, has sought in the motion now before us to extend the scope of this inquiry into a much wider area of the whole conduct of the banking system. He has picked up the usual rabble-rousing cries in this regard about the fact that some of the banks have sought to impose special charges upon small depositors whose accounts, from a business point of view, are simply not worth keeping. Those accounts cost much more to keep than they bring by way of return to the banks. Senator McLean would like to see the banking system run as a kind of social service, like everything else in the country according to the Australian Democrats. But unfortunately that is not the way a business can operate. Banks have to make profits, like other businesses. </PARA>
<PARA> It is of no material benefit to the conduct of economic debate in this country and in the Senate to have senators such as Senator McLean giving voice to the kind of rabble- rousing garbage of which some of his newly acquired friends in the Australian League of Rights have been masters for decades. Senator McLean told us this morning of a substantial public meeting that he attended in Adelaide recently which he found out, or so he says by way of a response to an interjection from myself earlier this morning, to have been convened by the National Secretary of the League of Rights. He wonders how all of a sudden he has been taken up by all these people who are interested and on his side. I can tell Senator McLean that anybody who wants to get out in this country and start talking the populist rubbish that he has given vent to in this place this morning on this particular area of his remarks is going to get a lot of friends. They will all come out of the woodwork and they will all be as ratbag in these matters and their opinions as he is, I regret to say. The next thing we will be talking about is the Jewish conspiracy or some other piece of equally--</PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Senator McLean" NAMEID="3I4">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="3I4">Senator McLean</NAME></TALKER>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="LJ4">Senator STONE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I acknowledge that Senator McLean did not refer to it. I am simply saying that the path he has been so unwise as to launch himself upon will lead him into that before he is through, because these are the people with whom he is now finding himself in association. These are the people who are out to create a feeling in this country that we are in the hands of a great financial conspiracy and that anybody in this country who is down on his luck, who has made a mistake, made a mistake of business judgment or made a bad borrowing deal, has not got himself to blame; there must be somebody out there who is responsible. It is the banks; and if it is not the banks, it is the Jews, or it is somebody, but it is not he.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I do not want to go on down that road because, as I said, Senator McLean has not got to that point-at least, not yet. But if he cannot see that, he ought to take a deep breath and think again, because that is where he is going in the company he is now keeping on the matter. </PARA>
<PARA> As Senator McLean said, we began with two extremely serious allegations. We had allegations of corrupt practices widespread throughout the Commonwealth Bank of Australia. Secondly, we had the allegation that this alleged fact was well known to the Australian Federal Police, who had collaborated in the same corruption and who were doing their best to cover it up, notwithstanding the crusade on the matter which Senator McLean was now launching. Senator McLean complained, with some justice, that when he first sought to raise the matter with the Minister for Justice, Senator Tate, last December, his letter was not acknowledged. I think he has a legitimate ground for complaint in that regard. He complained further that when he sought an oral briefing from the Minister's officers and from the Federal Police, that oral briefing was denied. Whether that is a legitimate complaint I do not know, because I expect that the Minister and his advisers by that time had had some opportunity to sum up the quality of the kind of so-called evidence that Senator McLean was producing. I suppose they had made the kind of judgment that, if I had been in their shoes, I might well have made myself-namely, `This bloke has got hold of some ratbag material from the usual kind of people whom we always see and why should we waste our time further by giving him a briefing on this subject?' That may have been too high-handed an attitude on the part of the Minister's advisers but I understand their coming to that view. Nevertheless, I am prepared to give Senator McLean the benefit of the doubt on that and to say that perhaps he was treated hardly in that regard. However, that is about the point at which my sympathy for the senator stops, because, undeterred-and undeterred also by the fact that he had not made the slightest effort to check his facts or even to obtain any commentary upon those alleged facts from the people against whom the allegations were being made-he plunged on regardless by putting down affidavits in this place and repeated the offence again when the Senate resumed earlier in the current autumn session. </PARA>
<PARA> As a matter of fact, some of these allegations were brought to the attention of the National Farmers Federation. The National Farmers Federation-independent of the banks; it had nothing to do with the banks-employed consultants to advise it on these matters. I am advised that the view which those consultants arrived at was that, far from having been too hard on the borrowers concerned by foreclosing too early, if anything the charge to which the banks would be liable was that they had not foreclosed early enough. As a consequence, the unfortunate individuals concerned have got deeper into debt than they would otherwise have been allowed to go. That was a view arrived at, as I say, not by the banks but, I am advised, by the National Farmers Federation. </PARA>
<PARA> I have directed my remarks at what I call these wild allegations by Senator McLean which go back to last December. More recently, Senator McLean has taken up the cause, which is a much more substantial and more respectable cause, of a number of borrowers in this country-not merely rural borrowers, but others-who, in 1985 and thereafter, either sought to or were induced to enter into foreign currency denominated borrowings from the banks. They borrowed in Swiss francs at what looked like an attractive interest rate at the time. Of course, subsequently, when the Australian dollar fell out of bed under the policies of this Government, those people were left with very much increased debts. </PARA>
<PARA> There has been, as always in these matters, a whole set of individual circumstances. Each case is different. Some of the people concerned undoubtedly made very bad judgments, were greedy, thought there was a free lunch to be had and, after all, why should they not have one. Having found that the lunch was not free, afterwards they complained that they had been badly advised. That is one category of such borrowers. </PARA>
<PARA> There was, however, another category of such borrowers: people who were very badly advised by some of the bank managers concerned. To say that they were badly advised is not to say that the bank managers concerned were corrupt, that they were guilty of peculation, fraud or any of the other wild charges that Senator McLean has been throwing around. Those people in that latter category probably have-indeed, many of them have been found by the courts to have-an action in law for a failing of duty of care on the part of bank managers and others who advised to that effect. There have been a number of cases of that kind, some of which have been settled out of court and some of which have resulted in court decisions, some in favour of the banks and some against the banks. That is the proper place for those matters to be settled and they are in the course of being settled and determined in that category. Certainly, the last place where one would hope to settle such matters would be in a Senate committee of inquiry. It would be a total travesty of our whole system to take such matters out of the hands of the courts and hand them over to the television cameras, amply guided by Senator McLean who no doubt wants to be re-elected and wants a bit of help in doing so. I say in passing that he will need all the help he can get. </PARA>
<PARA> I conclude by saying that I make an exception for that latter category of borrowings which is a specific area of banking transactions which has given rise to some quite legitimate concern in recent years. But those matters are already being handled, as they have to be, through processes of either direct negotiations between the borrowers and the banks concerned or, if those negotiations cannot be fruitfully concluded, in civil actions in the courts, that being the only place where they can be legitimately resolved. I regard this motion by Senator McLean as disgraceful, both in its origins and in its further expansion and widening. We shall certainly not support it. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;in reply-Quite obviously, I would like to reply to a number of points made by each of the last three speakers. I will start with the Minister for Finance, Senator Walsh. His opening remarks were fairly typical of his approach to debate in this chamber. He maligned individuals on the Australian Democrats bench. He began one of his usual, predictable assaults on us and then moved on to some of the more substantive matters.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The first substantive point that he made was that a lot of these allegations are unsubstantiated. That is not true. I do not believe that Senator Walsh is in a position to make that observation. Senator Messner and Senator Stone were also not in a position to say that the allegations that I made in this chamber were unsubstantiated. It has been my experience, having had hundreds of hours of discussions with these people, that some of them are extremely thorough. One of the problems that I had was to try to avoid being drawn into the mass of substantiating documentation which many of these people have accumulated, very diligently filed and marshalled in support of their arguments, often in quite prolonged and protracted court cases. To say that they were unsubstantiated is just pure speculation on the part of the Minister, Senator Messner and Senator Stone. It is a point to be made but it is an invalid one. It is of no consequence. It was said that I made no attempt to check these allegations. Once again, they do not know whether I made any attempt to check on them--</PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="3I4">Senator McLEAN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Stone does not know whether I looked into those documents. He does not know how many hours of discussion I had with those people. He does not have a clue as to what degree I checked the evidence that was brought to me-often in vast volumes by the people who made these allegations. Once again, it is a point to be made but it has no substance.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I think the point that honourable senators were really trying to make was that there was no attempt by me to check the records of the banks; to go to the other side of the story. I will come to that point in a moment because there has not been any attempt on their part to go to the other side of the story. There has been no such attempt on the Minister's part or on the police's part. It happens to be a reality of life that if a person who takes a position has very limited resources and time, he probably will not satisfy a whim, an emotional requirement or a debating point about the other side of the argument. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister pretended to know something about my background by saying that I did not have any background in business. He does not happen to know that I have been a small businessman and that I believe that this matter is substantially about the plight of small business people in this country and their plight at the hands of the banks and their financiers. I have participated in small business probably virtually non-stop for the last 20 years. The fact that the Minister does not know that is his problem. </PARA>
<PARA> He made the point that there are no grounds for criminal action. That is a point that the Australian Federal Police (AFP) have made-that there are no grounds for criminal action as opposed to civil action in many of these cases. I suggest that the Minister, Senator Messner and Senator Stone are probably being a little premature in making that judgment. There may well yet prove to be grounds for criminal action in relation to some of these cases. I can tell honourable senators that while the AFP and the banks say that they have thoroughly investigated these matters since I raised them, they have not done so. On 2 March I rang all of the six people affected and whose affidavits I have tabled and asked them whether their banks had subsequently come to them and carried out further investigations, or whether the AFP had, during that period, come to them-the accusers; the people who had made the allegations-and carried out further investigations. The answer was no. In the last 36 hours my staff have rung or attempted to contact all 27 of the people about whom I have now tabled affidavits and asked them, `Since the affidavits were tabled, have the Federal Police or the bank carried out this so-called thorough investigation that they or certainly Mr Cullen and Mr Sanders, claim has been carried out, to prove that there is no substance in these allegations?'. As of last night 16 of the 27 had said no. So these judgments that were made here by the Minister and the other speakers this morning, that there is no substance in these allegations, may well be a little premature. This is fairly early on in the process. It is early times yet. </PARA>
<PARA> I ask the Minister, Senator Messner and Senator Stone whether they have actually read the affidavits that I tabled in the Senate, because they are basing their rejection of the assertions in those affidavits on arguments which presuppose that they have read them. Almost every one of those affidavits I have tabled have appendages, but not substantiating documents. Those substantiating documents are with me, and none of those people who participated in the debate this morning have come to me and said, `Can I look into these substantiating documents?'. They have not been thorough in their investigation, but they reserve the right to stand up here and claim that I have not been thorough in my investigation. I have just said that the police and the banks have not gone back to the documents. Yet these senators are basing their rejection of these arguments this morning on the fact that somehow or other they are holier than thou because of their thoroughness. I know for a fact that yesterday afternoon Senator Messner contacted my office and asked for a brief summary. I said that there was not one-a summary about the length of a page was asked for, so that presumably he could prepare himself adequately to deflect these arguments in this chamber today. </PARA>
<PARA> This has been a good debate but it has been fairly lacking in substance. These debaters are clever. Of course they are experienced senators-experienced in the process of debating. </PARA>

<PARA> I move on to Senator Messner's arguments. Senator Messner developed the theme that committees are not adequate to deal with these sorts of things as they are not courts of law. It was never intended that the committee be a court of law. A court of law addresses itself to the details of a specific case, one on one. It is intended that the Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs would address generalised principles and observations about the state of banking in Australia today. To argue that I propose that the Committee function as a court of law is simply either a misunderstanding of what is being proposed or a lack of perception of what the Committee is about. </PARA>
<PARA> Today Senator Messner is rejecting the credibility of committees to pursue these things, yet I anticipate that tomorrow he will be calling upon the Australian Democrats to support his Party in referring to the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade a matter involving corruption, the misappropriation of hundreds of millions of dollars and national security. I refer to the Opposition's request for us to support it on the referral of the matter of the National Safety Council of Australia, Victorian Division. So he stands up here today and attempts to negate the credibility of committees, and tomorrow he is going to want one. What is more, he is going to want our support in getting it. </PARA>

He groped around in the air and tried to find something to reject, and he came up with the cruelty line-he suggested that somehow or other I was engaged in a cruel hoax because these people had approached me and alleged that their banks had exploited their circumstances. Many of them are financially, emotionally, domestically and maritally ruined, and they came to me. I will tell honourable senators where they had been beforehand. They had been to both of the major parties with these sorts of issues. The first day that these issues arrived on my desk, the people who brought them to me had already been to coalition party senators. They asked me to bring them to the Senate and to do certain things with them, yet Senator Messner grasps at this argument that somehow or other I am engaged in some sort of cruel hoax to take advantage of the circumstances of these people.</PARA></TALK.START>

He said that I have smeared Mr Don Sanders, the Managing Director of the Commonwealth Bank, and others. I do not know what he means by `smeared'. I believe I have made quite objective, real, honest observations about what they have said and how they have reacted to this situation. The word `smear' is emotive. Its use was obviously designed to have debating impact, but it is in no way related to the way in which I have interacted with these people. Yesterday afternoon, for about an hour and a half in my office I had very intense discussions with three senior members of the banking establishment. It was an honest, frank, and worthwhile discussion. They will be mentioning my name today in the media and I will be mentioning theirs. Senator Stone knows as well as I do that that is the price of public office. I am not only talking about parliamentary office; I am talking about office in the most powerful institutions of this land. Let us not pretend that this Parliament is the most powerful institution in the land. It pales into insignificance alongside the banks. If we had not mentioned some names, the people who are listening to this debate today would not know who were in control of this extraordinary dimension of their lives.

They have gone back to the drawer from which their case came in the first place.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="3I4">Senator McLEAN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, I could have acknowledged it. I chose not to become involved in lengthy, meaningless and valueless written debate between the banks and me. That was an objective judgment on my part. Senator Stone says that I have not checked the facts. I have been as thorough as the police have been in checking the facts. I have been interviewed by the Australian Federal Police on this matter. They came to my office in Gosford. We talked about it. That was the day before the Minister said in his press release that there was no substance in my allegations. The police said to me that they had investigated one case-the Taylor case. That is one case out of six. They said they had found no grounds for criminal action, but they acknowledged the fact that it was before the Supreme Court of New South Wales on civil grounds. I do not know whether those Australian Federal Police officers were uninformed but they told me the day before the Minister said that there was no substance in these things that they had partially investigated only one of the six cases. Since then I have tabled details of another 27 cases. Yesterday 16 of those people-and I have not been able to contact the rest-told me that the Federal Police had not been near them. So it would appear that there is some rather inadequate fact checking not only, perhaps, on my part, but also on Senator Stone's part, on the police's part, on the Minister's part and on the bank's part. Mr Sanders has responded to Senator Stone in relation to three of the 17 Commonwealth Bank cases which I have tabled. He has not responded in relation to others. Perhaps he will some time in the future.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator Stone then went on with a most extraordinary outburst on how I might, if I am not careful, some time down the line become a conspiracy theorist. That was just speculative rubbish. I have stood in public places, including the public meeting in Adelaide last Wednesday, and told people that I do not put any value on these conspiracy theories. I think when there are three politicians in one room there is a conspiracy. That has been happening since the beginning of time. If getting together and planning to achieve power and make money is conspiracy, it is all around us. I think Senator Stone is the mythologist on conspiracy, not me. To spend five minutes haranguing me about the possibility that if I am not careful I will be drawn into some zionist or some fabian theory of conspiracy is, to use the honourable senator's expression, unworthy of him.

Many of those victims have formed themselves into the Foreign Currency Borrowers Association, to which I spoke as a keynote speaker in Sydney last Saturday. I think I am well informed about the experiences of those people who borrowed overseas currency on the recommendation of their banks. In fact, I drew attention to an anomaly in some taxing aspects of those borrowings just last week.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I have deliberately taken time to make these very important points to the Senate. I have deliberately taken weeks to report to the Senate on the serious allegations of corrupt practices in banking and on the failure of the Federal Police adequately to pursue these allegations. I do not apologise to the Senate for having brought them here. I believe that is what I was elected to do; yet I am being accused by these respondents today of somehow or other being irresponsible, of lacking thoroughness and of other things which have been thrown at me. I believe I am honour bound to do what I have done since October in relation to this issue. I make no apologies for that. I believe the tabling of the affidavits was appropriate. I will be tabling more tomorrow and more next week. I will be building up the bank of information available to honourable senators who care enough to look at it. I do not believe that any one of the three who have spoken on this matter today have seriously done that. I will be tabling more affidavits and I will be making another attempt to have the matter referred to a Senate standing committee. I have confidence in Senate standing committees, even if Senator Messner does not. I do not happen to believe that they have to act as courts of law, as he has attempted to convince us they do. I happen to believe that the Standing Committee on Environment, Recreation and the Arts, which is investigating the use of drugs in sport, is rendering a service to this nation, not a disservice. I happen to believe that it is appropriate that the whole question of the National Safety Council of Australia be referred to a committee. In fact, in my own party room yesterday I argued that case, and it was supported by my colleagues. I happen to believe that the plight of Aboriginal people in this nation was quite appropriately referred to a Senate subcommittee and that the Senate handled that reference responsibly. Unlike Senator Messner, who contradicted himself in a matter of two minutes on the issue of the credibility and viability of Senate standing committees, I happen to have confidence in them. </PARA>
<PARA> I have responsibly brought this incredibly serious issue before the Senate. I have responsibly used my parliamentary privilege, which provides the opportunity for senators to do things in this place that they cannot do elsewhere. I do not believe that I have abused that privilege. It is extended to all of us. It takes courage to use it. I believe that I have used it responsibly. I am prepared to live with the consequences-and, obviously, I will live with the consequences-of having done so. </PARA>
<PARA> I am drawing to the attention of the Australian people the fact that we have a crisis of confidence in banking. This has been evidenced to me in three ways. Allegations have been brought to me of examples of deliberate asset stripping by senior officers in banks. Assertions and allegations have been made about incompetence and negligence in relation to foreign currency borrowings, which has resulted in approximately 1,500 previously successful business people being made bankrupt on the advice of their banks. They all had to be successful in order to qualify for a loan of half a million dollars on the advice of their banks. The third dimension of this matter is premature rural fore- closures. People on the land have always had special needs in relation to credit. They have always suffered as a result of certain factors, and a special bank was established to cater for their needs. That bank has shifted its focus to the normal banking sector, and those people have lived with the consequences of what we believe has been bad banking support in recent years. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Stone and the National Farmers Federation are quite entitled to challenge the focus of the Mitchelmore investigation. A counter report was made into this matter. But the reality is that both were investigating a problem. The two bodies concerned reported differently on the problem but they both acknowledged that there was a problem. They said that the causes of the problem were different but they both acknowledged that there was a problem. The problem is still there, and it is folly to pretend that it is not. </PARA>
<PARA> I think that the Australian electorate will judge harshly both the Government and the Opposition for refusing today to refer to the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs grave and serious allegations and to ask the Committee to look into a major social crisis in our nation-refusing because they do not have the moral fortitude to take on the banks. </PARA>

<PARA> ``(2) If a provision referred to in section 21A of the Christmas Island Act 1958 is in operation, this Act does not apply to anything dealt with by the provision.''. </PARA>
<PARA> (2) Page 3, clause 6, definition of ``Commonwealth authority'', paragraph (a) lines 1 to 3, leave out the paragraph, insert the following paragraph:</PARA>
<PARA> ``(a) that is incorporated by or under a law of the Commonwealth or by or under a law of a Territory, other than:</PARA>

<PARA>The need for amendments (1) and (2) arises out of the passage of self-government legislation for the Australian Capital Territory. Now that the Lands Acquisition Bill will not commence operation until after the establishment, I hope, of local governing administration in the ACT, subclause 5 (2) has been amended to delete reference to sections 7a and 9a of the Seat of Government (Administration) Act 1910. The reference is no longer necessary because the ACT Administration will not be bound by the requirements of the Bill, given that the definition of an authority in the Bill does not include a body politic. However, amendment No. 2 amends the definition of a Commonwealth authority in clause 6 to identify that statutory authorities which are the responsibility of or established by the ACT Administration are not bound by the requirements of the Bill. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to make a couple of remarks which relate primarily to clauses 22 and 24, which come within this group of clauses. These clauses relate to the pre-acquisition declarations which are to be made under the Lands Acquisition Act. The pre-acquisition declaration which is provided for in clause 22 provides that in a number of areas there may be some review and some appeal against Ministers' decisions. However, subclause 6 of clause 22 provides that, if the Minister includes in a declaration a statement under subsection 3-that is to say, the Minister believes that the land is suitable for use or for development of use for a particular public purpose-he may also include a statement that it is essential for the implementation of the policy referred to in the statement under subsection 3 that the interest in the land be acquired, and the declaration is, for that reason, not subject to review by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Clause 24 provides that the Minister may indicate that there is an urgent necessity for the acquisition of land in question and that it would be contrary to the public interest for the acquisition to be delayed by the need for the making of a pre-acquisition declaration and its possible reconsideration and review. </PARA>
<PARA> I wish to draw attention to the comments made on this matter by the Land Acquisition Reform Committee and to seek the Minister's comments on them. The Land Acquisition Reform Committee indicates that it is disappointed that the Bill has not been further amended in a way which would prevent the Government withholding the process which sets the Act in motion for any length of time, thereby potentially disadvantaging the people whose land will eventually be acquired. The Committee draws attention to the injustice which is illustrated in the case which I referred to at some length yesterday, namely, at Badgerys Creek since the then Minister for Telecommunications and Aviation Support made the first public announcement on 17 February 1986 and informed landholders in letters dated 24 February 1986 and later that land there is likely to be acquired by the Commonwealth. </PARA>
<PARA> The Land Acquisition Reform Committee makes a point on which I invite the Minister's comments. The Committee says that although the new Bill is amended in clause 22, the declaration that land is suitable for acquisition uses the phrase `is considering' the acquisition and `appears to be suitable'. The supporting speech made by the Minister in the House of Representatives on 20 October 1988 indicates the declaration is not to be made early to enable the Minister's proposal to be tested and effectively reviewed as the Australian Law Reform Commission recommends. </PARA>
<PARA> Indeed, as the penultimate step to acquisition, the new process-the pre-acquisition declaration-becomes just another name for the old notice to treat. While ever this flaw is perpetuated the many excellent provisions of the new Bill which come into play after the pre-acquisition declaration has been made remain out of the reach of affected landholders, who will be unjustly victimised up to this point in the process, as they have been in the past, as has been indicated by the saga of the acquisition of land at Badgerys Creek. That concern has been expressed. I would be grateful for the Minister's comments in relation to that particular matter. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have some material which I hope answers Senator Puplick's question. Clauses 22 and 24 provide, amongst other things, that a Minister can decide to proceed with an acquisition without following the pre-acquisition procedures that would give an owner the right of appeal to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal (AAT) to the decision to acquire. The Law Reform Commission, in its report, recommended that there should be two instances where pre-acquisition declaration need not be given and where there would be no right of appeal to the AAT about the decision to acquire. These were in cases of urgency or when national security requirements prevented the disclosure of details of a proposed land use.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Administrative Review Council recommended that a third situation should have a constraint on appeal to the AAT, namely where the Minister is satisfied and certifies that it is essential that the particular land be acquired. Circumstances where this provision might be used would arise infrequently, but, for example, the Commonwealth may need to acquire land in a unique location for an aircraft navigation aid. The Council expressed the view that in such instances appeal to the AAT should be precluded provided the Minister makes a public declaration that the acquisition is essential. Such a declaration would indicate the Government's commitment to the acquisition. Hence review by the AAT would be redundant, given that the Government is not bound to accept a recommendation by the AAT. The Council believed that it was highly desirable that the Minister remain politically accountable for such decisions. </PARA>
<PARA> The essentiality provision was cited twice in the initial Bill at clause 22 (4), where a pre-acquisition declaration would be issued and an appeal to the Minister to reconsider would be available but appeal to the AAT would not be available, and, secondly, in clause 24 (1) (b), where there would be no pre-acquisition declaration and no appeal to the Minister or the AAT. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill has now been amended to delete the more severe of these provisions at clause 24 (l) (b). However, the Government is of the view that clause 22 (4)-clause 22 (6) in the revised Bill-should remain unaltered because, in its present form, the need for public accountability is met. If a Minister chose to use the provision, he would not be able to do so without the details of what he was doing becoming public. A pre-acquisition declaration would be issued to anyone affected by acquisition and copies of the declaration would have to be published in the Commonwealth of Australia Gazette and in a newspaper circulated in the area where the land was located. </PARA>
<PARA> Furthermore, if an owner of land being acquired using any of the above three provisions-that is, urgency, national security or essentiality-believed that the provision was being misused, he or she would be able to appeal to the Federal Court under the provisions of the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act 1977. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have a fairly complex matter to raise in relation primarily to clause 40 which arises from some correspondence which has passed backwards and forwards between the Land Acquisition Reform Committee (LARC) and the Minister for Administrative Services, Mr West. The Committee transmitted to the Minister some advice which it had received from His Honour Mr Justice Wilcox. The reply of the Minister, which is dated 6 March 1989, is in fact part of the document from which Senator Ray just quoted in relation to the matter I raised about clauses 22 and 24 and subsequent comment from Mr Justice Wilcox which proposes that the Government consider introducing a new subclause 40 (6). I will take the Committee through that and seek the Minister's response to the recommendation made by Mr Justice Wilcox in relation to clause 40 (6). Clause 40 deals with the question of acquisition by agreement rather than contested acquisition. In a letter that Mr Justice Wilcox sent to Mr Duff, the Chairman of the Land Acquisition Reform Committee, on 14 February 1989, His Honour makes this point:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>. . . I am concerned to note the introduction into the Bill of cl. 40 (5) (d) and (6). The Law Reform Commission thought that it was most undesirable for even ``voluntary'' agreements to be entered into prior to the service of a pre-acquisition declaration. Our reasoning was that, in practice, such agreements are not truly voluntary, an announcement of ultimate acquisition having been made and people often being unable to accommodate the delay in the normal processes of acquisition. Furthermore, there is a very grave danger, particularly in the case of a big project such as an airport, of the Government acquiring by ``voluntary'' agreements a patchwork of properties so that, when a pre-acquisition declaration is ultimately served and the question of the project is up for review, the process will be embarrassed by the fact that the Government has already laid out very substantial funds. Ideally, it would have been good simply to say that there must be a pre-acquisition declaration in each case. </PARA>
<PARA> However, it was pointed out to the Law Reform Commission that the Commonwealth often acquires small parcels of land by truly voluntary negotiation, even a single parcel such as a house for a Commonwealth officer. It was argued, and we agreed, that it would be absurd for a pre-acquisition declaration to have to be served if the vendor actually had the property listed with an agent for sale and was extremely willing to sell. Consequently we inserted these exceptions. They have been reproduced, as paras (a), (b) and (c) of cl. 40 (4), in the Bill as it now stands. </PARA>
<PARA> It is not clear to me what purpose is intended to be served by the insertion of a provision for a certificate that the acquisition would be a ``standard commercial transaction''. </PARA>
<PARA>That phrase is to be found in clause 40 (5) (d). His Honour continues:</PARA>
<PARA>Obviously this is not intended to cover a case where the property is already listed for sale. Those cases are already covered. Therefore, ``standard commercial transaction'' must refer to a case in which the Commonwealth has approached an owner who has not put his or her property on the market. The Bill does not specify any criteria for determining what is a ``standard commercial transaction''. Does this merely mean that the form of contract is the usual real estate form of contract and the price is one which has been determined by negotiation? If so, the exception would open the way to the very problems which I have already mentioned. If the phrase means something different from this, that is more restricted, it would be desirable for the Bill to make this clear. </PARA>
<PARA>His Honour went on to recommend that the Land Acquisition Reform Committee should press for the deletion from the Bill of subclauses 40 (5) (c) and 40 (6). </PARA>
<PARA> In relation to representations made on that matter, Mr West, in a letter of 6 March, addressed to Mr Duff of the Land Acquisition Reform Committee, made the following point:</PARA>
<PARA>Regarding the standard commercial certification at cls. 40 (5) (d) and 40 (6) the Law Reform Commission (LRC) was concerned to protect the interests of persons dealing with the Commonwealth in property transactions and that is the main reason why the Commission recommended that owners should be issued a pre-acquisition declaration advising them of the Commonwealth's intentions and providing to them the right to seek an independent review of the Government's decision. The Commission was concerned that such a declaration should be served prior to acquisitions by agreement as well as by compulsory process to cover situations in which whilst the vendor agrees to the sale he might do so because he might feel coerced to agree or else have his property compulsorily acquired. </PARA>
<PARA>The Minister goes on:</PARA>
<PARA>The Government agrees with that view and the Bill provides that this would occur. However the Commission recognised that such a procedure would not be necessary where a vendor was already in the market having advertised his property for sale or lease because in such situations the vendor presumably would be well advised regarding values and would not experience coercion to sell to the Commonwealth. </PARA>
<PARA>The Minister goes on to explain in some detail that the Commonwealth believes that the vendor has a choice in this matter and that the legislation has, as a result, been drawn in the way in which it has. However, on further examination of the Minister's reply, in a letter dated 21 March Mr Justice Wilcox makes the following points, which I simply read into the record and on which I seek the Minister's comment:</PARA>
<PARA>I do appreciate the point made by the Minister regarding cl.40 (5) (d) and (6). I think that it is correct to say that there would be circumstances, not itemised in cl.40 (5) (a), (b) or (c) where property was truly available on the market irrespective of any intended acquisition on behalf of the Commonwealth. The Minister has furnished an example of one such case. I agree that the logic of the Law Reform Commission recommendations would extend to covering this situation. My apprehension, which I think that you share-</PARA>
<PARA>that is, that Mr Duff shares-</PARA>
<PARA>is that the certification procedure might enable ``the tail to wag the dog'' in the case of a substantial acquisition program. In my opinion this would be a misuse of the procedure, but it is one which may occur under some administrations. This has caused me to wonder whether it might be possible to tighten the wording, so as to avoid abuse, but, nonetheless, so as to cover the problem which concerns the Minister. </PARA>
<PARA>The Minister has in mind a situation where an interest in land would be available on the market irrespective of any proposal on behalf of the Commonwealth or of a Commonwealth authority to acquire that interest. The problem with the current clause is that it does not take in that element. It simply restricts consideration to the question whether the parties would be dealing with each other on equal terms; whatever this means in the context of a dealing where one party is the Commonwealth Government with compulsory acquisition powers. Perhaps the concern which I have previously expressed could be overcome if the concept which is favoured by the Minister was expressly built in to clause cl. 40 (6). This could be done by changing that sub-clause to read as follows:</PARA>
<PARA> ``(6) If the Minister is satisfied that a particular interest in land would have been, or would have been likely to become, available in the market irrespective of any proposal on behalf of an acquiring authority to acquire that interest and that the acquisition of that interest would amount to a normal commercial transaction between parties dealing with each other on equal terms, the Minister may give a certificate stating that the acquisition of the interest by the acquiring authority would be a standard commercial transaction.''</PARA>
<PARA>It seems to me that that is a very reasonable proposition in terms of a potential rewording of subclause (6) of clause 40. I do not believe that to accommodate that particular suggestion would cause the Government any great problem. I would be grateful for the Minister's advice on that matter. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I could go into a lot of detail on this particular matter, but I will come to the end first, if you like. We are aware of Mr Justice Wilcox's suggestion in this matter. On the whole, we do not believe it is necessary. We believe that it is already covered within the existing Lands Acquisition Bill. However, I would also have to say that an assurance has been given that a Bill of this sort of complexity that has been hanging around for so long will need to be reviewed as it starts to operate and probably within two years. We know that some amendments are going to be necessary. This is a matter which we would seek to monitor to see whether it is covered adequately under the current Bill. If it is not, then the Bill will need to be amended. We believe it is. Until one actually sucks and sees it is very hard to tell whether it will be covered or not. On this occasion though, on balance, we definitely think it is covered enough in the Bill. But we do give the assurance that if problems arise out of it in the general review of the Bill we will amend accordingly.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="EF4">Senator CHANEY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is addressed to the Minister for Justice. I remind the Minister that on 8 March I asked him whether, in view of the publication in the West Australian newspaper of purported extracts from the National Companies and Securities Commission report into the Rothwells Ltd collapse, the Government would agree to table a suitably edited version of the report in the Senate. I interpolate there that the need for editing is simply because one would not wish to prejudice prosecutions. The Minister will recall saying that he would consider the request and that it could be forwarded to the Chairman of the Ministerial Council of Attorneys-General, which received the report, the Council having agreed the report should be tabled in the Western Australian Parliament. Is the Minister aware that despite the resumption of the State Parliament in Western Australia the report, or a version of it which would not affect any possible prosecutions, has still not seen the light of day in Perth? Is he aware of speculation in today's Australian newspaper that, despite its apparent support for the release of the report, the Dowding Government is working behind the scenes to prevent its tabling because of the likely embarrassment it and its predecessor government will face? What has the Minister done since I raised this matter with him? In view of the tardiness of the Dowding Government and justified doubt about its motives, will the Commonwealth as a matter of urgency agree to table the report in the Senate or will the Commonwealth continue to collaborate in a cover-up?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="NJ4">Senator TATE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;First of all, I utterly refute any suggestion that the Commonwealth is engaged in collaborating with the Western Australian Government in any attempt to cover up the report of the investigation into Rothwells. The interim report that has been prepared for the Ministerial Council was considered by the Ministerial Council on 2 March. I recall that Senator Chaney's question followed that. The Western Australian Government has directed the National Companies and Securities Commission (NCSC) to arrange for a special investigation to be conducted into the Rothwells affairs. It will be recalled that a prominent Perth QC, Mr Malcolm McCusker, was appointed to carry out that special investigation. The Ministerial Council agreed to the NCSC's interim report being released in the Western Australian Parliament provided that such publication would not prejudice the interests of the administration of justice.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> An independent counsel's opinion, that of, I think, Mr Walker, QC, from the Melbourne Bar, was sought on that particular matter. That opinion has been obtained on whether the report would prejudice any future prosecutions. That opinion has been quite properly considered by the Ministerial Council. As senators will know, the Ministerial Council is, as I have mentioned many times before, composed of Attorneys-General not only from the Federal Government but from every other jurisdiction around Australia. It is at that level that the question of the release of the report will be taken. Obviously, that particular decision is one for the Council. It is not one which ultimately the Western Australian Government in that sense can veto. It can have an influence on the deliberations of the Council. I certainly do not accept that any allegation or press speculation attributing certain motives and a desire to cover up or to somehow edit this report in any way other than to protect the course of the prosecutions that might be undertaken has any substance.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am aware that Senator Harradine claimed during an urgency debate on 1 March and in a press release on the same day that `90 per cent of all families with dependent children had suffered a substantial drop in living standards under this Government'. He also claimed that only about 7 per cent of families with dependent children had benefited from the families package of this Government. These claims are fanciful. They do not reveal the true record. It is very important for the true record to be put in response to these particular claims. In fact, Senator Harradine's claim is based on one major misconception. That misconception hides the fact that almost a quarter of Australian families with dependent children have benefited under this Government. The misconception lies in Senator Harradine's seeming ignorance of the fact that the families package has provided substantial increases in payments not only to those families receiving the family allowance supplement (FAS) but also to pensioners and beneficiaries with dependent children. By not including that particular component Senator Harradine excludes over 440,000 pensioner and beneficiary families who have received the additional pension or benefit for their children at the same rate as FAS. It is also important in this context to remember the amount of that payment. For younger children it is $24 per week and for teenagers it is $31 per week.</PARA></TALK.START>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="XE4">Senator BOLKUS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Harradine also made the point that families have not benefited under this Government. The crucial factor is that since this Government came to power payments and benefits for children have increased in real terms by 61 per cent for younger children and by 108 per cent for teenage children. Since 1987 payments for children paid to low income families have increased by $7 a week for children under 13 and by $14 a week for teenage children. Overall, therefore, these increases have benefited over 577,000 low income families, with over one million dependent children benefiting from them. As Senator Chaney might have asked, this represents 30.7 per cent of all families receiving family allowance benefits and almost a quarter of all families with dependent children. We should note another benchmark in terms of what the situation was like when we took over. When the families package was introduced the child payment for a low income family represented only 11.9 per cent of the combined married rate pension. In less than two years it has now changed. For children under 13 it is now 14.1 per cent and for children between the ages of 13 and 15 it is 17.5 per cent.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There have been a number of initiatives that are central to this Government's achievements in this area. The most important one is this Government's commitment to low income parents to set benchmarks for the level of payments to children, particularly to teenage children. As indicated by the Prime Minister in 1987, these benchmarks are 15 per cent of the combined married rate pension for younger children and 20 per cent for teenage children. The Government has also committed itself to indexing these payments for cost of living increases. As the Minister for Social Security has said quite recently, on a number of occasions, this Government will meet its child poverty benchmarks this year. It is also important in this context to recognise other gains in the disposable incomes of families that have accrued under this Government. Importantly--</PARA>

The Minister is clearly going on extensively beyond the need to answer the question put to him. I think he should be called to order and senators given an opportunity to ask questions. I hesitate to say that he is debating the question because he is delivering it in such a boring monotone. In reality, apart from his style, he is debating the question.

In fact, he has probably wasted more time of the Senate by his churlish, pathetic behaviour. What I was going to say, in response to the allegations and in answering the question, was that we should also take into account the Government's record in employment of 1.3 million jobs. We should also take into account the fact that Medicare is of great assistance to low income earners. We should also take into account the fact that Austudy payments for secondary students have also contributed greatly to children living with families, particularly low income families.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade. I remind the Minister of what he said during a television program on 5 March in relation to Papua New Guinea (PNG). He said that the military riot was essentially a matter of industrial relations and, I quote:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>. . . obviously got a little out of hand and obviously is a little hairy when you find it happening in a military context. But the stories that were floating around about imminent coups and so on, I think were very wide off the mark.</PARA>
<PARA>Does the Minister accept that there is a deteriorating law and order situation in Papua New Guinea? Is he still of the view that the Government is not threatened by that deterioration? Is the Minister satisfied that the Papua New Guinea Government and Papua New Guinea security forces are able to maintain law and order, especially on Bougainville Island, and that Australians living and working there are not physically endangered? In light of recent events, is the Government satisfied that the current levels and form of Australian economic, military and technical assistance are the best Australia can provide to support Papua New Guinea's economic and political stability?</PARA>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="963" SPEAKER="Evans Sen The Hon G.J." NAMEID="VD4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="VIC" MINISTERIAL="FOREIGN AFFAIRS AND TRADE" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator GARETH EVANS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There are continuing law and order problems in Papua New Guinea, as has been obvious from recent press reports. Expatriates, including Australians, have been victims of some violent attacks but it does have to be acknowledged that the majority of victims are Papua New Guineans and there is no particular evidence of a programmed course of action against the expatriates in general or Australians in particular. The Namaliu Government recognises that law and order problems are constraining Papua New Guinea's development. They are a disincentive to foreign investors. I believe the Government is doing its best to come to grips with these difficult issues. Clearly, these issues are within that country's jurisdiction and, I believe, its capacity to resolve.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Government has announced several initiatives in law enforcement and the administration of justice. An amount of $12m is to be allocated over a four-year period. A cabinet committee has been set up to tackle the problem. A joint police and Papua New Guinea defence force operation against crime has been operating in the Highlands, in Lae and Madang. As far as Australian support for these endeavours is concerned, in August last year $11.9m was allocated from Australia's non-budget support aid program-that is, project aid-for a five-year project to strengthen PNG police capacity, following a PNG request for assistance of that kind.</PARA>
<PARA> Specifically in relation to the situation in Bougainville, it has to be acknowledged that it remains uneasy. A curfew has been imposed since 23 January following sabotage of mining equipment and government property by landowners demanding increased compensation from Bougainville Copper Ltd (BCL). Police are searching for the leader of the militant landowners, Mr Francis Ona, and explosives that were stolen from BCL. More recently, as we have all seen from press reports, there has been an outbreak of fighting between Bougainvilleans and workers from other parts of Papua New Guinea, particularly the Highlands. In addition to a police presence of 350, some 190 defence force troops have been sent to the island, although the operation of the mine has not been affected by these ethnic hostilities. We have now had an announcement by Prime Minister Namaliu of the establishment of a bipartisan truce committee which will include members of the national Government and Oppositions together with provincial premiers. Prime Minister Namaliu has said very forcefully that the Government could not condone people taking the law into their own hands and that he was determined to see those responsible being dealt with under the law.</PARA>
<PARA> The Australian High Commission remains in close touch with the Papua New Guinea Government on this matter. There was a little friction a few days ago in relation to a visit by a member of the High Commission staff to Bougainville as part of that process of keeping in touch with the issue and, in particular, keeping in touch with the interests of Australian expatriates there. It has become obvious that the contretemps was the product of, I believe, a quite genuine misunderstanding on the part of the people involved. Essentially, that part of the issue has been satisfactorily resolved.</PARA>
<PARA> Australia's main contribution to the financial side of resolving these problems is through our major contribution to the Papua New Guinea Budget. That is supplemented by specific projects from time to time of the kind that I mentioned in the law and order area. We will continue to keep in very close touch not only through our High Commission but also directly, government to government, on these issues and do the best we can to get PNG through what is obviously a rather difficult and volatile period. It is not, I repeat, as I have said publicly, a period or a course of events that ought to cause any great alarm about the future stability of that country. I think the problems are acknowledged; they are being grappled with. There is a highly competent team of people in the PNG Government. Part of the problem obviously has to do with the constitutional situation; the volatility of the Government in an environment where no confidence motions can be moved at six monthly intervals. If that problem can be resolved, which many people are now working to achieve, I think there is a fair chance that a lot of these other issues will stabilise over time.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade. I refer the Minister to the deteriorating situation in Namibia and the ultimatum which has just been delivered by the South African Foreign Minister to the United Nations Secretary-General that, unless South West African People's Organisation (SWAPO) forces are prevented from entering Namibia and fighting South African forces, South Africa would halt its observance of the UN supervised transition. What is the Government's attitude to this ultimatum and does it find it acceptable?

Is the Government satisfied that the United Nations Transition Assistance Group (UNTAG) is still capable of fulfilling its objectives?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator GARETH EVANS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is the case that the UNTAG operation has been very slow to be put into place and to implement its deployments. It has had some problems which can most charitably be described as initial teething problems. I spelt out yesterday at some length-I do not want to repeat anything I then said-the difficulties that have been experienced and some of the reasons for them. The Australian Government believes, however, that with proper management UNTAG is capable of fulfilling its objectives, and there are sufficient signs on the ground of the present situation being responded to effectively to make us still believe that the situation will stabilise and the transition period will be able to be managed as originally hoped.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As I said yesterday, it is for the Secretary-General to decide whether the situation warrants an increase in the size of the force to the upper authorised limit of 7,500 troops. We will just have to await his judgment on that matter. It may be that it will prove to be enough just to have in place the full range of fighting battalions and so on that are associated with the initial deployment of 4,600-odd, provided they get into place quickly in a way that has not yet occurred. We certainly have full confidence in the Australian management of our own 305-man engineer contingent. We are closely monitoring the situation, and every care will continue to be taken to ensure that Australian lives are not put at risk-although obviously there is an element of risk, again as I said yesterday, in any peacekeeping operation.</PARA>
<PARA> In relation to the South African ultimatum, if it can be so described, I can really do no more at this stage than say what I said yesterday: we are still not in possession of any detailed report from the United Nations as to the particular circumstances of what has occurred over the last few days, although to some extent those events speak for themselves. Our basic hope and expectation is that South Africa will act now with a maximum of restraint and in full cooperation with UNTAG, particularly given that there are some indications at least that SWAPO may have undertaken the movement in question without hostile intent. The evidence is ambiguous on that score; the evidence is conflicting. But to the extent that there is some such evidence, it is in nobody's interests to rush to judgment about who is to blame. The main thing is to try to get the situation back under control through rapid deployment of the remaining UNTAG forces through an effective taking command of the situation by the UNTAG commander, and by everyone, including the Opposition, exercising an appropriate degree of self-restraint.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator GARETH EVANS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As I announced early last month, the Australian Government has responded to requests from the former Palestine Information Office to change the title of that office to one under the rubric of the Palestine Liberation Organisation. I have had a further communication from Mr Kazak seeking clarification as to whether or not it is the Government's position that it be described as the Palestine Liberation Organisation Information Office or simply the Palestine Liberation Organisation Office. I have responded to that by making it clear that the Government has no objection to the office being called the Palestine Liberation Organisation Office; that is to say, simply deleting the word `information', if that is what is requested.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The main point that I have been at pains to make clear to Mr Kazak and others interested in this question is that this in no way represents the granting of diplomatic or consular status to that particular office. It in no way implies that any of the privileges or immunities that are associated with diplomatic or consular status will be attached to the office. What it does reflect in Government policy is a recognition of the quite fundamental change that has occurred in the publicly stated position of the PLO as a result of the statements made in Geneva in December last year by Mr Arafat in which the PLO did, of course, renounce terrorism and accept Israel's right to exist within secure and recognised borders. All of these matters I put on the public record in an answer to a question, which I have just now turned up in Hansard, on 2 March. I made the point in public statements on 2 March and in my letter of a few days earlier to Mr Kazak that, while:</PARA>
<PARA>The Government has welcomed the positive development in the PLO's approach to the peace process as expressed by Mr Arafat in Geneva . . .</PARA>
<PARA>he would:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . appreciate that any retreat from these commitments in the future will necessarily result in a further review of the Australian Government's position.</PARA>
<PARA>I said:</PARA>
<PARA>Our willingness to make the kind of gesture embodied in our acceptance of the renaming of your office is very much contingent on both the letter and spirit of those commitments continuing to be observed.</PARA>
<PARA>May I also say that in further recent correspondence with Mr Kazak I underlined that point in the following terms:</PARA>
<PARA>I should, moreover, like to underline the points I made in the final paragraph of my earlier letter. The Government will continue to monitor closely the honouring of the commitments made by Mr Arafat in Geneva in December last year. In this regard, I am concerned about some reported statements attributed to PLO leaders in recent months which, to the extent that they imply a continued willingness to contemplate certain terrorist activity, are profoundly unhelpful in maintaining the credibility of the PLO position.</PARA>
<PARA>I make those points because I think it is important to appreciate that, while the Australian Government wants to be responsive, as do so many other countries around the world, to the manifestly very important change in position by the PLO-because we believe that negotiations between the PLO and Israel are the only way forward out of the impasse in the Middle East-nonetheless those words have to be accompanied by deeds on the Palestinian side. Good faith has to be maintained. It is very much a part of the process of developing a climate of confidence in which we can achieve peaceful resolution of the situation in the Middle East that there be no resiling in practice from either the letter or the spirit of those undertakings. That is the basis on which the Australian Government has been prepared to acknowledge explicitly a representative role for the PLO in this country, but it is very much with the qualifications that I have again put on the record.</PARA>

I think that just about answers the question, and that will enable the honourable senator to go back to his wound-licking manufacturer and explain what I think about the issue.</PARA></TALK.START>

On a number of occasions I think Mr White himself has suggested it, but the Government certainly is not considering it.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think there are about eight questions altogether. I did not get a note of all of them, but I will answer most of them. Firstly, I do not remember off the top of my head the precise figures about external debt, but there is no doubt-I am not trying to walk away from this-that there has been a very large increase over the last several years. That, of course, is the sum of the sequence of current account deficits that we have been incurring over a very long period.

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="TJ4">Senator WALSH</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Boswell should listen to this, too. The major cause of that is that demand has been running at almost unprecedentedly high levels in Australia-certainly in the absolute sense-and the rate of growth in demand has been extremely high because the growth rate in the Australian economy is very much higher than had been expected. So in this financial year we may well have a current account deficit somewhat more than 4 per cent of GDP. But in John Howard's last year as Treasurer we had a current account deficit of 4 per cent of GDP in the midst of the worst depression the country had seen since the early 1930s. That is the genius of John Howard-to still have a 4 per cent current account deficit when in the middle of a depression. It is very much harder to do that than it is to have a 4 per cent current account deficit when we are in the midst of a very high rate of economic growth and an investment boom.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Whatever the precise figures on debt may be, two refinements should be made. Firstly, the net indebtedness should be looked at, rather than the gross.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Actually, I had not quite finished. I will finish the point I was making, and that is that in recent years for the first time Australia has become a significant exporter of capital, in particular of equity capital investment. That also ought to be taken into account when one is making a final assessment of the changes in our level of international indebtedness. To the extent that we have become a significant exporter of equity capital, though still in total an importer of capital, that of course has aggravated the figures shown in the accumulated external debt.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As to the second part of Senator Hamer's question, I think I am already on the public record in last Monday's Age; but if I am not on the public record I certainly was on the record when I spoke to the Age's bureau chief on this matter. If it were a simple question of whether it would be better to increase disposable incomes in Australia, I think everybody would have to agree that under present circumstances it would be better not to increase disposable incomes-at least unless the increase in disposable incomes were to go into saving. However, the statement which the Treasurer will be making next Wednesday will be about a package of taxes and wages, and-Senator Stone even, I think, agrees with this-at some point it is better to settle for a smaller Budget surplus, than might otherwise have been the case, in return for a lower wages outcome. It is a matter of judgment where that point is reached.</PARA>
<PARA> I make two final points about that. Never in the five years that John Howard was Treasurer did he go anywhere near achieving a Budget surplus at all. He left behind him a fiscal time bomb in the form of an impending Budget deficit of nearly $10 billion, or 5 per cent of gross domestic product. The second point is that whatever the appropriate size the tax reductions may be, if the Opposition's assurances or propaganda are to be taken at face value, there would be very much larger tax cuts if the Opposition were in government-so it says-offset by expenditure cuts. But it never identifies any expenditure cuts; it keeps presenting an ever growing list of expenditure increases.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="TJ4">Senator WALSH</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have seen the letter from the South Australian RAA. Similar campaigns are being waged by comparable organisations in other parts of the country. The basic proposition is that the Federal Government ought to spend on roads all the money that it collects in fuel excise. It is not a new slogan. It has been around for at least 25 years. I remember Harold Holt replying to it when he was Treasurer. It goes back at least that far. What the South Australian RAA fails to mention is what services, what areas of government expenditure, it would like to see reduced if the present surplus of collections of fuel excise, net of Commonwealth expenditure on roads, were to be reduced or eliminated. Two or three possibilities flow from that. First, other taxes would have to be increased. I do not know which other taxes the South Australian RAA thinks should be increased; or, secondly, expenditure would have to be reduced or the Budget deficit would blow out. That is the way that John Howard dealt with these problems when he was in government, not that the Liberal Party, to its credit, ever hypothecated all taxes on fuels for Commonwealth road construction.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> However, in regard to the campaign, on 30 March a letter was published in the Advertiser by S. Colhoun of Happy Valley. It was such a good letter that I believe I should quote three paragraphs of it. It says:</PARA>
<PARA> As a member of the RAA for the past 18 years, I strongly object to my membership fees being used to help finance a $6 million political campaign.</PARA>
<PARA> I am happy that some of my fuel taxes go towards things such as pensions, education, nursing homes, health programs, etc.</PARA>
<PARA> It is quite obvious that additional funds for roads would only mean more taxes-or would we really like less spent on our aged and our children.</PARA>
<PARA>S. Colhoun has summarised the issues very succinctly. I need not say much more about this issue except that although certain opportunistic members of the Opposition pay lip service to this campaign which is being waged by various motoring associations, never, when they were in government, did they adopt the principle, nor would they if they ever get into government in the future.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank Senator Button. The circumstances of the funding of the Commonwealth's national roads program are perfectly well known. It has been very effectively articulated on innumerable occasions by the current Minister for Land Transport and Shipping Support, Mr Robert Brown. There has been some cessation of one particular category of that funding as a result of the program being completed, but the funds that are now being made available are being allocated to the areas of maximum economic benefit and return. It certainly does not imply any concession that in the past there has not been a similar criterion applied. It is just that we are moving away now from the notion of national roads, the completion of the round Australia black-top highway, to a more selective application of the funds that are available. Particular emphasis is being placed, as the honourable senator should recall, on roads that are part of the transport infrastructure surrounding ports that are important for the movement of goods around the major cities, and on the improvement in the condition of the major urban arterials. These are all priorities that are centrally important in the development and maintenance of our national transport infrastructure. The priorities that have been articulated still have regard to real human needs and are not solely of an economic or an industry kind. It is for that reason that road funding has been maintained in real terms for local government right around Australia, even though in some other categories it has not been possible to maintain the funds at quite that level. I will be happy to supply Senator Bjelke-Petersen with extensive detail about the precise priorities that are currently being applied and the circumstances and the context in which those funds are now being generated. I think she will see, with the care and rationality that she notoriously brings to her consideration of these matters, that the Government's policy is well founded and does not justify the really quite untoward slights that she offered in her question.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4E4">Senator RICHARDSON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Government once again exceeded its target figures in terms of tourists visiting Australia during the bicentennial year. The figures for December were announced this morning. They show that there were 2.249 million visitors for 1988. This phenomenal figure represents an increase of 26 per cent on 1987. Given that the increases in 1987 and 1986 were 25 per cent in each year, this shows why Australia has the leading rate of growth in tourism in the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development. So I think we can take considerable credit for those phenomenal figures. John Brown must be paid the credit due to him for establishing tourism as a priority not only for this Government but for all governments to come. Tourism can never again be ignored, as it was under the Fraser Government. Tourism now employs 6 per cent of the work force and creates 20,000 jobs a year.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The interesting part of Senator Collins's question concerned predictions in the longer term. The Bureau of Tourism Research suggested figures a year ago that I think were accepted in the industry for a time. It suggested that the projected rate of growth until the year 2000 would be 7 per cent. However, many people in the industry are beginning to query that figure. Recently it was indicated to me by the Australian Tourist Commission that it is conducting a review of that figure because it believes it does not state the full case. I am more than confident that in the very near future the Commission will be making an announcement, on the basis of some well-founded research, which will suggest that that figure of 7 per cent should be made much higher.</PARA>
<PARA> I am interested in the remarks about Queensland and what it does for Tourism. The facts are that a great many tourists visit Queensland and that is certain to continue. However, more would visit Queensland if there was less destruction of that magnificent coastline that goes on under the Queensland National Party Government. More people would visit Queensland if some wetlands were left. Every time the Queensland Government finds such an area, it knocks it down.

Our powers relate to export controls, to foreign affairs considerations and, in certain circumstances, to corporations. But we do not have a direct power in terms of regulating domestic forestry on the ground for the internal market in New South Wales.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I was asked in the first part of the question whether I was aware of something that had been said by the head forester. I cannot confirm all of the very precise details that Senator Dunn put in her question because I did not see the programs on the ABC or Channel 10 on the dates set out in the question. But I understand that a leading forester employed by the Forestry Commission of New South Wales has made statements of a similar sort to those referred to by the honourable senator. I do not know on what basis he made those statements-whether in his own right or as a spokesman for the Forestry Commission.</PARA>
<PARA> With respect to the first part of the honourable senator's question, it is certainly true that there are logging operations going on in what is now commonly called the Coolangubra Forest but which, in forestry designations, is the Bondi Forest near the Coolangubra area in New South Wales. Those logging operations, according to the Minister for Natural Resources in the New South Wales Government, have been set in train by him through the Forestry Commission for the purposes, as he describes, of supplying saw logs to sawmills at Bombala. The Commonwealth was not consulted before this decision was taken. It is not a decision I have any power to regulate.</PARA>
<PARA> However, I have a power to be concerned about and regulate logging which is occurring in an area on the interim list for the National Estate-an area in respect of which I have a statutory obligation to make sure is not logged if there are feasible or prudent alternatives. I do have the power to see that any material coming out of those operations or out of the sawmill residue that is left over from sawmilling because of the logging is not exported as woodchips. I have advised Harris-Daishowa that that is not to be the case.</PARA>
<PARA> I know that that company has quarantined any material coming out of the area. It is put aside in the company's yard. It is not being sent to Harris-Daishowa to be stockpiled, as the honourable senator has suggested, but simply because there is no other place to put it. Whether or not it is ever milled for woodchips for export depends very much upon whether the Commonwealth and the State can reach an agreement on the outstanding conditions and terms of the Harris-Daishowa export woodchip licence. So far I have had three meetings with the New South Wales Government. A this stage I would anticipate at least another meeting before we would know the answer to that question. There will certainly not be any authorisation for that material to be milled or exported as woodchips until such time as there is an agreement. Given the need for the agreement, it may be that it never is milled and exported, particularly if there are feasible alternatives.</PARA>
<PARA> The honourable senator referred to section 6c of the interim licence. That is a new provision which I put in the licence for this year. It was not a provision in the licence previously. It is the first time the provision has appeared. It gives me direct power to regulate the supply of material out of National Estate areas or out of areas on the interim list of the National Estate. That is an explicit condition of the licence. In my view that condition of the licence is not being transgressed by Harris-Daishowa, and that is a view that I have formed after investigating the issue.</PARA>
<PARA> In the last part of her question the honourable senator referred to Apogee Road in Tantawangalo State Forest. I know of some trees that have been, I am informed, blown over in windstorms in the Tantawangalo area. I am not able to verify whether they are the exact trees the honourable senator is referring to but there are a number of them. The reason why they are not being taken for milling is simply that this is yet again another outstanding area which is dependent upon a settlement between the Commonwealth and New South Wales governments before there can be any acceptance of materials for woodchipping. Whether they are taken for woodchipping or not depends very much on whether that agreement is reached.</PARA>
<PARA> The last part of the honourable senator's question referred to `apparent breaches of licence conditions'. That is a very qualified and soft allegation, if I might make that observation. I do not believe that there have been breaches and I therefore do not think that the Harris-Daishowa woodchip licence should be suspended.</PARA>
<PARA> Let me conclude by making this remark: the logging in what is now called the Coolangubra, but by definition is the Bondi Forest, is logging being conducted under the auspices of the New South Wales Forestry Commission. I do not find it particularly comfortable that that is occurring while the Commonwealth and the State of New South Wales are trying to negotiate what, by any test, is a delicate and sensitive agreement. The fact that that is occurring makes it very difficult for us to conclude a final undertaking between the Commonwealth and the State.</PARA>

<TITLE>FUNCTION FOR FRETILIN MOVEMENT: ATTENDANCE BY PRIME MINISTER</TITLE>
<ANSWER PAGE="973" SPEAKER="Evans Sen The Hon G.J." NAMEID="VD4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="VIC" MINISTERIAL="FOREIGN AFFAIRS AND TRADE" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator GARETH EVANS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yesterday Senator Tambling asked me whether the Prime Minister had attended an Australian Labor Party function for `the rebel East Timorese Fretilin movement' in Darwin last weekend and thereby delivered a snub to Indonesia. The answer to both questions, as I said yesterday, is an unequivocal no, but I should attempt in a supplementary answer to relieve the obvious distress of Senator Tambling at what he seems to believe was some sort of shadowy gathering of insurgents in Australia's far north.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The situation was in fact as follows. My colleague Senator Collins and the member for the Northern Territory, Mr Snowdon, jointly hosted an informal function at the East Timor Association's Lafaek Club in Darwin on Saturday, 1 April, to coincide with the visit of the Prime Minister to that city. The function was an attempt-in fact, a very successful attempt-to give the Prime Minister an opportunity to meet a broad cross-section of the Darwin community. The list of more than 300 invitees included representatives of organisations as diverse as the Greek Orthodox community, the Indian Cultural Society, the Migrant Resource Centre, and a range of trade unions and professional associations, not to mention such sinister organisations as the Family Planning Association, Darwin pensioners, Darwin Senior Citizens Association, the Darwin Uniting Church Women's Fellowship, the Catholic Women's League and the Country Women's Association.</PARA>
<PARA> Not content with that list of 300 invitees, Senator Collins and Mr Snowdon went further, placing an advertisement in the Northern Territory News inviting anyone in Darwin who had so far escaped their attention to attend the gathering. In short, this function was a community-wide affair attended by people from many different groups, including, yes, the East Timor Association, the members of whom, incidentally, are overwhelmingly these days naturalised Australian citizens-the overwhelmingly diverse set of groups that make up that very rich cultural environment that Darwin is these days. To brand the occasion, as Senator Tambling did, as a Fretilin meeting was not only grossly inaccurate, and an insult to Darwin as a whole, but also typical of the kind of wild and baseless allegations we have come to expect from the senator from the Northern Territory.</PARA>

If there was a misunderstanding on the part of the Minister, that misunderstanding should have evaporated if his Department or whoever prepared the response had referred to my press release of 3 March and had not just relied upon that of 1 March. The statement of 3 March made it perfectly clear what I was talking about. I was talking about `Australian working families'.

<PARA> (b) the personal explanation by Senator Harradine; and</PARA>
<PARA> (c) the subsequent statement by the Minister for Consumer Affairs. </PARA>
<PARA>I would like to speak briefly to the motion because the answer given by Senator Bolkus typified the abuse that we have seen of Question Time since the Parliament resumed, which has resulted in a very small number of questions being asked in the Senate over this period. Ministers have come in to this place-Senator Bolkus is but one of them-and given prepared statements. Senator Bolkus's own words during his answer made it clear that he was intending to make what he described as a statement of the Government's position on this important question in response to what was supposed to be a question without notice. </PARA>
<PARA> The seriousness of this matter goes beyond the matter of the number of questions asked during Question Time. The fact is that the answer, clearly a carefully prepared answer, given by Senator Bolkus was in itself substantially misleading. Senator Bolkus was trying to get away from the facts that were drawn attention to by Senator Harradine in his comments in this Parliament and in the press statement that he put out on 3 March. Senator Harradine-Senator Bolkus referred to the first paragraph of that press statement-said this:</PARA>
<PARA> The Government's family policies stand condemned by the figures produced in the AIFS document `Families and Tax' which shows that most families have suffered a substantial loss of disposable income since 1984. </PARA>
<PARA>That is an unexceptionable statement. Whatever confusion there may have been about working and non-working families, the truth is that this report put out by the Australian Institute of Family Studies shows that whilst the Government can point to some percentage of Australian families who are on very low incomes having gained in some way from this Government, even on Senator Bolkus's figures, about three-quarters of Australian families have gone backwards under the Hawke Government, even if one looks at no more than the issue of tax and family allowance and other forms of assistance which are directly available to families with dependants. </PARA>
<PARA> Because I believe that Senator Bolkus has tried to muddy the stream, I will again refer the Senate to what was reported by the Institute of Family Studies just a couple of months ago. The point is made-it is all set out on page 7 of the report-that, with the exception of very high income earners and those people on a low enough income to get the family income supplement, the heaviest tax increases have fallen on middle income families with children. The table set out in this document shows that the burden has fallen without any regard to social obligations. I will quote directly from page 8 of the report:</PARA>
<PARA> The pattern of higher increases in average tax rates for those on lower incomes is repeated for all the various family types shown in Table 1. The outstanding exception to this pattern is for families on low incomes with children. These people have been greatly assisted by the Family Allowance Supplement. </PARA>
<PARA>Depending on how one plays with the figures one can say that that is 7 per cent of Australian families or one can try to lump them in with pensioner and beneficiary families-in other words, those families that are totally dependent upon the state for support through the Department of Social Security-and one can say that this Government has done something to ease the burden on the bottom quarter of income receiving families in Australia. But the truth is that the vast mass of middle income earners in Australia, including people on quite modest incomes, have suffered very badly under this Government. The report says:</PARA>
<PARA> The most striking feature of Table 1 is the very high proportional increases in the average tax rates for all family types around AWE. </PARA>
<PARA>that is average weekly earnings. To continue:</PARA>
<PARA>This contrasts sharply with the large declines in average tax rates experienced by very high income earners during the same period. </PARA>
<PARA>That is the truth and that is why there is such a revulsion about this Government in suburban Australia. That is why so many people are groaning under the weight of not only the extraordinary increases in interest rates but also the average tax rates that have considerably increased under this Government. We are not talking about the wealthy of this country; we are talking about medium income earners who are trying to do no more than live an average Australian life. They are finding it increasingly difficult, if not impossible, to buy a house. They are finding it increasingly difficult, if not impossible, to buy a car. And they are finding it increasingly difficult, if not impossible, to make ends meet. </PARA>
<PARA> We had this Minister-Minister Bolkus; one of the less competent Ministers in this Government, I would have to admit-get up today in Question Time, not with an answer to a question that he did not expect, but with a piece of paper in front of him because a dorothy dix question had been arranged. He tried to give the impression that under this Government there has been a substantial increase in assistance to families. Under this Government 70 per cent or more of Australian families have suffered increases in taxation and a decrease in the value of whatever benefits are available to them, whether it be family allowance or dependent spouse tax rebate. Where changes have been made to family allowance, other than for people who receive such a low income that they can get the family assistance supplement, for many families this Government has removed the family allowance entirely.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="EF4">Senator CHANEY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will go back to the point that I was seeking to address. A substantial number of families have had their entitlements to family allowance totally removed. No doubt, Labor senators will get up and say that those families can afford it; why should they get any assistance? Those families, with incomes of around $40,000, who have lost family allowance, now have to pay exactly the same tax rates as people with the same income but who have no children to support. All the notions of horizontal equity, so carefully addressed by Bettina Cass in her reports to this Government, about people on equal incomes but with differential capacity to pay tax because they have dependants, go out the window. This Government ignores the fact that the same Institute of Family Studies that produced this report told this Government that the real disposable income of a family with an income of $40,000 or more and with dependants is in fact no more than that of a single person on average weekly earnings. There is no sense of social justice in what the Government has done. Everyone can commend the assistance given to very low income families.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Australian Labor Party might occasionally acknowledge that its whole system of assistance to low income families is in fact built on an initiative of the Fraser Government, introduced in the 1982 Budget when I was Minister for Social Security under the term `family income supplement'. We do not quarrel because we introduced the proposal that assistance should be given to low income, working families. I see Senator Harradine nodding because he has had connections with the Shop, Distributive and Allied Employees Union. This is a classic case of a union with many members who have family responsibilities and are earning relatively low incomes. Under the old social security system, one could have the absurd situation that those families could have lower incomes, employed, than unemployed. It is a matter of rank injustice. The Fraser Government introduced the notion that there should be additional assistance provided for working families under those circumstances. We have never quarrelled with that. What this Government has done-the three card trick; the dishonesty of the Hawke Labor Government-is disguise the additions to that scheme as being assistance to families in Australia; it is not. It is assistance to a tiny proportion of families in Australia. If we are going to get ministerial statements in Question Time, if we get continued abuse at Question Time in the way Senator Bolkus abused it today when I believe he set out to misrepresent the position with respect to assistance to families and to misrepresent the position that has been consistently advocated by Senator Harradine, then I put the Government on notice, since Senator Button says that we will not get leave to move to take note of these matters, if there is going to be any debate on it, that we will move for suspension of Standing Orders to enable debate on these matters forthwith. </PARA>
<PARA> Question Time is being abused by this Government. We are sick of it. If Senator Bolkus or other Ministers engage in it, then we will take up the time of the Senate to ensure that the record is put straight. The record with respect to family assistance is quite clear. I seek leave to incorporate in Hansard, to foreshorten my contribution to this debate, pages 7 and 8 and the first two paragraphs on page 9 of the report `Families and Tax in 1989-AFIT Bulletin No. 5' instituted by the Australian Institute of Family Studies. </PARA>

<PARA> * Average tax rates are not calculated for sole parents at 0.5 AWE since, at this level of income, sole parents receive a part pension. </PARA>
<PARA>(1) Taxable income is split 60:40</PARA>
<PARA> Table 1 shows the changes in average tax rates between 1976-77 and 1988-89 for various family types and income levels. The starting point of 1976-77 is chosen because this was the year of introduction of family allowances. Table 1 also shows the additional dollars paid in tax in 1988-89 compared with the tax that would have been paid in 1988-89 if the 1976-77 tax situation still prevailed. The calculation is based on estimated average weekly earnings in 1988-89 of $25 903. </PARA>
<PARA> The table indicates the changing tax circumstances of selected hypothetical families and individuals. The incidence and representativeness of these hypothetical situations in the Australian population can be assessed by reference to Appendices 6 and 7 which show the distribution of annual taxable incomes by family type according to the 1985-86 ABS Income Survey updated to 1988-89. </PARA>
<PARA> The pattern of higher increases in average tax rates for those on lower incomes is repeated for all the various family types shown in Table 1. The outstanding exception to this pattern is for families on low incomes with children. These people have been greatly assisted by the Family Allowance Supplement. The table shows, for example, that a couple with two children aged less than 13 years on half AWE are in fact $18 better off per week in tax terms than they would have been under 1976-77 conditions. In other words, FAS has already more than compensated for the increased tax circumstances of low-income families with children. In terms of the Government's Family Assistance Package, it remains for this group to receive the payments under the FAS system to bring total payments for children to 15 per cent and 20 per cent of the married rate of pension for children aged less than 13 years and 13-15 years respectively. </PARA>
<PARA> The most striking feature of Table 1 is the very high proportional increases in the average tax rates for all family types around AWE. This contrasts sharply with the large declines in average tax rates experienced by very high income earners during the same period. The increases in average tax rates for families on AWE range from 4.8 percentage points for one-income couples with no children, to 6.8 percentage points for two-income couples with two children. These increases in average tax rates for families on AWE compare with an increase of only 2.7 percentage points for a single taxpayer on AWE. </PARA>
<PARA> Middle-income families have fared worse because they have experienced declines in the real values of the dependent spouse rebate, the sole parent rebate and family allowances without the offsetting tax reductions that those on the highest marginal tax rate have received. In addition, where a total family income equal to AWE has been derived from two incomes, both incomes have suffered from the sharply increased average tax rates on low incomes, yet the family is above the income level where it could benefit from FAS. It is clear from these findings that a reform package must address the reduced circumstances of low income people without children (those in the income range where FAS applies) and all middle-income families. </PARA>
<PARA> When families on AWE without children are compared to families on AWE with children, it is clear that the increases in average tax rates have been much greater for those with children. Indeed, it is middle-income families with children that have fared worst in the tax system over the past 12 years. This conclusion applies irrespective of whether the family with children is a sole parent family, a one-income couple family or a two-income couple family. This reflects the decline in the real value of family allowances. Thus, in any reform package, middle-income families with children would require additional benefit. </PARA>
<PARA> At income levels higher than AWE, increases in average tax rates have been greater for families with children than for taxpayers of a similar type, but without children, and at the same income level. Thus, a two-income couple with children on 2AWE, for example, has fared worse than a two-income couple without children on 2AWE. Similarly, a single parent on 1.5AWE has fared badly compared to a single person on the same income level. This trend indicates the need in a tax reform package to give additional benefits to all families with children. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Leader of the Government in the Senate now seeks to widen this debate into the opposition to wage increases. Let us look at this Government's record with respect to wage increases. What this Government has done in its accord with the trade unions is to produce wage increases which are between two and three times higher and two and three times as fast as the wage rises in comparable countries. What is happening under this Government is that, because it has completely messed up economic management and because productivity is stagnant-and the Minister cannot deny it-those wage rises have translated into inflation. Australian workers are worse and worse off under this Government. That is why people are so sick of it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The truth of the matter is that figures do not lie when they are analysed properly. The Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development analysis, which is greatly provided by this Government, shows that this Government has achieved stagnant productivity and a declining standard of living for many Australians. One can excuse Government members their stupidity and economic mismanagement-and perhaps I should close soon to allow the debate to proceed under the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, Senator Austin Lewis, who will be bringing forward a matter of public importance in just a few minutes-and one can have some sympathy for a government which is not capable of managing the economy which prevents the disasters now facing Australia, but one cannot excuse a Labor Government which loads the burden onto the lowest income earners. It is made quite clear here that the lowest income earners without dependants have suffered very badly. Middle income earners with dependants have suffered very badly. As against that, the only benefits that are shown in these tables are for high income earners. This Government is a social joke. It has totally ignored its own constituency. I look forward to having many debates on these issues. This Government is a disgrace and the people of Australia know it. I seek leave to continue my remarks. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yesterday on the Australian Broadcasting Corporation radio program The World Today an interview was conducted between a Mr Phillip Russell and a Mrs Christine Milne, who, for the information of the Senate, has been a central figure in the Wesley Vale pulp mill disaster. In the course of her remarks on that program Mrs Milne said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> But I perhaps didn't expect the level of anger in the local community, and I think that was exacerbated by the behaviour of Senator Stone, Mr Reg Hope and Mr Chris Miles who held a meeting in Devonport in which they really whipped people into a frenzy of anger and stereotyped the radical greenie as the person to blame.

But there was no frenzy. Secondly, I totally deny the charge of having stereotyped the radical greenie as the person to blame. I did use the term `radical greenie' to distinguish between what I call the extreme, the blinkered, the unreasoning, the irrational anti-development person, such as Mrs Milne-I might say the pro-unemployment person like Mrs Milne-and the great majority of Australians who are perfectly conscious of the need for sensible conservation and environmental policies in this country but who do not take their objections or views in that regard to the point of denying a $1,000m capital investment project which would otherwise have produced 500 jobs.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That, in the opinion of the Senate, the following is a matter of urgency-</PARA>
<PARA> The need for the government to reform areas such as the waterfront, telecommunications, transport, coastal shipping and industrial relations because, as the Governor of the Reserve Bank has said, micro-economic reform has a major role to play in raising productivity and is now urgently needed. </PARA>
<PARA> I note that on the speakers list the Leader of the Government in the Senate, Senator Button, will be following me, and I shall be interested to hear how he responds to that statement that these matters are now urgently needed. Will he deny them or will he, as he has already indicated in his interjections to Senator Chaney, as usual make some personal attack? As we know, Senator Button plays the man when he is on the back foot and never the ball. After the 1987 election 20 months ago, Mr Hawke announced that micro-economic reform would be the key element of the Government's third term agenda. Where are we down the track on that element of this Government's agenda? Frankly, nowhere. I am disappointed that it is Senator Button who is following me. I was rather hoping that it would be the Minister for Finance, Senator Walsh. Notwithstanding Senator Walsh's rudeness and vitriolic tongue, in this particular matter some of us on this side of the chamber almost feel sorry for him. He is tired and worn out. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="NG4">Senator LEWIS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As my colleague Senator Hill says, he is worn out; he wants to resign. The National Media Liaison Service has convinced the media that he is tired because he is sick of saying no to Ministers who ask him for more money. I say to the Senate and to the public that that is absolute nonsense. We know that Senator Walsh is worn out because for nearly six years in government he has been battering his head against a brick wall as he has tried to persuade his Cabinet colleagues to introduce some micro-economic changes even of a minor nature, all to no avail. No wonder he is exhausted. No wonder he wants to get out.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This Government does not even have the courage to decide to build Mascot's third runway. There has been no decision yet. The National Media Liaison Service again has persuaded the compliant media in Australia to hoodwink the people into believing that some decision has been made. In fact, the only decision that has been made is to defer the decision for another 18 months pending an environmental impact study. It was that decision not to make a decision that caused Senator Walsh to say, `Well, I give up; I am sick of it. If the Government cannot even make up its mind to build a third runway in Sydney how on earth will the Government have the courage to fix up the waterfront or to address the coastal shipping problems? How on earth will the Government have the courage to address the industrial relations problems in this country? How on earth will the Government face the transport difficulties that have to be faced by a government which is genuinely concerned about micro-economic reform in this country?'. </PARA>
<PARA> That is why Senator Walsh is worn out. He recognises that after six years of being Minister for Finance in this Government he would have made a greater contribution to the economic problems of Australia if he had stayed at home growing more wheat for export. That is the simple situation. Of course, we saw him today during Question Time. He is like a punch-drunk boxer. When the roar of the crowd comes he rises to his feet and the hands come up, but in truth it is only to surrender. </PARA>
<PARA> The Prime Minister, Mr Hawke, having made that statement about micro-economic reform being the key element of this Government's agenda, in May of last year the Treasurer (Mr Keating) in the other place-Senator Walsh repeated the words of that speech in this place-said:</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That was Mr Keating. He goes on:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This is why the Government has adopted such a complete and comprehensive strategy; big brush economic changes reinforced by sweeping strokes going to the micro or industry level. </PARA>
<PARA> What we have been after is a full picture-not something half finished. </PARA>
<PARA>He goes on to say that the Government had taken major steps to reform its business enterprises. I will come to that area in due course. He went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA> More competitive pressure will also be applied to the operations of Telecom and the Overseas Telecommunications Commission . . . </PARA>
<PARA>I shall address that later. Having said that on 25 May, two days later the Australian Financial Review reports:</PARA>
<PARA>The Federal Treasurer, Mr Keating, turned his attention yesterday-</PARA>
<PARA>in other words, one day after he made that speech-</PARA>
<PARA>to the labour market, which he sees as the last great reform challenge for Labor. </PARA>
<PARA>In other words, the very day after he made the statement of 25 May he acted as if the things he said in that statement had already come true and the last great area for change to be overcome was the labour market. Of course, he was right but it was not the last area for change. It is absolutely necessary that the labour market be reformed but what on earth has the Government done about any of these things? What on earth has the Government done about its micro-economic reform? What on earth has the Government done about the reform of the labour market? There were some tariff reductions and tax changes. We acknowledge that. There were some cosmetic changes to the Government's business enterprises. Some of them changed their names. The Overseas Telecommunications Commission (OTC) and the Australian National Line changed their names to public companies and got boards of directors. As to infrastructure changes, there was virtually nothing done. It instituted some inquiries. There was a lot of talk but by March of this year, about 10 months after Mr Keating had made this speech, the Government acknowledged that no changes had been made and by then it knew this country was going down the drain so far as its terms of trade were concerned at the rate of $15 billion a year. By then everyone was screaming for micro-economic reform. So what did the Government do? It decided to make some speeches about it. I really do not know whether the Prime Minister, Mr Keating or Senator Button believe that if they talk about something the people will believe they have done it. But believe me, the people no longer believe that they have done it. I will tell honourable senators some of the things they said. On 3 March this year the Prime Minister said:</PARA>
<PARA>A lot of people were thinking that the April statement-</PARA>
<PARA>that is, the one that is to come out next week-</PARA>
<PARA>was just going to be an announcement of tax cuts. I think you'll find there'll be more in it than that. </PARA>
<PARA>That was a great statement. It built up our expectations immediately. On 2 March Mr Steve Burrell wrote an article in the Australian Financial Review. We all know that Mr Burrell is commonly known as the mouthpiece of the Treasurer. He seems to have some sort of direct communication with him. In that article he said:</PARA>
<PARA>The Federal Government will widen the scope of its April Economic Statement to include a number of micro-economic reforms in an attempt to address criticism that its structural adjustment agenda has been allowed to stall. </PARA>
<PARA>There is an acknowledgment that the Government's structural adjustment has been allowed to stall. Once again the rhetoric comes out. Mr Burrell went on:</PARA>
<PARA>The Structural Adjustment Committee of Cabinet agreed yesterday that ministers should bring forward work on policy changes . . . </PARA>
<PARA>The Prime Minister announced in July 1987 that it was going to happen. In March of this year, 1989, the structural adjustment committee is saying, `You Ministers have to bring forward these proposals'. Mr Burrell reports that they should:</PARA>
<PARA>bring forward work on policy changes already in train and develop new initiatives for inclusion in the statement in key areas such as education and training, industry-</PARA>
<PARA>Senator Button is talking about bringing it forward in industry-</PARA>
<PARA>science-</PARA>
<PARA>Mr Barry Jones is incapable of producing anything for the science community-</PARA>
<PARA>research and development, transport and communication, housing and social welfare. </PARA>
<PARA>Twenty months after the election nothing has been done in these crucial areas. In this report Mr Keating's mouthpiece went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA> Mr Keating has been increasingly concerned about criticism levelled at the Government that its agenda of micro-economic reform-promoted as the centrepiece of its third term-has stalled in the face of union resistance and a loss of political will. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me draw the attention of honourable senators to those specific words. Mr Keating is not concerned that there is no reform. He is concerned that there is no perception of reform. That is what he is worried about. He is not worried about producing reform, he is worried that the people do not think he is doing anything about reform so he has to come out with some form of words which will make people believe that this Government is doing something. I tell Senator Button that it is good having Mr Burrell as Mr Keating's mouthpiece because we get all sorts of reports as to what happens in Cabinet. The article by Mr Burrell reads:</PARA>
<PARA>Mr Hawke sought initiatives from ministers late last year to counter perceptions that the Government had lost its political energy and lacked a vision for a fourth term. </PARA>
<PARA>Again, the Prime Minister is concerned about perceptions; he is not concerned about the reform which is desperately needed. Three weeks later, on 23 March 1989 in the Australian Financial Review, Mr Burrell reported:</PARA>
<PARA> The Federal Government dropped plans yesterday to include a number of micro-economic reforms in the April statement . . . </PARA>
<PARA>Again, it has all fallen in a great heap and again, we are not even to get an announcement of micro-economic reforms from this Government. I now turn to a very important speech by Mr Johnston, the Governor of the Reserve Bank of Australia. This is not a speech by some Liberal or National Party politician; this is a speech by the Governor of the Reserve Bank of Australia. I quote:</PARA>
<PARA> It is also important to realise that we can't keep the economy in a permanent state of sedation in order to keep the current account and inflation in check.</PARA>
<PARA>How very true that is in relation to the macro-economic situation. He then goes on to deal with the micro-economic situation, which is what we are talking about. He says:</PARA>
<PARA>We need to press on with more constructive policies-to switch investment growth into export and import-replacing industries, to save more to finance investment, to sustain our international competitiveness and to raise productivity. </PARA>
<PARA> The so-called micro policies of reform-of work practices and the established ways of doing things-have a major role to play in raising productivity. </PARA>
<PARA> These are more-not less-urgent when all is not going smoothly at the macro level. </PARA>
<PARA>In other words, Mr Johnston acknowledges that things are not going smoothly at the macro level. He says that that makes it all the more urgent for the Government to do something in this area. I refer to another paragraph of Mr Johnston's speech:</PARA>
<PARA> They reflect the degree of willingness that we Australians are prepared to offer in order that the country may reach its full potential. </PARA>
<PARA>What is the Government doing? We are unable to point to anything that it has done in relation to these matters. The Industries Assistance Commission in its draft report on coastal shipping pointed out that it is cheaper to ship salt from Mexico to Australia than around the Australian coast. It is cheaper to ship sugar from overseas to Western Australia than from Queensland or New South Wales, and it is cheaper to ship milk powder from Tasmania to Taiwan than from Tasmania to the mainland. </PARA>
<PARA> A few days ago, 10 months after the Government made an announcement about telecommunications, it finally produced a draft telecommunications Bill in relation to Austel, which is due to come into operation on 1 July. If one looks at that Bill one will see that the Government is interested only in protecting the monopolies of the carriers-OTC, Aussat Pty Ltd and Telecom Australia-and is not interested in doing anything to implement the things that Mr Keating talked about on 25 May when, as I said, he said that more competitive pressure will be applied to the operations of Telecom and the Overseas Telecommunications Commission. Where is that set out in this draft Bill? Nowhere. What is set out in this draft Bill is a continuation of the monopolies of Telecom. I am not the only one saying that. If Government senators wish to take any notice of Professor Baxt, Chairman of the Trade Practices Commission, they can read in yesterday's national affairs section of the Australian Financial Review this report of what he said:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . that the bill establishing Austel and the new rules for the industry had failed to embody the deregulatory spirit of the policy announced in last year's May Economic Statement. </PARA>
<PARA>Again, in another simple area where the Government could have taken some steps to introduce some micro-economic reform it steps away from it. Since Senator Gareth Evans has handed over the portfolio of transport and communications to Mr Willis, micro-economic reform has run into an absolute brick wall and has stopped. </PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Senator Stone" NAMEID="LJ4">

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Exactly. As my colleague Senator Stone says, the trouble with Mr Willis is that he has always taken his orders from the trade union movement, and it is not interested in micro-economic reform.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> No longer does Australia have excuses for being uncompetitive with the rest of the world. We now have a population of over 16 million. That is not a bad size domestic population to enable industries to get a start. Our wages, in comparison with those of some of our overseas competitors, are not high. Senator Button appears to dispute my statement about population. I say to him that the population of the German Democratic Republic is about the same as that of Australia. It is doing better than we are, notwithstanding its communist regime. In comparison with our Asian neighbours our wages are no longer high. The Australian dollar is not as low in value as Senator Button would want and, on the other hand, not as high as Mr Keating would want. </PARA>
<PARA> The question is: Why are we going down the drain at the rate of $15 billion a year? What is this Government going to do about it? What is its policy, other than just to wait and see? Will it wait until whatever the year is, 1993 or 1994, when the Economic Planning Advisory Council predicted we might get back to par? What is the Government doing about it? Absolutely nothing. We are going down the drain through our trade balance at the rate of over $1 billion a month, and this Government is not addressing the problems. What are those problems? They are work practices, restrictive regulations, business input costs and rigidities built into the system. In addition there are taxes, inflation and interest rates. At least the Government could be addressing at this stage these micro-economic matters which I have listed. There is no question of what we are talking about. We are talking about reforming the waterfront, telecommunications, transport, coastal shipping and industrial relations. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I appreciate the need for Opposition senators to psych each other up. It is absolutely essential. When John Howard's name was mentioned at Question Time they all made yawning noises, which is precisely what the electorate is doing. Senator Lewis has made a speech which is, of course, a collection of quotes thrown together in no particularly coherent way. The lightest touch in his speech was when Senator Stone interjecting that Mr Willis gets his instructions from the trade union movement. People said, `Oh, that's dreadful'. Senator Stone was the right man to make that interjection. The Liberal Party gets its instructions on these issues from the National Party, and did so throughout the 30 years that it was in government. That was why no micro-economic reforms were carried out in this country. That was why nothing happened in that period of government. That is why this Government has the problem today: in those 30 out of 39 years when the Opposition was in office, it did nothing about these things. That is why they are all on the agenda today. A day or two ago Mr Howard was interviewed here in Canberra by Pru Goward. He spoke about some of these issues. She challenged him about producing long term solutions. He said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>No, no. Long term solutions are the important ones, and this Government has frittered away years . . . the almost two years now has gone by since the last election has been . . . frittered away-nothing achieved, nothing gained, nothing planned, nothing changed, and even at this late stage, I would say to the Government, `Use the April statement as a vehicle for comprehensive economic reform. Don't see it merely as a tax bribe exercise'. </PARA>
<PARA>The Leader of the Liberal Party advises the Government about tax bribe exercises! This is the man who was the Treasurer in a government which waved around fistfuls of dollars before an election in tax offers to the Australian people and took them away five months late-and he lectures us about tax bribes. The Liberal Party is feeling a bit good at the moment because interest rates are up and things like that, and this improves its psychological condition for a few months. The Liberal Party goes through these perpetual crises; morale goes up when economic conditions turn down. That is what has happened in the last six or seven years and the Liberal Party is on an up phase at the moment. But let us look at what it is all about. A lot of it is about what was put in the Liberals' document called Future Directions. I will quote from what a respected political commentator said in the Bulletin on 13 December about Future Directions:</PARA>
<PARA>There is plenty of truth glossed over and no shortage of unrealistic promises in . . . ``Future Directions''. The unrealistic promise of simple solutions to immensely complex problems underpins the whole exercise. It is not possible to return to the comfortable predictability and simplicity of the 1950s but ``Future Directions'' encourages people to believe it. </PARA>
<PARA> The document seeks to imply that Labor deserves blame for protectionist policies which were, of course . . . the work of ``Black Jack'' McEwen and the Menzies government. It tries to pin Labor as the Party of regulation, ignoring the Hawke government's major deregulatory measures such as floating the dollar and admitting foreign banks. Howard, Treasurer in the last Liberal government which conspicuously failed to implement significant free market policies, is portrayed as the great deregulator. The coalition which has been in power in Australia for 30 of the last 39 years suggests that Labor is primarily responsible for the decline in moral values, the family, education standards, . . . </PARA>
<PARA> As analysis, in other words, ``Future Directions'' is about as shonky as can be. </PARA>
<PARA>The same might be said of the speech that has just been made. Members of the Liberal Party talked today about how they, presumably, would tackle some of these issues. They gave no indication of how they would do it; it is just suggested by implication in some vague way that they would. It is a funny day for them to come in here and talk about these sorts of issue. It is the day after the Liberal Party, the Party of deregulation, was again stood over by its National Party colleagues and friends on the issue of deregulation of the domestic wheat market-again stood over as it was for year after year of the Fraser Government, the Menzies Government and others in between. </PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Financial Review, in today's editorial, talked about the compromise that the Liberal Party reached, against its wishes, on deregulating the wheat market because it had to face up to that issue now; it could not put it off until after the next election as it did in those 30 years of government. This compromise was made by the Liberal Party, with many of its prominent figures-or should I say noisy figures; it would be generosity in the extreme to describe Wilson Tuckey as prominent. But Wilson Tuckey and others prominent in the Liberal Party in that sense made that compromise. The Financial Review said about it:</PARA>
<PARA> As an exercise in damage control, it can at least be said that it avoids the hilarious condition placed on steps towards wheat deregulation by that silo socialist Mr Sinclair, leader of the National Party: that progress first be made towards eliminating agricultural subsidies on world markets. </PARA>
<PARA>The editorial goes on to say that the conditions which the Opposition has placed on the legislation to deregulate the domestic wheat market, involving transport, handling, storage and waterfront areas `are indeed long overdue and desperately needed'. This Government does not disagree with that. </PARA>

So the members of the Liberal Party, when confronted in their Party room with a real issue that they have to face up to, as distinct from waffling about us in here, because they are scared of the National Party they reach a shonky compromise, tacking these other things onto this very important issue in the Australian economy, the deregulation of the wheat market. That is the sort of alternative government that we would get in this country.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Honourable senators opposite talk about structural problems in the Australian economy. Let us have a look at the structural problems in the coalition. The Australian people would get the same performance from honourable senators opposite as we got over 30 years from previous coalition governments. As the article in the Bulletin points out, these issues are useful in opposition-I suppose honourable senators over there have to be able to say something-but really they are not very much to the point.

<PARA>We hear Mr McGauran-I am not sure whether the one I am talking about is National Party or Liberal, but whatever he is-making big unquantified promises about research funding and so on. </PARA>
<PARA> We are here about politics. Ultimately the people have to make a choice between us and the Opposition. The first point I want to make is that, on the basis of the record of honourable senators opposite-not only in government when they tackled none of the issues they are now complaining about but also in opposition-when confronted with an issue they have to face up to they will run away from it because of the National Party. The record is quite clear for students of politics to see. The numerous problems that this Government has had to face up to are the result of years and years of neglect and lack of courage and vision sufficient to tackle some of these issues which now face the Australian people. It is this Government's role to get us out of that mess, and it is a difficult process. There is some talk about tired people on this side of the House, but look at what is happening opposite. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to make a few points about some of the things which this Government has done. I do not think macro-economic issues are much in question in this debate. The Opposition, when confronted with difficult alternatives to the Government on macro-economic issues, really runs away from those, and there are not many differences. </PARA>

Senator Lewis keeps interjecting about interest rates, inflation and all these things. Last year he used to say Australia had a higher inflation rate than all the countries we could think of. What countries did he mention? He mentioned the United States of America and the United Kingdom. They were always at the top of his list. Australia had a higher inflation rate than those countries but we have not heard much about that this year from that lot opposite because the Australian inflation rate is now not higher than it is in those countries.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA> I want to go through some of the things that this Government has done on micro-economic reform. There have been enormous financial reforms in this country, such as the floating of the dollar, the deregulation of the financial sector and the admission of foreign banks. All those things were on the agenda before the Opposition when it was in government, and it ran away from them. It did not take the advice of the experts it appointed to deal with them. There has been massive taxation reform in this country; the tax base has been widened; there has been the introduction of the capital gains tax; a reduction in corporate taxes; a whole range of changes to the personal taxation regimes and so on, and further tax changes will be announced this month. Senator Lewis made some comments about labour market reform. The important point to remember is that we do not say we have succeeded with this issue. It is no good our saying that we are perfect in respect of labour market reform. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;No, but look at the results. The honourable senator claimed in his speech that wages in Australia in comparison to those in Asian countries are no longer high. Senator Chaney was making exactly the opposite point in his speech a few minutes before. What is the Opposition saying? Are they too high or are they too low? The Opposition would not have a clue whether they were too high or too low. It is making opposite points within two 10-minute spans. If we look at the results of industrial relations reform in this country we see that less than half the number of industrial disputes occur now compared to those under the previous Government. Enormous breakthroughs have taken place and are taking place in work force flexibility and in award restructuring. These are historic things which those people opposite ran away from.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator Lewis mentioned industry policy. If he had made his speech two years ago, half of the people on his side of the chamber would have said that we ought to do something about tariffs in Australia, and the other half, represented by Senator Watson and others, would have said that we should not do anything about tariffs. We did it. The Opposition did not do it in all its time in government. It frigged around at the edge of the debate and did nothing in all of the period that it was in government. We did it in May last year, with a 20 per cent cut in manufacturing tariffs, and there were cuts even before that. The Opposition did nothing about the two-airline agreement, but we did. It did nothing about oil market deregulation, but we have done something. It did nothing about government business enterprises, but we have, although perhaps not enough-more to go. It did nothing about telecommunications deregulation, but we did it through greater private access to the provision of customer services. It did nothing about aggregation in the television system, but we have done it. All these are fundamental reforms which we had to tackle. Somebody had to have the guts to do it, and the guts were not found in the people who now re-present themselves, because interest rates are a bit high, as a possible alternative government in this country. The same intestinal fortitude exists in these people as in those who were around in the Opposition's period in government. </PARA>

In this sort of debate we can only talk, but we have done a lot by way of action. We do not by and means rest on our laurels. We have an awful long way to go in this country because of those 30 years of sadness and neglect when governments of the conservative persuasion were stood over by the National Party of Australia. Those governments missed opportunities and did not have the courage to take hard decisions. Similar people here are criticising us. It is a disgrace.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Button has said in his contribution to the debate that we are here about politics and that people have to make a choice. He also referred to an interview between Pru Goward on Australian Broadcasting Corporation radio in the ACT and the Leader of the Opposition, Mr Howard, in which the interviewer was pushing the Leader of the Opposition for long term economic solutions. That is certainly the key. The Australian Democrats join with the Opposition in this urgency motion in calling for the Government to reform Australia's economic environment but the nature of those reforms must be in accordance with concepts of social justice.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I take this opportunity to place on record the way the Australian Democrats would shape the economy. Obviously Australia is increasingly facing serious inter-related economic, environmental and social problems. We continue to live beyond our means while our future is being shaped by decisions made with little concern for the longer term consequences and in the absence of public consultation or scrutiny. The economic practices which govern all of our lives reflect an increasing lack of concern for what should be the central issues of social and environmental quality of life in both domestic and international contexts. The economic policies of both the Opposition and the Government perpetuate this destructive and shortsighted disregard for our future. </PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Democrats want an Australian economy which is socially equitable, environmentally sustainable, democratically controlled and which makes a positive contribution to the well-being of the Asian and Pacific region in particular. Our economic policies are designed to realise these interdependent goals. To achieve these goals-goals which I suggest any responsible political party ought to find difficulty disagreeing with-we believe we need an economy which is significantly different in structure and process from that which we now experience. It must be an economy which is based first and foremost on cooperative endeavour and on the acceptance that it is both rational and profitable to make social needs and ecological principles an integral part of our economic behaviour. The market, much vaunted especially by the Opposition and only to a slightly lesser extent by the Government, is a useful tool in assisting and planning the allocation of goods and services, but it fails to guarantee that these social needs and ecological principles are recognised. To leave our economic fate entirely to the market is to abdicate responsibility to build an economically viable, socially just and environmentally sustainable society. Nor can unrestricted private ownership of industry and control over investment, or bureaucratic self-interest, be allowed to override these goals. They are best pursued through open, cooperative and participatory processes of planning and production involving local communities, employees, unions, employers and government. Emphasis on democratic planning, decentralisation of productivity and increased community self-reliance is central to the progressive displacement of the socially and environmentally inefficient functions of the market as a major means of allocating resources and satisfying human needs. </PARA>
<PARA> The Democrats want to encourage the growth of cooperative enterprises and we would require, over time, that shared ownership and participatory decision making governed the actions of all public and private sector enterprises and utilities which employ more than 10 people. We envisage that this process would reshape the structure and performance of the economy which would increasingly comprise three sectors: a few large public sector enterprises and administrative units necessary for the provision of goods and services in their areas, and large private sector corporations, each publicly and democratically managed as one sector; a second sector of many small public or private sector organisations, cooperatively run and owned businesses employing 10 people or more; and a third sector of individual private sector units which employ less than 10 people. We are a great distance from realising these goals, but the source of our support for the motion before us today is simply what that motion says, that we need economic reform. We certainly agree that we need reform in the directions which I am outlining. </PARA>
<PARA> The economic policies and practices pursued or proposed by the other parties in this place are in fact hindering our progress in the directions which the Democrats would want to go. As a result, the Australian economy is not serving the Australian people. Clearly it is not serving the Australian people. Ask people whether they believe they are better off or worse off now than they were three years ago or five years ago. Most people have a perception that they are worse off, yet we have more jobs in the economy, we have a Budget surplus, we have increased industry profits; yet people still feel they are worse off. Clearly the economy is not serving the Australian people. There is excessive unemployment. Both the Government and the Opposition seem satisfied with the fact that we have plateaued our unemployment at 6 or 7 per cent. Major economic advisers in our community throw their hands up in horror when the figures show that the numbers of jobs are increasing. They say the economy will overheat, that it will tip in the wrong direction. It appears that we need to maintain a plateau of 6 to 8 per cent unemployment. It is unacceptable as far as the Australian Democrats are concerned. </PARA>
<PARA> Ordinary consumers lack purchasing power for the goods and services that we could readily produce with our unused labour, resources and machines. On the one hand, there is an excessive and increasing concentration of wealth in the hands of a few; yet, on the other hand, the number of people living in poverty continues to increase. Financial deregulation of which Senator Button on the Government's behalf is so proud-tax avoidance, off-shore investment and an increasing foreign control of Australian enterprises and resources-is also occurring. Manufacturing industry is declining. Productive investment is low. Many companies are moving their operations overseas and others are threatening to if we try to get them to meet their taxation responsibilities here. Many small businesses continue to go bankrupt. We have accumulated a massive level of foreign debt and, as a consequence, our economic priorities are increasingly determined by international financiers, hence the economy does not serve the ordinary people. The proportion of women in the labour market has improved marginally, but young people, ethnic people and Aboriginal people still face major disadvantages. Our natural resources are being destroyed at a rapid rate and there is no serious attempt to develop alternative energy sources. We have a long way to go. </PARA>
<PARA> As Senator Button said, people have to make a choice and people will make a choice. We need to look at the issue of reform in the hands of the Opposition and the Government. I have outlined the basis for reform that the Australian Democrats would want to see. The performance of the Fraser Government between 1977 and 1980 when, it is interesting to note, Senator Stone played such an active role in the Government's economic platform, resulted in a period of industrial anarchy and a severe blow-out of wages in 1981. The bull-at-a-gate approach of the coalition proved singularly unsuccessful in its previous term in office. While we support the basic thrust of the urgency motion, any reforms which take place must not be along those sorts of lines. On the other hand, by maintaining a sound relationship with the Australian Council of Trade Unions through the accord, the Australian Labor Party (ALP) has been able to institute gradual reforms-for example, in the shipping industry-that have seen our industrial relations record, and therefore our image, improve amongst our trading partners while starting the move towards a reduction of the featherbedding which has characterised, and which still does to a great extent characterise, the Australian waterfront. To adopt a confrontationist approach to these reforms would be both foolhardy and ineffective. The ALP's policy to make haste slowly is much more economically sensible than the Opposition's approach which in the past has resulted in the alienation of the waterfront and the stagnation of trade due to conflict between coalition governments and unions. We need to look at the failure of coalition governments to deal with the demands of the Industries Assistance Commission (IAC) to attempt to commence reforms on the waterfront. Honourable senators will remember that in 1980 the IAC called on the Fraser Government to establish a formal inquiry into coastal shipping and waterfront activities. This was not established until last year by the Australian Labor Party Government. </PARA>
<PARA> From looking at this motion, it seems that the Liberal Party has failed to learn from its disasters of the late 1970s and early 1980s when it was in government. This period showed that punitive legislation and confrontationist policies failed to deliver in Australia in the area of industrial relations. Industrial relations is a vital factor in this motion before us today. A poor industrial relations record like that of the Fraser Government could not have delivered the return that the ALP is beginning to obtain in various areas of micro-economic reform. In an article in the Age in July last year headed `Liberal Party ignores past mistakes at its own peril' Peter Stephens said:</PARA>
<PARA>The Liberals have failed to handle industrial relations before because they do not understand the relationship between economic conditions and wages policy. </PARA>
<PARA>I will also quote what was said by a member of the Liberal Party in the other place, Ian Macphee. In an article in the Herald in April last year he is quoted as saying:</PARA>
<PARA> I am frankly in no doubt that the wages outcome which has been delivered so far by the Government could not have been achieved by a coalition Government, even if I had been Industrial Relations Minister. </PARA>
<PARA>That is, of course, something which this motion tends to ignore. It must be said, however, that unfortunately the Australian Labor Party itself is sacrificing in too many respects the concepts of the accord in order to uphold Thatcher-like policies that have led to the erosion of real standards of living for its traditional supporters while, at the same time, allowing the transnational corporations, or our own home grown varieties, to send their middle and particularly their upper level employees on a wages spiral. </PARA>
<PARA> At this point I would put on the record the Democrats' disappointment with the Government's approach to the trade union developed document Australia Reconstructed. That document acknowledged that this nation and this economy are in a transition period. It took a positive approach and made innovative suggestions. But the Government has not acknowledged and acted upon the innovative aspects that were brought forward in Australia Reconstructed. Of course, the Opposition has been totally reactionary. Certainly the Opposition has taken this attitude-and I would be very disappointed if this were the case in respect of the Government-because of the hand of people like Laurie Carmichael in the development of that document. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government had a golden opportunity when the Industrial Relations Bill was debated in this chamber last year to ensure that we all moved into a new and positive era in industrial relations. But the debate in this place demonstrated that both the Government and the Opposition were prepared only to maintain their entrenched positions of confrontation. As I said, the Australian Democrats support the coalition's call for the Government to commence the restructuring of the Australian economy as a whole but we have a particular view about the nature of that reconstruction. </PARA>
<PARA> We are a vast nation. Just picking up the question of telecommunications and transport, it is clear that the market cannot in all cases and in all instances support the needs of the Australian community. The Democrats believe that the quality of service received by the disadvantaged, whether they live in cities or outlying areas, is of paramount concern in the provision of public services. The Democrats have been asked to support Senator Lewis's motion. But what social benefits does the Opposition believe will accrue to the ordinary person, the ordinary family, in our community, as a result of its proposed micro-economic restructuring or, in other words, privatisation. The benefits of the real growth in profits that corporations are now experiencing are being felt only at upper levels of income while ordinary families are increasingly at the mercy of those large corporations. That is why the Australian Democrats emphasise that reform must be accompanied by the concept of social equity. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Senate is debating a matter of urgency on the need for the Government to reform areas such as the waterfront, telecommunications, transport, coastal shipping and industrial relations because, as the Governor of the Reserve Bank of Australia has said, micro-economic reform has a major role to play in raising productivity and is now urgently needed. The Hawke Labor Government has reduced the Australian economy to a shambles. This is despite good prices for our export commodities. The old excuse about the terms of trade going wrong is no longer true. Our terms of trade are good, yet our economy is in a shambles. After the next election, the incoming coalition Government will have a tremendous task to get this country back on the rails.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Look at what the management of the Treasurer, Mr Keating, has achieved in the last six years. We have borrowed $85,000m overseas to maintain our standard of living. We are now the third most indebted country in the world. The interest bill on our foreign debt is taking a fifth of our export income. We are now promised wages rises and tax cuts but no compensating reductions in Government expenditure. The resultant increase in consumer spending will make our overseas indebtedness much more disastrous. Our inflation rate is double that of our competitors. Despite a lot of talk, productivity in the vital manufacturing and transport sectors has scarely risen at all. Improved productivity is essential if we are to raise, or even maintain, our standards of living, for the productivity of our competitors is rising while ours is standing still. Under this Government's economic management, we are not becoming more competitive; we are becoming less competitive. </PARA>
<PARA> Interest rates are sky high, and they are going to go even higher despite the nonsense talked by the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) while overseas. These high interest rates deprive many young Australians of the chance to own a home, make vital new investments in plant and equipment uneconomic and, through the resultant overvaluation of the Australian dollar, make it much more difficult for our manufacturers to be internationally competitive. It is a very sorry tale. It is not surprising that Mr Keating was runner-up in 1986 for the title of world's worst finance Minister. The winner, by the way, was the Finance Minister of Egypt. For some curious reason, this achievement by Mr Keating never seems to be mentioned by the Australian Labor Party. </PARA>
<PARA> What we must urgently look at, as this motion emphasises, is improving national productivity. This is, as I said, essential if we are to improve or even maintain our standard of living.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the Senate. The table, which is the latest I have been able to get, is dated 1983. Although the figures are substantially true now, the relative position will have worsened because all the countries with which we are comparing ourselves have improved their productivity since then while Australia's productivity, in six years of Labor Government, has been virtually static. But, as I said, the table shows that Australians can be extremely productive. In agriculture Australian workers are nearly seven times as productive as Japanese workers. We are 1 1/2 times as productive as the United States.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is worth studying where we are more productive and where we are not. One is forced to the conclusion that the areas in which we are not productive are areas where militant unions have had and use their monopoly position. This has been to the great disadvantage of the community. We are, for instance, extremely uncompetitive with the United States in manufacturing and in transport. An Australian worker is roughly half as productive as an American worker and that makes it very difficult for us to be competitive on world markets. </PARA>
<PARA> The key area in this motion that I wish to discuss is the transport sector. This is where the most immediate gains can be made. Look at some of the problems. Delays, stoppages and inefficiences in our ports are costing our economy about $2,000m a year. Savings can be made. If they are made, they will be particularly beneficial because, for every dollar saved through transport reform, our economic output would rise by $2. There would be a $2 rise in national output for every dollar we could save by eliminating the featherbedding, inefficiencies and rorts in the transport industry. Other estimates have been made that 20 per cent of the $11.5 billion spent on transporting exports and imports could be saved by proper reforms of our transport industry. These are reforms that we do not make. If we do not make them, it is to our great disadvantage. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us look at some of the things that have been going on on the waterfront and the way in which the Government has been neglecting the opportunity to reform them. As I said, the costs are high, about $800m a year on our waterfront, costs to the community resulting from inefficiency and featherbedding. Our ports have the unenviable reputation of being the worst in the developed world. Of course, the community as a whole pays. We pay for the extra costs of things that are imported. Our exports are less competitive because of the costs in our port handling, so we all finish up paying for these imports. </PARA>
<PARA> It is not only extra costs. We lose contracts through unreliability; we frighten off companies who are not prepared to take the risks of becoming involved with our exports. I remember a few years ago I was in Korea and Japan. The news that used to come there comprised a list of strikes in Australia that affected those countries, strikes in the coal export industry, shipping strikes, port strikes. The reputation of Australia is deplorable in this field. We lose many contracts and the whole community suffers because these matters are not being tackled and the Government is putting all this in the too-hard basket. It is not tackling the problems, that it should be tackling. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like to give a couple of examples of the sort of featherbedding that goes on. When grain is being loaded one worker is required to stand at the edge and watch the loading into the container ship. But union rules insist on two workers being there. Only one is needed but two must be provided. Because there are two workers, the union insists that a supervisor must be present, and because there is a supervisor there must be a foreman. Thus four workers are employed to do one man's work. The world does not owe us a living. If we do things like this the whole community suffers. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me give another example. In 1985 the Australian National Line (ANL) ship River Torrens came to Brisbane carrying cement clinker from Adelaide. The ship had been restructured at considerable expense so she could unload in perfect safety and very rapidly without the need to employ any shore labour at all. When she reached Brisbane the union insisted that, for each of the three shifts, one foreman, one waterside worker and one clerk would be present and paid for even though there was nothing for them to do. Because they were there the union also insisted on having a first aid officer-in case they injured themselves doing nothing. These are the sorts of things that must be stopped. The whole community is suffering. We are trading with the rest of the world at an enormous loss. If we go on like this, we are in desperate trouble. </PARA>
<PARA> I will give one more example. Grain terminals use highly expensive capital equipment which is fairly standard around the world. If we look at grain terminal performance in the United States of America ports the throughput per employee is 60,000, 80,000, 80,000, 120,000 tonnes, an average of about 100,000 tonnes throughput per employee. In Sydney, using the same equipment, the throughput per employee is 17,000 tonnes. In Newcastle it is 21,000 tonnes. That really epitomises what we must tackle. We must stop merely addressing problems by simply talking about them, as the Government does, and start to really tackle them. The whole community suffers with the inefficiency of our transport shipping and port handling facilities. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like to turn briefly to coastal shipping, which I have spoken on many times in this chamber. Because of the ruthless use of the monopoly power of the maritime unions our coastal shipping has become highly inefficient by any standards and what is carried in our coastal shipping is only what cannot reasonably be carried any other way. If one goes up the Hume Highway, for instance, one sees containers being transported by road from Melbourne to Sydney. That is ludicrous. They should go by ship. They do not, for very good reasons. We are using our transport very inefficiently because of the ruthless way in which the monopoly powers of the maritime unions have been exploited. </PARA>
<PARA> As I have said many times in this chamber, but it is worth reiterating very briefly, if we bought a ship from Sweden and raised the standard of accommodation from what is accepted in Sweden, a country with a higher standard of living than we have, and fitted that out to make it acceptable for Australian seamen, it would cost between $1m and $2m extra to provide the extra facilities required by our seamen. The cost of crews, even in new ships, is still 25 per cent higher than in comparable ships run by other developed countries. Of course, in the older ships they are very much more again. We must remember that it costs about $100,000 per billet. When one looks at billets in Australian ships another very interesting thing comes up. Our unions get six months leave a year. For a year's work they in fact get 338 days. This compares, for instance, with 216 days for an American, 174 for a West German, 141 for a Norwegian. When the matter was raised recently the unions said it was non-negotiable and that they were not prepared to discuss it. This is a ruthless rort. It makes Australian ships very expensive to run. We have got to provide 2.2 people for every crew billet. This again affects the whole community. Transport costs on the Australian coast are grossly excessive. Things that should go by sea do not go by sea because of the inefficiency of our coastal shipping and our ports. Those issues must be tackled. </PARA>
<PARA> The only way we will break the coastal shipping monopoly is to introduce competition. Monopolies can be controlled in one of two ways. The first is by enforcing tough legislation. It is very doubtful whether we have the effective constitutional power to do that, and it would be very difficult anyway. The second is by introducing competition. It cannot be done by negotiation. All the unions will do is make some minor concession here and take it up in some other area. People who have a good monopoly going will not yield it unless they are forced to. The only effective weapon governments have is to introduce competition. That is what this Government always refuses to do. It does not understand the value of competition, the economic efficiency caused by competition, and the great benefits to the Australian community which result from competition. </PARA>
<PARA> These are the sorts of things we must tackle to increase productivity, to involve our work force in the success of their enterprises and to ensure the living standards of the whole Australian community rise as they should rather than, as they have under this Government, falling further and further behind the standards of the rest of the developed world, involving us in the most enormous international debt in order to maintain the living standards we have. We have been borrowing, borrowing and borrowing to maintain our standard of living. Some time-and the time is now-all those debts are going to come in. We must work harder and more efficiently. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="2F4">Senator BURNS</NAME><ELECTORATE>(Queensland)</ELECTORATE><TIME.STAMP>(4.38)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have listened with great interest to what has been said. I must say at the outset that the Government has no great argument against what is being requested by the motion in principle, of looking at macro-economic reforms, looking at reforms in the area of transport and the waterfront, and looking at better industrial relations. That is the direction we have been heading in since we took office, a direction in which we can travel reasonably peacefully and faster than the Opposition could ever imagine because there is an understanding between the trade union movement and the Government, one based on a partnership of trust and fair dealing, something that the trade unions have never had and could never expect from a Liberal-National Party government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> A lot has been made about raising productivity. As far as I am concerned, raising productivity in itself is no particular asset unless that productivity is to be shared amongst all Australians in a fair and equitable way. I am not interested in raising productivity so that companies and individuals can become richer while workers become poorer, work harder and longer, have reduced living standards and no real future, and go back to the days of the Liberal-Country Party government. Productivity has to be shared. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Powell from the Australian Democrats made the point that they do not accept 7 per cent unemployment. Levels of unemployment throughout the world are a fair bit higher than they were in years gone by. I can recall a Liberal government almost being thrown out of office because of a 2 per cent unemployment rate. I can also recall recently a Labor government being re-elected with a fairly high level of unemployment. If we look to reducing levels of unemployment, to putting more people back into the work force until we have nil unemployment and look at our capacity, with high levels of technology, better management and better industrial relations, and our ability to produce so much more in terms of consumer and capital goods and services, we have to look at reduced working hours. When we look at reduced working hours those opposite throw up their arms in horror and say `You cannot do that. That will reduce productivity. People will have to work longer hours'. This is obviously to put more profits in the hands of the people who run industry. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Powell also talked about industrial anarchy. Since the Labor Government was elected there has consistently been a lower level of industrial strife than ever before. A legitimate industrial dispute is not anarchy. Sharing the productivity is most important. We also have to look at the bigger picture. As we become more prosperous and share it amongst our people, we need to look at overseas aid to assist developing countries. For some time the workers have accepted wage restraint. And I am sure, from talking to them and the leaders of trade unions, that they will continue to accept it if it is in their long term interests and they can see a gain at the end of it. But they become increasingly frustrated and angry when friends of those opposite continually get wage increases. I understand that even one of our enterprises recently upped the ante by 100 per cent, from about $100,000 to $200,000 in a wage package by reclassifying a position of manager. Those opposite then say to a baggage porter or an aircraft mechanic for Australian Airlines, `You should have wage restraint'. One can put to them all the arguments one wants about the value of that manager, but it is a bit hard for them to accept it, and I understand that. </PARA>
<PARA> What is done with company profits? Are they reinvested? That is not our experience, and the figures show that. The trade unions have played a positive role. We believe that management should also play a positive role in terms of the required changes and concern for Australia as a nation. Let us look at the role of labour and capital and our Labor Government. As Senator Button and others have said, deregulation of banks, airlines and wheat and sugar was put in the too hard basket-which was full-by the Liberal and National coalition Government. We took on those hard tasks. I have long been an advocate of orderly marketing. I can understand why the National Farmers Federation has said that it wants to see no tariffs on manufactured goods so that its members can have cheaper inputs into their farm operations. But I find it a bit ludicrous when its members in the sugar and wheat industries then say, `We don't want our system deregulated. We want protection. Let's rip the workers apart. Let's get all our goods from overseas and have large areas of unemployment or reduced wages and living standards. But we want our protection'. That is totally dishonest. </PARA>
<PARA> I took the trouble to speak to some people in the trade union movement, one of those people being Ivan Hodgson, the National Secretary of the Transport Workers Union. Ivan's response to me about this matter was that his union has continually, over some years now, expressed a desire for cooperation in improving skills and operating methods in the transport industry. It has talked to top management of various companies about that and it has received a negative response. From my experience I would say that that is because top management feels it is its right to manage regardless of the effects on its employees and other people in middle and lower management. The Transport Workers Union has a very positive attitude. It is concerned about longer driving hours, higher road speeds, the danger to people on the roads, the deaths that have occurred. The unions want to cooperate. They want to see a reduction in transport costs. But they do now want to see this done at the expense of working conditions and the wages of their members. That does not need to happen. We can have both with better, more efficient management and better ways of doing things. </PARA>
<PARA> Ivan also has a view about benefits to the whole community. That is important to him. If cooperation does occur and things change and there is a reduction in transport costs, he wants to see the benefits passed on to the community, not bottled up in the profits of companies, which then benefit a few individuals. He is also concerned and expresses a view about the idea of integrated transport systems-using all methods of transport where they are most suitable. Let us face it: if there are job losses in some areas because of changes, our responsibility is to make sure that those people are retrained and put into other jobs. If we believe that under no circumstances should any people lose their jobs, then we are really in trouble. I know that Senator Parer has a good understanding of those sorts of things. He has worked in a real way in those sorts of industries. We may have different views on some things. There are certain indisputable truths that neither of us would walk away from. </PARA>
<PARA> The Waterside Workers Federation is always getting labelled by the Opposition. I spoke to Tas Bull. He sent me a document which sets out the attitude of the waterside workers. He says:</PARA>
<PARA>Self-serving solutions are not the answer. The waterfront is in desperate need of rejuvenation-it's time for a major revamping of the industry. We're calling for a co-ordinated plan to make Australia's ports efficient and reliable, a plant that involves employers and labour working together to ensure a skilled and motivated workforce, productivity improvements and a safe working environment. </PARA>
<PARA>That is not a troglodyte speaking. That is not somebody who does not want change. That is not somebody who does not have a concern about the community. He speaks about jointly owned companies, having one local stevedoring contract and the work being done at a lower cost to Australia's exporters and farmers as well as more efficiently. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Hamer made a point about productivity not going up. The document states-I am sure this can easily be verified:</PARA>
<PARA> In the last 20 years productivity, measured by the number of tonnes moved on average by each waterside worker, has increased by more than five times. </PARA>
<PARA>Indeed, the numbers of waterside workers in Australia since 1950 have reduced from 25,000 to 6,000. If that is not making an effort on the part of the unions and the people who work in the industry, I do not know what is. Those opposite talk about work practices. The myth is that ours are very bad, but in fact other countries have invested more heavily in sophisticated machinery and computerisation. Australian waterside workers often work on cramped wharves with antiquated equipment. United States containers are loaded directly onto a trailer, ready to be driven away. In Australia, due to lack of space, containers are stacked on top of each other. This often means moving two containers to get to one. That is not a Waterside Workers Federation decision; that is a management practice. Yet those opposite would declare that as something that was inefficient and something that needed to be fixed. </PARA>
<PARA> The wharfies are considered to be really well paid. Until 1947, they did not get annual leave, they got no sick leave until 1956 and they got no long service leave until 1961; whereas most other workers in industry had those rights long before. Today the waterside workers are pioneering new ideas and initiatives such as multiskilling agreements, productivity deals, joint venture schemes and safer working environments. It is very clear: they are very forward thinking. They want to cooperate. They want to do something. But they will not be used by employers and they will not be used by the Opposition, which represents the employers. They want a fair and equitable position. </PARA>
<PARA> This material talks about 13 wharfies in Mackay who have a company in partnership with an employer. One of the workers said, `We are a lot happier on the job with the new company. The work is better; production is up; there is less tension. We are making the shippers and the users happy, so we stand to get more work'. They are just some of the things that the waterside workers are doing but get no credit for. Instead, they get abused and castigated. </PARA>
<PARA> The rail system has often been maligned. A review of the road cost recovery-occasional paper No. 90-has received widespread national publicity. Some of the things it talked about were the cost of railways and the money that governments have to put into railways by way of subsidy. It stated that heavy vehicles with three or more axles failed to pay their attributable road system costs by $1.49 billion. That is the extent to which the roads are wrecked, without money being put back in to have those roads maintained. The railways have got to totally maintain the track. Articulated trucks alone failed to pay attributable road system costs of $1.283m. The 26,000 six-axle articulated trucks plying Australia's road system failed to pay attributable road system costs by $828m or, on average, $31,865 per vehicle. I am not knocking the drivers of those trucks. They do a job, they are workers, and they are entitled to wages and conditions. But they are continually being asked to drive further and faster, putting road users and their own lives at risk. </PARA>
<PARA> Criticisms have been made by a person paid by the truck operators, Ms Kathy Robertson. The ARU's response was that the Bureau's report included all fuel taxes, whether Federal fuel excise or State fuel franchise fees. This means that the road freight deficit may be much higher than the Bureau's estimate of $1,497m because not all fuel taxes are levied as road user charges. However, even when all fuel taxes are considered as a road user charge, the point remains that the road freight deficit is $1,497m. It was then indicated that tax is paid on the fuel used by railway vehicles, but that money goes on the upkeep of roads, not on the upkeep of the railway's permanent way. So the railways are maligned because of their inefficiency when in fact it is not necessarily the case. </PARA>
<PARA> The railways asked for an industry council and the Railway Industry Council was formed. It is working to get a better and more efficient railway system. It provides railway unions with a genuine opportunity to influence the long term direction of the industry. It will not provide answers to current processes of labour rationalisation. For too long trade unionists have failed to become involved in the shaping and direction of their industry. It is the realisation of the Australian Railways Union that it now needs to get involved in the direction of the industry, get involved in what needs to be done and be part of management's decisions. If that is the case, the union has a responsibility to see those decisions work. Trade unions have an important role to play in our community, and it should be seen that they be given every opportunity to do that. The Railway Industry Council process is obviously not about solving the problems experienced by railway workers overnight. There again, the rail unions are being cautious. They are not saying, `Let's go on strike, let's have a blue'; they are saying, `It will not happen overnight, but let's work towards it'. With membership support, the process can be used by railway unions to overcome the longstanding institutional problems which have put the industry into decline and led to endless rounds of labour rationalisation. Without the support of those unions and others, we will never achieve the sort of goals that the Liberal Party is asking for. If one wants to look at problems, one should look at the institutionalised problem with the Victorian railways. It was going to put down a four foot eight inch gauge. The New South Wales Government originally agreed and put down a four foot eight inch gauge. The Victorians then put down a five foot one inch gauge. We hear talk about railway workers being efficient. That institutionalised system makes efficiency almost impossible. If we are going to achieve the things that need to be done not only for those workers but for everybody in this country, there has got to be a lot more cooperation and trust developed and a lot more working together in a meaningful way. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We are debating today the urgency motion moved by Senator Lewis which states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That, in the opinion of the Senate, the following is a matter of urgency:</PARA>
<PARA> The need for the government to reform areas such as the waterfront, telecommunications, transport, coastal shipping and industrial relations . . .</PARA>
<PARA>Reference is also made to comments by the retiring Governor of the Reserve Bank of Australia. We have three industries in Australia today that hold this country together-primary industry, mining and, more recently, tourism. The only advance we have made has been in the area of tourism. We have gone backwards in the manufacturing industry. This explains the high debt, the high current account deficit and the high balance of payments deficit that we now incur, even at a time when our terms of trade are the highest they have been for 10 years. This Government is moving into its seventh year. </PARA>
<PARA> Earlier in this debate the Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce, Senator Button, castigated my colleague Senator Lewis for quoting from various newspapers but promptly went on to spend the rest of his speech making selective quotes for his own purpose. Quite erroneously-he had to go back to December last year-he quoted from the document Future Directions, which has gripped the imagination of average people in this country who have suffered and who continue to suffer because of the economic mismanagement of this Hawke-Keating Government. </PARA>
<PARA> These days it is a common theme in the media, and I might say initiated by the Opposition, that there is an urgent need for the Government to tackle what is called micro-economic reform. Micro-economic reform covers the areas in the urgency motion-the waterfront, telecommunications, transport, coastal shipping and industrial relations. What it means is to face up to the tough issues-the inefficiencies of the work place, restrictive work practices-which unnecessarily add to costs and which are a major contributing factor to our own inability to compete on world markets with our manufactured goods. Senator Burns, quite correctly, said that he was not going to abide any method which would cut wages. We would agree with that. Our approach is to increase productivity to make us more competitive so that the individual worker gets a greater real return. That will not be done if we are not competitive and cannot market our goods. </PARA>
<PARA> There are, of course, appalling work practices in many industries. Most are steeped in history and were introduced by union militancy at a time when we could better afford to pay. The worst areas-and this was referred to by Senator Hamer-are those areas where there are monopolies. Monopolies are the most difficult to handle. A person in a manufacturing industry has an opportunity if things go badly to get into some discussion with his own work force and to correct them, but in a monopoly position that opportunity is not available. The days when this country could afford to pay are gone. We are now part of a competitive world which has shrunk. Compared with our near neighbours-Japan, Korea, Taiwan and now, of course, the emerging Thailand-we are from a productivity and manufacturing point of view approaching, if we have not already achieved it, Third World status. It gives me no joy whatsoever to make that remark. A country with our natural inherent wealth should not allow that to happen. Our standards of living have deteriorated and continue to deteriorate to a totally unacceptable level. As I have said before and will say again and again, the only way out of this morass is to become more competitive. We must export more; we must import less; and we must manufacture import replacement goods within Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> Our current account deficit is running at between $1 billion and $1 1/2 billion a month at a time when our terms of trade are at their highest for 10 years. Our net foreign debt is in the order of $100 billion and rising monthly. In an address I gave to a group of young people the other day, I amended the so-called seven beatitudes so that one said, `Blessed are the young in Australia because they shall inherit the Hawke-Keating debt'. That is what it has got to. </PARA>
<PARA> For an island continent a key factor to enable our exports to become more competitive is the waterfront-a classic monopoly area. There are two very large problems on the waterfront: the costs and the lack of reliability. I will talk about the costs, but before I do so I will cite a remark that was made to me just a week ago by a shipper, by whom I mean someone exporting. He said, `I wouldn't mind the cost if I could be assured of reliability. I will sacrifice the restricted work practices if I can be assured of reliability'. That is how important it is to him and others in this country. </PARA>
<PARA> Every good this country imports and exports must run the gauntlet of rorts and disputes on the waterfront which blow out costs and make vital exports uncompetitive on overseas markets. Our foreign trading partners, regrettably, are well aware of our abysmal record. Senator Hamer referred to it. In past years I was required to send telexes almost on a weekly basis to overseas countries declaring force majeure because of industrial disputations. </PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Senator McMullan" NAMEID="5I4">

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Who was in government then?</PARA></TALK.START>
</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="KI4">Senator PARER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Let us ask ourselves who was the President of the Australian Council of Trade Unions then. It was Mr Robert Lee Hawke. In 1984 the Baltic and Maritime Conference urged its members-this is why I mentioned overseas markets-to think twice about trading with Australia. In 1984 a South East Asian shipowner warned potential charterers to treat Australia like a communist country or a war zone. That was the feeling. It has not changed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The list of restrictive and unproductive practices that beset the waterfront is a very long and sorry one. I will give a few examples. There is the infamous `nick system' under which two men are rostered to do one job and then take turns to nick off while on full pay. It is still going on; it has not changed. Another variation of this is the practice of drawing straws. Workers on night shift on the wharf work for a short time and then draw straws to decide which one will remain to the end of the shift to clock everyone off while the rest of the gang go home. In this way they all get paid for the full shift. The workers work on average about 28 hours a week, for which they are paid in the order of $800. That is a fairly conservative figure. It varies, sometimes going as high as $1,000 or $1,200. In addition to this they receive a whole range of extravagant allowances, including a site allowance, a telephone allowance, a laundry allowance, an obnoxious cargo allowance, a bad stow allowance-if they have to unload a badly stowed cargo-a noise allowance, a dirt allowance, a rain allowance and a cold allowance, to name just a few. </PARA>
<PARA> The real Achilles heel of the waterfront is the inflexibility of the work force. There is a reason for that: there is a pooling system. The present industry based system means that stevedoring firms must hire their work force from a pool. In other words, workers are not employed by a particular company. One week they might work for P and O, the next week they might work for the Patrick Stevedoring Co. Stevedores cannot choose either the number of men or the particular men in the work force, so they cannot match their labour to their work requirements. This is not a matter of saying, `We do not want that guy or another guy'. They need to do that for efficiency. I think everyone would agree. </PARA>
<PARA> In the ports around Brisbane, where I come from, the employment of casual labour is totally forbidden. If there is a peak and a couple of extra men are needed and if there are people who know how to operate the waterside where they live, they cannot be employed. If a port in Brisbane needs extra workers for a peak period they must be flown in from ports in other States-from Newcastle, Melbourne, Sydney or Adelaide. That is what happens. Last year in my own State of Queensland it cost $1m to transfer workers to the ports of Brisbane. That was just the cost of transportation and accommodation. Each of those workers cost $200 a day in air fares, accommodation and travelling allowances before he even began to work on the waterfront. So for a five-day week there goes another $1,000. That is what happens. </PARA>
<PARA> The workers are paid for 35 hours a week, regardless of whether they actually work. When they are not working it is called idle time. In recent years idle time-I heard Senator Burns talk about the port of Mackay and I hope it improves-has reached 60 per cent. Overmanning and featherbedding in stevedoring gangs is the key cause of waterside labour shortages. We hear about these shortages. Recently in Brisbane someone wanted to send a yacht to the Tokyo Boat Show. Last year he did it and sold 150 yachts. This time he was told he could not get it on the ship because there was a shortage of waterside workers. We managed to do it but I will not go into the reasons. I will keep that story for another day. </PARA>
<PARA> Stevedoring charges to load scrap metal cost one Queensland exporter $14 a tonne-to lift it from the wharf and put it on the ship. In the United Kingdom it costs 70 pence and in the United States $2 a tonne. The reason for the cost in Australia is overmanning. I think there were 14 people involved. I can give the numbers but time is going to beat me. The exporter spoke to me last week. He said he would have been happy-he had a 20,000 tonne cargo-to pay the Waterside Workers Federation of Australia $100,000 if it would stay away and let his people load the cargo, which he would do at a dollar a tonne. He would then save himself $8 per tonne. </PARA>
<PARA> As time is running out I will concentrate on what I think the Government should do. The Government is about to be presented-I believe it already has been-with the Inter-State Commission report. I understand it is going to be made public in the not too distant future, either in a few days or in a few weeks. It will be interesting to see how far this Government will go on the report of the Inter-State Commission. It will be interesting to see just what the Inter-State Commission will recommend. The general feeling within the industry is that it will suggest that we move away from the pooling system as a method of somehow getting a relationship going between employer and employee. Stevedores must have the right to set their own labour strengths. I am not suggesting that they be so choosy that they reject a fellow because they do not like the look of him, but they must be able to get the right person to do the right job. They must have the right to determine rosters. We cannot continue the nonsense that has been going on. They must have the ability, for example, to get rid of the silly nonsense whereby on every shift on the ports there must be a full time first aid man who does nothing at all but wait for someone to have a heart attack, which he cannot handle; he has to call an ambulance. Last year that cost the ports of Brisbane $1.5m. If those people had been freed up to work 17 more people would have been able to work on the waterfront. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We are debating a so-called urgency motion which is very bland. It seems to be rather a contradiction in terms. But in general it is saying that there needs to be micro-economic reform in this country and productivity needs to increase. Put in those terms, nobody could disagree. The problem with it is that in the speeches that have been made in support of it things have been said which indicate the political nature of the motion. Let me deal with it in those terms.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I want to make some preliminary points. To my utter amazement, I found that in moving this so-called urgency motion Senator Lewis said not one word about what should be done, not one word about what the alternative government's program is about micro-economic reform in the areas mentioned in the motion or any other areas. That is a very significant commentary on the substance of the significance of the motion and the seriousness with which it is taken. In a sense it is not surprising because that draws our attention to what is not in the motion. It is often interesting to look at the way people draft motions such as this to see what they have left out. In this area of micro-economic reform there are a number of important issues. Surprise, surprise; nothing is said about deregulation of the wheat industry. It is the first chance that the Opposition has had since this motion was proposed to do something about micro-economic reform, and it has squibbed it. It is going to do nothing. It is serving its masters in the organised rural lobby, not the farmers, not the national interest. </PARA>
<PARA> Normally, one finds that Opposition members-and it has been a characteristic of this Opposition-are lions in opposition. They will tear down the problems, leap into them and be very ruthless; but suddenly they become lambs in government. In this instance they are lambs in opposition as well. In the Australian Financial Review this morning Geoff Kitney stated:</PARA>
<PARA> And because of this, doubts will persist about whether Mr Howard can translate an in-principle policy position in Opposition into actual structural change in Government. </PARA>
<PARA>. . . . </PARA>
<PARA>. . . that he was held hostage by the National Party on micro-economic reform.</PARA>
<PARA>. . . . </PARA>
<PARA>. . . Mr Howard has been seen as a politician with a strong philosophical commitment to market forces and deregulation, lacking the persuasive powers to have these views implemented. </PARA>
<PARA>Another article in today's Australian Financial Review states:</PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition has effectively turned the recommendations of two reports on the wheat industry on their heads . . . </PARA>
<PARA>Those reports had concluded that domestic marketing arrangements needed to be relaxed so that they could prompt improvements in the wheat distribution chain, resulting in significant savings to growers. But those two proposals have been rejected. It is very interesting that in this urgent need for micro-economic reform and efficiency, that obvious, significant proposal slipped through the net. It will be very interesting to see what happens when the matter comes before the Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> The third preliminary point I want to make is that this is quite clearly a diversionary tactic to cover up the inherent contradiction of the macro-economic policies of the Opposition. It has been dealing for some time with the question that interest rates are too high. Therefore, it is obvious that people think that perhaps something should be done about it. Opposition members say that the solution is to tighten fiscal policy. But as Senator Walsh said during Question Time, they will not indicate where they would cut spending. Their alternative is to have a tighter wages policy, but somehow or other, simultaneously, they say that they are concerned about the living standards of Australian families. It may have escaped them that the living standards of Australian families are fundamentally determined by their wages. </PARA>
<PARA> They are saying that wages should be tied to productivity and simultaneously they are saying that the rate of productivity increase is zero. A fairly easy bit of arithmetic shows what the wages outcome of that policy would be. The only redeeming feature of that wages policy is that they are absolutely incapable of delivering it, as they were incapable of delivering it the last time they tried to introduce such a draconian wages policy. They failed then; they would fail again. The other implication which they are trying to hide is the impact of their economic policies on employment growth, which has been an outstanding achievement of the Government, and which they would undermine. </PARA>
<PARA> The fourth point I make covers both a preliminary point and leads me to the substance of the proposal. It is necessary to acknowledge that micro-economic reform is not easy. We need to distinguish between talking about important things and doing something important. There has been a lot of exposition about things that are important to the future of Australia. As far as I know, nobody who has participated in this debate has in any way challenged that. Let us not pretend that there is a magic wand. It is a long, slow and difficult task. This has been the first government to start to confront the matter. I do not want to pretend that we have solved it; I simply say that it is the first time it has been seriously confronted. Is anybody seriously saying that our waterfront problems have emerged since 1983, or that the problems in coastal shipping have arisen since 1983? Every serious commentator acknowledges that, although we have problems, the shipping situation has improved. </PARA>
<PARA> Has the telecommunications monopoly increased since 1983? Of course it has not; it has lessened. There is more to do. I am not trying to say that the problem is resolved. I am saying: let us face up to its seriousness and face up to it honestly. Has the system of consultation and arbitration which leads to this so-called rigidity been introduced by this Labor Government? Of course, it has not. Suddenly, we find that this is a so-called matter of urgency for micro-economic reform, and a few areas where the Government has been successful have suddenly been left off the micro-economic reform agenda because it is inconvenient. The Opposition might have to accept the fact that the Government has done too well. The Government has done better than the Opposition thought was possible, better than it could contemplate, so it decided that it would not talk about it. No wonder the public loses faith in our politicians. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us look at what has happened about the effective rates of protection for Australian industry in the last few years. The effective rate of protection as reported by the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development-and it is not a unique analysis-in 1984-85 was 22 per cent. In 1986-87 it had fallen to 19 per cent and, on the policies as currently formulated, the OECD's estimate, which I think is commonly shared, is that by 1992-93 it will have fallen to 14 per cent. No one wants to pretend that that is the end; that we have reached nirvana. But it is the most substantial change in industry assistance in the history of Australia, the most substantial reform ever. Somehow or other that did not get mentioned. We have also had dramatic reform in the area of taxation policy, in terms of both efficiency and equity. The OECD report discussed it at great length. Senator Button covered it very comprehensively. Those things really need to be acknowledged. Senator Lewis, to his credit, made passing reference to it. In 1983, those were the key areas requiring micro-economic reform. They have been tackled and substantial progress has been made. More needs to be done; it is a long term issue. Let us be serious about it, let us not try to score cheap points on it. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us go to the key areas referred to in the motion as requiring attention: transport and communications and the labour market. The OECD defined four areas in a micro-economic reform agenda: industry policy, tax policy, transport and communications, and labour markets. Let us look firstly at the area of transport and communications. For a start, we have a very fundamental piece of micro-economic reform in the area of transport-the deregulation of the airlines. It has been talked about for a long time. There are even passing indications from time to time that it was the policy of the Liberal Party. But nothing ever happened. The only government that has ever dealt with that issue is this Labor Government. There has been a deathly hush about it from the Opposition because it knows that it was the right policy, correctly introduced. </PARA>
<PARA> There is a continuing, ongoing program of other activities in micro-economic reform in transport and communications. For example, there has been a wide-ranging package of reforms to improve the efficiency and performance of the eight transport and communication government business enterprises. Those changes are not necessarily the end of the road but they are substantial. They are the biggest changes since the last Labor government introduced Telecom Australia and Australia Post which were, in themselves, substantial reforms. We are in the process of creating Austel as a regulatory and price-setting body to oversight the monopoly powers of telecommunications enterprises. I certainly do not believe that the economic or social and welfare elements of Australian society will be enhanced by the fundamental trunk route of telecommunications being opened up to competition or being privatised. </PARA>
<PARA> Coastal shipping, which has been improved, needs more work, but the most substantial review of it ever is taking place at this moment. The task force which is responsible for that is likely to report to the Government this month. That will be when we are all put to the test. It is no good moving these waffly urgency motions and giving expressions of anguish. We need to wait for that report, which is imminent, and deal with it in a substantial way. Let us say what we are all going to do and then let us be judged by the voters on the merits. </PARA>
<PARA> The same situation applies to the waterfront. We have had years of inactivity, predominantly under the auspices of conservative governments. There has been a very extensive inquiry. As Senator Parer said, the Inter State Commission is likely to report soon. My understanding is that the report is likely to be tabled this week. Then we will be able to deal with the substance of what we are all proposing to do-no hand wringing, no grief and anger that somebody ought to do something about these things; we will all be put to the test and the voters will be able to judge us on our merits. So in that area there is a whole range of issues which we all need to confront. </PARA>
<PARA> We also have the fundamental question of labour market reform. In opposition, members of the Liberal Party have always spoken with great passion on this issue. Fortunately, in government they have been relatively ineffective in doing the things they say they will do-fortunately because most of these things would in fact have an adverse effect. But the fundamental thing is that they cannot achieve the most important contribution which industrial relations management can make to efficiency in the Australian economy: they cannot deliver industrial harmony. Their confrontationist approach always leads to an increase in the number of working days lost, which creates very significant problems for Australian industry and its competitiveness. </PARA>
<PARA> The award restructuring and workplace reform that are going on are the most comprehensive ever. They are not completed; more needs to be done. But in 1989 we have going on the most comprehensive reform since Federation. Yet the wimps who did nothing move an urgency motion saying that something needs to be done about labour market and micro-economic reform. The wage system has been developed in a way that facilitates micro-economic reform. A significant education and training program is under way-the most significant established by any Federal government. Award restructuring will provide incentives for skill formation and help to develop more flexible forms of work organisation. The Government is providing substantial assistance for the expansion of practices of information sharing and participation in decision making so that the processes of management and employer-employee relations can be substantially enhanced. The one certainty is that an adversarial approach will not bring about in organisations the fundamental changes in workplace and management attitudes that we require. </PARA>
<PARA> To conclude, I welcome the fact that Senator Button, alone I think amongst the speakers, recognised how difficult such reform is and will continue to be. There are no easy solutions. Much has been done and more needs to be done. This is a phoney motion of urgency. It is a diversionary tactic without a skerrick of a positive contribution-no proposal and no policy. It was designed simply to divert attention from the Opposition's lack of macro-economic policy and a lack of courage in respect of micro-economic reform. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;in reply-I moved this motion of urgency and I now wind up the debate. I totally reject practically everything that Senator McMullan just said. He challenged me to say what our policy is in this area. Let me put it to him in four simple essential elements. Our policies include reduced and restructured taxes, made possible by reduced government spending; reduced and less costly regulation of business activity; a more flexible labour market; and reduced business input costs, especially government taxes and charges. And if this Government had the courage to adopt those four policies it would not be in the bind it is in at present with the economy going down the drain at the rate of $15 billion per annum; that is, over $1 billion per month or $1.7m every hour. That is over $3 1/2m this country has lost in its terms of trade in the course of this debate in the Senate today.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This is occurring at a time when our commodity prices have been at their highest for 10 years. Indeed, some are at record levels. In addition, we have revenue from the massive tourist boom. What is the Government doing about this problem? It is doing absolutely nothing, except borrowing more and selling off our inheritance. </PARA>
<PARA> All that Senator Button could talk about was history. Indeed, some of it went back to `Black Jack' McEwen over 30 years ago. We are talking about micro-economic reform of the waterfront, coastal shipping, rail transport, road transport and communications. We are talking about productivity improvements. That is not some mystical process. It is, in effect, getting rid of waste. I refer to some of the explanations and detail given by my colleagues Senator Hamer and Senator Parer when they spelt out the sort of waste which is going on in this economy at present and the sorts of work practices which have to be altered by this Government. The Government has talked about it and talked about it. Reform in this area was to be the masterpiece of the third Hawke Government-and in fact it is nothing. The situation is so bad now that even the Governor of the Reserve Bank of Australia, Mr Johnston, has had to raise it as a matter of urgency. Let me quote what he said:</PARA>
<PARA> The so-called micro policies of reform-of work practices and the established ways of doing things-have a major role to play in raising productivity. </PARA>
<PARA> These are more-not less-urgent when all is not going smoothly at the macro level. </PARA>
<PARA>It could not have been put any clearer than that. I call upon the Senate to support this matter of urgency. </PARA>

<PARA> STATEMENT TO PARLIAMENT</PARA>
<PARA> Construction work on the Parliament House has now been completed. The work remaining involves defects rectification and the finishing touches to the formal gardens on the House of Representatives side of the building. </PARA>
<PARA> As in the past years I will now provide honourable members with the updated budget figures for the project which will bring them to August 1988 prices-just after the commencement of the Parliament's operations. Given the stage reached and the relatively minor movements in the budget, after that period it is the Minister's intention for future reporting to revert to six monthly rather than three monthly reports. </PARA>
<PARA> The revised building budget now stands at $914.4 million with another $158.45 million for the non building items. The total project budget is therefore increased to $1072.85 million in August 1988 prices. </PARA>
<PARA> This updating includes $1.64 million for the effects of inflation in the three months period calculated on escalating the unexpended portion of the budget. </PARA>
<PARA> Additional components include $0.77 million for redundancy payments and $1.56 million for industrial dispute costs. Only $0.32 million of this last figure is for costs incurred in the August quarter: there were no industrial dispute costs in July. The other $1.24 million were costs incurred for a significant strike in March 1988, the reimbursement for which was delayed until now. </PARA>
<PARA> After almost 8 months of occupancy, many of the early minor problems have now been rectified. I am sure that Members and Senators are appreciative of the improved facilities which of course contribute to the fulfilment of their responsibilities as representatives of their constituents. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the paper. </PARA>
<PARA>In speaking to the annual report of the Australian bicentennial road development program, I want to emphasise how much appreciated this program has been. Originally an initiative of the Fraser Government, it was supported enthusiastically by the then Minister, the Hon. Ralph Hunt. The program finally came into effect on 20 December 1982, for the purpose of providing a major impetus to the development of Australia's road system by the bicentennial year. This was to be financed by a special surcharge on diesel fuel and motor spirit. It is about the progress over those years and the expenditure of that surcharge that I want to make a few points this afternoon.</PARA>
<PARA> I commend the fact that a major part of the program has been to upgrade the national highways. However, in the process we seem to have forgotten the arterial and rural roads. The situation has now developed where local authorities have not been given enough for their own areas even to maintain those arterial roads. What has resulted is a major discrepancy between the two-wonderful national highways; however when we drive off the highways all we get are pot-holed surfaces and many times roads that have been returned to dirt and gravel instead of bitumen because councils cannot afford the upkeep. Local authorities are, naturally, very concerned about the Government's refusal to acknowledge that insufficient funding has become a gigantic problem. Cuts have been particularly bad and have had a major impact in country areas. It has become impossible to keep up with the demand for new and improved roads to cater for the needs of the transport industry and the individual motorist. </PARA>
<PARA> Some months ago, the Royal Automobile Club of Queensland undertook a State-wide survey of roads and found that country roads are so rough that motorists are often forced to drive on the shoulders rather than on the potholed bitumen. It also found that many roads become impassable when it rains, and that they are deteriorating more rapidly than city and shire councils can repair them. Existing networks are rapidly falling into disrepair because of the decline in maintenance allocations. The transport industry and private motorists have been forced to bear the financial burden of increased maintenance and operating costs brought about by declining standards of road maintenance. The high cost of wear and tear on transport vehicles is then being passed on to consumers in the form of higher prices. I emphasise that a safe, reliable road network is of fundamental importance to our nation's economy. </PARA>
<PARA> As this report indicates, the Australian bicentennial road development program was to be financed by a special surcharge on petrol. What has happened is that while more than half the money spent by motorists on petrol goes to the Federal Government, for every litre of petrol or diesel purchased, the Government takes about 30c in tax, returning only about 5.35c to the motorist in the form of road funding. Consequently, it has placed greater financial strain on local and State authorities, already struggling to cope with rising costs. </PARA>
<PARA> The present Government's spending on roads has fallen by 30 per cent in real terms over the last four years, including a direct cut of $33m this financial year. In other words, that represents a total cut of $350m. No wonder our roads are falling apart. </PARA>
<PARA> Although my time is running out, I take this opportunity to quote from a number of articles about the state of the roads in rural Queensland. One said:</PARA>
<PARA> Lack of road funding is an insult to every travel- ling motorist. It is an insult to our intelligence to get so little back from our fuel tax for our roads. </PARA>
<PARA>Another said:</PARA>
<PARA> It is unfair that people in the most productive areas of Australia have to put up with deteriorating roads while money for roads is lavished on Sydney, Melbourne and Canberra. </PARA>
<PARA>We need to think about all these comments for a little longer than the five minutes we are given to speak to these reports. I have no doubt that when the Bill dealing with the bicentennial roads comes in I will be able to say a little more about this. The road network is vital to all Australians. It is the vital basis for our economy. This Government has an obligation that extends beyond the national highway network to ensure that all Australians are served by the highest standard road network. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The annual report of the Australian bicentennial road development program attempts to set out the contribution made by this Government to improving Australia's roads network. When reading the document one notes not so much what the Government has achieved but rather what the Government has failed to achieve because in this regard there is certainly much more to report. As some of us would know, Australia's roads carry 97 per cent of all passenger journeys, 77 per cent of all freight, 83 per cent of all domestic tourism and 43 per cent of overseas tourist journeys between capital cities. Poor roads serve to isolate communities, increase fuel consumption, damage vehicles and increase the cost of goods.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> On page 4 of the report, under the heading of benefits, reference is made to the savings in vehicle maintenance and running costs, including fuel consumption which comes from better roads. It is ironic, therefore, that over the past five years, while the present Hawke Labor Government has been in power, most motorists have wasted two weeks of their life sitting in traffic jams. These traffic jams are becoming the bane of all motorists. Up to 20 minutes of each peak hour can be spent standing still. Around half the fuel used by motorists could be saved if the present stop-start traffic jams were avoided. On highways, fuel consumption could drop by up to 30 per cent if the Government was prepared to do something about it. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us look now at the source of funds for the Government's road development program. As the previous speaker, Senator Bjelke-Petersen, said, this Government has used fuel taxes to bludgeon the Australian motorist into submission. Petrol, a necessity for so many people, is taxed at the rate of over 120 per cent. In 1983-84, 66 per cent of fuel excise was spent on roads; now it is just 23 per cent. In 1988, 5.66c a litre of the fuel excise was spent on roads. In 1989 that figure has gone down to 4.95c a litre. </PARA>
<PARA> Research by automobile authorities has revealed that half of the existing road surfaces in Australia are over 20 years old. As previous speakers have said, 20 years is considered to be the maximum life span of a road surface. The neglect which this Government has allowed to occur will mean that it will be faced with massive costs for replacement. I note also that if a road is widened by one metre the number of fatalities occurring on that road can be halved. If funding were to be provided to allow for the provision of dual carriageways, we could reduce the number of fatalities by around 80 per cent. It has been said by automobile authorities that this Government's cuts in road funding could result in something like 7,000 lives being lost by the year 2000. About 600 people a year will die because of funding cuts. </PARA>
<PARA> The Australian public is by now well and truly fed up with the neglect of our roads. As a result, we have recently had placed before us the fourth major roads Bill from this Government in the last four years. The latest one, the Australian Centennial Roads Development Bill, allows the Government at the stroke of a pen to cut the level of funding owing to roads. It contains a veritable minefield of potholes for the unwary motorist. The indexation provisions contained in the ACRD legislation operate when they are determined by the Minister. We know that the Australian land transport program also was supposed to be indexed. However, the Government saw fit to index down the initial 3.66c per litre to 3.241c per litre to keep a constant dollar value of $810m. This latest price deflator manipulation has increased by 8 per cent less than the consumer price index. So the Government's fuel tax rip-off will continue its increasing spiral with a fuel consumption increase of about 3 per cent per annum. It will not be long before that figure the Government reaps is $6.5 billion. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, the Treasurer (Mr Keating) and the Minister responsible will have ample scope under the ACRD program to manipulate the level of road funding in real terms and, therefore, further discriminate against Australian motorists in order to meet their election promises. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes. I will get to that in a minute. Mr Hunt did a great deal for this program. It is a pity that this Government has done the damage that it has to it. The program is nearing completion and it is a sad thing that all that was set out to be achieved has not been achieved. As a rural based senator I find that the most frequent complaint is about roads. It is little wonder, because we have a government that in one month can provide millions of dollars to build a bridge across a river in South East Asia, yet it cannot find the resources to help the people in Wellington, New South Wales, to build a bridge, or to provide funds for other river crossings across the State. People definitely have a right to complain about how this Government has treated the road system in Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> For many months of the year our roads are impassable. The recent wet weather has caused enormous problems for thousands of country people. Only this morning I received a complaint from a veterinarian who lives no more than 30 kilometres from this building. He has been complaining about the state of the road in his area for the past three years, as have his neighbours. In desperation the local community has on several occasions made temporary repairs itself. When people complain to the local council they are told that no funds are available for repair. Instead of providing a more permanent solution, the council keeps sending out trucks with sand to toss in the creek crossing. The result is that there is both water and sand on the road and unsuspecting travellers get their cars bogged in the mess regularly. Understandably, this veterinarian is fed up. He asked me what can be done. </PARA>
<PARA> The people in the Yass and Goulburn districts are asking how many people must die before the Hume Highway is upgraded and diverted away from these towns. Let us look at the figures for New South Wales in the last year. Some 1,041 people died on the roads, but the preliminary figure for injuries as a result of accidents in New South Wales during 1988 stands at 36,700 people, with 9,000 of those people being seriously injured. As we drive along the Hume Highway we are likely to see half a dozen wreaths on the posts signifying the latest victims of our national highway system. This is the same highway along which the Government proudly displays signs telling us that it is a bicentennial road project. Let us remember that in May 1988 Senator Walsh admitted to the Parliament that there was actually a cut in road expenditure of $350m in just four years. That is the problem besetting this country at the moment. Country people will not stand it for much longer. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government raises some $7 billion through taxes and excises. This is likely to rise dramatically this year to $10 billion, yet only $1.2 billion of those taxes is being put back into the road system. We can understand people's anger. We must also remember that for every $1 million not spent on roads transport industry costs increase by some $3 million. This country cannot afford to have its road funding cut back as this Government is doing. The Government stands condemned for what it is doing. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The annual report on the Australian bicentennial road development program reveals that $72.5m is being spent on the section of the Pacific Highway between Sydney and Newcastle to the west of Lake Macquarie. This section was opened to motorists during the year. This $72.5m worth of work is of great significance because it is the money that should have been spent on the Berrima-Mittagong bypass when the previous Government set the Hume Highway upgrading as the top priority for the national highway system and the Australian bicentennial road development program.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Hume Highway was given top priority by the excellent Minister for Transport and Construction, Mr Hunt, because in fact it is the highway which carries major traffic volumes and sustains the greatest number of deaths and disasters. Instead of proceeding with what was described at the time as the Mittagong-Berrima bypass-a bypass of two towns-which was planned in 1981-82 and agreed by the communities in that region and the State Government as having top priority, Mr Peter Morris, the Labor Minister for Transport in the new Labor Government, who lived in Newcastle, had a different set of priorities. So instead of the towns of Mittagong and Berrima being bypassed, only the Berrima section of the bypass was opened, just a couple of weeks ago. As a result, the town of Mittagong is an isolated island in the midst of two long stretches of freeway. This is the worst possible position to leave a town in, particularly a town which has many young and old people. It is a ludicrous situation because these people have to try to cross a road which is heavily used by trucks and cars which come off freeways at both ends of the town. The people who made that decision to divert that funding away from the Mittagong and Berrima bypass must bear a heavy responsibility for the inevitable accidents and loss of life that will take place in the four years that we will now have to wait before the freeway bypass that had been planned back in 1982 is eventually completed. </PARA>
<PARA> On the day that the Berrima section of the bypass was opened, I protested to Mr Hollis, the local Federal member for the area, that it was a tragedy that only half of the bypass had been completed. He denied that there had been any plans under the previous Government; he denied that there had been any plans by Mr Hunt or the Department; he denied that there had been any priority given to the Hume Highway. He said that in fact there had been no plans for a bypass when he had been elected as the member for Macarthur. Of course, that is simply false. All of the residents of the region know that it is totally, completely and malevolently false. The evidence for that comes from his own mouth. Shortly after his election in 1983 he said that the Mittagong and Berrima bypass-that is, a single bypass-would commence shortly and that the Labor Government was committed to funding the bypass. He did not say `two bypasses'; he said `the bypass'. </PARA>
<PARA> The fact is that Mr Hollis has so failed his electorate, the people of Mittagong and all drivers who use the Hume Highway, and this Government has succumbed to pressure from a former Minister for Transport from Newcastle, that roughly 30 kilometres of freeway on the western side of Lake Macquarie with a very low traffic frequency relative to the Hume Highway is now receiving priority of funding in the classic Labor pork-barrelling fashion that this Government is famous for. It is a disgrace that this money has been diverted from this Hume Highway bypass. I can only hope that despite the dangerous position in which the town of Mittagong has been placed by this Government, it will in fact escape with few accidents. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In taking note of the annual report on the Australian bicentennial road development program, I want to draw the attention of the Senate to a recent and what I consider to be a somewhat shabby exercise that has been entered into by the Minister for Land Transport and Shipping Support, the Hon. Bob Brown. Mr Brown wrote to local councils on 10 March to argue against the case presented by road user organisations such as the Australian Automobile Association (AAA). In that letter he attempts to discredit that campaign for more road funding. In one part of the letter he said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>I have been concerned that one of the three Government partners in our road development programs would choose to ally itself with a private motorist organisation in its campaign against one of the other partners. </PARA>
<PARA>Local councils could well be confused by Mr Brown's perception of partnership. Road funding has been cut by successive governments unilaterally. During the course of the Australian bicentennial road development program, the report of which we are discussing today, spending in real terms has declined. In all that time local government has never been invited to be represented around the table when the decisions on expenditure have been made. The bicentennial road development program was not a project in partnership with local government by any stretch of the imagination, because local government was never given the opportunity to participate in the decision making about the level of funds to be provided. </PARA>
<PARA> Prior to the adoption of the successor of the bicentennial road development program-the Australian centennial road development program-there had been no invitation for our partners in government at the local level to consult with the Federal Government in order to reach a consensus on the best approach. Had such an invitation been issued, it would have been enthusiastically accepted by local government and perhaps its input would have meant the avoidance of the misunderstandings that resulted from the defective bit of legislation that was presented to the Senate before Christmas last year. </PARA>
<PARA> In his letter to the councils Mr Brown went on to suggest that the Federal Government should not have the major responsibility for roads. He says that accepting responsibility for the national highway system should be enough. We all know the effects of that. Despite the Federal Government being the major beneficiary of the fuel excise levy, after national highways take the cream off the top of the revenue can, local roads are at the end of the funding queue. Local government is entitled to make the point that the major beneficiary of road user charges should take the major responsibility for expenditure. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Brown goes on in his letter to say something with which I can agree. He says:</PARA>
<PARA>Fuel taxes were never intended simply to finance road-works. They are part of the Government's total tax structure and like other revenues also assist other areas of government responsibility such as pensions, education, health, defence, assistance to veterans, child care, and so on. </PARA>
<PARA>The one problem with that argument is that almost all the government services which he has listed have also been the subject of cuts. In some cases, like pensions, veterans' entitlements and child-care, the cuts have been severe and are carried by those in the community least able to bear them. </PARA>
<PARA> The statement the Minister makes begs the question of where the revenue goes. Some undeniably goes to compensate for the loss of revenue resulting from negative gearing for company takeovers-a tax measure to look after the Government's corporate mates. Local government is entitled to feel cheated when it is aware of the use that is made of these funds-funds that are desperately needed for road infrastructure. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister, in an attempt to mislead the readers of his letter, vaunted the fact that $20m had been spent on national roads since 1983. He tried to fudge the issue that in real terms funding has declined. Mr Brown told local councils of his disappointment at the photo on the front of the AAA brochure, which he says is a desert track somewhere in the outback. I have seen plenty of bitumen roads in the country which are being torn up because councils cannot afford to maintain them any longer. The Minister concludes his letter by saying:</PARA>
<PARA>You will understand my disappointment that some councils in our third tier of government would choose to support and assist the AAA campaign. </PARA>
<PARA>The Australian Democrats support any public awareness campaign which ensures the truth about such programs as the bicentennial road development program. We think this letter from Mr Brown is a pretty shabby exercise which is unworthy of him and the Government. Our partners in government have not been treated as partners in respect of road funding. The road networks are disappearing. A letter which is aimed at misleading and intimidating councils is not worthy of this Minister. </PARA>
<PARA> In conclusion, can I just say that the Democrats would like to see an Australian centennial rail development program developed as a road safety measure similar to the program we have for roads. That is a measure which we will be pressing forward with over the course of this year. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We will talk about that some other time. Perhaps the honourable senator may be more interested in the roads that need funding in Western Australia. The point I make is that I was in local government when the measure was first introduced. At that time 2c per litre of the fuel tax was passed on to road making-not necessarily to maintenance, but to road improvement and new road development. For the first time local government could budget with confidence to improve the road system in Western Australia. In the earlier 1980s we certainly saw the improvement of the Great Eastern Highway, the freeways around Perth and the Great Northern Highway. In fact, the Great Northern Highway was finally sealed, through this scheme, right through to Darwin.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Unfortunately, in the last three or four years under this Government, with cuts in funds, we have seen the deterioration of roads in Western Australia and also the postponement of urgent works like the Northam bypass. If Senator McKiernan ever gets far enough away from the city-100 kilometres or less- he will see that the northern bypass is a much needed road. Improvements on the Great Eastern Highway have had to be delayed time and time again because of the lack of funds. </PARA>
<PARA> This Government indexed fuel excise to the extent that it has now reached about 21c per litre, but the Government failed to index what went back into roads. I do not decry the fact that some of the duty on fuel goes into other measures that Government has to fulfil in social security and other matters, but what goes back into roads must also be indexed. This Government has failed badly in that respect. </PARA>
<PARA> We all know that while the amount of fuel excise used for roads is not indexed, the cost of road making is certainly indexed by the increasing cost in labour, fuel and so on. As one example, a fairly decent-sized, heavy road grader that one could buy for $100,000 four years ago would now cost $400,000 when this Government has pegged what it puts into roads at $1.2 or $1.5 billion. There is certainly indexation in that way. That is the reason State governments and local governments cannot keep up the spending on roads that they should. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course, the Australian bicentennial road development program gave way to the issue that we debated in the dying hours of the spring session in 1988. Once again, the Government has fixed the amount that will go back into roads at 4.95c a litre instead of starting off at a figure of 6c which would once again get money back into roads. That would be an increase of about 25 to 30 per cent above what is the case at present. </PARA>
<PARA> It is not too late for this Government to index that figure now so that we can once again build good roads and, what is more, safe roads. The Minister for Resources, if he does get out into the country in Western Australia, will see that that is needed and will report that back to his Government and ask it to fix its folly. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The report of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade is an important one since it surveys the entire field of Australia's overseas aid and development assistance program. Importantly, it confirms the fact that this program has suffered a disproportionate burden of expenditure reductions in recent years compared with other portfolios. As I said in debate early in March on the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (General Capital Increase) Bill, official government development assistance and aid has dropped from about 0.56 per cent of gross domestic product (GDP) to 0.36 per cent in the three years to 1988. The Development Assistance Commission of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) has indicated that no other member country has ever reduced aid volume so dramatically.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That is a very important point to remember, particularly when one reflects on the Australian Labor Party's stated policy in this area. There is again a reduction from 0.56 per cent to 0.36 per cent of gross domestic product. The report echoes many of the views that I put forward in the recent debate in March. I would like to focus today on that section of the report dealing with Australia's participation in two international financial institutions: first, the World Bank and, second, the Asian Development Bank. </PARA>
<PARA> I had hoped that the report might have appeared prior to the debate in this chamber in March on Australia's share increase to the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development since the report does enforce the arguments that I made at that time for more comprehensive reporting of Australia's participation in the World Bank and, indeed, the Asian Development Bank. The Joint Committee says that Australia's policy towards the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank is not based on a broad view of the banks as developing agencies, bodies that must take into account social and environmental effects and goals in the shaping of their programs. Rather, the Committee believes that policy is based on too narrow a view of the banks simply as banks, bodies that borrow and lend funds for different purposes and simply judge whether there are going to be sufficient returns on loans to cover costs. </PARA>
<PARA> That is not what the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank are about. It is pleasing to see that at least the World Bank has in recent months expressed itself unequivocally on those issues. To help bring Australia's policy towards the World Bank into broader perspective, I moved on behalf of the Democrats in that recent debate an amendment that would, amongst other things, have called for an annual report that would be made by the Treasurer in terms of our participation. Such a report would look at three major items: the effectiveness of the World Bank's programs on the alleviation of poverty, the effectiveness of the programs to prevent environmental degradation and what account has been taken of the views and needs of indigenous peoples. </PARA>
<PARA> While a gutted form of our amendment did pass, those essential elements unfortunately were not amongst the items that the Government would be required to report upon. The coalition accepted the Government's assertion that reporting would be too difficult. I think it is interesting that, while this chamber thought that that type of reporting would be too difficult, the American Congress, as one legislature, has made mandatory far more comprehensive reporting than even I was suggesting. It seems to believe it is feasible. Indeed, with regard to the alleviation of world poverty, it went so far as to set down the precise indices that should be used in judging the effectiveness of programs-for example, female literacy rates, death rates of children under five, and a number of others. In other words, there are concrete measures by which we are able to ascertain whether those types of programs going into various places are effective in the alleviation of poverty. </PARA>
<PARA> During that particular debate I made the point that the World Bank is trying to report publicly on those issues. I find the analysis in the Committee's report reinforces even further the points that I made when it states:</PARA>
<PARA> Effective membership requires greater participation and awareness of development issues in policy formation. The Bank's implementation of this poverty alleviation strategies requires a broad understanding of developing countries. The programs must be carefully monitored . . . </PARA>
<PARA>Again I quote:</PARA>
<PARA>The Bank's president . . . has introduced a requirement that each report to the IBRD board on adjustment programs comment specifically on the program's social impact on the poor. </PARA>
<PARA>Those particular items should be noted in terms of this report because they show that an increasing emphasis is being placed-unfortunately not by our country but certainly by others-on the operations of those particular institutions. Again, the Committee notes that Australia's leading representative at the Bank's executive boards is always a Treasury officer. The Committee underlines the fact that there is no guarantee that this person will have expertise in development issues. Furthermore, the Committee does not find any effective dialogue between Treasury and the development experts in Australia's International Development Assistance Bureau (AIDAB) on matters of policy substance. The Committee says:</PARA>
<PARA>There must be regular and real dialogue between senior Treasury and AIDAB officials on the critical issues facing the banks. A proper Australian position on the Banks' approach to structural adjustment, Third world debt or the impact of aid on the environment cannot be achieved by the current resort telephone calls and faxes. </PARA>
<PARA>To overcome this situation, the Committee recommends that responsibility for policy formulation should shift away from Treasury and towards AIDAB-attached, as it is, to the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade. To this end, the Foreign Affairs and Trade Minister, not the Treasurer, should be Australia's representative on the boards of governors of both the World and Asian Development Banks. The Australian Democrats concur wholeheartedly with that suggestion. The argument that needs to be carried in this regard is that we are not looking at narrow financial principles-as Senator Stone and Senator Walsh argued in concert in that recent debate-but rather at the broader world view and the view that countries such as Japan have lately indicated that they are pursuing, and policies which the World Bank, in terms of its turning down of the loan for further dams on the Amazon, has recently indicated it is now willing to follow. </PARA>
<PARA> Those three issues-the alleviation of poverty, the effects on the environment and the views of indigenous people-are three items that ought to form the backbone of our attitude to further operations in this area. That resolution of the Committee and its recommendation to have the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade as the representative rather than the Treasurer would go a long way to bringing those broader and probably more sympathetic views, from our point of view, to bear on the operations of our relationships with those development authorities. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This report, A Review of the Australian International Development Assistance Bureau and Australia's Overseas Aid Program, is a very important one and it has taken a considerable amount of effort to compile. I hope that the Government takes good notice of the recommendations. I would like to mention just a few of them-first of all, one on volume. I quote from the report:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> If Australia's adherence to the 0.7% ODA:GNP target is not to become purely rhetorical there must be rapid growth in aid as a proportion of GNP. By 1992 Australian aid should once again stand at 0.5% of GNP. </PARA>
<PARA>We are a long way short of that. Our current level of foreign aid is 0.36, which is just up a little bit from 0.34 of the previous year. As Senator Macklin has said, in the previous year the Development Assistance Committee of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development was quite scathing in its criticism of Australia's contribution to foreign aid and talked about the level of cuts which were evident in the previous budget. I quote from the report:</PARA>
<PARA> The Committee regretted that the aid budget had suffered a disproportionately high share of the cuts in total public expenditure . . . In view of the urgent aid needs of many developing countries and the desirability of sustaining an adequate joint aid effort, the Committee urged the Australian authorities to resume real increases in aid. </PARA>
<PARA>It is to the Government's credit that last year Mr Hawke's guarantee that aid would not fall below 0.36 per cent of gross national product (GNP) occurred in the last budget. It is welcomed but it falls far short of the Australian Labor Party platform commitment to achieve 0.55 per cent by 1990. Of course, the new Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Senator Gareth Evans, made some speeches along those lines when he first took over the portfolio. He said that he hoped that the level of aid would be increased from 0.36 per cent of GNP to 0.40 per cent in the next budget. It remains to be seen whether that will be a reality but I hope that it will be as the first stage of reaching that commitment of 0.55 per cent of GNP by 1990. </PARA>
<PARA> There is a lot of public support for increasing Government foreign aid. Public opinion polls indicate that people still believe that Australia can and should help the poor. Public support for aid is reflected strongly in the significant increase in public donations to non-government organisations. Donations increased from a total of $33m in 1982 to $68m in 1987. The amount has more than doubled in five years. There is a lot of community support for foreign aid. It is always worth reminding people in the Australian community, and particularly the decision makers, that aid is a two-way street. Over 90 per cent of Australia's bilateral aid is provided as goods; that is, food aid, machinery, etc, or services such as those of agriculturalists, doctors, teachers and so on sourced in Australia. Cutting aid actually means job losses in Australia. In looking forward to the next budget, we hope that there will be no cut in foreign aid. </PARA>
<PARA> Equally, of course, the economies of neighbouring Third World countries must grow and develop if trade opportunities are to improve. As we keep hearing from our Asian and Pacific neighbours, who are the major recipients of Australian aid, they are really seeking economic security. Even if we are considering it only from a position of enlightened self-interest, providing as much aid as we can within our region is a means of peace-keeping and building good relationships. </PARA>
<PARA> The Australian aid program needs a poverty focus. This has been very clearly outlined by the Australian Council for Overseas Aid (ACFOA), the umbrella group of non-government organisations that cooperates very closely with the Australian International Development Assistance Bureau (AIDAB), the Government organisation, to fund and provide the infra- structure for overseas aid. What ACFOA has to say about a poverty focus is very important. Public support for foreign aid in Australia is principally dependent on aid having that focus. People support giving aid because they want to see poverty ended. It is gratifying to understand that there is that support in the community, that people have a global outlook and are not only concerned with improving their own material lifestyles. The second reason is that the impact of aid will be greatest if focused on assisting the poor. Recent studies such as Does Aid Work have highlighted the effectiveness of targeting aid to assist the poor. Aid does work. </PARA>
<PARA> Several other donor countries have adopted a poverty focus. Last year the Canadian Government agreed to a new emphasis in its aid program on dealing with poverty first, on human rights and on partnerships with non-government groups. That sounds like a very good balance to me. The Dutch Government's poverty focus for its aid program has strengthened domestic support for the aid program and protected the program from cuts whilst other areas of public expenditure have been pruned. We have not quite got to that stage in Australia yet, but I hope that we will and that there will be a greater conscience about Australia's contribution to ending poverty worldwide by making sure that we have a very healthy aid program focus in our region. </PARA>
<PARA> Achieving a poverty focus requires a geographical focus, sectoral priorities and acceptance of popular participation as the key to successful development. Popular participation is very important indeed, because it has been demonstrated very clearly that non-government organisations, when they are reaching directly to the people who are to be the recipients of aid, find that aid moneys are not wasted on programs which are not designed to suit the needs of the recipients themselves. Obviously, if they have got a lot of say in designing programs, the money will be best spent. </PARA>
<PARA> It has also become very clear that too little Australian aid is targeted for health programs, particularly preventive health programs in the Pacific island states. Too much Australian aid goes to large scale capital intensive infrastructural projects. Health, education, training, village level agriculture and water resource development should be given more emphasis as they are the cornerstones of a poverty focus. </PARA>
<PARA> I would also like to comment on the section in the report's recommendations on human rights at paragraph 10.55 on page 139. I quote from the report:</PARA>
<PARA>Effective aid delivery demands consideration of human rights issues . . . </PARA>
<PARA> Broadly speaking, aid should be increased to those countries where the observation of human rights is improving. Where the opposite is the case aid should be reduced . . . </PARA>
<PARA> In cases where abuse is particularly serious, and the government is recalcitrant, the suspension of aid should be considered. The effectiveness of the sanctions in changing government performance must be addressed. Australia should follow the course of action most likely to improve the lives of the victims of human rights abuse. </PARA>
<PARA>The Philippines would be a very important case study in considering the question of aid in relation to human rights. Human rights violations in the Philippines have been very well documented by an Amnesty International report. I recently had the opportunity to visit the Philippines and saw for myself many examples of violations of human rights. I know that Senator Gareth Evans raised the question of human rights violations when he met President Aquino and others in the Philippine administration. However, I do not think that he was nearly tough enough on the Philippine Government in that respect. That is exactly what the report suggests, that where violations of human rights are particularly serious the suspension of aid should be considered. I am not suggesting the suspension of aid altogether, because poverty is rampant in the Philippines, the people desperately need help, and they consider that they have a lot of support in their struggles for social justice and their moves towards democracy. I believe that our aid should be redirected towards non-government organisations, of which there are many ready, willing and able to take any transfer that comes from Australia as the aid is withdrawn from government to government projects and directed to the people who need it most.</PARA>
<PARA> I do not think there could be much argument about the violations of human rights which continue in the Philippines. Many people I met said that the abuse is now much worse than it was under the Marcos regime. They repeatedly told me, `Under Marcos we were afraid of being detained; under the Aquino Government we are afraid of being killed'. That was volunteered to me over and over again. Anybody who is working for a cause oriented group in the Philippines is considered a subversive and is considered liable for targeting by the vigilantes in what Cory Aquino has described as her policy of total war. There can be no democracy in the Philippines at the point of a gun. I experienced democracy Philippine-style at the point of a gun when I was there and it was not a very pleasant experience. So I do not believe that we should be giving any support to the Cory Aquino Administration while these violations of human rights continue. They are abounding and increasing and their record on human rights is getting worse. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am tempted on this occasion to debate the question of the Philippines as it has been raised, but I want to concentrate on the appalling record of the Hawke Government in relation to foreign aid as is now recorded by the bipartisan Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade. I refer particularly to chapter VI of the Committee's report headed `The Amount of Aid'. It reminds us that since the report of the Committee to Review the Australian Overseas Aid Program, known as the Jackson report, aid has in fact been slashed by 19 per cent in real terms. In other words, between 1985-86 and 1988-89, 19 per cent has been slashed in real terms from the contribution that Australia makes to foreign aid. It is also emphasised in the report that these cuts have come at a time when conditions have been worsening in most developing countries. So the consequence of this slashing of aid is greater than might be first appreciated.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The report looks very briefly at why this cut may have occurred and clearly forms the view that the cut has occurred because it has been the easy option for government-a soft option, emphasised by some research which, I must say, regrettably indicates that Australians feel that if one is going to cut in some area it is better to cut assistance to other countries and to those who are worse off. I regret that this Government has adopted that easy option and, therefore, in what I accept have been difficult economic times, has slashed foreign aid, as Senator Macklin mentioned a moment ago, at a greater rate than any other area the subject of government cutback. </PARA>
<PARA> The most dramatic year was 1986-87, which involved a cutback in real terms of 11.9 per cent. The Senate will remember that year as the year in which this Government embarrassingly abrogated the just renegotiated foreign aid agreement with Papua New Guinea (PNG). This Government, after renegotiating a reduction in that agreement, which was not easy for PNG to accept in its difficult circumstances, within a matter of months reneged on its agreement. As I recall, it sent Senator Gareth Evans on a trip to PNG, our nearest neighbour and the greatest recipient of our assistance, to tell its Government that we were chopping another $10m off our aid contribution. The consequences of that unilateral cut far exceeded the monetary consideration. There was a considerable loss of confidence by PNG in Australia that has never been totally overcome. It was a matter of regret to many of us at the time that this Government would fail to keep its deals in a way that resulted in a lowering of Australia's standing in the international community. </PARA>
<PARA> Additionally, these cutbacks regrettably have meant that the greatest cost has been borne in regions that can afford it least; in other words, in the regions of the world where there is chronic poverty, particularly in areas of Africa and South East Asia. That has occurred because a considerable percentage of our foreign aid goes to PNG, although we reneged upon our deal, and because multi- lateral support is locked into the Budget. Therefore, the bilateral assistance we have offered to desperate places has gone to those who have suffered the greatest share of the burden. I believe that is regrettable, and I use this opportunity to state so. </PARA>
<PARA> Furthermore the Committee mentioned that the result of these cutbacks may well have had a detrimental effect on the quality of Australia's aid. The reason for that, of course, is that significant aid projects take some time to put into place, to establish, and require some ongoing support. If there are continual cutbacks, it tends to be in those areas in the first instance and, therefore, the quality of assistance can be detrimentally affected. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like to mention-as Senator Macklin did-that it is not only this bipartisan committee of the Parliament or the Opposition that has lamented the Government's appalling record in this area, but it has also been noted by the international community. I particularly refer to the Development Assistance Committee (DAC) of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, the donors club committee. It described the fall in Australian aid as unprecedented-that is, that no Western country has ever reduced aid so far so fast. What an appalling indictment upon this Government! Late in 1987 the DAC conducted its biannual peer review of Australia's aid program. Almost half of its two-page press release was devoted to criticism of Australia's declining aid volume. I find that embarrassing. The Opposition finds that embarrassing. The Committee notes that the United Nations target-the target we all know in foreign aid being 0.77 per cent-has now fallen to almost 0.3 per cent. The Committee expresses its concern that this target expressed as percentage of aid against gross national product is now simply becoming purely rhetorical. We experienced that in recent times with Senator Gareth Evans giving speeches saying how his Government was going to arrest this decline and contribute to an increasing record in this area. Yet if we look at the years of his Government, we see it went down from 0.51 to 0.5 per cent to 0.46 per cent, down to 0.38 per cent down to 0.37 per cent and now down to 0.36 per cent. This is a consistent pattern of decline. There is no evidence that indicates the Government is going to do anything to arrest that decline. </PARA>
<PARA> The two specific areas that immediately come to mind that are required to be addressed-I think I have addressed both on previous occasions in the Senate as being short-sighted examples of the Government's policy-are in relation to United Nations bodies. The first is in relation to the International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD). That fund was formed in 1977 to address the need to increase food production in the poorest food deficit countries. This Government has declined to meet the third replenishment of IFAD, a matter that has been criticised by the international community, by the United Nations, by the World Bank and by our own private donor organisations-Community Aid Abroad and the Australian Council for Overseas Aid. It is short-sighted because it is a body that can contribute to helping the poorest nations of the world increase their own food supplies, which is something I would have thought all Australians would wish to see. It is short-sighted also because it is an opportunity for Australian commerce, through this organisation, to get further into the world of international consultancies, which can actually be highly remunerative. A country that suffers our balance of payments problem I would have thought would be one that would want to use these opportunities. </PARA>
<PARA> The second short-sighted area is the Government's intention to withdraw from the United Nations Industrial Development Organisation. Similar arguments apply and the Committee, at page 81 of the report, drew the attention of those who read it to the fact that Australian companies are losing opportunities for investing in developing countries as a result of this decision. I draw the attention of the Senate to this short-sighted approach of the Government. On any humanitarian approach the Government's record in this area is appalling. If one looks at a foreign relations approach, our capacity to influence within our region and in the international community generally, the result of the Government's policy is that we have reduced capacity to influence in ways that can be to our benefit. If we look to the purely pragmatic commercial basis, as I indicated a moment ago, as a result of this Government's policies Australia is losing commercial opportunities, which is foolish in our current precarious economic circumstances. I abhor what the Government has decided to do. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The problem with sessional orders in discussing a report such as this report of the Joint Committee on Foreign, Affairs, Defence and Trade-a review of the Australian International Development Assistance Bureau and Australia's overseas aid program-is that we only have 10 minutes to address very major issues contained therein. I would have liked to address quite a number of the issues that have been raised in this report quite rightly by the Committee. But because of the limitation of 10 minutes I will have to focus on some of the recommendations and conclusions of the report which are questionable. I will deal briefly with one of the recommendations of the Committee concerning population which is dealt with on page 110 of the report.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The recommendation of the Committee that Australia substantially increase its funding to the United Nations Fund for Population Activities (UNFPA) will multiply the shameful attacks on the human rights of the world's poor which have been perpetrated by the well-heeled international population control establishment. This recommendation appears to be based on information which has been given to the Committee by Dr Sadik, the director of the UNFPA, which is misleading, and by certain demographers. I have studied the transcript. Some of that evidence is downright false. The Committee, not having been made aware of all of the facts, has done its best. Indeed it sought to ensure that no funds be paid to organisations involved in countries pursuing coercive family planning practices. However, false and misleading statements have been made to the Committee. I note that the Committee's report says at page 108:</PARA>
<PARA>In their discussions with Dr Sadik, the executive director of UNFPA, members of the Committee sought assurances that UNFPA had not funded programs which involved coercive programs. </PARA>
<PARA>It then goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA>Dr Sadik advised the Committee that a review conducted by the US Agency for International Development had found that UNFPA had not been involved in coercion. </PARA>
<PARA>Clearly, anyone who knows anything about this whole area of population control would see that as being laughable. I admit that the Committee simply stated what Dr Sadik said, but that was blatantly misleading. The United States decision in 1985 to cut all United States funding to UNFPA was made on the basis that the UNFPA was involved in funding the Chinese population control program, which is the most coercive in the world. It is a denial of basic fundamental human rights. Did Dr Sadik tell the Committee that? Did she tell them that the Australian taxpayers' money would go to support population control practices in China, where couples are ordered to refrain from having children without prior authorisation under the threat of sanctions consisting in most cases of deprivation of health, education and housing services, and in many documented cases of forced sterilisation and abortion? Had I the time, I would go into the studies which show that the most favoured method of population control is now the coercive sterilisation of large numbers of people. </PARA>
<PARA> Did Dr Sadik tell members of the Committee that the United States official aid bureau, USAID-the United States Agency for International Development-announced as late as June 1988 that the United States would again shun UNFPA because UNFPA assistance to the Chinese Government `indirectly contributes to a coercive family planning program'? Did she tell the Committee that UNFPA is the major contributor to and co-sponsor of a $40m HRP program-that is, the human reproduction program. That program is involved in developing the abortion drug RU486 and the anti-HCG abortifacient drug for population control in the Third World? Incidentally, it is very noticeable, in reading the transcript, that one of those who gave evidence, Dr Hull, stated, in answer to the honourable member for Dundas, Mr Philip Ruddock, that this drug was a contraceptive vaccine. He said, `You can think of it as making the egg immune to sperm'. That is absolutely false. It is scientific nonsense. If he did not know it, he ought to have known it. I do not have time to give the description given to me by the Department of Community Services and Health and by the HRP program itself.</PARA>
<PARA> Did Dr Sadik tell the Committee that the review which she claimed cleared UNFPA of involvement with coercive programs had not been made on the basis of an audit of UNFPA, but simply on the basis of statements made by officials of the UNFPA? Subsequently, further studies had been done and evidence had been given to the Foreign Relations Committee of the United States Senate which clearly showed that China was continuing to be involved in a denial of human rights and in coercive population control programs. The details are contained in a very substantial document which I have with me. That was sufficient for the United States Government to continue its refusal to fund the UNFPA. </PARA>
<PARA> A number of other highly misleading statements were made to the Committee which, unfortunately, I do not have time to go into, but which I will be happy to discuss with the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade (Senator Gareth Evans) and with others who may wish to know the facts. One should bear in mind that an appeal to the Committee to increase funds to UNFPA was made by two or three demographers who are on the population control gravy train. I believe that Australia should abolish the support that it is already giving to UNFPA, totalling $700,000, and it ought to reject any suggestion that it should give more money. Clearly, UNFPA is involved in coercive population control programs and in developing-despite what it says-abortion drugs. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is a pleasure to speak to this report entitled Education for Active Citizenship because it is an excellent and important report. It is also in many respects a terrifying report because it tells us what many of us here already knew-that is, that many people in Australia know very little about what parliamentarians do and they have little knowledge of our democratic system. The Senate Standing Committee on Employment, Education and Training must be congratulated for presenting this report, which is an enormously important piece of work. If the recommendations of this report are heeded and implemented, Australia should develop into an effective participatory democracy.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> One of the most fundamental elements of democracy is the right to vote in free and fair elections. I am seriously concerned that State and Federal elections are at times little more than media manipulated monopolies. Surveys in Western Australia carried out by members of my staff have shown that only a tiny minority of voters-perhaps 10 per cent or even less-have a full understanding of our preferential voting system. The majority do not know what preferences are. They do not know what determines when or whose preferences are distributed, nor who has control of the direction of preferences. I am sure that many senators have also received calls in their offices from people who say, `How am I to direct my preferences?', or `Where are you directing my preferences if I vote for you?'. They do not have a full understanding that every voter has total control over his preferences. </PARA>
<PARA> Proportional voting, such as that which is used to elect us to this place, is understood by even fewer voters. This is an irony and a tragedy because our electoral systems are, in the main, amongst the fairest and most advanced in the world. It is unfortunate that we had an aberration in the Australian Capital Territory, the modified d'Hondt system. We are awaiting the final results of that election, even though the election was held on 4 March. </PARA>
<PARA> If we do not have a proper education program on our voting systems in the electorate, people cannot competently use the excellent electoral systems which we have in Australia. One cannot use one's vote intelligently in a preferential or proportional system if one does not have an understanding of exactly what that system is. That can result in an inane protest vote, which is quite different from a deliberate protest vote of course. Very often it also results in an unintended abstention which causes an aberration in election results. </PARA>
<PARA> Protests can also be seen in the registering of some strange parties. In Victoria at one time, for example, the Deadly Serious Party proposed policies which included pensions for one-legged seagulls. That sort of thing does not help our democratic process. Indeed, there were a few strange parties in the ACT election, including parties which seriously proposed the abolition of democracy. With regard to people who advocated a referendum on whether the ACT should have self-government, that referendum should have included all interested parties. Of course, that means that the whole of Australia would have to decide the issue. If the ACT is to be governed by people who represent electorates in other parts of Australia, the people of Australia should have a say on that issue, too. </PARA>
<PARA> The recent State election in Western Australia saw the sudden emergence of Grey Power as a political force. We had candidates of good heart who stood because they were eager to help the plight of the aged in our community. Indeed, the plight of a number of the aged in our community is quite severe. I spoke with some of these candidates myself and they had no understanding of the electoral system under which they were standing. In Western Australia there was a new system for the election of the Legislative Council which is based on the Senate system. These people had no understanding that their party's registered preference card would lead to the preferences of people who voted for Grey Power with a `1' in the box above the line going a particular way. Therefore, a group which arose as a protest against the status quo served only to reinforce it by the way its preferences were allocated. </PARA>
<PARA> So when we have a general lack of political literacy in the community things happen in election results which ordinary people really do not want to happen at all. As a result of this report, maybe we are moving in a new direction. It has certainly been pleasing to hear speakers on the Government side and the coalition Opposition side highly commend this report and its recommendations. If indeed the recommendations are implemented and we do have a community which understands our electoral systems-how democracy works and how in a democratic society people can have direct input into it-I believe there is hope for us all. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like to refer briefly to the recent Australian Capital Territory election results. I have always regarded the Australian Capital Territory as a particularly alive and aware community as far as democratic systems are concerned, and the election results here were very interesting. There will be a new style of assembly, with neither of the major blocs having a majority. It may be that as a result of that we see a new style of governing which is not an adversarial style but a consensus style. As far as the Democrats are concerned, that will serve the people in a much better way. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This report entitled Income Support for the Retired and the Aged: An Agenda for Reform was tabled in the Senate on 7 December 1988, so it is still being debated some time after its tabling. Perhaps this is part and parcel of the history of this report, because a committee to inquire into income support for the retired and the aged was first set up on 6 September 1983. Because of other work in which this committee was involved it was unable to report before the date of the double dissolution of the Parliament in June 1987. At the commencement of the present Parliament the Senate asked the new Community Affairs Committee to resume inquiry into retirement income provisions in Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This new Committee was set up on 22 September 1987 with only three of the eight members of the former committee appointed to it. The evidence had already been taken and, in fact, the report existed in draft format. This provided some problems for the Committee. However the stated aim of the Committee to provide a `more adequate, equitable and cost-effective retirement income provision for all' is reflected, I believe, in the recommendations of the report. </PARA>
<PARA> The report is divided into two parts. Part one has the recommendations in regard to income support provided through the social security system. That part of the report would therefore be of particular interest to those who are totally or almost totally dependent on government pensions to support them in their later years, whereas the second part of the report examines the occupational superannuation systems. Therefore, that part will be of particular interest to those in the community who have or expect to have superannuation provide part or the total of their income in their later years.</PARA>
<PARA> Before I look at the recommendations in any great detail I would like to provide the Senate with some of the many statistics set out at the back of the report, because they are of extreme interest. I will look first of all at the principal sources of income for males. Of males aged between 65 and 74, 9.5 per cent rely on superannuation whereas 70 per cent rely on government pensions. Of males aged 75 years or over, 10.9 per cent rely on superannuation for their income and 75.2 per cent rely on government pensions. I turn now to females. Of those aged 65 to 74 years, only 4.5 per cent rely on superannuation whereas 79.4 per cent rely on government pensions. Of those aged 75 years or over, 2.5 per cent rely on superannuation and 85.1 per cent rely on government pensions. Therefore, it is the first part of the report that would be of interest to the majority of people and it is the recommendations in that part of the report I shall concentrate on. </PARA>
<PARA> The first recommendation is crucial. It recommends that the level of the age and service pension be increased. At present the pension is about 24 per cent of average weekly earnings. The Committee did not choose to give a preferred percentage but, from all the evidence received, people who are totally dependent on pensions find it very hard to manage on that amount. So an increase should be looked at right away. This recommendation, like the majority of recommendations in part one of the report, was supported by five of the eight senators who sat on the Committee. I would like to add my personal regret that it was not supported by more members of the Committee. The other recommendations in part one of the report advocate an increase in the level of rent assistant and a reduction in the pension adjustment time lag. Prices go up, but pensions do not go up accordingly, which causes a lot of difficulty for people in managing their every day concerns. It certainly is very important that pensions be adjusted automatically and on a regular basis so that people who are totally reliant on pensions know where they stand and are not extremely disadvantaged during the time lag. </PARA>
<PARA> The taxation treatment of pensioners causes them to carry an unwarranted tax burden. Pensioners who are in a tax bracket or who are earning minimal sums of money are taxed on those sums of money. That takes away the incentive for people who are reliant on a pension to improve their circumstances. The Committee recommended that there should be a common qualifying age for the age pension, which in these days of equal opportunity legislation seems to be the right move. But I do have some personal reservations about that age being 65 and not 60. Both men and women who do extremely hard physical labour often find it hard to continue doing that sort of work beyond 60 years of age and, of course, with the present unemployment rates in the community it makes better sense for some people, who wish to, to retire earlier rather than later. However, the Committee did recommend flexibility as far as pensions are concerned, so that some pensions would be available at an earlier age. </PARA>
<PARA> I think the most interesting proposal by the Committee was what it referred to as a long term reform option. This was put out as a matter for discussion rather that as a firm recommendation. Members of the Committee did hope that the Government would at least look at this sort of option so that there could be more lateral thinking about pension schemes. This reform option involved a two-tiered age pension system. This means that there would be a flat rate 20 per cent pension right across the community-this would take away the disincentive for caring for oneself in one's later years-and there would be a top-up of a further 10 per cent of pension for those who have no other source of income. The Committee had this costed out and the detailed costs are on page 135 of the report. Believe it or not, on the figures for pensions paid out as at 1 January 1988 there would be a net saving of $0.4 billion. So, I hope that the Government will look at that option. </PARA>
<PARA> Time is running out; so I will refer only very briefly to part two of the report which, as I said before, relates to income support provided through occupational superannuation schemes. If the recommendations are implemented, there will be more incentive in the community for people to provide for themselves through superannuation schemes. Employers also will be under some pressure to provide superannuation schemes for all employees, with portability of those schemes. </PARA>
<PARA> In conclusion, this report deals with very serious matters as far as our community is concerned. We are faced with a greying of the population. A greater proportion of our population will be concerned with these matters and they are not going to go away. Simply importing vast numbers of young immigrants to support our older Australian population will not solve the problem. We need to look at support systems for the aged in a new way, and I hope that this report will contribute towards that. </PARA>

The provision originally included in subclause 119 (1) is alreadycovered by clause 117-that is, that an inquiring authority requires the written authority of the Minister to dispose of the interest in land. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to raise at this stage the question which I raised during the course of the debate on the second reading-namely, the provision of the solatium payment. The Minister will recall that during the debate on the second reading I raised the question of whether the Government had given any thought to changing the arrangements for solatium payments from a flat payment of $10,000, which would be indexed by movements in the consumer price index, to some other formula which was related more directly to the actual total value of the land which is being acquired.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I also seek from the Minister some comment on the question which has been raised in a number of representations which have been made to the Government which indicate that there are other things which ought to be taken into consideration in the establishment of the problem. I refer in particular to a submission made by the National Farmers Federation, which says in part:</PARA>
<PARA>The Bill rightly seeks to compensate those whose property has been compulsorily obtained by government but does not go far enough in addressing legitimate and intangible loss and distress faced by those whose land or part thereof has been acquired. </PARA>
<PARA>The Federation goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA>The Administrative Appeals Tribunal should be the proper forum for the settlement of such claims in addition to those claims for compensation as identified in the Bill. </PARA>
<PARA>The NFF makes the point that clearly farming families who have worked properties for generations have an emotional attachment to the land in a way which is indistinguishable from an attachment to a home. As the Minister knows, a solatium is provided essentially for emotional recompense for the acquisition of a home, being a dwelling place. The Farmers Federation goes on to draw attention to the acquisitions of quite substantial parts of land which may be necessary for the completion of the very fast train project, for example. I understand that these sorts of matters have been raised in the Labor Party Caucus within the last couple of days in terms of some exploration of the consequences which may flow from the very fast train project proceeding. </PARA>
<PARA> I therefore seek the Minister's comment on those two matters: first, whether the Government has been persuaded that there is any validity in the argument that the solatium payment itself should be related not to a flat fee but to the value of the land which is being acquired; and, secondly, whether the extension of a solatium payment to compensate people for emotional attachment to the land, in exactly the same way as they are being compensated in the provisions of the Bill for emotional attachment to their dwelling place, has received any further consideration by the Government. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will deal with the last point first. The Australian Law Reform Commission, in its report, identified the particular case of a person's home being compulsorily acquired causing that person to have to move from where he or she was living, and a particular item of compensation was identified to cover that circumstance. However, there may be other circumstances in which a person's property is compulsorily acquired and that person has had some particular attachment to the land. In such a case that person may feel that the compensation assessed on all the quantifiable aspects of the property would not be sufficient to compensate for his or her personal loss. In such circumstances there is nothing in the Bill which would prevent an item of claim for compensation of that nature. More significantly, subclause 55 (1) allows for such a claim by providing that the amount of compensation that a person is entitled to is that amount which would justly compensate the person for the acquisition. Putting it in layman's language, if one has a particular affection for the back paddock, or whatever else, that can be a case for receiving compensation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> On the question of what is really a fixed sum versus a variable amount, the Government considered the proposition for solace payments and considered a number of options. Some Australian States provide a householder's solatium for the amount to be paid linked to the value of the property acquired. I think that is what Senator Puplick was considering. The Government believes that this is not a valid basis for payment since the intangible losses suffered by less affluent socio-economic groups are not necessarily any harder or harsher than those suffered by those who are more affluent in the community. In other words, I am appealing to Senator Puplick's romantic side rather than to his economic determinant side to say that the loss of a house or a property and the emotional drain that goes with that process is not necessarily related to one's bank account-nor should it be. We are relatively firm on this matter. Therefore, we ask for a fixed statutory thing-indexed, of course. I think it should be indexed. That is the basis on which we are proceeding now with the first query that Senator Puplick raised. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the Minister for his explanation and answer. I will now raise with him the question which, again, I raised yesterday in the debate on the second reading on this matter-namely, the impact of capital gains tax provisions in relation to acquisitions which are made. To put it briefly, if a person is required to make a sale and purchase of a property, or make a sale of an asset, as a result of the Government requiring him to sell that asset under the compulsory powers or the coercive powers which are available to the Government to acquire land, does that render the person liable to pay capital gains tax? Is that a particularly fair situation? I will encapsulate it in this form: if the Government requires somebody to sell a property to the Government because it intends to acquire property under the provisions of the land acquisitions legislation, the vendor has no recourse other than to sell. He would not have sold other than by being compelled to sell by the provisions of the lands acquisition legislation. But because he is compelled to sell, he is put in a position where he has to pay capital gains tax. In other words, the Government both forces him to sell and forces him to pay a capital gains tax on a sale which he would not voluntarily have made but for the acquisition powers of the lands acquisition legislation. Does the Government believe that that person should be entitled to relief from the payment of capital gains tax under those circumstances?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not know whether Senator Puplick can hum the Twilight Zone theme-we are getting into areas which I am not expert on and one is the tax Act. However, one can draw a distinction between compulsory acquisition, as I understand it, and a negotiated settlement. As I understand it, if compulsory acquisition occurs, it is not subject to capital gains tax. That is as I understand it. Senator Puplick may put as much credibility on that as he can, but I think I am right on that point.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> On the question of the negotiated agreements, it may well be that the tax Act comes into play. But I have to say that the appropriate mechanism for dealing with that problem is the tax Act and not the Lands Acquisition Act. I do not think we could put a clause in this legislation, even if we were minded to, to override a tax Act in that way. If there is any correction needed to that interpretation, I will certainly pass it on. But I believe that is right. </PARA>

<PARA>The purpose of this amendment is to delete clause 124 in its entirety and to insert a new clause as per the provision of circulated amendment. In my address yesterday during the second reading debate on this Bill, I drew attention to the fact that we have some concerns that whereas the 1955 Act, which this legislation is now replacing, had a mechanism to guarantee compatibility with State practices and procedures in relation to mining, that does not appear to be as entirely clear in the 1988 Bill. This section deals almost exclusively with the question of mining. </PARA>
<PARA> When this matter was debated on 20 October 1988 in the House of Representatives, my colleague, Mr Fife, the member of Hume, made the point that from time to time State laws are passed and modified in terms of their relationship to and impact on the operation of State mining regimes. We believe that if the Bill were passed in its current form, new regulations to the proposed Act may be required each time State legislation is changed. </PARA>
<PARA> We believe that by retaining reference to State laws in the Bill, there would be no need to modify the regulations under the proposed Act as changes are made to State legislation. It is for that purpose that I have moved the amendment on behalf of the Opposition. By the reinsertion, essentially, of the 1955 formula we would have a system whereby automatic effect would be given to changes in State mining law. If the clause is allowed to stand in its current form, every time a State mining law and practice is changed there will be a need for changes in the Commonwealth regulations to accommodate that. That will be unnecessarily burdensome and time consuming. The reversion to the formula of the 1955 Act guaranteeing compatibility with State practices and procedures is a more preferable action to take. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Several people have expressed concern at the mining provisions contained in the Bill. Although this matter was addressed in debate in the House of Representatives, I will elaborate on the Government's intention and the reasons why these changes are necessary. For many years there has been a perception within the mining industry and some State mines departments that exploration and mining on Commonwealth land was either not allowed or was just too difficult or time consuming to attempt.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Back in September 1986 the Government established an interdepartmental committee (IDC) to examine the problems in this area and to formulate possible solutions that would streamline the administration of exploration and mining on Commonwealth land. One of the major problems identified by the IDC was the present Lands Acquisition Act. The sections in the present Act that deal with exploration and mining on Commonwealth land are imprecise and inconsistent. The present Act provides that State laws, subject to such exemptions and modifications as are prescribed, shall apply to mining on Commonwealth land in a State or the Northern Territory. The same provision is not made, however, for exploration on Commonwealth land. </PARA>
<PARA> A further shortcoming in the current Act is that the exploration and mining provisions apply only to land vested in the name of the Commonwealth. For land vested in the names of most Commonwealth bodies, there is no mechanism that currently allows exploration licences or mining leases to be issued. This resulted in poorly defined administrative procedures. The present system is not working well. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government's objective is to facilitate access to Commonwealth land for minimal exploration and development while at the same time both protect its use of the land and meet its statutory responsibilities for environmental protection and heritage conservation. To this end, the Government has recently decided on a multiple land use policy that will apply to all Commonwealth land, the only exceptions being national parks and Antarctica. This policy will ensure, firstly, that a proper resource assessment is undertaken prior to acquisition; secondly, that the wider interests of the Commonwealth are considered in determining land use and not just the specific use to which the land is put; thirdly, that the mining industry is aware of the general guidelines that are likely to govern its operations on Commonwealth land; fourthly, that Commonwealth land is used as efficiently as possible in returning a benefit to the Government and the country; and, fifthly, that environmental and heritage interests are adequately protected when considering development proposals to mine or explore on Commonwealth land. </PARA>
<PARA> The other major recommendation was that revised provisions on exploration and mining on Commonwealth land should be included in the Lands Acquisition Bill and that regulations should be developed based on multiple land use policy. The regulations will prescribe all conditions under which exploration and mining will be allowed on Commonwealth land. The mining industry will know exactly what it must do to obtain access to Commonwealth land. The regulations will be drafted after consultation with the States and the Northern Territory.</PARA>
<PARA> The regulations will contain provisions similar to those relevant State mining laws and at the same time ensure that the Commonwealth meets its statutory responsibilities in managing the land it owns. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to make some brief concluding remarks on the remainder of the Lands Acquisition Bill 1988. It has been a very difficult Bill for successive governments to come to grips with. I would firstly like to commend the Minister for the way in which he has been prepared to allow public comment and to involve himself and the Government with representations from groups throughout the community in order to produce a number of amendments which have taken into account those individual comments and suggestions. I believe this is a very proper way of dealing with an extremely complicated piece of public policy.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Secondly, I would like to again place on record the very considerable debt which Parliament owes to the Law Reform Commission, in particular Mr Justice Wilcox, for having undertaken the major inquiry which has brought about the new piece of legislation. Finally, I would like to pay tribute once again to all of those members of the Land Acquisition Reform Committee, particularly John Duff and Mary Turner, who have played very significant roles in generating the public debate and the various public forums and public meetings which I have attended, Senator Brownhill has attended, Mr West has attended and departmental officers have attended in order to make sure that there was maximum public input on this piece of legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> Now that we are on the verge of having a new Lands Acquisition Act, it is clear that the Act will be tested fairly promptly by all of the requirements for acquisition both in relation to Badgerys Creek and, potentially, in relation to the very fast train project if it is to proceed. I commend the Department. The officers who will be responsible for administration of the Act will have a very hard task in front of them in dealing with these very complicated areas of acquisition. </PARA>
<PARA> I was very heartened to hear the Minister indicate that the matter will be kept under review in a way which undoubtedly will bring forth the capacity to make amendments after the Act has been seen in practice for some little time. I believe this exercise has been important and worth while, although frustratingly slow in many respects. Undoubtedly the officers of the Department feel a great deal more frustrated that anybody else as far as this particular matter is concerned. The Bill in its amended form does have the very warm-heated support of the Opposition. We look forward to participating in any reviews or in any further development of this legislation which may be necessary in the light of experience. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-I wish to make a short statement to correct part of an answer I gave to the Senate yesterday.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In answer to a question from Senator Hill concerning the National Safety Council of Australia, I described a Mr Alex MacArthur as a former director of the NSCA, Queensland Division. That description contained in my brief was incorrect. I am advised that in fact Mr MacArthur is correctly described as a former Queensland manager of sea-air rescue operations for the Victorian Division of the NSCA. I so advise the Senate and emphasise that the Queensland Division of the NSCA, which is a completely separate organisation from the Victorian Division, enjoys a very high reputation in Queensland. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to make a statement to clear up a misrepresentation that occurred in the ANU Reporter. Since it is not a personal statement but one in regard to my Party, I had no course other than to make a statement on the adjournment. In the ANU Reporter Vol. 20, No. 3, of Thursday, 23 March 1989, the following paragraph appears:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>A spokesman for the Minister for Employment, Education and Training, Mr Dawkins, told ANU Reporter that although the list of proposed legislation awaiting debate in the Senate was lengthy, the amalgamation Bill could be brought forward so that the legislation could be in place for the 1 July target date set by the Minister for the creation of the new ANU. He added that the Government expected the Bill to be passed by the Senate with the support of the Democrats, if not the Opposition parties. </PARA>
<PARA>That particular proposition, presumably coming from a spokesman for the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Dawkins), was accepted at face value by the reporter who wrote this particular article in the ANU Reporter. As soon as this hit the newsstands-basically the Australian National University-my phone in Parliament House lit up and did not stop for days. My staff wasted an enormous amount of time correcting what was a view of the spokesman of the Minister which had not been checked with me by the reporter. The spokesman for Mr Dawkins can say what he likes in a political context; I am not having a go at that spokesman. But I am very disappointed that a reporter printed this as is, particularly because in the previous issue our position was stated very clearly. Our position is as of October last year when I issued a statement that we were opposed to amalgamation. It has not changed. The reporter who wrote this article did not check with me and presumably did not bother checking with the previous edition of the paper and went ahead and published this article. </PARA>
<PARA> I put to the editor of this paper that, if in fact a spokesperson for me had said that the Government had decided to drop the whole idea of amalgamations, that person would have rung the Minister. Likewise, I expect that, on such matters of contention and matters in issue before the Parliament, it would be a responsible exercise on the part of a reporter before publishing this as a main, lead story on page one at least to do the courtesy of checking with people who are quoted as having a particular position which is diametrically opposed to that which is currently on the record. </PARA>
