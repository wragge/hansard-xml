<PARA>To the Honourable the President and members of the Senate in Parliament assembled.</PARA>
<PARA> The humble petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth that:</PARA>
<PARA> The Parliamentary Joint Select Committee on Video Material has concluded that ``Adverse effects upon people, and especially upon children, of exposure to material containing various degrees of violence, pornography or obscenity have been demonstrated''.</PARA>
<PARA> The majority of the Select Committee strongly opposed the proposition for a new NVE (non-violent erotica) category, which would have entrenched X-rated video pornography.</PARA>
<PARA> All six State Governments have, through their Attorneys-General, expressed unanimous opposition to the circulation of X-rated videos.</PARA>
<PARA> We consider the continuing distribution of X-rated videos from the A.C.T. to be reprehensible and to be contrary to the wellbeing of the Australian community in general.</PARA>
<PARA> We strongly request urgent Government action to prohibit the distribution of X-rated and excessively violent video material.</PARA>
<PARA> And your petitioners as in duty bound will ever pray.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-Mr President, I claim to have been misrepresented. My personal explanation refers to a notice of motion given by Senator Short yesterday and to an article which appeared in the Australian newspaper on 14 January. In relation to the first and second points of Senator Short's notice of motion, I say that the origin of the trip lay with Richard James, the New South Wales member of the Australian Democrats, who suggested to Robert Pash of the Libyan Cultural Embassy in Melbourne that an Australian delegation of parliamentarians should visit the chemical plant at Rabta to ascertain the nature of that plant. Certainly the trip was not initiated by Robert Pash. In accepting the invitation to go on the trip, I regarded it as part of my responsibility as a senator elected on a platform of disarmament.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In his third point, Senator Short says that we allowed ourselves to be used as pawns by the Libyan Government. On my return, I made statements in which I expressed my serious doubts about the nature of the plant, particularly in view of its military surroundings and its defence. I showed very clearly in my statements that I was not a pawn of the Libyan Government. I point out that although the Government has ceased to have diplomatic relations with Libya, it still trades with that country. I point out also that a week after I returned from Libya, Senator Puplick had discussions with Yasser Arafat. </PARA>
<PARA> In relation to the fourth and fifth points of Senator Short's notice of motion, I point out that, of course, the Libyans stated that our presence in Libya was a sign of solidarity with the country. However, in every single meeting I had with Libyan officials, including Colonel Gaddafi, I stressed very strongly my abhorrence of the development of the chemical weapons arms race in parallel with the nuclear weapons arms race. I described and supported the Australian Government initiatives in this area, including the ban on the export of chemical weapons precursors. I said that I had received a briefing from the Department of Foreign Affairs before my departure and that I would give it one on my return. I also deviated to Geneva on the way back to talk to David Rees, Australia's Ambassador for Disarmament. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA> I seek leave to have the second reading speech incorporated in Hansard. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The speech read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA> This Bill will have three important effects on the current deregulated mess that passes for the Australian economy. The first will be to encourage savings. The second will be to offer small investors, especially the aged and those who have retired, a secure investment with a good return. The third effect will be to assist those who are currently saving to buy their first home as property prices rise or are struggling to meet their escalating mortgage repayments as interest rates rise. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill will exempt from tax the first $2,000 of interest earned by anyone who deposits their money into accounts paying no more than 12 per cent with financial institutions which lend for housing. So people with bank and building society deposits will benefit. More money will be available at a lower interest rate to those borrowing to buy their own home. This Bill will therefore make a substantial contribution to increasing the level of savings in Australia and to ensuring that people buying their own home to live in do not have to pay the massive interest rates currently dictated by unregulated financial markets. </PARA>
<PARA>Savings</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> In December 1988, the Economic Planning Advisory Council (EPAC) issued a paper entitled ``Trends in Private Saving''. It noted that private savings have trended down since the mid-1970s and stated that without a significant improvement in the incentive framework for saving, private saving is unlikely to make a major contribution to the further adjustment in domestic savings that is needed. </PARA>
<PARA> Since then, our deteriorating balance of payments problem and ever growing foreign indebtedness have resulted in economists, bankers and business people demanding that something be done to increase the incentive to save. Recently two Ministers of this Government have been prepared to advocate publicly the need for incentives to increase the level of savings in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> Why is it important to increase our domestic savings? Australia is buying too much from overseas countries and exporting too little. Our increasing level of foreign indebtedness and foreign ownership means that we must pay increasing amounts of rents, interest and dividends to the foreign owners of Australian assets and to foreign lenders. If we could save more in Australia, we would need to borrow less from overseas and we could reduce the rate at which we are selling off Australian businesses and land and property to overseas buyers. We would therefore begin to reduce our repayments to overseas lenders and owners of Australian assets. As Australians save more, they buy less and this means that we will buy fewer imports. </PARA>
<PARA> There is little argument about whether we need to increase our level of domestic savings. The argument is really about how to do it. The deregulationists and expenditure cutters who determine the economic policies of the Hawke Government, the Liberal- National Party coalition, Australian big businesses, and the foreign bankers who have been generous enough to lend us our foreign debt, all want to increase savings by inflicting more pain on Australians. They want us to use monetary policy-i.e. higher interest rates-fiscal policy, that is, more expenditure cuts, and tax increases in the form of consumption taxes to increase domestic savings. In short, they believe that we must suffer pain in order to increase savings. </PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Democrats are not interested in yet another attack on the living standards of low and average income households to wrench more savings out of the economy. We oppose expenditure cuts which enable the Treasurer to gloat about the size of his domestic surplus. We oppose consumption taxes because they cannot be avoided by low income earners who get pushed further into debt and poverty. We oppose more increases in interest rates. We know that many Australians will save more if we give them a direct incentive to save by not taxing the first $2,000 of interest earned. That is what this Bill will achieve. Someone with $10,000 of savings and $20,000 of other income will currently lose money by investing in a savings account at 12 per cent. They will earn $1,200 in interest and pay $412.50 in income tax and Medicare levy, approximately $500 in provisional tax, leaving them with a return of less than $400 on their $10,000 investment. With inflation running at 7 per cent, they lose at least $300 by investing their money at 12 per cent given the existing tax regime. </PARA>
<PARA> This Bill will enable existing and potential savers to achieve a real return on the first $2,000 of interest they earn. The limit of $2,000 will mean that people with a lot of money will not get the tax concession for interest above $2,000. For all Australians with savings, but particularly for retired people and the aged, this will be a good opportunity to invest some money safely. They will not need to invest in complex bonds, trusts and elaborate tax minimisation vehicles which may be risky, to avoid the punitive taxes on savings. They will be given access to an honest, secure and simple form of investment. </PARA>
<PARA> Last year, the Japanese Government began to take a 20 per cent slice of the interest earned on savings accounts which had been totally exempt from taxes for 25 years. These tax free savings accounts, called maruyu, have been a major inducement for the Japanese to save. Japanese industry has had ready access for many years to a vast reserve of cheap capital. It was estimated last year that almost $US2.5 trillion were in these accounts. The Japanese Government acted to reduce, but not abolish, the tax concession after pressure from the United States Government to do something to increase Japanese domestic consumption. I doubt whether the Japanese Government sought the advice of our deregulationist Treasurer or his Liberal Party counterpart. Japan acted sensibly in the first place to give a tax concession to encourage domestic savings and now under extreme pressure they are only removing a small part of that exemption. Japan was able to restructure the economy without becoming dependent on foreign investors and foreign lenders because it had adequate levels of domestic savings. </PARA>
<PARA>Housing</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> This Bill will also make it easier for those who are saving to put a deposit on a home. Escalating house prices have widened the deposit gap for many prospective home buyers. If they struggle to save something, the Government taxes away their earnings. As house prices increase, they cannot save enough to keep up with inflation in general let alone the inflation in property prices in most of Australia. The Bill deliberately gives the tax incentive to save in such a way as to encourage people to save with financial institutions that lend for housing. This will mean that more money will move into financial institutions which lend for housing. Savings banks and building societies will be able to attract more money at lower interest rates because people will save with them to get the tax benefits. Consequently banks and building societies will be able to pass on the lower interest rates they are paying for money to those who are borrowing to buy a house to live in. Interest rates on home loans will fall. </PARA>
<PARA> The Hawke Government and the Liberal and National parties have voted to give a tax incentive to those who are buying their second, third or fourth properties as investments. That is their priority. The person who owns many houses gets to claim the interest payments on borrowings as a tax deduction and can then offset any further losses against income they earn from other sources. The Laboreals can come up with exotic reasons to support tax concessions for property investors. This is the first of two Bills which will give the Government and the Opposition the opportunity to support tax concessions which will benefit those who are trying to buy their first home and those who are struggling to pay it off. The Australian Democrats believe that Australians wanting to buy a home to live in and those who are attempting to pay off the homes they are living in deserve a tax break too. If we cannot afford to help them, why are we helping property investors? Why are we suffering expenditure cuts and high interest rates so that wealthy Australians can buy more luxury imports and Australian companies can borrow more money overseas?</PARA>
<PARA> In looking at the cost of this proposal, we must recognise that we can save future revenue on public housing and social security payments due to the increasing poverty created when housing becomes less affordable. In terms of our balance of payments and foreign indebtedness, we will be able to make future savings on the interest repayments to foreign lenders. We can save Australia from increasing dependence on foreign investment and begin to reduce the increasing proportion of our wealth which goes in the form of rent and dividends to foreign owners of Australian assets. At the end of 1988, all savings bank deposits totalled $67 billion and all building society deposits totalled $19 billion. These accounts were of course in a variety of term deposits, cheque, pass book, investment and statement accounts, with varying interest rates. To calculate the possible revenue loss means making a number of assumptions:</PARA>
<PARA> First, about the proportion of current deposits that would be attracted to accounts of up to 12 per cent;</PARA>
<PARA> Secondly, about the higher rate at which new savings will grow as a result of this measure;</PARA>
<PARA> Thirdly, about the number of people earning interest who are already below the tax threshold;</PARA>
<PARA> Fourthly, about the level of interest rates in the future; and</PARA>
<PARA> Finally, about the marginal rates of tax on current and future savings and therefore what if anything the Government will deliver as tax cuts this year. </PARA>
<PARA> Clearly, it is impossible to come up with a precise costing because of these assumptions. In June 1988, the total interest paid by savings banks was $4.1 billion. If we assume that this grows to $5 billion this financial year and about half this amount is paid on accounts that attract the concession then $2.5 billion of interest payments would not be taxed. If we assume that the average tax paid on this amount is about 30 per cent, then the Government will lose some $800m in revenue from interest on savings accounts with banks. If building societies continue to attract about one-third of the savings attracted by banks that would add another $270m, making the total cost just over $1 billion. </PARA>
<PARA> The cost would be reduced when interest rates fall and the 12 per cent limit is reduced. Similarly, the cost would be lower with lower tax rates. This cost, however, is less than the almost $2 billion the Government has given away in company tax cuts. It is also less than the cost to the Government of giving a tax concession to Australian companies which borrow overseas and use the deduction on the interest they pay on their borrowings to pay little or no tax. However, it will be money well spent to encourage savings and home ownership, rather than allowing the wealthiest Australians to import luxury goods and giving tax concessions to property investors so that they can pay more for a home than Australians looking to buy a home for themselves to live in. </PARA>

<PARA> (a) condemns the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs (Mr Hand) for his intemperate and unjustified attack on the Senate committee system and, in particular, the work of the Select Committee on the Administration of Aboriginal Affairs;</PARA>
<PARA> (b) rejects Mr Hand's assertion that civil liberties are threatened by the operation of Senate committees, that individuals have no right of reply and that the recently concluded inquiry into Aboriginal Affairs policy is a `political stunt';</PARA>
<PARA> (c) reminds the Minister that the Aboriginal Affairs Committee has a majority of Government members;</PARA>
<PARA> (d) calls on the Leader of the Government in the Senate (Senator Button), on behalf of the Prime Minister, to dissociate the Government from Mr Hand's comments, and from similar attacks by the Premiers of Western Australia and Victoria; and</PARA>
<PARA> (e) reaffirms its confidence in the integrity of the Committee system which has enjoyed all-party support for a period of almost 20 years. </PARA>
<PARA>In moving that motion, I wish to say to the Senate that I think that it is incumbent on this chamber to defend its own operation and to assert its value. I say that because I think the position is that the institution of parliament around Australia has not retained as high a regard in the public mind as I believe it should for the welfare of our system of government. I think that one of the most encouraging developments in the parliamentary system in this country over the last 20 years is the development of the Senate committee system. As I will indicate later in my speech, the Australian Labor Party, which now forms the Government of the Commonwealth, was instrumental in pursuing the expansion of Senate committee activity, and the Labor Party to this point has adopted a stance which has been common with that of the Liberal and National parties, and indeed I think with Independents and the Australian Democrats in this place-namely, an attitude which is supportive of a system of Senate committees. Indeed, it is a feature of the present Government that it chose to extend the Senate system of committees into the House of Representatives and to provide a very similar committee arrangement during the term of this last Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> What we saw just two weeks ago was an intemperate attack by Mr Hand on the Senate committee system, and I will deal in some detail with what Mr Hand actually had to say. But the fact is that that attack was nearly coincidental with attacks by a number of other leading Labor politicians in this country, the Premier of Victoria and the Premier of Western Australia, who attacked not the work of the Senate Select Committee on the Administration of Aboriginal Affairs but the committee which is looking at the vexed question of the use of drugs in sport. One would hope that the coincidence of these three attacks was coincidence and not a matter of arrangement between the three participants; but in any event, it is a matter of concern that these senior Labor politicians should undertake an attack on the Senate committee system in this way. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to focus today on Mr Hand because he is a member of this Parliament and he ought to have been in a position-and no doubt has been in a position-to see much more closely than those Labor premiers the operation of the Senate committee system and the value that it has been to Australia. What is it that Mr Hand had to say? Perhaps before I get on to that I should say that the thing that Mr Hand and those two premiers have in common, as I said in a press release issued at that time, is that all three are guilty men in the sense that they have recently been shown up by inquiries to have matters of government within their administration which had something which they would prefer to have seen hidden away. We know that in Victoria we have had the scandal of the Victorian Economic Development Corporation-a scandal which has cost the Deputy Premier of Victoria his place in the Victorian Government. We know that in Western Australia we have had the scandal of W.A. Inc., which Mr Dowding has desperately tried to distance himself from over recent months and particularly before the recent election. </PARA>
<PARA> But here in Canberra we have had the exposure in this Parliament of elements of the administration of Aboriginal Affairs under the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs, Mr Hand, which led Mr Hand to dismiss his own departmental head. It is an extraordinary feature of Mr Hand's administration that the committees of which he is so critical disclosed to him information which led him to dispose of his own departmental head. One could not get a more dramatic demonstration of the importance of the operation of Senate committees than that, and one could get no more dramatic illustration of the fact that a parliament which is prepared to do its job to get behind the matters which are otherwise matters of secrecy and on which there is no public knowledge, in that circumstance can prevent a government from making more serious errors and wasting more of the taxpayers' money. If Mr Hand is so contemptuous and dismissive of the work of Senate committees, it is odd that he chose to dismiss Mr Charles Perkins on the basis of the information which was disclosed by the Senate Estimates committees under the questioning of Opposition senators. </PARA>
<PARA> Just two weeks ago Mr Hand attacked the Senate committee system. I would like to quote some of the things that he said:</PARA>
<PARA> I think the Senate has gone far beyond, in recent years, the role it was set up to do. You have a system of committees now where evidence is taken, the most outrageous claims are made, whether they be true or not, about individuals. Civil liberties of those individuals are just swept aside, while some senators strut around this country, you know, floating on their own ego picking up these sorts of wild stories which are then able to be run in the media, and people's characters are just absolutely destroyed, all but destroyed in a lot of cases, where the person has no right of come-back at all. </PARA>
<PARA> And in the Senate, we've seen some frightful claims made about individuals and organisations in my area, and without really any evidence at all, other than a bit of hearsay. Now if there is a problem about an individual there are proper legal processes, I would have thought, for those matters to be addressed. </PARA>
<PARA>And so on. He then went on to refer to Peter Dowding. He referred later in the interview to the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander (ATSIC) Committee and said:</PARA>
<PARA> My difficulty is that the Senate committee dealing with ATSIC, as one classic example, has roamed around the country-normally you're lucky if half of them turn up-taking all sorts of evidence from people, some of it in camera, and now leaking and making statements to the Press, about what they think ought to be done to improve ATSIC. </PARA>
<PARA>I would like to pause at that stage because I think that passage, detailing Mr Hand's complaints, very clearly demonstrates why Mr Hand was so concerned about the ATSIC inquiry. If we look at the report which was tabled in the Senate today-a report which I do not intend to debate because I think we will have an opportunity to do that later and it is not the subject matter of this motion-we actually find that the majority of this Committee is made up of Labor members of this Senate. The whole of that Committee found that Mr Hand's Department had engaged in activities which were striking down the reputations of people who had been in policy opposition to Mr Hand and who had been sacked by him from the Aboriginal Development Commission (ADC). We find this not in the minority report of the Committee, but in the majority report. I refer to paragraph 5.48 which states:</PARA>
<PARA> It is a cause of concern to this Committee that the leak of confidential information from within the Aboriginal Affairs portfolio was used to damage the reputations of some of the current and former Commissioners of the ADC and that no investigation into the source of the leaked material took place. </PARA>
<PARA>This is a matter which is squarely within the administration of Minister Hand. He has the authority over and the control of this Department. He has the clear constitutional responsibility for it and authority over it, yet we find the Committee reporting that a whole series of Aboriginal people of good character who had given very good service, many of them for 15 to 20 years, to successive governments and, most importantly, to the Aboriginal community, found their reputations damaged. The Committee went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA> The Sydney Morning Herald article-</PARA>
<PARA>which was based on this leaked material from the Department-</PARA>
<PARA>was demonstrably wrong and unjustifiably damaged the reputation of the Commissioners. No evidence was presented to the Committee that reflected on the honesty of the dismissed Commissioners. However the article received wide circulation. Facsimile copies of it were distributed to remote areas where the newspaper itself was not available. </PARA>
<PARA>Not only were these people traduced in New South Wales because of that report but also, apparently, official facilities were used to traduce these people throughout Australia. No action has been taken by this Minister about the actions of his legal agents in traducing the reputations of these people. I stress that all the members of the Committee, including the Labor members, in paragraph 5.53 of the report said:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . even at this stage, the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs should write to each of the dismissed Commissioners thanking them for their services to the ADC and advising them of this Committee's conclusion in paragraph 5.50. </PARA>
<PARA>Paragraph 5.50 says this:</PARA>
<PARA> The impression created-</PARA>
<PARA>that is, by this leaked material, the reports and the sending of facsimile copies of the report from the Sydney Morning Herald around Australia-</PARA>
<PARA>caused considerable distress to a number of former commissioners. This was combined with the failure of the Minister to offer any acknowledgement of the contributions made by the former Commissioners, some of whom had served the ADC for a number of years. </PARA>
<PARA>I dealt with some of those people who were traduced. I remember dealing with Pastor Ossie Cruz when he was a member of the National Aboriginal Conference and we were in government. He was often a strong and public critic of the Government of which I was part and of the portfolio, including at the time when I was the Minister. I would say to Minister Hand that if he is prepared to tolerate that sort of treatment of people just because they have been critics of the policy of his Department, then it ill sits in his mouth to make the sorts of complaints that he has made about the Senate committee system. Minister Hand should be ashamed of himself and I trust he will follow the advice of the Senate Committee and write and apologise to those people in a very public manner. The last words of the Minister I wish to quote are those spoken in the course of that same interview when he said:</PARA>
<PARA> And so I say to the Senate committee, you know, anything they suggest, any proposition they put up-because it is a stunt, the whole thing's been a political stunt-doesn't automatically mean that I am going to accept it. </PARA>
<PARA>I think that the passages I have quoted from that report bear out the comment that I made earlier-that Mr Hand's comments are the cry of a guilty man who knew that the Senate Committee would report in a way which would reflect badly on his administration and, indeed, on many of the statements he has made about the whole approach he has adopted to Aboriginal Affairs and to the formation of ATSIC. For this Senate to tolerate that sort of self-interested criticism without a response would be pathetic and letting down the system of which we are all part. </PARA>
<PARA> Yesterday we saw the fruits of the ATSIC inquiry which was the subject of such severe criticism from the Minister. It is interesting to compare his allegations with the report, not just in the part that I have quoted, but also in the extensive passages of the report which relate to the issue of consultation. Minister Hand put one test on the introduction of ATSIC. He said that it would only be introduced if it were according to the will of the Aboriginal people. He made a great deal of the process of consultation undertaken by him. That process of consultation involved his visiting many communities and having a whole series of discussions. The majority report of the Senate Committee deals extensively with the evidence it received about that process of consultation. We find that throughout chapter four of the majority report-and again I stress that this is the report of the Committee under its Labor chairman, not a minority report of those who dissented from some of the views of the majority in respect of proceeding with ATSIC-there is evidence of dissatisfaction with the process of consultation. We find that whilst there may have been some broad in-principle consideration of the concept of ATSIC, there was, in the Aboriginal community itself, a sense that there was a need for much more explanation before the people would understand what was involved. Paragraph 4.27 of the majority report quotes from what Dr Coombs had to say about the Aboriginal process of decision making and the difficulty and time consuming nature of consultation if one is to have genuine consultation. The Committee observes in paragraph 4.28:</PARA>
<PARA> This . . . demonstrates the difficulty in conducting consultations whether by a Minister or a Parliamentary Committee through a series of short meetings with the object of reaching a decision . . . </PARA>
<PARA>At a number of reported meetings of the Committee-and I stress that this is not the minority, it is the whole Committee report-ATSIC was presented on a take it or leave it basis. The only alternative was the continuation of the existing situation which was supported by hardly anyone at the meetings. </PARA>
<PARA> So we have a situation where the Committee throws up the deficiencies of the process of consultation. We find that paragraph 4.38 states:</PARA>
<PARA> Thus it was inevitable that the focus of some meetings became blurred and that participants' perceptions of the process may have been at variance with those of the Minister's party. </PARA>
<PARA>We find that the support that was given-I quote from paragraph 4.39-`was qualified by the expectations of further extensive and detailed consultation which did not occur'. We find, in paragraph 4.42, the Committee reporting:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . `follow-up' meetings conducted after the Ministerial meetings provide ample support for three points:</PARA>
<PARA> That understanding of ATSIC was not as widespread as was hoped;</PARA>
<PARA> that further detailed consultation on the legislation was required; and</PARA>
<PARA> that more information was needed on the details of the operation of ATSIC. </PARA>
<PARA>We find quotations from Aboriginal Affairs officers on the deficiencies of the process of consultation. The whole report of the Committee bears out the Opposition's concerns about the inefficiency or ineffectiveness of the consultation process. I quote again from paragraph 4.56 of the Committee's majority report:</PARA>
<PARA> The Committee asked virtually every witness who appeared before it in the latter part of 1988 whether they wished the Bill to proceed, given their current level of knowledge. With very few exceptions the answer was `no'. Support for the immediate passage of the Bill tended to come from well funded organisations which had supported ATSIC from the outset, for example the Northern and Central Land Councils. </PARA>
<PARA>Paragraph 4.73 states:</PARA>
<PARA> The Minister for Aboriginal Affairs did set his own criterion for the success of the consultative process, namely `. . . . positive endorsement from the Aboriginal and Islander community . . .'</PARA>
<PARA>I am staying right away from the contentious aspects of this Senate Committee report. I am quoting only from those sections which have the imprimatur of all the Government members of that Committee. The simple reality is that the report, whatever its debatable conclusions, bears out quite clearly why Minister Hand had a cause for concern about this inquiry. His reason for concern was that it has exposed the fact that he cannot live up to tests that he himself has placed on the process he commenced. </PARA>
<PARA> The truth of the matter is that the evidence as it is brought out in this report simply shows that the Minister has not achieved the objective of gaining Aboriginal community support through this process of consultation. What he has is the support of those few well-funded organisations, in particular the land councils, which have been virtually the administration of the Minister. The administration has not been the Department of Aboriginal Affairs; it has been the Minister's office and those organisations which have been sympathetic with his own private political aims. They are the land councils, which are of course substantial economic bodies but they certainly do not represent the generality of Aboriginal people in this community. What we have is a situation where the Committee's report shows the inconsistency between the Minister's complaints about the committee system not protecting individuals and the Minister's own behaviour and the Department's behaviour with respect to this matter. </PARA>

I go back to the policy put forward by the then Labor leader, Mr Whitlam, in the 1967 Senate election policy speech when he said:</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="EF4">Senator CHANEY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is the view put by the Minister at the table. He can put that forward as his view in this debate if he wishes, but I would have thought that the performance of a succession of Senate committees from the 1970s onwards would have demonstrated on a bipartisan basis the value of the system which has been established other than the value which has been given to it by Senator Ray. If one looks at the first major inquiry into the securities industry, one will see that it was the foundation of substantial reforms in the operation of that system. If one looks at the major inquiry which was undertaken into the proposed national compensation scheme during the Whitlam Government, one would say that that the Government was held back from an incredibly expensive mistake by the careful work of that committee, which unanimously suggested that the Bill should be withdrawn and redrafted, and which put forward a whole series of reasons why the Government's proposal was flawed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Senate's capacity to deal with policy matters of that sort is only part of the story. The Senate committee system-the Estimates committees, for example, which disclosed the maladministration in the Department of Aboriginal Affairs in the latter part of the last year and which led Minister Hand to act in the way I have already described in achieving the dismissal of his own departmental head-is a further illustration of the value of the work which has been done and which should be accepted by governments as a contribution to good government. I am sorry that the Minister at the table, who has recently promoted an inquiry into how we might facilitate doing the business of the Senate in a better way, an inquiry which I understood has a part of its intention ensuring that the Senate give better consideration to legislation, has expressed the extremely cynical and one-sided view he has today. I suppose that raises the question about whether the exercise that he promoted with respect to the consideration of business in the Senate was simply a political exercise in the sense that it had nothing to do with the Senate, except the preservation of the present Government in office. </PARA>
<PARA> The allegation of the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs was in part that no protection is given to witnesses in the Senate committee system. I do not think anyone would deny that any process of inquiry gives rise to problems of conflict between getting to the facts and protecting the civil liberties of those people involved. That conflict arises whether inquiries are made by parliamentary committees, by committees of inquiry, by royal commissions or indeed by policemen. Inevitably in all those systems rules develop which go to the protection of the civil liberties of witnesses and of people who may be reflected on by witnesses. Again, there has been a bipartisan approach to the issues raised. On 25 February 1988 the Senate adopted a series of resolutions relating to the issues of parliamentary privilege and the operations of committees. One finds a whole series of procedures which were established to protect the position of witnesses before committees. The Minister's remarks went more clearly to the interests of those people who are not themselves witnesses before committees but who are reflected upon by people who are giving evidence to committees. The resolution that we adopted in February last year made clear provisions to protect the interests of such people. Paragraph (12) of the resolution of 25 February provides:</PARA>
<PARA>Where a witness gives evidence reflecting adversely on a person and the committee is not satisfied that that evidence is relevant to the committee's inquiry, the committee shall give consideration to expunging that evidence from the transcript of evidence, and to forbidding the publication of that evidence. </PARA>
<PARA>Paragraph (13) provides:</PARA>
<PARA>Where evidence is given which reflects adversely on a person and action of the kind referred to in paragraph (12) is not taken in respect to the evidence, the committee shall provide reasonable opportunity for that person to have access to that evidence and to respond to that evidence by written submission and appearance before the committee. </PARA>
<PARA>One can raise all sorts of arguments about the efficacy of any system of reply or response. One can, on the other hand, as the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs has, and most recently this morning on the AM program, criticised committees because they take steps to protect witnesses and people who may be affected by the evidence of witnesses. Only this morning on the AM program Mr Hand was highly critical of the fact that certain evidence was taken in camera by the ATSIC Committee, presumably because the Committee thought that it was necessary to protect those people who were either giving evidence or who were reflected upon by the evidence. Minister Hand cannot have it both ways. </PARA>
<PARA> The truth is that the obligation is on committees to preserve the necessary balance between disclosure in the public interest and the protection of individual reputation. To try to escape totally meeting that balance would require giving up the process of investigation. I do not believe that anyone can seriously argue that that would be in the public interest. The truth is that any process of inquiry gives rise to that need for balance. Extensive rules govern the operation of the Senate committees in this area. If Mr Hand, any other Minister or, indeed, any other member of this Parliament believes that those rules can be or should be improved, that is a matter that he can take action on and it should not be a difficulty. </PARA>
<PARA> The attack by Mr Hand received widespread media comment. I will not refer to it in any detail, but I think all honourable senators would know that it received extensive comment in both the electronic and the print media. I think it is essential that this Parliament make it quite clear that it has confidence in the integrity of the committee system which, as the motion says, has enjoyed all-party support for almost 20 years. I would be sorry if the attitude which is taken by the Government were in line with the attitude which has been expressed by Senator Robert Ray, that this is a matter which is to be judged solely in terms of its capacity either to elect or not to elect Labor or to elect or not elect the coalition to government. I believe that the parliamentary institution has roles which, if properly filled, enable either side of politics to govern better than it would without an effective parliamentary instrument. My own view is that the parliamentary system of inquiry enables any government to avoid mistakes, to govern better and, in particular, to legislate better. </PARA>
<PARA> In the instant case there is absolutely no doubt that there will be substantial amendments to the ATSIC proposal if the ATSIC proposal ever goes through this Parliament. Those substantial amendments will be the result of the painstaking work of this Committee. Quite strong and differing views will be expressed in the debate on the Committee report about some of its conclusions. The truth of the matter is that, as Senator Peter Baume illustrated in debate last night, as did Senator Boswell, it is possible even within the Committee itself to be highly critical of some of the conclusions which were drawn by the majority, just as the majority would, in turn, be critical of the conclusions drawn by the minority. But the truth is that whatever judgment one makes about those differing views on detail, this Government and this Parliament will make very substantial changes to the ATSIC proposals on the basis of the light which has been thrown on those proposals by this inquiry. </PARA>
<PARA> The cheap and self-protecting attack on the committee system made by Minister Hand needs to be replied to by this chamber. He should be told clearly, as the public should be told clearly, that this chamber supports the work of the Senate committee system. We believe that with the safeguards we have, which include, as in this case, the Government having a voting majority on the Committee, it is absolutely pathetic for the Minister to have made the attack that he has made. I do not know whether the Minister will take part in this debate. If he is going to take part, I am sure that someone else will have a chance to respond to the comments that he wishes to make. I commend the motion to the Senate and trust that it will be carried with the support of all parties in this place. </PARA>

Senator Chaney thinks so much of this institution and its committee system that he cannot wait to get out of it. I want to go to an interjection I made. Senator Chaney, as usual, put up the straw man and knocked it down. He was talking about the motive for setting up the Senate committee system. He talked about all sorts of nobility.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes. But I say to Senator Stone and others that what I could also go on to say is that the Senate committee system has evolved from those origins into something completely different. We have seen develop in this chamber a strong committee system, a system that works well, a system that has flaws. One would not believe that if one listened to Senator Chaney's speech today. It is a good system, a robust system, but still a system that has flaws. It is a system whose image is slightly purer than the reality. When we read the descriptions of the committee system in Odgers or any other Senate publication, or when any of us go to primary or secondary schools to give our blurb, a slightly higher and more noble gloss is put on the committee system than maybe it deserves. But I would never support the dismantling of the committee system in this place. On the whole it is the one thing that justifies the existence of this chamber, that this chamber can be proud of. It is the basis on which this chamber can say that it is entirely different from any other chambers around the world. That is the strength of our committee system.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This motion, however, will not get my support. Because that system is so robust and so entrenched I do not believe that we have to react to every criticism of it, whether that criticism is justified or not. I believe that we are showing too high a degree of sensitivity if, every time a Minister, a Premier or someone else criticises the committee system, we have to waste several more hours of the Senate's program debating the matter. One does not have to be much of a theoretician to conclude that we could well end up by 7.30 tonight not having discussed one ounce of legislation in the first two days of sitting. It is eminently possible. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Chaney's motion talks about Mr Hand being intemperate. He is a bit of a black Irishman; I have to admit that. He says what he thinks. He did not go to a finishing school. He came through the university of hard knocks. Gerry Hand has always stated his views clearly and fearlessly. He has not learnt the political art of saying one thing and meaning another.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;If we are talking about intemperateness, a few honourable senators opposite, and maybe a few on this side, could also qualify. I have followed the debate in this chamber, although I have never entered the debate on the Aboriginal affairs issue in the last few months. I have heard some pretty intemperate statements made on both sides of this chamber. No-one has had a censure motion moved against him for that. I have heard some wild and unsubstantiated allegations made that have now dropped out, that are now not being pursued. Yet people were happy to get up in this chamber and fling them around. That is the role of this chamber. But honourable senators opposite should not spit the dummy out the first time they are criticised. They should not come into this chamber and put up pompous motions because they cannot cop the criticism. If the Senate committee system is as durable as they think it is and I think it is, it is quite capable of taking this sort of criticism and in no way being dented by it. Yet this motion had to be moved today.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The first paragraph of the motion refers to Minister Hand's attack on the Senate committee system being `unjustified'. Minister Hand had to sit through most of December listening to a whole series of allegations and attacks on him in this chamber which bordered on the vicious. Therefore I believe he is entitled to respond. I do not agree-I put it on the record-and I suggest that most of my colleagues do not agree with every aspect of Mr Hand's response in criticising the activities in this chamber and the Committee. Of course, I do not agree with everything he said but I have my doubts as to whether it was totally unjustified. </PARA>
<PARA> In point (b) of Senator Chaney's motion he refers to a political stunt. There have been a few political stunts on this, starting at the Estimates Committee. There was no necessity before Estimates Committee E met for members of the Liberal Party of Australia or the National Party of Australia to go out and background the press like they did. They went out and blew up this issue. They went around the gallery and said, `Ah, look! A Black mafia is running Aboriginal Affairs'. When later interviewed, Senator Tambling said that it was to get the press's attention. There have been plenty of political stunts involved in all of this. One thing that surprises me-I do not ascribe this to all members of the Opposition-is that people say that this is a serious matter and that they feel deeply about it. I have seen members on the Opposition side ask those sorts of questions-I am not referring to Senator Chaney but there are others-and they then sit down with a smirk and a smile on their face. These are supposed to be serious issues about which people feel passionately. Yet I have seen the smirk and the smile come out. Therefore I tend to ascribe some other motives to people; that they are using this to advance not the interests of Aboriginals but their own political careers. That, from sitting on this side of the chamber, is obvious of a few of the individuals. Therefore when I hear people say, `You know we're only concerned for the Aboriginals and Aboriginal people', I have to doubt that when I see the body language of some of those people involved in this particular exercise. </PARA>
<PARA> The big point has been made in paragraph (c) that there is a majority of Government members on the Committee. I say, `So what?'. If the committee system is what Opposition senators say it is, objective, and that committees assess the evidence as such, it does not matter whether there is a Government majority. Not all committees that this Senate has set up have had a Government majority or a casting vote. When it is a contentious issue, when the fix is to be put in, the real key is found by reading the one to 15 points setting out how the committee will operate which follow the substantive motion. When the Opposition is really interested in making political points, that is when it describes the Government as a majority. All of us in this chamber know that that has happened. It happened over the identity card. Very cleverly, people pranced around afterwards and said, `Aha! We tricked you; you don't have a casting vote'. Of course it happens. </PARA>
<PARA> Point (d) of the motion calls on the Government to dissociate itself from Mr Hand. Of course, that would be typical of those opposite where loyalty means nothing. We are not going to dissociate ourselves from Mr Hand. He is the Minister. We will support him. What the motion suggests would be typical of the sort of thing Liberals would do and the way they operate. The real key to this question is in point (e). It states:</PARA>
<PARA>(e) reaffirms its confidence in the integrity of the Committee system . . . </PARA>
<PARA>I am happy to do that. But I say do not do that uncritically. It is not as though the committee system in my experience here has been completely objective. I have seen people caucus. I have seen people express a view one day, get nobbled overnight and come back with a different view on the committee system the next morning. I have seen people go in to committees with such preconceived ideas that all they do is look for evidence to support those ideas. I have seen people in the committee system not attend virtually any hearing, yet they have been able to put out a 40-page dissenting report. I am not talking about the ATSIC Committee now, but the committee system generally.</PARA>

<PARA> Leaks also occur from a committee that imperil the integrity of the committee system. One only has to go back to the Privileges Committee inquiry into the Murphy affair. Not one member of that Privileges Committee remained unconvinced that it was a senator who leaked that. We all remain convinced that it was not a staff member. There are faults in the committee system. They are, for the most part, relatively minor. But let us not get on our high horse and say that the committee system is absolutely perfect. It is as good as any in Australia and it may be as good as any in the world for all I know. </PARA>
<PARA> We must be willing to take criticism. We must be willing to cop it as well as dish it out. That is really what this debate is about. This Senate spent most of December dishing it out. It gets one boot back and it squeals. It spits the dummy and says, `Oh, my gosh! We must have a motion on this. We must protect it'. This committee system will endure with or without these types of motions.</PARA>
<PARA> I do not have much more to say on this matter. I think Senator Chaney filled in the middle part of his speech with remarks on the ATSIC committee. That is something I am not capable of doing. I want to respond to one or two things Senator Chaney said. He raised the question, `Was there a conspiracy between Dowding, Cain and Hand to attack the Senate committee system?'. We all have our differences in politics, even Gerry Hand is known to have his differences. He has had his differences with Mr Dowding. Recently, on the pay rise, he has had his differences with Mr Cain. I am looking at my colleague Senator Childs and wondering whether he could possibly believe they were involved in a conspiracy; that they sat down over dinner one night and plotted an attack on the Senate committee system. We are not that important to them. That is certainly a rather ridiculous allegation. </PARA>
<PARA> This comes down to the chamber's ability to absorb criticism. There is no doubt about this chamber's ability to dish it out but there is doubt about whether it should absorb. I do not agree entirely with Minister Hand's attack on the committee system. I do not think it was totally fair. In his own mind he thought it was and I am quite happy to see people respond to that criticism. It does not justify a motion; it does not justify the condemnation; it does not justify honourable senators wasting two or three hours of this chamber's time on this subject. </PARA>
<PARA> I reiterate our attitude to the committee system so that it will not be distorted by Senator Chaney or anyone else. We support it. I do not retract what I said about the motives behind the setting up of the committee system. They were not as noble as he ascribes. These things have a life of their own. This committee system overcame what I would call its less than principled start. It is something that needs to be supported. When I refer to supporting the committee system, I mean that it does not just need our moral support. The committees need to be properly staffed. Senators need to take their committee duty seriously. I conclude by saying-it is not really relevant to Minister Hand-that this committee system is in danger of breaking down. That danger arises from the creation of too many committees in which too many senators are strung out too far. That is where the mistakes occur. We have to think about the workloads these committees are putting on senators and how we can consolidate that workload. Otherwise, if we keep on setting up select committees on such things as paper mills, on Staples, as has been suggested, et cetera, we will overload this committee system. It will then collapse under its own weight because senators will take the short cuts. They will get their staff to read the evidence. They will rely on the committee staff to write the reports instead of doing it themselves. Lack of staff for the committees and the overemphasis on committees by creating far too many represent a far greater danger to the committee system than Gerry Hand letting off a bit of steam. This chamber should be mature enough to cop criticism and not respond every time it is made. By doing so, one indicates a fragility of the committee system that simply does not exist. </PARA>

<PARA>condemns statements in similar terms made by any other member of the Senate or the House of Representatives criticising the Senate Committee system . . . </PARA>
<PARA> I begin by picking up several of the points made by Senator Robert Ray, because I think he attempted to muddy the waters on several issues. First, he said that the committee system was robust and that therefore it should take no notice of the sorts of criticisms which had been made of it by Mr Hand and the Premiers of Western Australia and Victoria. It does not matter how robust a system is; any system can be killed off if it receives sufficient criticism. Certainly that is more likely to occur if the criticism which is mounted against that system is unjustified. The motion makes the point that the criticism which Mr Hand made of the Senate committees in general and the Senate Select Committee on the Administration of Aboriginal Affairs, in particular, was completely unjustified. Therefore, it is completely appropriate for the Senate to seek to defend its own committee system. It is indeed politically disingenuous of Senator Ray to attempt to claim that the committee system will continue to operate, irrespective of the attacks which Mr Hand and others have made on that committee system. A sufficient number of such attacks, reported in the press sufficiently frequently, will eventually lead to damage to the committee system. Therefore, I totally reject the claim which Senator Ray has made. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Ray further attempted to muddy the waters by dealing with the attacks which were made by the Opposition on Mr Hand, in particular, and on the administration of Aboriginal affairs during the month of November. Honourable senators will know that the Australian Democrats made a deliberate point of not joining with the Opposition during those attacks. However, those attacks on Mr Hand and on the administration of his Department had absolutely nothing to do with the committee system and nothing to do with the operation of the Committee inquiring into the Administration of Aboriginal Affairs and the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission (ATSIC), in particular. Whether Mr Hand was justified in responding to those attacks again is quite irrelevant to the question of whether he had any justification to attack the committee system. It is a non sequitur; it deals with a completely unrelated matter. </PARA>
<PARA> I was disappointed to hear Senator Ray also say that members on his side of the House would place loyalty to Mr Hand above their loyalty to good government. I was particularly disappointed to hear him say that because in a matter like this which goes substantially to the heart of good government, of which he himself has said the Senate committee system is part, his loyalty to good government should surely supersede his loyalty to a Minister in a particular government at a particular time. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Ray also attempted to muddy the waters by going back to the history of the development of the committee system. By implication, he suggested that Mr Hand was referring to that history, yet it is absolutely clear that Mr Hand was referring specifically to the motivation which surrounded the formation of the Select Committee into the Administration of Aboriginal Affairs. </PARA>
<PARA> The history of the development of the committee system, interesting as it might be and perhaps flawed as it might be, again is totally irrelevant to the matter of the attack which Mr Hand made on the committee system and therefore should not be taken into consideration in this debate today. </PARA>
<PARA> The first paragraph of the motion condemns the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs for his intemperate and unjustified attack. Mr Hand's attack arose historically after the Premier of Victoria, Mr Cain, and the Premier of Western Australia, Mr Dowding, criticised specifically the inquiry into drugs in sport of the Senate Standing Committee on Environment, Recreation and the Arts. I would certainly not imply that Mr Hand entered into any conspiracy with the two Premiers in his criticism of the Senate committee system, but I would certainly say that he took the opportunity to jump on the band wagon and very quickly turn around the attack on committees in general to an attack on the Committee inquiring into the Administration of Aboriginal Affairs. His remarks were certainly intemperate and unjustified. </PARA>
<PARA> In my short time in the Senate, I have served on a number of Senate committees, three of which have already reported. My experience of work on those committees is that they are hard working. Contrary to what goes on in this place, party differences are substantially submerged during consideration within committees. Senators are hardworking. In the case of the Select Committee on the Administration of Aboriginal Affairs, I am completely unaware of any backsliding by any senator. I am unaware of any member of that Committee not attending every meeting of the Committee for which he was available. Senator Collins pointed out yesterday that he had been to every meeting other than those he was unable to attend for very good reasons. I have certainly attended every meeting other than those in Queensland where a prior engagement prevented me from attending. That applies to every other member of the Committee on both sides of the chamber. </PARA>
<PARA> It is fair to say that Mr Hand's remarks were also politically stupid. They came at a time when the Aboriginal affairs Committee was within a very short time of reporting to the Senate. Through his remarks and his attack claiming that the setting up of the Committee was a political stunt, he painted himself into a corner, out of which he is now having considerable difficulty in extricating himself. On the AM program this morning, he turned around and said that he would now consider the report of the Committee and the amendments proposed by that Committee. </PARA>
<PARA> He cannot have it both ways, as Senator Chaney said in a somewhat different context. He cannot on the one hand claim that the Committee was a political stunt and a charade and that it was just going through the motions of considering ATSIC with ulterior motives of holding up or blocking the legislation and then turn around and say that out of this deeply flawed Committee can come suggested amendments to the ATSIC legislation which he is now prepared to consider seriously and to implement. I would go further than Senator Chaney has gone and say that Mr Hand was politically very unwise. It would have been far more sensible for him to have remained quiet at this time; if interviewed regarding the Senate committee system, to have said things such as he would be interested to have a look at the report of the Committee when it became available and would give consideration to the deliberations of that Committee. However, he chose not to go down that path. That reflects very much on the personality of the man in that position, Mr Hand himself. </PARA>
<PARA> As I indicated in speaking to the report yesterday, this is not the only time on which Mr Hand has behaved in that way. Indeed, throughout consideration of the ATSIC legislation, he has taken an attitude that it is this legislation or no legislation. He has been unprepared to talk with those who have alternative views. The alternative views which he is not prepared to accept are held in good faith, even though they might be at variance with his views. I think this is a great pity, because what is at stake here is the better administration of Aboriginal affairs for the betterment of the Aboriginal people of this country. I do not think their well-being is in any way served by a Minister who takes the confrontationist, arrogant attitude of not being prepared to take advice from other sources and directions when that advice disagrees with a position to which he has become committed at the early stage of consideration. It is also worth while pointing out that the Committee itself, on the morning after Mr Hand's attack on it, moved a motion of condemnation. That motion was not supported by the Labor members of the Committee, but nonetheless it was supported by the Opposition members and by me and it led on to a press release. I certainly had the feeling that the Labor members were annoyed by that attack. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Chaney has dealt to some extent with clause 2, Mr Hand's assertion that civil liberties are threatened. I point out that, as with the courts, there are a number of provisions in Senate committees which protect the rights of individuals. The right to be heard in camera is one which this Committee used on several occasions so that witnesses could give evidence to the Committee in camera. An undertaking was given to those witnesses that, whilst the substance of their claims might be used, the witnesses would not be identified with those claims. Moreover, where evidence is not given in camera, there is the right for people who become aware of evidence through the newspapers and other media to appear before the Committee and to counter any claims that have been made. Finally, there is the possibility that a person who feels maligned could take action against a witness and the witness would then have to use the defence of privilege to defend himself or herself. </PARA>
<PARA> I think it is very unwise of Mr Hand to go down this road. It is quite clear from the Committee report that an article which appeared in the Sydney Morning Herald in May 1988 attempted to malign the Aboriginal Development Commission (ADC) and by implication, as this was about the time of the dismissal of eight ADC commissioners, those commissioners in particular. It has already been pointed out that, as to the article that appeared in the Sydney Morning Herald, not only did it contain information which could have come only from the files within the Minister's own Department but also it was faxed widely throughout Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> It is worth mentioning that very early in the morning of the day the article appeared, I had a phone call from Mr Pat Dodson, of the Central Land Council, drawing my attention to the article. I said, `No, I have not seen the article. I will get hold of a copy of it'. The copy of the Sydney Morning Herald, which was available in Canberra did not contain the article. It was not until the afternoon that I was able to get a copy of the article faxed down from Sydney, because it was in the Sydney edition of the Sydney Morning Herald that that article appeared. Yet Mr Dodson in Alice Springs had a copy of that article early in the morning. I was told only yesterday by one of the journalists in Parliament House that a copy of that article was also boxed in the journalists' boxes around Parliament House. Mr Hand is being-to use the word I used earlier-sanctimonious about the intrusions into civil liberties by this Committee. At the same time, he is allowing that sort of attack on individuals to go unchecked, an attack which, as I have indicated, must have come from someone very close to him within his portfolio. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="TF4">Senator COULTER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As Senator Chaney says, he has done nothing to rectify it, and both the majority and minority reports recommend that he should do something to rectify it. Indeed, it is worth interpolating here that the letter Mr Hand sent to the eight sacked ADC commissioners was indeed a very grudging and very mean letter and in no way drew attention to the extensive work which those people had done for the ADC and for Aboriginal people over a long period. This is a point to which Senator Chaney has already drawn attention.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Clause 3 is merely a statement of fact that the Minister was reflecting on a committee which had a majority of Government members. It is worth drawing attention to the fact that the Minister himself consistently resisted any investigation into ATSIC and that at the inception he certainly resisted and objected to the creation of the Committee. For the record, I repeat what I said yesterday in response to Senator Devlin, who claimed that the contrary was the case. This Committee arose initially out of a motion, which I proposed, that the legislation lie before the Senate for six months so that Aboriginal people would have an opportunity to look at it and make representations on it. Following that, Senator Chaney moved to create the Senate Select Committee essentially to give effect to that process. We supported that motion because clearly it was a good way of proceeding. </PARA>
<PARA> I think it is also worth pointing out that the Committee found that, following 24 August, when the legislation itself became available, neither Mr Hand nor the ATSIC task force engaged in any consultation whatsoever. There has been no consultation since that time. To the extent that there has been any, that consultation has been carried on by the Senate Committee. For Mr Hand to turn around this morning and say that he is prepared to look at the amendments that have been recommended by the Committee just seems to me to be a peculiar twist of events when throughout he has both resisted the processes of consultation and attacked the Committee that has made those recommendations. </PARA>
<PARA> Clause 4 calls on the Leader of the Government in the Senate (Senator Button), on behalf of the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke), to dissociate the Government from Mr Hand's comments. I think this goes to the matter that was raised by Senator Ray and on which I have already spoken; that is, that the Leader of the Government has a responsibility to the Parliament which transcends his or her own party loyalty. I will be very disappointed if that is not the case, as I was in the Committee, when the Government members did not join with the Opposition and me in criticising Mr Hand's attack on the Senate committee system. I think it is absolutely appropriate that the Government in this case recognise that its responsibility to Parliament is far more important and significant than its responsibility to its own party loyalty. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, clause 5 calls on the Senate to reaffirm its confidence in the integrity of the committee system. I have not been in the Senate for a great length of time but I have been associated with three Senate committees which have already reported in that time. I am associated with a number of others which are still in process and with a number of references. My own opinion is that the committees are probably the most productive part of the operation of the Senate. It is worth interpolating here that I am disappointed with what goes on in this chamber, because essentially we talk to Hansard. But in the committees we really sit down and talk to each other. We talk in non-party terms; we take evidence; matters are debated informally; and we come to conclusions which very often cross party lines. Following the first draft of the report of the Senate Select Committee on the Administration of Aboriginal Affairs, I made a number of submissions to the Committee-they ran to six or seven pages-on suggested changes to the report which went to the matter of recommendations for amendment to the legislation. All except one of those recommendations were accepted by the Committee, and by the members on both sides, as an improvement on the legislation. It is certainly my experience that the committee system works well and it is productive. It is absolutely appropriate that the Senate reaffirm its confidence in the integrity of the committee system. </PARA>
<PARA> Reflecting again on what Senator Robert Ray has said-that the system is robust and, therefore, we do not need to defend it-I think it is vital that we defend the committee system against attacks and particularly those attacks which really have no justification in fact at all, as this attack by Mr Hand had no justification. My colleague Senator Powell will be speaking particularly to the clause which we wish to interpolate between the last two clauses. I move:</PARA>
<PARA> After paragraph (d), insert the following new paragraph:</PARA>
<PARA>``(da) condemns statements in similar terms made by any other member of the Senate or the House of Representatives criticising the Senate Committee system; and''. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will not hold the Senate up for very long, but it is important that we place on the record the reasons for the Australian Democrats amendment to Senator Chaney's motion. I will not rehearse the matters which Senator Coulter, as a member of the Senate Select Committee on the Administration of Aboriginal Affairs, referred to in the motion and as the Australian Democrats spokes- person on Aboriginal affairs has already put in the debate, but we felt that it was important to broaden the scope of this motion; indeed, in the interests of the last clause of Senator Chaney's motion, reaffirming confidence in the integrity of the committee system, which has enjoyed all-party support for a period of almost 20 years. It is an historical fact that although the Senate committee system has, on the surface, fundamentally enjoyed all-party support, there have been periodically, and perhaps even consistently, attacks on that system. Senator Chaney's motion focuses on one particular attack and extends itself to two others in terms of the Premiers of two States. The Democrats simply believe that it is important to put on the record that this sort of attack takes place fairly often. Indeed, Senator Haines was reflecting in our discussions on our amendment on the first Senate Select Committee established by the Australian Democrats, moved by herself, the Senate Select Committee on Private Hospitals and Nursing Homes. She assures me that had we had time to go back to the Hansard on that occasion we would have seen many intemperate and unjustified remarks about the potential of that Select Committee to do inordinate damage to one particular sector in the community, and yet, as it transpired, that has been a most valuable and longstanding exercise on behalf of the Senate, a very valuable contribution to policy making in this country, which indeed goes on.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator Robert Ray has expressed the view that this chamber should be mature enough to take criticism of this kind and that it should not respond every time it happens. The point is that we do not respond every time it happens and the Democrats amendment is perhaps saying that maybe we should more often respond to this kind of criticism. </PARA>
<PARA> In addition to making a general reference to the comments that Senator Haines said were flying around the place in the early 1980s on the inquiry into nursing homes being set up, I want to refer to specific comments by members of this chamber and one comment by a member of the other place with relation to another Senate committee-the Senate Select Committee on Agricultural and Veterinary Chemicals in Australia. In that debate, which extended over almost a year during the formation of that Committee, many intemperate and unjustified statements were made by members of the Opposition. I have a stack of Hansards and I have been through some press releases that were issued at that time. I would like to begin with a quote from the Opposition spokesperson on primary industry, Mr Bruce Lloyd, who stated:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . the Select Committee had the ability to create adverse publicity by fringe groups whose interests were more in line with self-promotion rather than in helping agriculture. </PARA>
<PARA> . . . publicity had the ability to damage Australia's reputation as a major agricultural exporter . . . </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="O14">Senator POWELL</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That was said by Mr Bruce Lloyd, Deputy Leader of the National Party of Australia, on 2 November 1988. I would say that it was an intemperate and unjustified attack on the Senate committee system. In April last year Senator Lewis, in this place, stated:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>If our primary products are besmirched by the sort of inquiry which the Democrats are intending, it may very well put at risk all markets for Australian primary produce. </PARA>
<PARA>Senator Boswell, in this chamber, stated:</PARA>
<PARA>I warn the Senate that fools step in where angels fear to tread. We are going to open up the greatest Pandora's box in the rural industries that we have ever seen. </PARA>
<PARA>In October 1988, Senator Lewis picks up the point made by Mr Lloyd. He stated that the setting up of a Senate committee, which is what we are defending through Senator Chaney's motion:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . will mean that there will be opportunities for all sorts of people to come before that committee and give evidence about what is the environmental impact on Australia of chemicals in primary production. </PARA>
<PARA>What a shame! The Democrats thought that that is what the committee system was all about-to enable all sorts of people to come before committees and give all sorts of evidence. However, on 17 October 1988 Senator Lewis argued strongly, vehemently, passionately and, I would say, intemperately and unjustifiably, against that sort of process. There are many other quotes from Senator Lewis's speech which I think I should spare the Senate, but basically they revolved around the terminology of a Senate inquiry being a witch-hunt. I refer honourable senators to page 1489 of the Weekly Hansard. Again, Senator Archer, in that same debate on 17 October, referred to the Senate Committee on Agricultural and Veterinary Chemicals as being:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . a stupid, pointless and dangerous exercise where there is no possibility of producing a result of any benefit to Australia . . . under no circumstances can I do other than pour scorn on the proposed inquiry . . . </PARA>
<PARA>Senator Panizza, in the same debate, talking about the sorts of witnesses who come before Senate committees, stated:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . there is nothing wrong with respected scientists putting their case to an inquiry. Respected scientists will be judged by their peers. </PARA>
<PARA>But then he said:</PARA>
<PARA>Nutty type people, people who are vindictive against farmers and veterinarians, can make whatever statements they like and get away with it . . . </PARA>
<PARA>That is the very point that part of Senator Chaney's motion goes to-an accusation that people can come before Senate committees and make unjustified statements and there is no protection for anybody under that system. Senator Panizza, at least in October of last year, did not seem aware of that point and perhaps in party room discussions since then he has been made a little bit more aware in the terms of Senator Chaney's motion. On 19 October, two days later, Senator Brownhill said in the same debate:</PARA>
<PARA>Fringe groups will cause problems and their accusations will do a great deal of damage to this country's trade in the future. This will threaten the reputation of Australia . . . </PARA>
<PARA>On that same day Senator Crichton-Browne said:</PARA>
<PARA>This proposed committee is designed to attract all the fringe lunatic groups that attach themselves like some plague to the body politic of the Democrats. This Committee will do nothing to enhance the rural sector . . . </PARA>
<PARA>Senator Crichton-Browne also said:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . it will have the purposeful and acknowledged effect of attracting unwanted, unnecessary and certainly undesirable publicity, of a distorted nature, to Australia . . . </PARA>
<PARA>Senator Panizza also used terms such as `fishing expeditions'. A little later in the same debate Senator Boswell referred to the fact that he was concerned about how long such a committee might run and how much it might cost. Senator Lewis, who reflected on the question of evidence before parliamentary inquiries, prefaced his remarks by saying:</PARA>
<PARA>I do not prejudge the issue. </PARA>
<PARA>He then said:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . evidence will then be blown right around the world to the detriment of Australian primary production and to the detriment of Australian primary producers. </PARA>
<PARA>Those are quotes from only two editions of the Hansard that I have before me reporting the debate on one Senate inquiry. As Senate committees have come under attack again and again and will probably continue to do so, both in this chamber and in the wider community, the Australian Democrats believe that this motion should be extended so that we, as a chamber, in passing this motion make sure that we are not engaged in a political stunt and that we are addressing the significant issue. </PARA>
<PARA> This is where we part company with Senator Ray. We believe that this chamber should react, at least now and then, when its committee system comes under attack so that these sorts of attacks will not be made in such cavalier fashion, so vehemently, so intemperately and so unjustifiably. The question of who or who is not engaged in a political stunt is very much at issue in this motion. The Democrats' amendment condemns in similar terms statements by any member of the Senate or the House of Representatives, not just Mr Hand or the Premiers of a couple of Labor governed States in this country. This chamber should condemn all such comments from wherever they come. </PARA>
<PARA> As a member of many Senate committees I endorse the remarks that people have made. In particular, I endorse those more honest remarks which point out that not all deliberations of all Senate committees are totally devoid of any partisan activity or prejudice. If we have an exercise in which we, as members of the Senate, can engage which is worth while, where decisions are made on their merits, it is certainly the committee system. None of us is perfect and none of our committees is perfect but it is certainly a system worth fighting for. For that reason the Australian Democrats want to do everything they can to reduce unnecessary, intemperate and unjustified criticism. I, therefore, strongly support the amendment which has been moved by my colleague Senator Coulter and I commend it both to the Government and to the Opposition. If ever there were a Democrat amendment which should be passed by this Senate it would be the amendment to the original motion which, in its last clause, reaffirms the Senate's confidence in the integrity of the committee system which has enjoyed all-party support for a period of almost 20 years. </PARA>

What has been said about civil liberties this morning? I ask those people who are listening to this debate to consider the following scenario: a person is accused of being a thief and of having stolen from a local club. The club, in that person's absence, chooses what evidence it wants to accept and it condemns that person without having heard from him. Senator Chaney laughs at this. His laughter implies that it is a matter of small moment to condemn a Minister of the Crown for an intemperate and unjustified attack on a Senate committee. Apparently, Senator Chaney has said that no notice of this should be given to Mr Hand before he is condemned. Is Senator Chaney saying that Mr Hand should be given no chance to be heard? Would it not have been better for Senator Chaney to have got his colleagues in the House of Representatives to do something about it? Why did he not make an opportunity available for Mr Hand to answer this? What is the point of our going through an exercise of self-congratulation in which we say what a terrific system this Senate has?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I believe that our system of Senate committees is a good system. People who are listening outside must be very impressed to hear that this institution cannot stand any criticism of itself by a Minister who was-and this is not denied-blackguarded, condemned and insulted day after day, week after week during November and December last year. As soon as he replied, this mighty and august body condemned him without hearing from him or in any way giving him proper warning that this issue was coming on. Where is the sense of balance in that? The minority report of the Select Committee on the Administration of Aboriginal Affairs has been tabled and talked about. Let us see what it says about the Minister. On page 4 it says:</PARA>
<PARA>Consultation about the ATSIC proposal has been incomplete and inadequate. Certainly neither the quality nor the quantity of consultation have been adequate to redeem the promises of the Minister that ATSIC would proceed only after full and extensive consultation. </PARA>
<PARA>That in effect condemns the Minister as inefficient, as not being a man of his word and not properly consulting with the Aboriginal communities around Australia. On page 5 the minority report says:</PARA>
<PARA> As set out later, the Committee heard general allegations of the most serious kind to the effect that the consultation process was corrupted by intimidation, coercion, enticements and stand-over tactics. The Committee has also received a list of funding `commitments' entered into during the course of the Minister's first-round consultations. </PARA>
<PARA>The inference is that this Minister has been in some way connected with intimidation, coercion, enticements and standover tactics. That is a fairly serious allegation which I, for one, would have thought a person would be entitled to answer. It is an allegation which might rouse in the mind and heart of any reasonable person feelings of outrage and which might lead to a response. The Minister was condemned in these strong terms and he made a response, then this fair minded chamber condemned him again without giving him any chance to answer the allegations made against him. Why is it all right for this Senate to condemn, blackguard and call for the resignation of the Minister time and time again, week after week and to produce, through one of its committees, a minority report by two very senior senators which condemns this man, but it is not all right for him to defend himself? If that is the way this chamber considers fairness should be dispensed then we have something to worry about. Where is the test of natural justice? That test should consist of two elements-bringing an unbiased mind to considerations of the matter and hearing the other side. How can we say we have looked at this motion with an unbiased mind, when members of the Opposition and the Australian Democrats have on their own admission come here already prepared to pass this motion condemning a senior Minister of the Crown, a man who has struggled hard over the years?</PARA>

By that, I take Senator Chaney to mean that had Mr Hand been a senior Minister of the Crown a bit of natural justice would have been applied, but since he is a junior Minister the motion is all right. In other words, natural justice is only for those who have a certain status in life. Otherwise why did Senator Chaney go out of his way to correct me?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I would just like to say something general about certain bodies-not only the Senate and Senate committees-which can cause great damage to people and organisations through their proceedings and reports because they possess absolute privilege. This chamber and its committees have absolute privilege. But the problems go beyond that. That absolute privilege extends to courts, royal commissions, judicial inquiries, parliaments and parliamentary committees and a whole string of people have been affected by their actions. Most recently there was the case of the Queensland ministry which unintentionally was unjustly blackguarded and unjustly put at risk of disrepute by people-or a person in particular-speaking under privilege. Those Ministers had to swear statutory declarations and try to redeem their reputation. In my view, members of the Ahern Government were most grossly dealt with. Similarly, when Kerry Packer was named, he had to make a chase to redeem his reputation. Mr Justice Murphy went through the same difficulties because of the actions of bodies which have absolute privilege. I adhere to the view that there must be provision for absolute privilege for the good of the community. There must be the opportunity for open debate, for the exchange of views and for good, vigorous and proper discussion of matters. But because of the tragedy and injury that bodies with absolute privilege can visit on people, these bodies should act with fairness-and fairness includes hearing both sides of the argument and bringing an unbiased--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Chaney suggests that we bring Mr Hand to the Bar of the Senate. I suggest that the least we should do is rephrase this motion so that it reads, for example, `that the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs, Mr Hand, be invited to respond to allegations that he has made an intemperate and unjustified attack on the Senate committee system'. At least that would provide the Minister with the chance of being heard. If we do not do that, do we proceed on party political lines? It will be demonstrated that this body, which is said to be so fair minded, august and elevated, has proceeded on party political lines when the vote is taken. Every member of the Opposition and the Australian Democrats will be on one side and every member of the Government will be on the other side. Yet, we will go to the public and say, `Well, this Senate has considered this motion in a dispassionate and unpolitical way'. How does that stand up?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA> A report was prepared on the ATSIC legislation and a dissenting report was made by Senator Coulter which was separate from the main body of actions. There was a strong attack on the Minister. The Minister anticipated that attack and made a strong attack in response. In that political scene this Senate purports to be outraged and offended to the point where it now has to pass a motion condemning the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs. It will take that action on a political basis but it will pretend-and this is where the vice rests-that it did so on a judicious, fair minded and considered basis. That is just not true. That is the problem and the vice we are facing. The reality is one thing; the pretence is another. If we simply said `Look, we are trying to get Mr Hand. He is on the run and has been for a while. We have had him and his Department under attack and this is another tactical advance in the area', that would be one thing. But for heaven's sake, do not let us pretend for one minute that this motion is put forward in any way other than a most political manner. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Cooney has just mounted a defence of the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs (Mr Hand) on very spurious grounds. First, he accused us of engaging in a political and not a judicial process. Of course, he was quite correct. I say to my legal colleague that this is not a court and that the processes which he set out as being desirable are processes which would apply in a court action but have never been applied here and are not appropriate in the Senate. This is a political chamber so any decision taken here is political. If that is what Senator Cooney is criticising, what should we conclude from that criticism?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is more important that we ask ourselves whether, in exercising that political judgment, we are behaving fairly. Here, I have to say that Senator Cooney did not set out for the Senate the entirety of the argument before us. He did not tell us that several weeks ago, when Mr Hand attacked two Senate committees and the Senate committee system in general, he did not deal with us as Senator Cooney would now have us deal with Mr Hand. Several weeks ago Mr Hand did not give to us any statement of the charge he laid against us. He gave us no chance to hear his evidence. We were not invited to respond in any way. In short, Mr Hand behaved exactly as Senator Cooney would now criticise us for behaving, and there was not a word from Senator Cooney to draw that to our attention. </PARA>
<PARA> When Mr Hand made his attack the first question that arose was whether possibly a question of privilege was involved. Of course it was not, for a number of reasons, not least of which was that there is no question of privilege as between members of the different Houses. We did not pursue it on that basis. But why did Mr Hand attack the Senate Select Committee on the Administration of Aboriginal Affairs so vehemently, so unexpectedly, so unreasonably and without any notice to the Committee? Why did he do it as he did and when he did? The reason is that Mr Hand feared the Committee's findings. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ME4">Senator PETER BAUME</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Crichton-Browne is right. He determined to attack the Committee in an attempt to kill the messenger because he feared the message that was to appear. That is what it was all about. He chose the moment when other people had attacked another Senate committee to launch his attack on the Committee in an attempt to kill the messenger before the message was delivered. It was an attempt to launch a pre-emptive strike. It was based on the weakness of the Minister's position on the merits of the matter that was before the Senate Select Committee, a matter in which the Minister and the Government have made no case for the course they proposed to take. They have not redeemed their pledge of adequate consultation. They have dealt shamefully with a number of Aboriginals who were dismissed arbitrarily as acting commissioners. They have not examined adequately the alternative proposal offered to them by an Aboriginal organisation-by Aboriginal commissioners within the Aboriginal Development Commission-and they have acted in an atmosphere where there have been very serious and difficult allegations.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> However, Mr Hand then went ahead and widened his attack into one on Senate committees in general. He made a personal attack upon senators by trying to talk about the way they worked, saying that he thought the Senate had exceeded its power and its remit. I interpolate that the conclusions which some of us reached and to which Senator Cooney has just referred were based on the evidence before the Select Committee. That is beyond doubt. The evidence is all there in the majority report; it is just that the majority report did not proceed to the conclusions. We based our conclusions on the evidence. We took evidence and listened to people. The hearings were prolonged. They were, if you like, much more judicial and fairer in their way than the attack launched on us by Mr Hand. Not only that, but our report came down after Mr Hand's pre-emptive attack. We waited some weeks after Mr Hand's attack upon the Senate committees so that we could let our anger subside, consider the matter with some care and come up with a considered motion, as we have done today. For the reasons Senator Chaney will set out in closing the debate, I hope that we will support the amendment and also the motion as amended. That is the proper course to take. I remind Senator Cooney that every one of the Senate committees is controlled by the government of the day. The government of the day has the numbers. It can control a committee. It can determine who provides evidence and the form of the final committee report. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Hand's pre-emptive strike on Senate committees in general is not atypical of governments, and it was not directed just at the Senate Select Committee on the Administration of Aboriginal Affairs. I remind honourable senators that when we attempted to set up a committee some 15 or 16 months ago Senator Peter Walsh attacked Senate committees and threatened to withhold funding from a committee if it was not one of which he approved. If he went on with that line-I am glad that he has not done so-it would provoke a constitutional crisis in this country because it would attack the Senate's right to conduct its business. But it is not unusual for government Ministers-I use the term `government' generically here-to attack Senate committees. They resent the power of Senate committees. They resent the expertise which is often available to Senate committees and to which they can turn. They resent the concentration which committees bring on particular issues, they resent the reputation which committees enjoy, and they resent the effectiveness of committees. Committees are a nuisance to governments. They reveal things which governments would rather remain hidden. They bring detailed analysis to matters which governments would rather have accepted without that analysis. </PARA>
<PARA> It is quite inappropriate for Mr Hand, with his record of dealing, to try to claim that the Senate Select Committee did not deal fairly with him. Senator Chaney has already drawn attention to that, but I want to make the point again. Mr Hand is the person who dismissed eight acting commissioners of the Aboriginal Development Commission simply because they would not agree with a course he proposed to take. Their crime was that they had asked a court to rule on the validity of the first ever ministerial direction given under the Aboriginal Development Commission Act. So he sacked them. He sacked them within six weeks of the completion of their terms of appointment. All he had to do was wait another six weeks and their terms ran out anyhow. He sacked them in a way which ensured that they would suffer enormous damage within their communities because people in their communities feel they have done something wrong. It is a malevolent and mean-spirited act as well as being unnecessary. It was punishment of those people for taking a course of action in the courts which was proper and well-intentioned. It did very great damage to them as individuals. Why did not Senator Cooney draw our attention to that set of actions and to the lack of justice shown by the Minister in taking that action against those relatively powerless Aboriginal people?</PARA>
<PARA> There was also the story in the Sydney Morning Herald, to which Senator Chaney and Senator Coulter have referred. That story was disseminated widely, probably in advance of the availability of the newspaper in which it appeared. That story was wrong, unjustified, further damaged those people, and drew on official records of some kind for its writing. Labor senators should not talk to us about fairness. It is said that one cannot go to equity with dirty hands. One cannot defend the Minister on this matter in view of that recent record. Look at the subsequent treatment of Mrs Shirley McPherson, the harassment and needling that has gone on and the way in which her position has been made impossible. </PARA>
<PARA> We have to say that the attack that was made on Senate committees was intemperate, defensive, inappropriate, contemptuous of the Senate and a direct challenge to the committee system. It would have been recreant of the Senate not to have responded in some way, and specifically in the way in which Senator Chaney has responded. </PARA>
<PARA> I say in response to Senator Powell that it is quite proper for honourable senators here to question the setting up of a Senate committee at the time it is set up-to question in this chamber in vigorous debate any proposal to set up a committee. That is not what we are arguing about today. We are arguing about the fact that once the Parliament has established a body to do a job for it as servants of the Senate-because that is what we are on committees-it is not proper for people outside to attack committees in the way in which Mr Hand has done. For that reason it is proper that we have the motion before us today that was moved by Senator Chaney. It will be my pleasure to support it, and I understand that we shall be supporting the amendment moved by the Australian Democrats. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The need to respond is much reduced by the excellent speech which has been made by my friend and colleague Senator Peter Baume. I thank him for that contribution to the debate, which has enabled me to be much briefer. I say, however, in addition to his comments, that the contribution from the Government seems to have been, I suppose necessarily, for the purpose of drawing red herrings, setting up straw men and answering arguments which have not been put, because the basis of the resolution is not arguable. Senator Robert Ray, for example, was vigorously arguing that the Senate committee system could not be claimed to be perfect. That is self-evident. The courts are not perfect, the Parliament certainly is not perfect, no government is perfect and there is always room for improvement. When referring in my speech to the efforts made by the Senate as recently as February 1988 to lay down rules governing the protection of witnesses and of those who might be implicated by witnesses, I specifically made the point that this was an example of improvement and that it was open to people to make suggestions for further improvement. That is always possible.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I believe that Senator Cooney's contribution has been adequately answered. As I listened to him, I was reminded, following his protestation of friendship for the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs (Mr Hand), of the fact that it is a serious mistake to appear in court for a friend. I tried it once and realised that it was a serious mistake. I suspect that Senator Cooney's friendship has overcome his forensic skills. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, that is probably so. The case put forward by Senator Cooney was sadly flawed. Perhaps it is important to note that Senator Cooney also put a weight on the Senate which in his speech he did not choose to put upon Mr Hand. One of the less creditable aspects of this matter, and a matter to which I referred extensively in my speech, was where the Committee majority made it quite clear that the eight sacked commissioners had been ill-treated-in some ways directly by Mr Hand and if in other ways not by Mr Hand directly, by his Department. No attempt has been made by Mr Hand and his Department to rectify the wrong done to those people.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The reference to Fitzpatrick and Browne was part of the endless confusion, if I may say so, of the speech. That case involved people being brought to the Bar of the House on a charge of contempt with a view to gaoling them, and indeed they were gaoled. It is extraordinary to suggest that that is in some way analogous to today's proceedings. Indeed, if one were to follow Senator Cooney's advice, it would be impossible to bring a censure motion in this Parliament. Apparently one would issue some sort of notice and commence some sort of quasi-judicial procedure to examine the facts. Clearly, after centuries of parliamentary tradition that is a sorry misreading of the function of this place. </PARA>
<PARA> I thank Senator Coulter for his contribution. I simply add a little to what Senator Peter Baume said about the concerns expressed by Senator Janet Powell. It is a pity that Senator Powell had to use the debate to reopen arguments about a matter on which she felt passionately, namely the chemicals inquiry. As Senator Peter Baume pointed out, there was a series of debates prior to the establishment of the Committee in this place as to the wisdom or unwisdom of that inquiry. All honourable senators will understand that there are substantial commercial firms involved, international and competing firms, and there are people who have vested interests outside this country in damaging our major export industries. The sorts of concerns expressed by Opposition senators at that time were in no way analogous to the matters that we have raised in respect to Mr Hand. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="EF4">Senator CHANEY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank my colleague for that comment. The amendment which has been put forward by Senator Powell on behalf of the Democrats gives the Opposition no difficulty at all. It is, in its turn, a condemnation of statements in similar terms made by any member of the Senate or House of Representatives criticising the Senate committee system. If any persons were to conduct themselves, whether from this or the other chamber, in the way Mr Hand has done, I think they should be roundly condemned.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This motion is not a motion of censure; it falls short of that. Had we moved a formal motion of censure, there would be no question but that Mr Hand would have been given a right of reply through his representative in this place. But Mr Hand has-this is uncontested-made intemperate criticisms of the Senate committee system and has been condemned in the news media. I refer to editorial comments in the Canberra Times and the Sydney Morning Herald relating to his comments. To suggest that no judgment can be passed in this chamber is on the face of it ludicrous. </PARA>
<PARA> I close by saying that there is one substantial reason why this motion should be passed and why it is important that it should have been brought forward. Mr Hand chose to attack the Committee at a time before it had completed its deliberations. No-one would be in any doubt that political pressures are involved in participation in committees. For supporters of the Government who are members of a committee it is a serious matter to be considering the sorts of criticisms which have been made of this Government and its administration in Aboriginal affairs. For that difficulty to be compounded by intimidatory statements by the Minister is a serious matter indeed. We will have a vigorous debate in this place about the report. The debate started yesterday; it is not to be part of this debate today. But no-one who listened to Senator Peter Baume's speech last night could fail to be impressed by the strength of his criticisms of the findings of the majority. For the argument to be further complicated by the Minister's attitude prior to the conclusion of the Committee's deliberations is extremely unfortunate. It simply highlights the difficulty of committees dealing with current political events or issues in a way which is fearless and without regard to the short term political consequences. </PARA>
<PARA> The ATSIC Committee was dealing with a major administrative reorganisation which will go to the future welfare of several hundred thousand Australians. It is not for me to lecture in this place. People like Senator Collins, who has a close personal knowledge of and a working relationship with the Aboriginal community in his electorate, understand, probably better than I, the impact that ATSIC will have, if it gets into place, on the Aboriginal people of this country. For the exhaustive attempts that have been made by this Parliament to subject this proposal to proper scrutiny to be subjected to the bully boy rubbish that we copped from the friend of Senator Cooney, Mr Hand, is to me totally objectionable and quite intolerable. </PARA>
<PARA> I am quite contemptuous of Mr Hand's attitude to this matter. Mr Hand has been shown not to have been prepared to accept the broad gathering of opinions and contributions as to how the administration of Aboriginal affairs should be shaped. That he is not prepared to use these processes, but blindly pushes on down his own track, reflects very badly on him indeed. However, I do not wish to get into that area. I simply commend this motion to the Senate and I trust that in future we will not have Government Ministers behaving in this disgraceful way. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The National Occupational Health and Safety Commission Amendment Bill deals with amendments to the structure of the National Occupational Health and Safety Commission (NOHSC). Amendments are certainly necessary, given the saga of mismanagement that has been revealed in the McKay report. The Opposition supports this Bill, but I propose to move a second reading amendment at the conclusion of my remarks. I would like to give honourable senators a potted history of the National Occupational Health and Safety Commission. The NOHSC was established by the Hawke Government under the National Occupational Health and Safety Commission Act 1985. It is a tripartite body comprising representatives of Commonwealth, State and Territory governments, employers and trade unions.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Under section 7 of the Act, the Commission is, first, to develop among the members of the community an awareness of issues relevant to occupational health and safety matters and facilitate public debate and discussion on such issues; secondly, to provide, in the public interest, a forum by which representatives of the Government of the Commonwealth, the governments of the States, and of employers and employees may consult together in, and participate in, the development and formulation of policies and strategies relating to occupational health and safety matters; and, thirdly, to provide a national focus for activities relating to occupational health and safety matters. </PARA>
<PARA> The specific functions performed by the Commission are set out in section 8 of the Act. The Act currently provides for a Commission consisting of 17 members. The Chairman is a full time appointee and is the chief executive officer of the Commission. The remaining 16 part time members represent the Australian trade unions, the Confederation of Australian Industry and the Commonwealth, State and Territory governments. </PARA>
<PARA> The chief purpose of the Bill we are currently debating is to separate the functions of the chairperson of the Commission and the chief executive officer, for reasons I shall come to later. Additionally, the Bill provides the Commission with a new function in relation to the evaluation of occupational hazards in work places and enables the Commission to constitute committees comprising persons other than its members. The NOHSC or Worksafe Australia, as it is commonly known, is divided into two operational arms. The first is the National Health and Occupational Safety Office (NHOSO), which is responsible for policy development and administrative support. The second arm is the National Institute of Occupational Health and Safety, which is responsible for the Commission's scientific and technical research functions. </PARA>
<PARA> The Hawke Government has proudly boasted that the establishment of the NOHSC was historic and that it was born of the accord with the trade unions. NOHSC clearly owes its genesis not so much to the fertile imagination of the accord partners but to the authors of the Robens report published in the United Kingdom in 1972 and the subsequent legislation enacted by the Conservative Heath Government. Robens recommended statute law spelling out general duties of employers which in turn would be supported or fleshed out by a system of regulations and non-statutory codes of practice. The report also recommended that various health and safety agencies be unified into a single autonomous administrative organisation with a comprehensive range of powers and functions. </PARA>
<PARA> Occupational health and safety legislation enacted by the States and the Commonwealth in the last decade and a half has clearly been modelled on the Robens concept of industrial self-regulation with, as one commentator suggests, `a few antipodean adaptations to take account of federalism'. So much of the accord has now been shown as myth that we need hardly be surprised that one more aspect of it is now debunked. Clearly, there has been a huge need for a thorough overhaul of occupational health and safety practice. </PARA>
<PARA> Only this month we have had a statement from the Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Peter Morris) about the appallingly high rate of workplace deaths in Australia. The Minister has told us that each week, on average, eight Australians are fatally injured at work and 6,000 suffer injuries for which they are compensated. Overall, the annual cost of workplace deaths and injuries, including compensation, lost production, retraining and welfare, is about $9,600m. </PARA>
<PARA> Mining and quarry workers are nearly nine times more likely to be killed at work than the average Australian worker. Transport and rural occupations are also among the most dangerous jobs. Figures cited by the Minister last year put the fatal injury rate at work in Australia at about 77 deaths per million workers. That compares with a rate in Sweden of 22; in Japan of 20; and in the United States of America of 37. While the rate seems to have dropped back, on the latest figures, to about 61 deaths per million workers, it is still far above the rate for comparable countries. </PARA>
<PARA> While I am on the topic of deaths and injuries of workers, I am conscious of the fact that workers usually referred to in this context are those in the paid work force who are covered by compulsory insurance schemes. Seeing that the Government is now addressing women's issues, at this hour, when it realises that it has not got the women's vote, I ask: What attention is being paid to the many unpaid workers who labour in their homes for the benefit not just of their families but also of the nation? What advice are they being given about safe manual handling practices or about the proper use and storage of hazardous chemicals? The Insurance Council of Australia in its February 1989 bulletin has issued a warning about homemade chemical cocktails. The title of that article is `They can kill'. It refers to typical items such as chlorine for pools and its volatility, solvents in the home and other substances that can place women who work in the home at great risk. This includes not only women but also their families. How effective is the NOHSC in fulfilling its charter to promote an awareness of issues relevant to occupational health and safety among the women-for by and large they are women-who work without wages and workers compensation in their own homes? I hope that we will see the Commission in its new form addressing that issue. </PARA>
<PARA> It is beyond doubt, from the statistics cited above, that occupational health and safety has been an area overdue for reform. In October 1984 the Government established a tripartite National Occupational Health and Safety Commission on a non-statutory basis, pending legislation for its creation as a statutory authority. The required legislation was introduced into the Parliament by Minister Willis on 23 April 1985 and, despite Opposition objections, passed the Senate on 16 May. Royal assent was received on 27 May. However-honourable senators might just note this, given the importance of occupational health and safety-the Act was not proclaimed until 20 December 1985. </PARA>
<PARA> When the establishing legislation for the NOHSC was introduced, the Opposition took exception to the unwieldy nature of the bureaucracy surrounding this reform and the duplication of State instrumentalities and commented on the singular lack of success of previous initiatives in this area. As my colleague Senator MacGibbon noted at the time:</PARA>
<PARA>We are dealing with human relations. Human nature simply cannot be confined or controlled by legislation. It does not matter how draconian the legislation is. </PARA>
<PARA>On 17 April 1986 the national Commission was launched officially by the Minister at a ceremony in Canberra when it was announced that it would be adopting the name Worksafe Australia. By late 1987 earlier criticisms made in anticipation of the Commission being given statutory backing were being amplified and echoed by a number of commentators. Jack Waterford writing in the Canberra Times began a detailed piece on NOHSC with the following remarks:</PARA>
<PARA>Worksafe Australia-supposed custodian of Australian occupational health and safety-is by some accounts in total crisis. </PARA>
<PARA> Three years after its establishment, it is said not only to have failed to meet its objectives of developing a national strategy for improving occupational health and safety, but to have become a floundering bureaucracy four times as large as it was ever intended, with appalling staff morale, high rates of absenteeism, sick leave and staff turnover, and with a very poor reputation out in the workplace. </PARA>
<PARA>I wonder about the occupational health of the staff working for the Commission. In the Age newspaper today there were details about mergers being imposed on universities in Victoria. I wonder what will happen to the health of academics and administrators within our Australian universities as a result of their occupations. Perhaps the Commission needs to address that problem. We talk about occupational health in industries in which people lift and handle things. We ought to talk also about stress brought on by this Government in certain occupations and the effects on health. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Waterford added that the bureaucratisation of the Commission had meant that its scientific and technical areas had been starved of resources whilst tripartite control led to a lack of accountability. Another commentator, David Biggins, writing in the Current Affairs Bulletin of August 1987 argued:</PARA>
<PARA>All the appointees to the Commission are `peak council' nominees, their accountability to the grass roots remote. Clear lines of communication-in both directions-have not been set up. The Commission's structure is unlikely to encourage worker participation. </PARA>
<PARA>Speaking of the Commission he said:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . has not indicated how information will be disseminated to the shop floor. What should be a major priority appears to be slipping away. </PARA>
<PARA> Similarly, the US practice of using the law to bring government instrumentalities under critical public scrutiny has not been much used in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA>His argument continued:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . the National Institute of Occupational Health and Safety . . . appears to be falling into the pattern of a typical research institute with little regard to workplace origins of occupational health issues. The emphasis is shifting to research rather than the provision of information. </PARA>
<PARA>On the practical point, the Commission draft code on Safe Manual Handling released in 1987-which many Government members would wish to forget-was criticised heavily by industry, Senator Button, Senator Walsh and the Government's Business Regulation Review Unit. The code suggested that manual handling of 16 kilogram weights be restricted and that any item weighing more than 34 kilograms be banned from being lifted by any person-male or female. Taken to its absurd limits this would have prevented Australia's 164 million sheep from being shorn, or indeed many sick Australians from being nursed. That brings us back to the Bill we are debating today. </PARA>
<PARA> The then Minister for Industrial Relations, Ralph Willis, when introducing this Bill in the other place mentioned that the 1984 interim Commission had recommended to the Government that the work of the Commission should be reviewed after four years to ensure that its operations were in accord with its legislative brief. I note that this, and much of that speech, was omitted when Senator Bolkus was obliged to read the second reading speech on introducing the Bill into this chamber, as he was refused leave to incorporate the speech in Hansard. So much for Senator Bolkus reading the second reading speech! Mr Willis put a fine gloss on the real state of affairs when he said:</PARA>
<PARA>Accordingly in September last year I decided to bring forward the review by one year and appointed a former secretary of the Commonwealth Department of Health, Mr Bernie McKay, to conduct it. </PARA>
<PARA>Mr McKay's report findings were released by the Minister on 3 March 1988. The report was critical of most aspects of Worksafe's activities and recommended 34 ways in which NOHSC could be improved. The report's findings may have also prompted the resignation of Mr Brassil, the Commission's first Chairman. To quote Rod Campbell in the Canberra Times:</PARA>
<PARA>Mr McKay's report was considered by the Commission on Monday. Mr Brassil, its Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Worksafe, resigned the same day. Mr Brassil said yesterday he was retiring from both positions in the next few days for health reasons-</PARA>
<PARA>it seems rather ironical that he was retiring for health reasons from the National Occupational Health and Safety Commission-</PARA>
<PARA>but hoped to be able to take up a part time government appointment. </PARA>
<PARA>According to Mr Rod Campbell, Mr Brassil agreed with the main thrust of Mr McKay's report and said that many of its proposals were the same as those he had been promoting. The Campbell article continues:</PARA>
<PARA>He said he did not want to make adverse comments on the report but felt it contained some inconsistencies and mistakes, particularly relating to claims that Worksafe had failed to properly develop a program of strategies and priorities. </PARA>
<PARA>Among the most significant criticisms of Worksafe made by Mr McKay were:</PARA>
<PARA>An overall lack of progress in its first two years of operation, requiring immediate structural and organisational changes. </PARA>
<PARA>Inadequate progress in heightening public awareness of occupational health and safety matters and developing strategies and priorities. </PARA>
<PARA>Inadequate co-ordination of occupational health and safety, particularly between the States and Commonwealth departments. </PARA>
<PARA>Inadequate development of standards, information and education programs and research activities, and of the National Institute of Occupational Health and Safety. </PARA>
<PARA>Inadequate representation of women on the Commission and its committees. </PARA>
<PARA>That is an indictment which I think Senator Reynolds should be here to hear. The criticisms continued:</PARA>
<PARA>Communications problems between Worksafe and Mr Willis and his Department-</PARA>
<PARA>although some of the blame was levelled at the latter two-</PARA>
<PARA>A rigid adherence to tripartite principles at all levels of activity. </PARA>
<PARA>The negative impact of a public service model organisation on its activities. </PARA>
<PARA>That is a litany of criticisms, a list of problems that the Government ought to have been able to pick up well before we got so far into the business of this very vital Commission. As I outlined earlier, the Bill presently before the Senate reflects some but not all of the recommendations of the McKay report. Additionally, these structural changes are to be backed by changed administrative procedures within NOHSC. Opposition senators, through Estimates Committee A, will certainly pay close attention to progress on implementing the following recommendations of the McKay report. The ones on which we will concentrate in detail are:</PARA>
<PARA>That a review of the corporate services and support functions of the Commission should be undertaken with a view to possible rationalisation of some of these with those of the Department-</PARA>
<PARA>that was recommendation 5-</PARA>
<PARA>That expertise rather than tripartism should be the principal criterion by which membership of committees and working parties is derived-</PARA>
<PARA>that was recommendation 7-</PARA>
<PARA>That the Commission gave high priority to its co-ordination role and in this respect prepare an inventory of activities in each State which relate to its priorities and strategies-</PARA>
<PARA>recommendation 10-</PARA>
<PARA>That all existing committees and working parties be critically reviewed with a view to their abolition and only retained where no alternative arrangement is possible-</PARA>
<PARA>recommendation 21-</PARA>
<PARA>That the Commission undertake the changed role proposed in the McKay report within existing resources-</PARA>
<PARA>recommendation 24-</PARA>
<PARA>That grants made to the ACTU and CAI for training purposes should be made by the Minister and such grants should be administered by the Department rather than the Commission-</PARA>
<PARA>recommendation 30-</PARA>
<PARA>That an independent review of basic training needs in occupational health and safety be undertaken to determine future requirements and prepare delivery arrangements-</PARA>
<PARA>that was recommendation 32. </PARA>
<PARA>I emphasise again that Opposition senators will address those issues and ask questions in the Senate Estimates committees to ensure that the McKay report is not yet another report that is just shelved. Despite claims that progress is being made, as recently as November 1988 the Commission was criticised in the report of Senate Estimates Committee A for allowing an officer domiciled in Canberra to commute each week to Sydney at public expense for 21 months even though the officer had been given compulsory notice of transfer. </PARA>
<PARA> During 1987-88 the Commission operated under the four programs of prevention, standards, human resource development and corporate services. The experience gained during that year has made the Commission decide to operate under just two programs in 1988-89-knowledge and prevention and corporate services. While it is pleasing to note that the proportions of staff between the two programs have changed since last year when there were 70 staff in corporate services to the 159 in knowledge and prevention, the ratio still seems to be too high at the 1988-89 estimate of 59 staff in corporate services to 170 in knowledge and prevention. Although the Opposition supports the National Occupational Health and Safety Commission Bill 1988, the Government can be sure that Opposition senators--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;No, I am not making a personal explanation at all. I do not feel the need to do that, as do some Opposition senators from time to time-like every day. Let me make it clear from the outset that the Treasurer's criticisms have been made in response to some of the more fanciful proposals put forward to increase private savings, including some of those put forward by the Opposition. I certainly agree with the Treasurer that there are no quick fix proposals that will merely create avenues for tax minimisation and undermine public savings. I have never said anything which could be construed as support for those quick fix proposals.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There are three components of aggregate savings-household, government and gross business savings. The Government has directly sought to increase aggregate savings by increasing the level of public savings to historically high levels. Regardless of whether Senator Stone agrees with the adjective or not, responsible fiscal policy on our part has meant that the total net public sector borrowing requirement is now zero. This financial year's Commonwealth Budget will have a surplus approaching 2 per cent of gross domestic product (GDP). Gross business savings as a proportion of GDP remain at a healthy level. Household savings have declined in recent years, and this was a concern I raised recently. Any proposals to increase household savings would need to be on a revenue-neutral basis, as far as the Government is concerned, because of the effects on the other elements of aggregate savings.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think part of the question was left out: `or the Minister for Foreign Affairs'. This is not going to turn Question Time into a personal explanation period. However, given the opportunism of yesterday's motion by Senator Puplick and the actions of the shadow Minister, it is a classic example of where one erroneous press report is latched onto by members of the Opposition, no transcript is checked, and then extended into a straw man that they subsequently knock down. This is why this Opposition, with its shallowness, is not going to win future elections, because it is just a pathetic approach. I was asked a specific question in Hong Kong alone: Had this year's application rate shown a decline over the previous year? I said no, it had not. That is a fact. What people overlook, of course, is that year by year our application rate from Hong Kong had been doubling and certainly in this year's program that anticipation existed. Anyone who visits Hong Kong would clearly know that one of the major issues running there is whether Australia in future will discriminate against immigrants from Hong Kong.</PARA></TALK.START>

But that would easily meet the threat to the program that the Prime Minister alluded to of $350m. The program does have difficulties, but I want to stress too in fairness that the Asian migration debate is one of the factors operating in the business migration area. A second factor is competition from New Zealand and Canada, which have far less rigorous requirements, not only in monetary amounts but in character checks, et cetera. A third factor-maybe only until last week, not this week-was the fact that an appreciating dollar in Australia made it harder for people to meet the requirements. So there are three elements running through this that all have to be addressed. Those opposite can make as much noise as they like.

<PARA> The business migration program this year has suffered, and I believe that the program next year will suffer. There are other things we can do. We can tinker around the edges with the requirements to ease them slightly-not ever to get to the level of New Zealand and Canada, because I think that they are economy class schemes and we are running a first class scheme. But to have that statement that I made in Hong Kong, that there had not been a decline from one year to another, interpreted as being in conflict with the Prime Minister's views is totally and absolutely wrong. As I say, we anticipated, and no-one challenged the figures. We have been doubling the business migration program year on year. That has flattened out to nothing.</PARA>
<PARA> I also went on to say in Hong Kong-it was not reported here-that the gap between the first approach and development of business migration applications by business migration agents and their lodging in our office is quite often 10 to 12 months.

The response by Mr Cadman was equally shabby because he checked none of the facts.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="1H4">Senator HAINES</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I refer the Minister representing the Minister for Community Services and Health to a decision made by the Government in September 1987 to end the monopoly production of certain drugs when they had come to the end of their patent life. This decision involved a requirement that the original sole manufacturer set a price for the drug that was within 20c of the price charged by new manufacturers of a similar drug, or face the delisting of their product from 1 April this year. I ask the Minister why the Government is refusing to immediately relist those pharmaceutical products made by drug companies which first refused, but have now agreed, to the pricing requirement? Is the Government aware that its plan to punish those nine companies for not agreeing immediately to the 20c differential by delaying the relisting to 1 August 1989 could have severe repercussions on consumers? Is the Government aware of the problems facing patients and their doctors if, for that four-month period-that is, between the delisting time of 1 April 1989 and the relisting schedule time of 1 August 1989-patients are taken off the drug or provided with excessive quantities of or repeat prescriptions for the drug, or changed to a generically similar but possibly not identical drug? Finally, in the interests of consumers, their medical practitioners and pharmacists, will the Government abandon its plan to hold off the relisting of the currently delisted drugs until 1 August 1989 and relist the relevant drugs immediately?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RF4">Senator COOK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think that that question had about two `am I awares'-am I aware that we may have punished pharmaceutical companies, and am I aware that we may have done something to injure patients? I am not aware of those things because, if the brief which I just happen to have about me is correct, then those things will not occur.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Let me just go to the details that I can advise the honourable senator of in respect of this question she has raised. The Government asked pharmaceutical companies to lower prices on some drugs where there were cheaper alternative brands available under the pharmaceutical benefits scheme (PBS). The generic drug initiative is part of an industry package aimed at boosting the overall growth of Australia's pharmaceutical drug industry. The package includes longer patient terms for new drugs and price increases for drug companies prepared to invest in Australian manufacturing, drug research and export. To partly offset the cost of the package the generic drug initiative was introduced. Most companies agreed to lower their prices, but a few declined, preferring to withdraw their brands from the pharmaceutical benefits scheme. As a consequence of that action of the drug companies 12 brands were withdrawn from the PBS and that will take effect from 1 April this year, as Senator Haines has said. It must be stressed that in every case alternative brands which have identical active ingredients to the deleted brands will continue to be available through the PBS and there is no reason why patients should therefore be disadvantaged. Patients will have to ask their doctors, however, to prescribe the equivalent drug brand remaining on the pharmaceutical benefits schedule if they wish to obtain subsidised medication from 1 April. Alternative suppliers were advised in September 1988 that it would be necessary for them to supply the full PBS demand from 1 April 1989. These suppliers required a lead time of approximately six months to arrange material supplies, equipment and storage to be able to fulfil the commitment to supply the full demand. So they had notice of about seven or so months and they required a lead time of six months.</PARA>
<PARA> In some cases manufacturers of the delisted brands-this is the first `am I aware' I think the honourable senator has referred to me-have now changed their minds and want to reduce their prices and stay on the list. Unfortunately for them it is too late. The alternative suppliers have already manufactured large stocks of these drugs and would be severely disadvantaged if the Government agreed to relist the originator brands earlier than August of 1989. So if we are talking about punishing people that is a totally unfair complexion to cast on this. If we were to punish anyone by changing direction it would be those who agreed to manufacture drugs to replace those drugs that have been de-listed. In order to ensure a reliable supply of these important drugs, especially in the face of vacillation by the major companies, the Government had to give a commitment to the alternative suppliers that the de-listed brands would not be re-listed for at least four months. So I think the honourable senator's two `am I aware' questions are not fair. They cast a wrong complexion. Patients' interests are protected as are the interests of the companies that have cooperated in this scheme.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am not an intractable waste. However, there is 11,000 tonnes of this stuff in Australia and, unfortunately, 8,000 tonnes of that is stored at Botany in the heart of the Sydney metropolitan area. The polychlorinated biphenyls and the hexachlorobenzenes are pretty awful so we have to do something about them. Unfortunately, for too long governments have run away from the problem, given that it is unlikely that too many communities would welcome any high temperature facility. However, the Victorian and New South Wales governments agreed with the Commonwealth on the need to establish a task force to try to come to grips with the problem. The task force reported in the middle of last year. It made a number of recommendations which have been accepted by the Ministers from the three States. I think the most important of the recommendations was that, quite apart from building a facility, whatever we were to do in the future the main priority had to be to minimise the waste that we produce. We are now looking at ways and means of doing that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> A facility will be built to destroy and dispose of all the intractable wastes that are stored and that are being produced in south-eastern Australia; the facility will be government-owned and I think that, too, is important; and a community based committee will be established to monitor the performance of the facility. Obviously, given the problems that such a facility could possibly bring, that is important. There is a commitment on the part of the three governments to ensure that only the most advanced technology is used in such a facility.</PARA>
<PARA> Late last year I had a further discussion with Mr Moore, the New South Wales Minister for Environment. It was his attitude and that of his Government that, if such a facility were to be built, given that most of these intractable wastes are produced and stored in New South Wales, the facility should also be there. That is a position with which I wholeheartedly agree. The task force is currently working on sites in New South Wales alone and a report on a preferred site will be available later in the year. I shall inform Senator Zakharov and the Senate as soon as that announcement has been made.</PARA>

In fact, our citizenship ceremonies could not take place without the broad support of local government around the country. This year, over the Australia Day weekend, some 7,000 residents took up citizenship. Two hundred local councils were involved in that ceremony. Obviously, throughout the country local government-mayors, aldermen and staff-is putting a great deal of effort into citizenship ceremonies and giving great support to the Federal Government in this regard. Clearly, in the Year of Citizenship, as declared by the Prime Minister last year, it is important that local government receive some recognition and support for the very important role that it plays.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I take this opportunity to announce that we will be undertaking a number of special projects with a number of local councils throughout the country to enhance and to recognise the work that has been done in relation to citizenship ceremonies. I will run through the councils that have been selected by virtue of their percentages of non-citizens. In New South Wales, Fairfield Council has 21.5 per cent of non-citizens; Randwick Council has 19.4 per cent; Wollongong Council has 15.8 per cent; and Warringah Council has 14.8 per cent. In Victoria, we selected Sunshine, Springvale and Broadmeadows; in Queensland, Brisbane and Mount Isa; in South Australia, Salisbury; in Western Australia, Wanneroo; in Tasmania, Hobart, Glenorchy, Clarence and Kingborough; and in the Northern Territory, Darwin and Palmerston. I would be happy to table this list for the benefit of honourable senators.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As I was saying, the inadequacy of poverty lines is something that this Government has recognised. Senator Chaney also recognised it when he was Minister for Social Security because neither this Government nor the previous Government has endorsed the concept of poverty lines as an indicator. In government we are addressing two basic issues in this area. The first is to ascertain where child poverty exists, not by some arbitrary total figure or some value-ridden dollar measure of poverty, but to locate the real areas of hardship for children so that programs can be directed to those children. That is what we have done with family allowance supplement, the child support scheme and so on. In fact, it should be noted-and this goes very much to the point of Senator MacGibbon's question-that at the end of January 1989 almost 300,000 children were benefiting from this Government's programs under the family allowance supplement scheme.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The second question for governments to answer is where the areas of need are and how to address them with the adequate degree of support. In this respect I should point out that the Government has used as the most appropriate response to this problem the establishment of benchmarks for adequacy of 15 per cent and 20 per cent of married rate pensions. Those are the bench-marks mentioned by the Prime Minister in 1987 and they are the same benchmarks that we have repeated we will achieve by 1990.</PARA>
<PARA> In conclusion, I mention the fact that we have benefited almost 300,000 children-at least 125,000 families-by measures addressed specifically to those areas of need. I should also point out that in our six years of government we have addressed the problem by increasing payments in every year of that period. I ask the Senate and the Australian public to compare our record with one measly increase in seven years by the Opposition when it was in government.</PARA>

On this occasion Mrs Chambers objected to the election result in Ballarat South, where she lost by 102 votes. She followed the normal Liberal Party modus operandi and lodged some generalised objections, none of which had substance, then submitted to the court that it should go on a `fishing expedition' all the way through the records to try to find the evidence. That was never the original intent of the Victorian Act nor would it be the intention of the Federal Act. Not that that process should be condemned-I think that in the long term it might be desirable provided that other parts of the Electoral Act are amended to allow disputed votes to be counted. That would achieve some balance. I suspect that at both Federal and State levels, through judgments and judges, one area has been liberalised and the other has not.

We know that because the cheque drawn on the challengers was a Liberal Party cheque, not Mrs Chambers's cheque. Her criticism is that the Electoral Commission did not respond quickly enough. I argue, having now read the facts, that the Electoral Commission responded very quickly. It needed to delay for eight days to take legal advice on some cases. It had to check that the challenges by Mrs Chambers and the Liberal Party were not duplicating existing challenges. In fact, it put on two extra staff in Ballarat, which is a Federal electorate, and one person in Burke, to resolve these matters.</PARA>
<PARA> We were all party to the legislation. We all voted unanimously to go through proper procedures to take objections on the roll and not just, on the first rumour, rip someone's name off the roll. Letters have to be written and objection notices and final notices have to be sent out. All of that is under way. Even if the Electoral Commission, by some fluke, could have completed this process between 18 December and 3 February, none of it would have been relevant to Mrs Chambers's appeal to the Court of Disputed Returns, which says explicitly that one cannot challenge the roll. It is yet another case of the loser whingeing. It is part of Opposition mentality that if it loses an election it cannot be because of the merits of the candidate or deficient policies; it must be because there is something wrong with the electoral system. We have been there and done that. The Opposition is there and is doing that. As long as it does it, it has an Opposition mentality. Why does it not try to get out of it and start looking towards government?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Is the Minister representing the Minister for Employment, Education and Training aware of the inability of many rural families to qualify for isolated children's assistance under the assets test guidelines? In view of the fact that the great majority of Australians already have the opportunity to send their children to conveniently located neighbourhood schools, enjoy good roads and have access to modern conveniences that are not provided to isolated families, when will this Government recognise that, by the very nature of farming, liquidity is a major problem and many farmers do not have the means to afford the cost of schooling? Is there any possibility of the Government reviewing the assets test guidelines to enable more rural families to qualify for isolated children's assistance?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="TJ4">Senator WALSH</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This is another free kick in the square. As to the additional allowance for isolated children, everybody gets $1,000, in round figures, and, again in round figures, about $2,000 is available subject to an income test which has always been there and is now subject to an assets test. The people on whose behalf Senator Bjelke-Petersen is asking the question, whom she depicts as disadvantaged people, are by definition people who have net assets in excess of $600,000 in addition to the house and curtilage. The National Party's definition of a disadvantaged person is somebody who has net assets in excess of $600,000 plus the house in which he lives. I suppose somebody from the National Party who has been dipping his fist into the public till for the past decade or so might have a different perception from that of the great majority of Australians of what is disadvantaged. If one had access to the public till through one's association with the Queensland National Party, one would probably think $600,000 was not very much. However, I can assure Senator Bjelke-Petersen that the great majority of Australians have no aspirations, no belief, no expectation that they will ever accumulate assets of that size as well as the house they own. Most Australians never accumulate anything significant beyond the house they own. So the people about whom she speaks are not disadvantaged.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator Bjelke-Petersen says also that every Queensland country school teacher, every Queensland country police officer-even if he or she does not have a second income in the household-every household in the country in Queensland which has two persons employed, as well as just about every tradesman, should be denied the additional allowance because of the income test, but that people who have assets in excess of $600,000 should continue to get it. That is not a proposition which this Government will pick up. If there is scope for any additional money to be paid under this program, I can confidently assure the Senate that it will be devoted towards either increasing the basic allowances or easing the quite stringent income test which applies to this program. It will not be shunted off in the way the Queensland National Party would have it shunted off; that is, into providing extra hand-outs for people with net assets in excess of $600,000 as well as the house that they own while households on an income of $24,000, which is less than average male adult male weekly earnings, are not entitled to it because of an income test.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="TJ4">Senator WALSH</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It has been apparent for some time that the administration of natural disaster relief arrangements and probably the rural adjustment scheme in Queensland is like the administration of just about everything else in Queensland. From time to time they have been administered in ways that have a familiar ring about them, such as when the Fitzgerald Commission of Inquiry into Possible Illegal Activities and Associated Police Misconduct started delving into Queensland administration. Indeed, there have been cases in the past when natural disaster relief funds were regarded by the people who administered them and the government which oversaw them, and sometimes issued directions to them, as a sort of National Party slush fund to be distributed to National Party toadies and apparatchiks whenever the people who controlled the fund or controlled the controllers of the fund felt like doing so.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I have seen the report in the Brisbane Courier-Mail. The report says that one farmer received NDRA funds following Cyclone Winifred and used them to extend the farm size and purchase a cane quota, and that a dairy farmer used the funds allegedly given for drought relief to purchase an increased milk quota. Leaving aside the question of whether a milk quota ought to have a market value per se-I would be interested to hear Senator Stone's views on that at some time-if the reports are correct there is absolutely no doubt that NDRA funds have been misused. Under the rural adjustment scheme, in certain circumstances funds could be used for such purposes, but there is no way that NDRA funds could be used for that purpose within the guidelines.</PARA>
<PARA> I will ask the Department of Finance to endeavour to check out the facts behind these reports. Prima facie, there is a case because we know that in the past there have been similar misallocations of public money by Queensland authorities. We have sought assurances from the Queensland Government that it will clean up its act. If this latest report is verified by the subsequent inquiry, the time has come to consider suspending NDRA funding payments to Queensland. If the Commonwealth is put in a position where it takes that fairly drastic step, that is an action which is attributable, should be attributed and will be attributed to the maladministration of the Queensland authorities which has been going on over many years and upon which it would appear they have taken no effective action. I suggest that if Mr Ahern is committed to ending corruption, he should take some effective steps to clear up this matter.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister representing the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs. I refer to the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody, which used to be known as the Muirhead inquiry. Has the Minister seen research from the staff of this inquiry which establishes that the rate of Aboriginal deaths in custody is in fact lower than the average for all people in custody? Does this not undermine the basis for this special, racially based inquiry? How much has this inquiry cost so far? If it is to continue, should it not deal with the death rate, and the reasons for the deaths for all detainees, not just one racial group? Or, if such an inquiry is not thought necessary or appropriate, and there is some special and understandable concern about the number of Aborigines in custody, should not the inquiry concentrate on why so many Aborigines are in custody, and the extent to which government programs are contributing to these very high numbers?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="NJ4">Senator TATE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is a fact that when I made available to the Australian community the interim report of Mr Justice Muirhead resulting from his inquiry to the stage it had reached at the end of 1988 into Aboriginal deaths in custody, as requested by Federal and State governments and the Territory Government-in other words, supported by all jurisdictions-some very interesting figures were to be found in the appendices. In summary, as I recall, it appeared that even in police custody Aborigines are no more likely to die than are non-Aboriginals. The real problem lies in the fact that far more Aborigines are taken into custody than should be the case. That is the real point which needs to be tackled as a policy matter.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> On the question of the numbers of Aboriginals in custody, I am told that an Aboriginal is 20 times more likely to be arrested than is a non-Aboriginal-and that leads to being put into a police lock-up and then perhaps followed by further detention. The Australian Police Ministers Council has been considering that problem since this matter erupted into public prominence in late 1987. As a result of the Muirhead Royal Commission's interim report, we now have available to us many recommendations, which in large measure coincide with the thoughts of the Police Ministers, as to how, firstly, one might avoid the taking of Aboriginal persons into custody in the great numbers in which they are. That would also involve the Attorneys-General of the various jurisdictions agreeing to a program of, for example, decriminalising simple drunkenness. Other measures that need to be taken into account are as to how police lock-ups are set up and conducted, and as to how supervision of those within them is conducted. All these matters will be the subject of an interdisciplinary discussion between Police Ministers, Aboriginal Ministers, Health Ministers and Corrective Service Ministers in Burnie, in the north-west of Tasmania, in a meeting convened by the Hon. Roger Groom and to be held in the week before Easter. On that occasion, spread over 2 1/2 days, various matters will be discussed, and we will take the opportunity in a comprehensive way to look at various social issues to which Senator Hamer rightly alluded in his question. Those issues need to be addressed if we are to prevent great numbers of Aboriginals being taken into custody and the subsequent deaths that do occur.</PARA>
<PARA> It is also important to recognise that the Muirhead Royal Commission, although focused on and inquiring into Aboriginal deaths in custody, will in its recommendations, if implemented, have great beneficial effects for non-Aboriginal Australians who also find themselves being taken into custody. I believe that point needs to be emphasised. The whole Australian community will benefit from the recommendations of Mr Justice Muirhead. I refer, for example, to the conduct of coronial inquiries, the way in which certain offences should be taken off the statute books, the way in which police cells and lock-ups should be constructed, the way in which police themselves should be trained and made more sensitive to the possibility of depression induced by overconsumption of alcohol, and all these things. I believe that many Australians will benefit from this series of recommendations. That is not to say that as a nation we should not continue to undertake an investigation into the particular phenomenon of Aboriginal deaths in custody which came into special prominence in late 1987.</PARA>

I would be concerned about the situation were the facts as outlined by Senator Powell true. However, they are not. First, three of the five members of the Australian Capital Territory Consumer Affairs Council had their terms expire on 11 December last year and the resignation of one other member has been received since. There are four of the five who have gone. In view of the fact that an election is coming up literally in a matter of days, it would seem to be a bit pointless for the Commonwealth to move in when a newly elected Australian Capital Territory Government can consider the matter very soon. I do not think the role of the Council has been understood. It does not have an executive role in the consumer product safety field; rather, it has an advisory role. The executive role is in the hands of an officer who can prohibit or impose conditions on the sale and supply of goods to which the honourable senator has referred provided similar prohibitions or conditions have been imposed in another State or Territory. Unsafe consumer goods which cannot be sold elsewhere in Australia cannot therefore be dumped in the Australian Capital Territory.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In addition, the Trade Practices Act can be invoked by Senator Bolkus in his role as the Minister for Consumer Affairs to protect further the Australian Capital Territory from these goods. Senator Powell made a special reference to children's mirror glasses and water pistols. I am advised that apparently they turned up in showbags at the Royal Canberra Show. The suppliers withdrew the offending items from sale after intervention by the Bureau and neither item has been found on sale since. It is interesting that the Australian Democrats should talk about the Australian Capital Territory being a dumping ground for unsafe products, given that they have just given the Australian Capital Territory David Vigor.</PARA>

The Government knows that such measures of poverty and poverty lines should be used very carefully, if at all. Poverty lines and measures of poverty are always both arbitrary and imprecise. The Henderson poverty line, the most widely known in Australia, has never been endorsed by any government, neither this one nor the previous one. It suffers from a number of problems. Firstly, it is based on household expenditure data derived from a survey completed in New York in the 1950s. Secondly, it suffers from significant delays in updating and constant revisions resulting from national account figures. Thirdly, it suffers from being inevitably arbitrary. For these reasons measures of poverty have always been used with caution in whatever circumstances they may have been used.</PARA>

<PARA>I do not wish to address it at length now, but I say to the Minister for Consumer Affairs (Senator Bolkus) that, having sat in the Senate on many occasions when Australian Labor Party Opposition members interminably went on about the Henderson poverty line, in one sense I welcome the Minister's clear statement that the Government does not accept those lines. There are very many poverty measures. They are not, of themselves, very effective. One of my main reasons for rising to speak now is that I want to give the Minister notice that he can expect further questions on this subject. Whilst it is convenient for the Government in 1989, when it is suddenly faced with the impossibility of meeting the promise made by the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) in 1987 to adopt at last a rational approach to the vexed question of the measurement of poverty and the issue of who in the community is in poverty, how does it, therefore, intend to make judgments about the meeting of the Prime Minister's promise?</PARA>
<PARA> I do not think that the Government is in any doubt, any more than the Burdekin inquiry is in any doubt, that there is a very substantial number of children-tens of thousands, if not hundreds of thousands-who are living in hardship and who, on any fair use of the term, could be said to be living in poverty. Those children, children of tender years, who are living on the fringes of our cities without parental care or any other supervision, who are forced to steal, to beg and to prostitute themselves to live, are, on any definition that I would accept, living in poverty. I say to the Minister that it is all very well to throw up these glib statements in an election campaign, but the Opposition expects some clear answers from the Government on how it will measure its performance in this area. We expect something more than the shillyshallying we have had from the Minister over the last two days.

<PARA> Leave granted.</PARA>
<PARA> The answer read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA> Charging for international Direct Dial (IDD) calls is initiated upon receipt of an answer signal from equipment controlled by the overseas telephone carrier in the destination country. OTC applies tests in its telephone exchanges to confirm that answer signals received from overseas meet stringent technical specifications before being accepted as valid and passed to the calling party's charging equipment in the Telecom network.</PARA>
<PARA> However, when such equipment in an overseas country is faulty, a technically valid answer signal may be generated erroneously where a called party has not answered. The incidence of such false answer signals, as revealed through customer enquiry and quality of service testing, is low, and usually associated with those overseas networks which are relatively unsophisticated or poorly maintained. When detected, OTC technical staff investigate and seek to eliminate the fault in cooperation with Telecom and the overseas carrier responsible.</PARA>
<PARA> OTC applies comprehensive maintenance procedures in cooperation with overseas carriers and with Telecom to ensure that international signalling systems and switching equipment are functioning correctly. These tests show no evidence of any improper generation of false answer signals from within the OTC or Telecom networks.</PARA>
<PARA> While the technical problems are located outside Australia, OTC will investigate complaints and will give consideration to customer's call charge records which indicate suspect charging. It is not the policy of either OTC or Telecom to charge for unsuccessful calls.</PARA>

<PARA>In calling for a mini-Budget and for policy change from this Government, the motion reflects the very real desires in the Australian community for change. The desire for a change of policy from this Government is rooted in the simple fact that Australian families are suffering, that they are feeling a great deal of pressure. That pressure flows directly from the outcome of this Government's policies. The pressures flow from high taxes, extremely high interest rates and inflation; for some, a lower real wage than they were getting five years ago; and, for many, a lower real wage after taxes than they were getting five years ago. There is clear evidence of the failure of the Government's economic policies. It goes beyond the impact on individuals. The country can be seen clearly to be living beyond its means in the massive rise in foreign debt, a rise in foreign debt at a time of high commodity prices, and a clear indication that the present policy settings for Australia are unsustainable. </PARA>
<PARA> We say, therefore, that there is a need for a mini-Budget. By that we mean not just a change in the financial measures that affect our economy, but a change in all of those policies which hinder the creation of a more productive society. The truth is that we can get out of the difficulties we have as a country, the difficulties that face many Australian individuals, only if we become a more productive and wealthier country. The frightening thing about what is happening to Australia today is that we are seeing declining living standards at a time of increasing debt. Everybody knows that when they are borrowing they can temporarily increase their living standards, but we, when our debt gets higher month by month, are seeing our living standards decline. </PARA>
<PARA> I suppose the fact that the Caucus met here on Sunday is an indication of some realisation on the part of the Government that there is concern right around Australia about the policies which are being followed by the Government. The pressure which is out in the electorate and which I referred to is, I suppose, most directly caused by high interest rates over recent months. This is the most obvious symptom. It has the harshest impact on people of the Government's economic policies. When one sees that the prime business lending rate in Australia is now around 17 per cent and compares it with the rates of our competitor countries, one can see how relevant the issue is both to the broad economic health of the country and to what is happening to the people in the cities and suburbs and on the farms of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> New home buyers now face interest rates of 16 per cent. We have had a rapid growth in house prices over the last 12 months. For many young couples who are contemplating the essential activities of forming a family-having children and so on-a normal part of that activity, the owning of a house, is becoming out of their reach. Home loan repayments have risen dramatically over the course of this Government. We are told that the strategy of this Government is to tell us that things might be tough under Hawke but they were worse under Fraser. </PARA>
<PARA> When Mr Fraser lost government it took about 19 per cent or so of one's earnings to pay one's mortgage. It is now something like 30 per cent. Average home loan repayments have doubled since 1983. This is one example where the people of Australia can look back, just as they can look back at employment and unemployment, and say that things were a lot better under Mr Fraser for virtually the whole of his Government than they have been for the whole period of the Hawke Government. </PARA>
<PARA> On the question of interest rates-this matter impacts most directly on the living standards of all the people of Australia who are at the stage of their life when they are buying a house-one finds this enormous increase in the amount of their disposable income which is required to service the mortgage. As far as taxation is concerned, we have in the broad sense yet another year of record taxation and a record amount of what Australia is producing being taken as tax. To come back to the situation of the average earner, we find that his tax has increased by about 90 per cent to over $126 per week during the period of the Hawke Government. We find that the marginal tax rate-the tax rate that he pays on every extra dollar he earns-has gone from 30c to 40c in the dollar. This year the Federal Government will collect about $82 billion in taxes compared with $41 billion in 1982-83. </PARA>
<PARA> The other reason why there is hardship throughout Australia is that the tax system is not only collecting more, it is also collecting it, in many respects, more unfairly, particularly with respect to those people who have dependants. This Government has failed to adjust, at all, the concessions which are contained in the tax and social security systems for those people who have the additional cost of looking after dependants. That has been measured by the Institute of Family Studies, which has said that a couple with three children and on an income of more than $40,000 a year has no more disposable income than a single person on an income of about $24,000 a year. The fact is that the failure to adjust family allowance for all but the poorest families and the failure to adjust the dependent spouse rebate have meant that the limited tax concessions which applied and which gave some relief to people who are looking after dependants have been whittled away in value under the Hawke Government. </PARA>
<PARA> We have had a period of high inflation. Compared with other countries, our inflation rate is about twice the average rate. When one looks at the price of basic commodities for Australia such as cars, one finds they have gone up by far more than the inflation rate generally. Since May 1984 the price of a Ford Laser and a Holden Commodore has gone up by more than 70 per cent. It is no wonder that so many people feel that it is beyond their capacity to buy a car. We have had a real disposable income reduction under this Government, which has been measured and talked about a great deal by the Opposition. We have had a reduction of something like $58 a week since Labor took office. It is a figure which has never been successfully or sensibly challenged in this place or anywhere else. </PARA>
<PARA> One can sum up the sense of pressure that one gets when one is out in the suburbs by remembering the choices that now face Australians. Does one have children or does one buy a house? The reports that people are postponing having children for up to 10 years in the hope that they will be able to afford to buy a house show an extraordinary change in the structure of Australian society. Let us see what Labor members of Parliament think about it. Mr Ronald Edwards, a very energetic Australian Labor Party member of Parliament, represents the seat of Stirling in Western Australia. Just a few weeks ago he put his views down in a submission to the Australian Electoral Commission as to the redistribution of his electoral boundaries. I got that submission because it makes excellent reading and gives Mr Edwards's assessment of what is happening to the people in the suburbs in his electorate. He is talking in the submission about the estimates of population growth in different areas. He says:</PARA>
<PARA>In the light of recent interest rate and housing price rises it is likely that the growth in Mirrabooka will reach the projected figure whilst the growth in Woodvale and Kingsley may fall short of the target. This will be due to the reduction in demand that will occur at the upper end of the market. </PARA>
<PARA>He attaches figures to show that some areas have more expensive houses and others have less expensive houses. He says:</PARA>
<PARA>The point can be clearly made. If capacity to pay is reduced by reductions in real disposable income and this is coupled with rising prices and rising interests rates then the take-up rate will be lower in general. What will also happen is that demand will increase for cheaper land and houses at the expense of dearer properties. This is an economic reality that must be addressed. </PARA>
<PARA>That is Mr Edwards's view of economic reality. People will have to move to cheaper houses in his electorate of Stirling because they face rising interest rates and reductions in real disposable income. He goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . the market also skew more towards rental propositions and the Mirrabooka Homeswest rental market will play a part here. </PARA>
<PARA>In other words, what Mr Edwards, the honourable member for Stirling, is saying is that the people will face declining real income and higher interest rates; and more and more of them will have to throw themselves on the mercy of Homeswest, the State Housing Commission of Western Australia, if they are to have anywhere to live. </PARA>
<PARA> It is not surprising that people think something is wrong. They see these changes occurring to their detriment. They see them occurring at a time when the country as a whole is getting steadily more deeply into debt. Gross external debt now exceeds $121 billion, that is, more than $7,000 for every man, woman and child at a time when living standards are declining. We are borrowing more just to service existing debt. Sixty-three cents of every dollar of export income is required to service the debt and to compensate for our deteriorating competitiveness. We have a double whammy. We are getting poorer in terms of our living standards and we are amassing huge debts at the same time. </PARA>
<PARA> It is quite clear in those circumstances that the status quo is not good enough. We seek the passage of this motion of urgency this afternoon because we believe it is incumbent on the Government and is utterly necessary for Australia that there be changes of policy. When one looks at the ambitions that the Minister at the table, the Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce (Senator Button), had for Australia when he set off five or six years ago to change the face of Australia, when one looks at what has happened to productivity in this country and when one compares what is happening with respect to the productivity of Australia and what is happening with respect to the productivity of the rest of the world, one sees nothing but failure. Let me quote from Syntec. Syntec said in a very recent edition:</PARA>
<PARA>We deserve a better explanation than we have been getting from the Hawke Government on the series of shocks being received on a fairly regular basis about our external accounts position . . . It is due at least as much to the fact that Australia's unit cost of production is deteriorating so rapidly compared to our trading partners that, increasingly, it is a simple commercial proposition to get supplies from overseas. </PARA>
<PARA>No comment could reflect more obviously on the areas to which the Minister at the table, the Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce, is responsible. We have a situation in which he has done some excellent jaw-boning. He has lectured the people of Australia about the reality of the economy. He has lectured his own Government on the realities of the Australian economy but he has not achieved the policy changes which are necessary to get us out of this stagnant productivity which underlies our increasing debt and our declining living standards. </PARA>
<PARA> Put at its most simple, Australia is still living beyond its means. We have to become more productive to reverse that. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;To increase living standards we have to become more productive. What we have to do is to make changes from the approaches that have been adopted by this Government if we are to become competitive enough. What we have is this Government pursuing policies which will not assist us to get out of this bind because they will not make us more competitive. This Minister at the table has got us relying on an interest rate policy that has Australian industry paying 17 per cent interest rates when our Japanese competitors are paying under 4 per cent. He knows that the countries with which he is asking Australian industry to compete do not have to tolerate the high interest rate regime that has been imposed by the Hawke Government. The accord has consistently delivered poor labour productivity and unit labour cost figures. They are poor in that they have been in excess of those of our trading partners. We do not want low wages for the people of Australia. The mixture of government policies has to produce productivity rises which will reduce our unit labour costs, instead of increasing them. That is what our competitors are doing. Australia is not doing it under the arrangements which have the support of this Government. On that score, the accord has failed. As I said before, we are continuing to tax at a record national level.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Many things need to be done if we are to have a more productive society, if we are to change the culture-to use the Minister's words-if we are to do something about the paralysis that seems to afflict us. We have been assured by the Minister for Finance (Senator Walsh) that there is room for some further reductions in government expenditure. There has to be a continuing effort by government to trim expenditure wherever possible, thus reducing the burden and the cost of government. That must be done to assist in giving responsible tax cuts. It will also reduce the public sector's call on resources and make room for further private sector activity. Fundamental to the changes that we believe are necessary are changes to the labour market, to encourage employers and employees to agree on measures to increase productivity and output and thereby achieve the capacity to pay more realistic higher wages and at the same time to produce greater profits and encourage investment. That is not impossible. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister at the table knows that well-managed enterprises working in close tandem with the work force can achieve great productivity improvement and can break out of the economic bind which generally afflicts us. We have to have an industrial relations system which encourages rather than discourages that. We have to have an industrial relations system which at the same time ensures that the rule of law applies to the trade unions as it applies to the rest of the community. It is now time for taxation reform to reduce the overall tax burden and to provide more incentive for people to work hard and to lift the burden on families. It is central to our approach to the tax system that it is not just a matter of the gross amount of taxes that are collected. Important questions of fairness and equity need to be addressed. I have already said in this speech that under this Government the tax burden on people with dependants has increased in relative terms to the rest of the community. It cannot be fair that those Australians who are supporting a spouse and children or where the two spouses are working and supporting children have seen the terms of trade move against them as severely as they have under this Government. The total failure of the Government to acknowledge the cost of family responsibilities for all but the bottom 15 per cent of families-in income terms-is a national disgrace and something that should be addressed for social and economic reasons. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister at the table knows that there is enormous room for gain through privatisation and deregulation to increase competition. He knows that the rate of loading and unloading containers in Australia is a disgrace, compared with the rate in the rest of the world. He knows that the rate of packing and unpacking containers is a disgrace compared with the rate in the rest of the world. He knows that the cost to Australian industry of coastal shipping is a disgrace, as are numerous other areas. For example, the transport of grain is another such area. It was identified by an independent inquiry put in place by his own Government. There are gains to be made in that area. He knows that increased competition in telecommunications and in transport generally can be used to break us out of the economic bind in which we find ourselves. All these changes are practical and feasible and the only thing stopping the Government from implementing them is lack of political will. It is time that we ceased hearing from Mr Keating the reasons why things cannot be done and started hearing about the things that can and will be done to change the position. </PARA>
<PARA> I conclude by referring to a speech made by Sir Arvi Parbo just last weekend. Sir Arvi Parbo is the head of major corporations in this country, but he started life as a migrant. He gained his education and worked through the mining industry to attain the position of great influence he holds today. Few businessmen give better advice to all of us and to the country in general than Sir Arvi Parbo. He made the point in his speech that we start with the proposition that it is hard to imagine a country with more advantageous circumstances than we have. We have the ability to produce food and fibres and every mineral. We have more than adequate land, an excellent climate, no pollution problems worth speaking about, few natural disasters, no real racial problems, a literate population, freedom from terrorism, and a position as part of the fastest growing economic area in the world. Nobody can gainsay the advantages we have in Australia. The truth is that we have failed to take advantage of them; instead we stagnate as our productivity figures demonstrate. Our economy is indeed troubled, as the debt figures indicate. Last Saturday, Sir Arvi Parbo said:</PARA>
<PARA> Our basic need is for better performance. This includes working harder, but it means much more than that. It means improving our skills, removing artificial obstacles to the efficient functioning of the economy and, above all, developing a community attitude which supports and applauds achievement. It means encouraging, not discouraging, the natural desire of individuals to improve themselves. </PARA>
<PARA>In far too many areas, the policies of this Government fail to meet the simple prescription Sir Arvi Parbo gave us last weekend. We believe that changes need to be made now. We call for a mini-Budget and the accompanying policy changes which will break us out of a cycle of stagnation. </PARA>

That is, of course, true. Every year since we have been in government Senator Chaney and his mates have been up on their feet objecting to any wage increase in this country.

Those opposite walked away from the wages issue-all of them over there-and what did they get? They got a 16 per cent increase in wages in one year, 17 per cent the next. That is what they got, and Senator Stone blames the trade unions for that. The Fraser Government was incapable of handling the trade unions. That is why it got those results. It was incapable of handling trade unions, because the royal wedding was more important to the Prime Minister than the economy of Australia. That was the truth of it in those dark out-of-Africa days, where members of the Opposition all belong. That was the truth of it. It suits Senator Stone now to blame the trade union movement for that.

<PARA> I was trying to make the point that Senator Chaney said that some people in the community have suffered as a result of the economic changes which have taken place and the need to reduce the Australian standard of living in the period we have just been through. We have never run away from that issue. Senator Chaney listed a whole range of consequences of that. Then he said that we should cut government expenditure further. Where is that going to be done? The Liberal Party is peculiarly hesitant about telling us where that is going to be done. I will tell the Senate where it would be done, if the Liberal Party ever get a chance at it. It would be done in terms of social welfare benefits and things of that kind. Senator Chaney said, `These are the people who have suffered most, but we have to cut government expenditure further'. </PARA>
<PARA> He said in the course of his remarks that there should be further reductions in government expenditure but he was very coy about telling us where. He then went on to a number of other things such as needing to reduce the tax burden. As I have said, Government will be addressing this issue of the tax burden in April, not just as it relates to salary and wage earners but as it affects other people in the community. Senator Chaney went on to talk about changes to the labour market.

<PARA> Senator Chaney departed a little from his text to give me a spray about interest rates and living standards, the failure of the accord, and all those things. We have very high terms of trade at present. The incapacity of the previous Government in 1981-82 to handle that was the ruination of that Government. That will not happen to us because of the policies that we have in place, because we will produce a wages outcome this year which, consistent with the needs which Senator Chaney refers to, of better remuneration for wage earners, will also be consistent with the needs of the Australian economy in terms of handling that current account problem. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Chaney offered some sort of cursory comments about comparative figures about inflation and things like that. Senator Chaney had better catch up on some of those figures about inflation next time he makes a speech because he cannot make the same comparisons that he did last year when talking about comparative inflation rates. Have a look at the United States rate, for example. That was Senator Chaney's big figure last year. </PARA>
<PARA> I will just sum up. The question that Senator Chaney addresses is this: Some people have been aggrieved, and we understand that, by the decline of standard of living in the community. The greatest burden in the decline of standard of living in the Australian community has been borne by wage earners. It is time some of the Opposition members began to acknowledge that. That is why the Government is seeking to arrive this year at a wage-tax trade-off which will ensure increased wages and more progressive tax reductions, which will benefit lower income earners. That is why we are doing that. That is the solution which the Government is proffering to this problem in times of very difficult economic circumstances which the country is currently in. That deals, in some part, with the question of the burden. </PARA>
<PARA> The other sector of the community which Senator Chaney would like to allege has borne the burden is what might be broadly described as the welfare sector. Over a period the Government has really made an enormous contribution to the welfare sector. I want to just put two figures in Senator Chaney's mind. I am not talking about welfare when I say this. If the Opposition's policies had been followed in relation to wages, every family in Australia would be 34 per cent worse off than they are now. </PARA>

Social security supplements for children have been raised from $10 per week in March 1983, when we came into government, to $24 per week in 1988, a real increase of 60 per cent. This Government stands by its commitment to raise combined family allowance and family supplement payments to 15 per cent of the married pension rate by 1990. We have provided an increase in rent assistance to low income families. Medicare is saving families-I am not sure what the current fad over on the Opposition benches is in relation to health insurance-$21 a week.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Button concluded his contribution to this debate by stringing out for us a list of things which he claims the Government has done to benefit Australian families. The Government may well have done some of the things that he listed, but I am not sure that the impact on Australian families has been as great as he hoped, given that at the same time this Government has taken a great deal away from the same Australian families. There can be no question at all but that Senator Chaney is quite correct in his assessment of the suffering that is being undergone by a large number of ordinary Australian families. They are feeling the pinch in no uncertain terms. Interest rates are soaring, house and land prices are soaring, and the cost of ordinary household goods is increasing as government sales taxes are increased and extended. On the other hand, the price of goods has failed to fall as it should have in the past quarter with the rise of the Australian dollar because companies are profit taking presumably because they can see some hardship facing them in the near future.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As Senator Button claims, the Government has made some improvements in education payments for 16- and 17-year-olds, but it cut Austudy to 15-year-olds in their last two years of school and that affected a significant number of low income families in South Australia and Western Australia. If he does not believe this, maybe he should take some of the phone calls that I have had to take from women in tears because they were faced with the prospect of having to take a 15-year-old out of school because they had lost that $40 a week in Austudy payments purely because in South Australia the majority of students in year 11 are still aged 15, apparently unlike the case in New South Wales and Victoria, and they were being penalised for that fact. </PARA>
<PARA> Family allowances are now means tested-flying in the face of the fact that not all the money that is earned by the sole breadwinner is shared equitably with many Australian families. Pensions and benefits have been cut. The disposable income of most Australian families has been reduced over the last five years of this Labor Government. I might add that most of those damaging pieces of legislation-cuts to family allowances, taking widows off the class B widow's pension when they get to 45 years of age and putting them on unemployment benefits, cutting Austudy payments, reducing ex-service pensions, delaying the consumer price index increases -have got through this Parliament only because they had the support of the Opposition parties. So it is a bit cheeky of Senator Chaney, having contributed to the problem, to then complain about it. But it does not alter the fact that it was the Government initiatives that led to these problems. </PARA>
<PARA> Then we have that age-old problem of bracket creep, meaning that most Australian families are paying excessive tax and have been given fewer opportunities during the life of this Parliament and this Government in particular to decrease this exorbitant amount of tax through tax deductions. Over the past decade both governments have cut concessions to ordinary Australian families. At the same time, they have increased assistance to businesses, often with no resultant increase in productivity or employment so that some companies in this country are proudly asserting, as Alan Bond did last year to the Australian Financial Review, that they will be paying no tax at all in the next financial year. Yet many pensioners in this country are paying in tax 50c out of every dollar they earn over the prescribed amount. </PARA>
<PARA> We allow the continuation of tax concessions to businesses that reduce their contributions to Consolidated Revenue to nil. Some of the biggest companies in this country are at fault. Some of the biggest companies in this country are paying less than 10c in the dollar in tax, some of them less than one cent in the dollar and companies such as the Bond Corporation, no tax at all in the financial year 1989-90. On top of this, this Government, with the support of the Opposition parties, saw fit to cut nominal company tax by 20 per cent and when we moved last year to have that cut held over until personal tax cuts were introduced at the same level we got no support at all. What has happened is what we predicted would happen then-that the Government would come into the new year claiming that economic conditions were so bad that it could not see its way clear to offering the promised personal tax cuts. So while companies, many of whom are paying no tax or very little tax, are benefiting from a 20 per cent tax cut, Australian families look like benefiting very little indeed in those areas. </PARA>
<PARA> In the meantime the Treasurer (Mr Keating) is complaining that Australians are not saving and, worse, that they are spending as if there will be no tomorrow and they are spending largely on imported goods. We might well ask, `Why are they spending on imported goods?'. Of course, the answer is that our manufacturing sector has not got off its butt sufficiently in the last couple of decades to be producing the sorts of export items that we need to produce a decent balance of trade figure, nor has it gone into any innovative areas where import replacement items are being produced. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="1H4">Senator HAINES</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Stone asks whether Mr Keating was wearing his Italian suit at the time. The answer is probably yes since I understand that that is all he wears. Of course, that raises the question of what we are doing in this country with regard to decreasing the consumption of luxury imported goods. The answer is: very little indeed. The Government should impede the purchase of a significant proportion of luxury imported goods simply by placing a luxury tax on things such as Rolls Royces, imported Italian suits, furs and so on. But it is not prepared to offend its wealthy backers in this way and it continues to penalise ordinary Australian families by cutting back on their benefits, complaining at the same time that those same families are refusing to put their money in the bank. That is hardly surprising. If they put their money in the bank they lose most of the interest they earn in tax. Senator Chaney was talking earlier about the need to bring questions of fairness and equity into the open so that we can address them. But if we look at the situation of Australian families vis-a-vis that of Australian companies we find that the tax concessions offered to the latter far exceed those applying to Australian families. I agree with Senator Chaney; we need to do something about introducing a bit of fairness and equity into the system. That means looking at why Australian families are not saving and what we can do to encourage them to save. Mr Keating says that, while Australians are spending as they are on imported goods, we have a grossly distorted balance of trade figure and that this is causing economic problems in the country. This will lead to harsher conditions being applied to those same families that are already feeling the brunt of this Government's policies.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> One of the quickest ways of encouraging people to save is to reduce the tax burden that they face if they do save. I hope that the Opposition's expression of concern about the need for Australian families to own their own homes will lead it to support a couple of the legislative measures that we have introduced this week; namely, to allow some tax concession with regard to the interest paid on home loans, which was something that existed during the last years of the Fraser Government when Mr Howard was Treasurer, and to give a tax exemption to at least part of the interest that people earn in savings accounts that they place with banks, building societies and other organisations that lend for housing. </PARA>
<PARA> As Senator Chaney said, something has to be done to balance the equation that is distorting this country's economy. Apparently, we allow unlimited foreign investment in this country in a way which does not happen anywhere else. That foreign investment includes a capacity for people from outside this country to buy Australian real estate. Inevitably, that pushes up the price of land and housing, putting it further beyond the reach of Australian families, even assuming that they can afford the burgeoning interest rates. We have a government and an opposition that support a deregulated financial market and that, in turn, with reduced savings means increased pressure through people wishing to borrow. </PARA>
<PARA> The business community is not too worried about interest rates. After all, if it borrows at 16 per cent, because it can write it off against its tax, it is paying an effective rate of 8 per cent, or at least it was when nominal company tax was 49c in the dollar. It is getting a slightly less good deal now; nevertheless, it is paying significantly less than the 16 per cent at which it is borrowing. An individual who borrows to buy a home or a home unit which he or she intends to rent to somebody else also gets that capacity to negatively gear, to write off the interest payment against his or her tax. The only people in Australia who do not get that sort of tax concession at the moment are those people who are borrowing money to put a roof over their heads and their children's heads. I think it is important that we follow the example of both Britain and the United States of America so that some sort of tax concession on the interest on home loans is allowed to Australian families. It has not broken the back of the American and British economies and it certainly will not break the back of the Australian economy if Australians are given that sort of tax concession. </PARA>
<PARA> In the last day or two the Treasurer has made some fairly unkind comments about suggestions from some of his own Ministers, some of his own backbenchers, some members of the Opposition and the Australian Democrats that a smidgin of tax relief should be given to people on the savings that they put in banks and building societies. He is arguing that, if we allow, as has been suggested, the first $2,000 of interest earned on certain savings accounts in those sorts of institutions to be tax free it will distort the system. The system is already distorted when some people can get tax concessions and others cannot. But leaving that to one side, either the Treasurer wants people to save and not spend or he does not. If he does, he has to be prepared to forgo some tax revenue in order to achieve what he says he wants to achieve. </PARA>
<PARA> We need only look to the example of Japan to see what intrinsic benefits there are to encourage savings. The Japanese Government made a deliberate decision after World War II that it needed access to as much money as possible in order to reconstruct a country that had been devastated during the war. It, therefore, allowed people to save tax free as far as interest was concerned. That country now has the equivalent of about $US2.5 trillion in savings. The results of that saving and the access to investment money through borrowings on it can be seen by anyone who visits Japan, anyone who looks at its domestic surplus, anyone who looks at its trade balance, anyone who looks at its innovative manufacturing sector, and anyone who looks at that nation's development. The Japanese did it, at least in part, by the simple expedient of encouraging people to save. There is no point in Senator Chaney coming forward with a matter of urgency-the Australian Democrats will support it-which talks about the suffering of Australian families because of high taxes, high interest rates, the failure of the Government's economic policies, rising inflation, the balance of payments crisis and the still rising foreign debt, most of which is contributed to by foreign borrowings by private sector companies, if the Opposition and the Government are not prepared to take some fairly simple, equitable and fair steps to correct the imbalance that is there and to give Australian families some of the tax concessions, some of the tax benefits, some of the assistance which, for the last decade or more, has been pouring into Australian companies with no valuable result that any of us can perceive. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I support the urgency motion which has been put before us this afternoon by Senator Chaney because there is not the slightest doubt that today we are confronted with a situation of suffering by Australian families due to this Government's high taxes and the failure of its economic policies. This failure is evident in almost every aspect of the economic scene. Take, for example, the first element of that failure mentioned in Senator Chaney's motion: soaring interest rates. Today we have a situation where the short term interest rates in this country as measured by bank bill rates have risen by nearly seven percentage points since the end of 1987. In the past 14 months we have had a seven percentage point increase in interest rates.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In the Business Review Weekly of 24 February 1989 there is an article by Dr Ed Shann, who at one stage worked for me in the Treasury but who is now employed doing better things. He points out what has happened to the relationship between short term bond rates and long term bond rates in the course of the last year or so in this country. He points out that a year ago long term bond rates were 3 per cent higher than short term rates and now they are about 3 1/4 per cent lower. That switch into an inversion of the relationship between the short term rates and the long term rates is a dangerous phenomenon, the results of which are being seen in this country as in many other countries before. On that matter Dr Shann concludes that we are building for a fall; we are building towards a recession. But he points out that so far as the balance of payments is concerned, the fact is that with exports unlikely to be rising much next year any solution to the balance of payments means that imports must fall. He goes on to say that they have only ever fallen in Australia if domestic demand has been falling-not just growing slowly, but falling-or if we have been in a recession. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me take one aspect of the interest rates-the big picture, as the Treasurer (Mr Keating) would call it, on interest rates. Then let us take what might be described as the `little picture', although it is pretty big to individuals who are confronted by it and that is, of course, the subject of home mortgage rates. </PARA>
<PARA> Home mortgage rates today are roughly 15.5 per cent, in some cases 16 per cent. They will almost certainly rise to 16 per cent generally before many more weeks have passed. The Treasurer's views on that matter were given in a fascinating interview with Miss Michelle Grattan in the Melbourne Age last Monday, when he was asked when home owners could expect some relief in their mortgage rates. The Treasurer at that time said:</PARA>
<PARA>Bear in mind that 40 per cent of mortgages are still enjoying the 13.5 per cent ceiling. </PARA>
<PARA>I think I would have to tell the Treasurer that anyone who has a mortgage rate of 13.5 per cent is not enjoying anything. Such a person might regard himself or herself as fortunate by comparison with other less fortunate fellow mortgage holders who are paying 15 1/2 per cent or 16 per cent, but I would not think that he or she would be `enjoying' the situation. I make that point in order to flag another point-namely, the capacity of our Treasurer to tell a different story whenever the circumstances suit him. That article appeared in last Monday's Melbourne Age-no doubt the interview was given a couple of days earlier. On Monday evening in the Australian Broadcasting Corporation's program Four Corners, what did the Treasurer have to say about mortgage interest rates? On that occasion in response to a comment by one of his interviewers he said:</PARA>
<PARA>The only thing I'd say to her about that is when we had the old days of 13 1/2 per cent loans, which some people still have, they only had it for 20,000 (dollars) or 30,000 (dollars) worth of the mortgage, they'd then have to go and find another 30,000 (dollars) worth in the secondary market and then they'd get a personal loan . . . </PARA>
<PARA>That is, at a higher interest rate. He was talking about the well known interest rate cocktail phenomenon which was a feature of the situation when housing interest rates were totally regulated. The Treasurer in his statement on Monday night was basically saying that people who had 13.5 per cent loans did not really benefit much at that time because they had to get the other half of their cocktail at much, much higher rates compared with the situation today. Yet in his interview with Miss Grattan he points to 40 per cent of those people as still enjoying 13 1/2 per cent mortgages. That is an example of the capacity of our Treasurer to change his story depending on the circumstances. My goodness, he has had a lot of occasions in the past six months or so to do just that. It is no wonder that Mr Keating's credibility is now wearing thin, even within those quarters-the Press Gallery in this place-which have contained his most persistent adulators in the past. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us have a look at another example of the Treasurer's story having to be changed because in the end the facts will out. It is the question of rising inflation referred to in Senator Chaney's motion. One will recall that rising inflation was referred to by the Treasurer in his Budget Speech as `Australia's most important economic disease'. Inflation was 7.7 per cent in the 12 months to the December quarter of last year. That compares with the Treasurer's Budget time forecast that it would fall to 4.5 per cent by June of this year. We are told by the press this week that some disquiet has been expressed by the Australian Labor Party Caucus meeting at the weekend because there was evidence showing up in its research that the Party's stocks with women were falling. Well, no wonder. Notwithstanding our more enlightened age, in this country women usually still do the shopping. Inflation is brought home to them every time they do the shopping. </PARA>
<PARA> Another area where the Treasurer's credibility has been shot to pieces in the past six months and which is also referred to in Senator Chaney's motion is the balance of payments crisis. The Treasurer in his Budget Speech referred to the balance of payments as Australia's most serious economic problem. We have had a series of successively discredited Keating forecasts for our balance of payments outcome for 1988-89 over the period since the Budget was brought down. In the Budget itself, the Treasurer forecast a deficit for this year of $9,500m. Within less than a month of that figure being published leaks were emanating from the Treasurer or his office or the Department to the effect that the actual outcome was more likely to be about $10 1/2 billion. </PARA>
<PARA> After the November balance of payments figures appeared the Treasurer held a press conference at which he said that he hoped the final outcome for the financial year 1988-89 would be not worse than last year's figure, which was $12.3 billion. This is the ever escalating forecast. After the January figures were released a fortnight or so ago, the Treasurer held another press conference at which he said that he now hoped the balance of payments deficit for 1988-89 would be of about the same proportion of our gross domestic product as for last year, which was 4.2 per cent-that is, about $14 billion. </PARA>
<PARA> Professor Barry Hughes, to whom our attention was directed yesterday by the Minister for Finance, Senator Walsh, has put forward in a most interesting paper some forecasts which run a good deal higher than that. There is very little point in debating the odd billion or two because the real point is that the Treasurer's forecasts have been so far out that there is no longer the slightest faith out there in the financial markets in the credibility of any forecast or other economic policy prognostication issued by the present Government. I should add that emanating from Professor Hughes's paper is a most interesting passage. At one time Professor Hughes was Mr Keating's own personal economic adviser-in fact, during the latter part of my period in the Treasury. Professor Hughes said, among other things:</PARA>
<PARA>Our central message-</PARA>
<PARA>that is, the central message of the paper he had written for the First Boston Corporation-</PARA>
<PARA>is that a monetary policy stance aimed at creating a 1986-style flattening of domestic demand and consequent major reduction in . . . imports is unlikely to be fierce enough to produce an acceptable annual bottom line-</PARA>
<PARA>that is, for the balance of payments-</PARA>
<PARA>by early 1990. </PARA>
<PARA>That is, early next year-a year hence. What about the still rising foreign debt? When this Government came to office our net debt to foreigners was less than $20 billion. At September last year it was over $93 billion. In the last few days this Government has congratulated itself on the fall of about 10 per cent in the value of the Australian dollar against foreign currencies. When it does so, it might bear in mind that the value of our outstanding debt, or at least that part of it denominated in foreign currencies, has just jumped by about 10 per cent, and so of course has the cost of servicing that debt, which, I might add, is already running at over $8 billion a year in interest costs alone. In the last week or so our Government has pushed that cost up by anything up to $800m a year by the intemperate statements of the Treasurer and the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke). That figure will depend on the amount of our total foreign debt that is denominated in foreign currencies, which is at least half. </PARA>
<PARA> What is the Government's policy on this? The Government's policy is to concur with the demand of the Australian Council of Trade Unions (ACTU) that we have a tax cut equal to $20 a week and a wage increase close to $30 a week. How is the Australian economy supposed to deliver that increase in real incomes, and hence in real purchasing power, when we are already living beyond our means internationally by an amount of $14 billion to $15 billion this year alone and raising our international debts accordingly, or selling off bits of Australia accordingly, in order to finance that process of living beyond our national means? Has the Treasurer or Senator Button, who spoke earlier in this debate, given the slightest explanation of how that can be done?</PARA>
<PARA> The only mention Senator Button made of increasing productivity, which is the only way in which it can be done other than by fortuitous means such as a further rise in our international terms of trade-that is, the price at which we sell our exports, et cetera-was the flippant reference to Williamstown Dockyard. It was a good reference in one way because it illustrated a more general point. After an extraordinary amount of harassment by the trade unions at Williamstown Dockyard, the managers and employers sacked the whole work force. The workers were out for over three months. At the end of that time they came back and the Government got some sense in the work practices on the site. I presume the analogy that Senator Button has in mind is that this Government is about to sack the whole Australian work force. At the end of that time, it might get some sense out of its trade union mates in the ACTU as to how we can get some sense of desperate need for better productivity in this country, which is the only remedy for our present problem. </PARA>

Quite clearly, things must be done but, in typical fashion, the Opposition does not come up with the answers, other than suggesting that we should bring about a recession so that people will not be able to spend as much and therefore will not be able to buy imported goods and thereby the balance of payments will be redressed in some measure.

The alternative suggestion-to be fair to Senator Stone, he suggested this at the end of his speech-is an increase in productivity. I hope I have properly accounted for what Senator Stone said in that regard. Of course productivity should be increased. If productivity is brought to a proper level it will go a long way to solving Australia's problems. However, to say simply that there ought to be an increase in productivity and not go on to suggest a formula or policy or program by which productivity can be increased seems to me not to be meeting the needs of the hour. </PARA>

That is based on the proposition that productivity ought to be encouraged in a way which is consistent with this community, as a united force, going forward to do something about the balance of payments and this country's economic problems. Certainly we shall not reach that position by setting up an antagonistic camp with the employers on one side and the employees on the other. What would happen would be not an increase in productivity, but a return to the bad old days which predated this Government with armed camps at war, suspicious of each other, and not working together to increase productivity. This Government's policy involves an accord which envisages employers and employees sitting down together and discussing how productivity can be increased and success achieved.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It has been achieved, Senator Messner, and I will give one example. The waterside unions have been much criticised, but let me give an example of what has happened on the Melbourne waterside over the last 18 months. In Melbourne is a depot where the LCLs, or less than container loads, are unpacked. The employers asked the waterside workers to unload five of these containers over a period of seven hours, after which the workers could then go home. That standard was set by the employers. The employees, through their union, said `If incentives are in the right place, there is a better way in which this shed can be made productive so that LCLs can be properly dealt with'. To their credit, the employers listened and put the scheme into operation. In the last 18 months there has been an increase of 200 per cent in the productivity in that shed. That is an example of what can be done through cooperation and if employers and employees, through their unions, sit down and state the ground rules. That is what can happen if there is mutual trust.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am asked how this originated, but if we are to go into recriminations, apportioning blame and discussing where past blame has lain, we will get nowhere. Problems such as those on the Melbourne waterside should be analysed, and people should be optimistic and look to the future. If such an attitude is taken, what has happened on the Melbourne waterfront can be repeated throughout the land, and in certain areas it has been repeated. That attitude will lead to increased productivity and that, as Senator Stone said, will lead us in large measures towards solving our problems. By so doing we can bring down interest rates and give people what they deserve, and in that way Australia can go forward. But unless we understand that every section of the community can work together and that the basis of the accord is correct, I am afraid that we shall have a very pessimistic future.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It has been said that the sufferings of Australian families should be taken account of and that their problems have occurred as a result of Government policies. Let me make it clear that during these hard economic times we have been through the Government has encouraged productivity and community cooperation, but at the same time the Government has looked to the needs of those who are vulnerable and has done something about them. In other words, Government effort has gone to assist the family, and the family assistance scheme is a great illustration. Let me give an example of a family consisting of mother, father and three children, with an income in the way of earnings of $16,800, with two of the children aged between 13 and 15 and with one child under 13. The family rents privately and currently receives $101 per week tax free-which when added to the wage coming into that family is equivalent to $25,000 a year. The only other way that family could reach such an amount would be by way of a 50 per cent wage increase. </PARA>
<PARA> That process operates in two ways. It introduces into that family a much needed injection of income, and also does so without imposing on the community the effects of a huge rise of 50 per cent. About 140,000 low income families receive assistance under the family assistance scheme. The average payment under that scheme is $40 a week, which is tax free. That is a good state of affairs and is consistent with the Government's policy of helping those in need in the most economic way-a way which does not have an impact on the wage structure of this country. </PARA>
<PARA> I wish to emphasise two points in debating this matter of urgency. First, it is true that there are economic problems. Of the various solutions advanced by various groups in the community, including the Opposition, the Australian Democrats and the Government, I believe that the Government's solution has the most chance of success. That program involves going forward in a cooperative spirit so that workers and employers can sit down and talk about restructuring and how work practices can be adjusted in order to increase productivity. In that way of cooperation, based on the accord, one can go forward to increasing the wealth of the community. </PARA>
<PARA> Secondly, in circumstances where hard times have had their effect on families, the Government has focused on assisting those who are the most vulnerable. It has taken action through the family assistance scheme, through the child welfare scheme, Medicare and a whole variety of social welfare and social justice schemes. This has created a situation in which there has not been, as would be the case in a recession, any fearful impact on those who are least able to bear it. </PARA>
<PARA> That is the way forward. Certainly the way forward is not to follow Lego economics involving adjustments here and there, bearing down the wages, putting people into recession and pulling levers to achieve a result. The Government is saying to the people of this country that attitudes are changing and must change even more. It is saying that if there is a sense of fairness in the community, these problems will be solved. Such a course had not been suggested by the Opposition. The Opposition has simply raised issues and, as usual, come up with answers which, if put into operation, would simply fail. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is easy to be negative about the Government's economic performance because there is much to be negative about. First, we have seen the enormous Budget blow-out in terms of the raising of taxes and the new taxes which have been put on the Australian people by this Government since it came to power. These taxes have led to a great lack of incentive in the community to work hard. Secondly, in recent times we have seen Budget figures set down only in August last being blown out of the water by inflation and by the recent figures. Interest rates have all gone through the roof. Most importantly-this is where we will take Senator Cooney to task-we have seen no improvement in productivity under this Government. In fact, we are now witnessing a continuation of the decline that started back in 1985. These are the facts, and this is why we are prepared to debate this matter openly and positively in the Senate today.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Australian families and the Australian work force are under pressure regarding living standards. One does not have to work too far around the community to understand that. All the Government puts forward in its own defence are bland statements and assertions that somehow we are on the right track. The Australian people want to know: `On the track to where?'. We even get statements from the Treasurer (Mr Keating) and the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) that somehow taxes are good for us. That is exemplified by Keating's Commissioner of Taxation saying, as he does in all his correspondence to members of parliament these days, that taxes build a better Australia. Does the Government understand how silly this is and how it is being thrown aside by the Australian people? Those inanities show how arrogant the Government is and how out of touch it is with the Australian people. </PARA>
<PARA> Where is the concern of the Australian Government for the work force, for the individual worker? We have just heard Senator Cooney praise the famous `better than sliced bread' approach of this Government, called the accord. What a monument to failure of productivity growth is the accord. What is needed is not the pulling of levers, which Mr Keating, the Treasurer, is so fond of doing; it is leadership-providing leadership to the Australian community-not some kind of pact between the Government and its surrogates who run the trade union movement. The Government needs to show the way. </PARA>
<PARA> This Government continues to mouth the rhetoric of free enterprise but it does not believe in it. Its heart shows no commitment to those principles. All of this is quite clear when one looks at the record: higher taxes, bracket creep, capital gains taxes, assets tests on pensions. All those things are added to increasing government regulation, not less regulation, which is tying down private enterprise and the individual worker. There has been no attempt on the part of this Government to address the very serious problems of micro-economic reform. There is the mess on the waterfront. There is huge potential, if only it were properly unleashed, on the part of the telecommunications industry. This country has a huge capacity to deal with its problems if only the Government would free up the labour market and allow excellence to be rewarded, allow people to work harder and be rewarded for it. Those are the kinds of things which need to be done. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Of course. As Senator Stone says, these things are the very issues which the Government avoids, yet they are critical to the future of this nation. Misleading statements continually flow from the Government, including the Prime Minister, mainly for electoral purposes. I instance his statements before the Oxley by-election and on the very eve of the Western Australian election that interest rates would not go any higher and would start to fall this year. Yet on the Monday after the election in each case interest rates continued to rise, putting housing under enormous pressure and making the buying of a house almost unachiev- able for Australian families. This Government will have to wear what that is doing to the social fabric of Australia. It is tearing apart the foundation on which this country has been built over many decades.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> If this Government were providing true leadership it would show in a positive light the very real qualities of the Australian people. The Government could provide proper leadership at the appropriate level and assist in improving the skills of individuals who want to improve their skills. It could provide incentive for those who want to work harder, who want to work up the ladder of success and improve themselves. It could galvanise Australians into striving to improve themselves by those means. It could start by saluting the individual efforts of those in the community who want to work harder. But the Government, bound hand and foot by the trade union movement, refuses to throw off the accord and start to reward effort and excellence. It is bound by its political union with the trade union movement which precludes the achievement of the very things which the Australian population is seeking to achieve. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government keeps sending the wrong messages to the community. It says: `If you do well we will tax you out of existence. If your income rises you will move into a higher tax bracket and we will rip it off you'. That does not come about only because of inflation. It also comes about when people work harder and lose more of their money in taxes. The incentive for effort is declining. This is right at the time when we should be increasing incentive and opportunities for the individual to improve himself and his family. Everybody in this country knows what should be done except, apparently, the Government. What needs to be done is not the making of some collective arrangement, some political union with an outside corporate body, be it in the enterprise sector or the union sector. The Government needs to improve opportunities for ordinary Australians to enhance their lifestyles. This Government totally fails to understand that basic point, which shows how arrogant and out of touch it is. All we hear about from Keating, Hawke and Walsh is hands on levers and numbers from Treasury that appear on bits of paper that are thrown around the Parliament, which have no relevance whatsoever to the lives of the ordinary human beings of this country. Sir Arvi Parbo, in a remarkable speech made in Adelaide to a Liberal Party gathering, a speech which was quoted by my Leader only a few minutes ago, was very neat on this point. He said:</PARA>
<PARA> Our basic need is for a better performance. </PARA>
<PARA>He went on to make the following point about how we can improve the performance of Australians:</PARA>
<PARA> This includes working harder, but it means much more than that. It means improving our skills, removing artificial obstacles to the efficient functioning of the economy and, above all, developing a community attitude which supports and applauds achievement. It means encouraging, not discouraging, the natural desire of individuals to improve themselves. </PARA>
<PARA>Those words should be carved in stone, with apologies to Senator Stone. They are a clear statement of what is needed in this community to improve the quality of life of every Australian. This Government refuses to acknowledge that. It refuses to acknowledge the right of individuals to improve their living standards. It will not provide the proper leadership to enable individuals to do that. Instead, it stultifies the opportunities Australians might have to exercise their right to self-improvement. It throws road blocks in the way. It taxes people out of existence when they want to improve themselves. It applies to them a system of industrial relations which stops their opportunity to improve. It prevents them from changing jobs freely. It locks them into a union system that absolutely stultifies opportunities to improve themselves and their families. </PARA>
<PARA> Sir Arvi Parbo went on to refer to how we might transform Australia into a performance-oriented society. He talks about attitude. He does not talk about levers. He does not talk about numbers. He talks about how people think and work. He says:</PARA>
<PARA>Superior performance is not achieved by governments, the industry, the unions or any other part of the machinery; it is achieved by individuals. The advantages we have as a country do not entitle us to anything; on the contrary, they represent an obligation to make full and wise use of these advantages. </PARA>
<PARA>That is the point. This Government should be leading individual Australians down the track of improving their own circumstances by their own efforts. It should be providing incentives for that to be done. It should be removing the roadblocks in the way of business and individuals improving their own situation. </PARA>
<PARA> We are faced with enormous problems in the future which have all been created by the mismanagement of this Government. We have seen the most important issue of productivity dropped aside in recent months. For instance we have seen in the last quarter of this financial year that the percentage of gross domestic product per hour worked by our work force has fallen by about 3 per cent. This is right at the time when it should be rising. We are now faced with a situation where the interest we have to pay on our gross debt owed to people overseas, in terms of a percentage of exports of goods and services, has risen since the Fraser Government was in power in 1982 from 8 per cent to 20 per cent of the total amount of our exports. If one likes to express that in terms of net debt as a percentage of gross domestic product, we have seen it triple in that time. </PARA>
<PARA> The problem is that the growth is not stopping. One or two years ago the debt of this country was less than $100,000m. By May it will be $140,000m. It is growing every month by $15,00m or, in hourly terms, about $2m an hour. While this debate has been going on the debt of the country has risen $5m. Those are the problems that are not being addressed by this Government. It is failing to come to terms with the most urgent and worrying concerns of Australians. </PARA>
<PARA> Where is the Government's policy? It asks for ours. I will tell honourable senators what our policy is. It has already been released in our industrial relations policy. It goes to the core of the issue-to improve the circumstances of individual Australians by encouraging them to do better, by offering them a way of changing the arbitration system and the industrial relations system in this country so that they can improve their own circumstances by their own efforts. They should not have the Government sitting across the road, blocking their entry to the way of prosperity. That is what this Government has not and will not address apparently while it is bound hand and foot to its trade union masters. It has to change and, most of all, it has to explain to us how it will stop the huge growth of debt to overseas countries by this nation. That is not stopping; it is going up every month. How is the Government going to stop it? The Government should explain that to the Australian people forthwith. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, for all the reasons that we have just given, for all the arguments that have been put forward so strongly by Senator Chaney and Senator Stone, we believe the Government should move immediately to introduce a mini-Budget to explain and show a way to the Australian people out of the huge mess which it has created. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This afternoon we are debating a motion which has been moved by Senator Chaney on the question of families, their economic circumstances and their economic welfare. It is the height of hypocrisy for Senator Chaney, who was a Minister in the Fraser-Howard Government, to stand in this place this afternoon and lecture the Hawke Government, despite its fine record, on the treatment of families in Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Let us look at the last 12 months of the Liberals in power. Let us look at what happened in 1981-82 when the Liberals were on the Treasury bench in the House of Representatives. The record is that 186,000 Australians, not 18,600 but 186,000, were thrown onto the industrial scrapheap as a result of the policies of Senator Stone in his previous incarnation over the road at the Treasury and by Mr Howard, the then Treasurer. One hundred and eighty-six thousand Australians lost their jobs. That is what Liberals did for job security. That is what they did for family welfare in this country. No wonder they paid the price at the ballot box six years ago next weekend. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us examine the economic realities of the present day and age and compare them with the past. In 1982-83, when Senator Stone was Secretary to the Treasury, this country had its worst recession in 50 years. That is the record. It was the worst economic recession in 50 years. Not only did we have inflationary price rises in the double digit range and the cost of living going up over 10 per cent per annum but we also had unemployment peaking at a seasonally adjusted figure of about 10.4 per cent. That was the record of these people. This afternoon they come into the chamber on the second day of the new parliamentary period to lecture this Government on its treatment of Australian families. That is the cheek of those people. They left this Government with a prospective Budget deficit in 1983-84 of $9,600m. Opposition senators should read Paul Kelly's book. It is all documented there. Page after page describes how this situation came about. I am not talking about $960,000 but $9.6 billion. That compares with a surplus today of $5,500m. I have referred to their record on unemployment and I have referred to their record on inflation. </PARA>
<PARA> This motion talks about the balance of payments. Australia has always had a balance of payments problem. It is nothing new. We are a net importer of capital. With a few exceptions, for a couple of years, we always have been. Senator Stone knows the economic history as well as I do. I remember reading the fine articles by Professor Trevor Swan which were written in the 1950s. At that time he was documenting Australia's balance of payments constraint on growth. That is what it was all about; it has not changed. It is not a new problem. </PARA>
<PARA> Despite the disappointing figures in recent times, real progress has been made on this particular matter. But, of course, a significant element of the balance of payments in the present day and age is, in fact, imports of items that are necessary for Australian growth. This means better plant and equipment, better machinery and a lot of raw materials which are vitally important for growth in the Australian economy. That is what a significant part of our import bill comprises. I go back into economic history again because I find it fascinating to be lectured on these matters by Senator Chaney and Senator Stone. In Mr Howard's last full year as Treasurer, that is, 1981-82, the balance of payments current account deficit in relation to Australia's national income, broadly defined as Australia's gross domestic product, was 5.9 per cent. Despite the difficulties that we are having at the present time with the balance of payments, it is most unlikely that it will reach 5.9 per cent. In fact, the figure will probably be more in the order of 4 per cent of gross domestic product. It is very important, through you, Mr Acting Deputy President, to respond to Senator Stone. We must relate these things to the size of Australia's income-our gross domestic product. When the current Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard) was the Treasurer of this country, our balance of payments current account deficit was 5.9 per cent of Australia's gross domestic product. It will not reach that figure in this financial year. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition is bleating about interest rates at the present time. The Government has made it clear that we will ensure that interest rates fall as soon as economically possible and not before that time. We will not be looking at the short term options. We will make sure that demand is held down to improve the balance of payments by shaking off the high level of demand for imports at the present time. We will not be releasing policies to reduce interest rates for other than economic reasons. </PARA>
<PARA> It is unfortunate-I am the first person to admit this-that the housing sector, which is essentially a domestic sector, not a traded goods sector, bears the brunt of interest rate policies. But as the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) has made clear time and again, interest rates will come down as soon as it is economically possible. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like to look again at the record of the Government of which Senator Chaney was a member-the Fraser-Howard Government. Mr Howard was Treasurer with Senator Stone advising him. At the time of the economic recession in the early 1980s that I referred to earlier, we also had quite high interest rates. That has been forgotten by the people who have spoken in this debate this afternoon. We had a period in the early 1980s in this country under the Liberals of economic recession-not a boom-coupled with high interest rates. Under the Hawke Government, admittedly we have high interest rates, but we also have a rapidly expanding economy. We now have economic growth, compared with the economic recession under the Liberal Government of which Senator Chaney was a member. That is the difference. I am as concerned as any member of the Government about the level of inflation in the community. I was disappointed by the December quarter consumer price index, showing an annual rate of 7.7 per cent in cost of living rises. Importantly, as has been pointed out, that reflected the pent-up demand for housing, particularly in Sydney. I have seen a Treasury paper which suggested a reworking of the methodology with respect to incorporating housing in the consumer price index base. Treasury came up with an alternative figure of 7.3 per cent which, although still an unsatisfactory figure, shows that a particular method of calculating housing costs can add almost half a percentage point to the national inflation rate. </PARA>
<PARA> At the same time as members of the Opposition lecture the Government about the inflation rate, they conveniently ignore what is happening overseas. In the period since about October, I have noticed that all the international comparisons the Liberals make when lecturing us about our economic management do not include Britain. It is very interesting that they have dropped Britain from their international comparisons. Despite the fact that Mr Howard goes over to London and worships at Mrs Thatcher's knees, why has Britain been dropped as a basis for comparison in Liberal Party speeches? The reason can be deduced from the front page of London's Sunday Times of 19 February, just 10 days ago. The article refers to Cabinet concern about an 8 per cent inflation rate. In Australia, we are talking about a 7.7 per cent inflation rate. The Opposition tells us that that figure is far too high. </PARA>
<PARA> According to Mr Howard, Mrs Thatcher is a great conservative Prime Minister. He went over there to ask how he could get elected. However, the British inflation rate is already 7.5 per cent and is heading for 8 per cent. That was reported in the Sunday Times 10 days ago, so Senator Stone and Senator Chaney should not lecture us about how conservative governments can bring down the cost of living. The former Liberal Government failed in that. I well remember how it cranked up the level of unemployment to try to reduce the inflation rate. Mr Howard's policy throughout the years of the Fraser Government was to fight inflation first. Higher levels of unemployment were created to try to create slack in the labour market, to create a position in which inflation would fall. Conservative policies in operation in the United Kingdom have created an 8 per cent inflation rate, as reported in the Sunday Times. Mrs Thatcher's policies have brought about that situation. Honourable Senators opposite should be honest and talk about the position in the United Kingdom when they lecture us about the economy. </PARA>
<PARA> They might also start paying some attention to the United States. I noticed the other day that a monthly figure on its price rises suggested a 0.6 per cent increase in one month. I will not do what the late Sir Phillip Lynch did and multiply 0.6 by 12 to arrive at an annual rate. In his case he multiplied a quarterly figure by four and suggested that was the annual figure. Inflationary pressures are building up in other countries and honourable senators opposite should not lecture us about the inflation rate in Australia, particularly in view of the policies pursued by the former Liberal Government under Mr Howard as Treasurer, which were described as fighting inflation first. </PARA>
<PARA> I also feel affronted that members of the Opposition should lecture this Government about so-called cuts in the standard of living when month after month, year after year, they use only cash wage and salary figures. Sometimes they relate them to price indexes, but they miss the point completely. The Government's policies, as announced in the 1983 election campaign, were to generate the concept of the social wage. We do not see family welfare being measured necessarily only by wages and salaries in cash terms. That is why we embarked on programs such as Medicare, the first home owners scheme, family allowance supplements, and a range of other Government programs that go well beyond comparisons of cash incomes and salaries, beyond even relating those to consumer price indexes to get real figures. They go well beyond those concepts and incorporate the social wage, which is a much broader measure of the economic welfare of families. By definition, the Liberals are missing the point completely when they castigate this Government for its record in wages and salaries. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Chaney has yet again moved an urgency motion which refers to the plight of Australian families. It is interesting that in October or November last year, the Leader of the Opposition, the failed former Treasurer of Australia, Mr Howard, released a document called, I think, `Future Directions', a manifesto of the Liberal Party. It was to be the blueprint for the brave new world of conservatism in Australia, as handed down by Mrs Thatcher in London. It is interesting to look at a recent opinion poll conducted by the Melbourne Age newspaper of 9 February. The article said that a poll showed that the ALP was ahead on issues. When electors were asked which party was more committed to supporting families, 48 per cent of those polled responded that the ALP was more committed; a mere 27 per cent said that the coalition was the more committed party. About three months after Mr Howard's manifesto of future directions for Australia was released, the people rejected it resoundingly. They indicated that they did not believe any of this nonsense because they well remembered when Mr Howard was Treasurer of Australia. The Liberals keep pulling their hair out, asking what they are doing wrong. They forget that people do not have short memories. The sooner the Liberal Party gets rid of Mr Howard, the more chance it might have. </PARA>
<PARA> In conclusion, Labor's first priority has been to get the economic fundamentals right. We have faced the economic realities. We have not taken the short term options as the conservatives have. We have not taken contradictory positions in doing that, but we see that we must get the fundamentals right if we are to achieve Labor's traditional goals and long term reform. We believe that economic and social policies work hand in hand. Through economic growth, Labor has created jobs, improved welfare and generated extra revenues for family assistance. </PARA>

The Labor Government's family policies are a fraud because over 90 per cent of all Australian families with dependent children have suffered a substantial drop in living standards since the Labor Government came to power in 1984. Those hardest hit are the families with dependent children which are not eligible for the family assistance supplement. Their disposable income has dropped by more than 12 per cent in the last five years. If those families are caught up in having trouble meeting their mortgage payments because of the increasingly high level of interest payments, their standard of living drops more than the 12 per cent by which their disposable income has dropped.

<PARA> Let us take what is known as a sitcom-a single-income three-children one-mortgage family. An example of that is the one-income family on $19,000 per annum, with three children, which is finding it difficult to keep up with its mortgage repayments or with the rent, if it is renting a home.

Because of the loss to the mother of the family assistance supplement, the loss to the husband of the spouse rebate, and the increased tax the Government actually claws back $6,611 of the $10,000 the mother is earning, leaving her only $3,389. That is an absolute disgrace. It is an example of the poverty traps into which this family assistance supplement scheme is pushing a number of families. </PARA>
<PARA> Furthermore, the Federal Government stands condemned of daylight robbery from the purses of Australian mothers because it has frozen family allowances. Honourable senators will recall in this chamber in 1976 the then Government explaining to us why it was changing the tax rebate system to a family allowance system. It cost the Government nothing to do that because it was taking money out of the hip-pocket of the taxpayer husband and placing it into the purse of the mother. We in this chamber all applauded that. We thought it was a good idea. I recall getting up and saying that it was a great idea, provided it kept pace with inflation. I was supported in that by the spokesman for the then Labor Opposition, Senator Don Grimes. He also realised that the family allowance system was a cashed up tax rebate system paid to the mother out of the hip-pocket of the breadwinner. </PARA>
<PARA> Since that time, because of the failure properly to index the family allowance supplement, there has been $19.2 billion purloined from the purses of Australian mothers. In the current year alone the Federal Government is robbing Australian mothers of more than $1 billion through that tactic. We have all heard the promises and the publicity stunts of the Government over its family policies. We heard as far back at 1983 Bob Hawke giving a promise to the electorate that if he gained government he would increase the spouse rebate. Not only has he not done that, he has also frozen the spouse rebate to such an extent that the pittance it represents now is a gross insult to the mothers of Australia in their most important work of nurturing furture Australians. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Acting Deputy President, you have not heard me speak before, if not so bitterly, then so trenchantly against the Government. It is time that this was done so that the Government can put things right, if not for the families that are suffering then for its own neck. Families are feeling the burden and that is a fact that will react very much against the Government. My time has expired and I understand a vote is required on this matter. I thank honourable senators who have enabled me to speak. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In the period 25 January to 18 February 1989, Senator Button visited Japan, the Philippines, the United States, Italy, France and the Federal Republic of Germany. The main purposes of the visit were to discuss fields of common interest in economic development and science and technology matters, and to promote greater collaboration between Australian businesses and their counterparts in some of our major trade and investment partners. In Japan Senator Button took part in the Tenth Australia Japan Ministerial Committee Meeting (AJMC), ably chaired on the Australian side by my colleague the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade (Senator Gareth Evans). This was Senator Button's fourth AJMC and, at least from his perspective, the most satisfying and constructive.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator Button does not intend in this statement to attempt a full report on the outcome of this meeting. That is, strictly speaking, a job for Senator Evans. He does, however, report with some satisfaction that it was agreed with our Japanese counterparts that it was appropriate and timely for Australia and Japan, in many senses the most advanced economies in the Western Pacific, to characterise their political and economic links as a `constructive partnership' and to work harder and more consciously in several fields to strengthen that partnership. Senator Button was particularly pleased with the positive attitude of the new Minister for International Trade and Industry, Mr Mitsuzuka, to the so-called Multifunction Polis project. Honourable senators may be aware that the Australian and Japanese governments, with the private sectors in each country, are sponsoring a feasibility study relating to this project, to be concluded at the end of the year. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Button was also pleased to hear several Japanese Ministers speak about Japanese investment in Australia in a way which showed both a clear understanding of our wish to see it diversified into new, productive sectors of the economy and sensitivity to the concerns of some people in the Australian community about the rapid rate at which that investment is growing, particularly in the real estate and tourism sectors. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Button thinks that the excellent atmosphere which pervaded the meeting may reflect the respect which Japanese Ministers and officials feel for the achievements made in recent years by Australia, by the unions, business and the Government, in tackling many of the economic problems we face. Senator Button thinks that they can see clearly what many honourable senators sitting opposite him unfortunately still fail to grasp: that the union movement, many in the business community and, of course, this Government have a clear idea of the new directions that must be taken to ensure that Australia can compete and thrive in the 1990s, and that great strides have been taken towards laying the foundations of a more modern, innovative and competitive economy. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Button went on to the Philippines, where he attended the Second Association of South East Asian Nations Science And Technology Week as a keynote speaker. He did this for two main reasons. Firstly, he wanted to demonstrate the respect the Government has for the efforts being made by the ASEAN countries to strengthen their science and technology capabilities and our judgment that their efforts will bear fruit and lead to enhanced science and technology collaboration as well as practical business opportunities for Australia. Secondly, he wanted to support efforts made by Australian firms and research institutions and the Scientific Industries Steering Committee (SISC), in the context of the ASEAN Science and Technology Week, to create commercial opportunities for Australia in the ASEAN countries. Senator Button signed a memorandum of understanding on science and technology cooperation with his Philippine colleague, Dr Arizabal. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Button thinks that the ASEAN Ministers responsible for science and technology appreciated Australia's interest in, and support for, their Science and Technology Week. Our support included a small financial contribution from the Australian International Development Assistance Bureau for the Science and Technology Week as well as a strong Australian private and public sector presence in the associated exhibition. </PARA>
<PARA> In the United States the primary objective was to promote the image of Australia as an attractive location for high value-added investment projects. The itinerary involved a press conference in New York and a series of meetings with corporations with investments in Australia. The press conference gave impetus to the efforts of our Investment Commissioner in North America who commenced operations last year. In an extremely competitive investment promotion market, Australia has raised its flag and its opportunities will increasingly be noted. Meetings with executives from some of the large corporations, either currently investing in Australia or considering such investments, highlighted our attractiveness as an investment location. For example, Merck, Sharp and Dohme, the world's largest pharmaceutical company, has recognised our expertise in medical research and invested in a joint venture with Australian Medical Research and Development (AMRAD) in Victoria to commercialise the results of AMRAD's research. </PARA>
<PARA> The objectives of the visit to Italy were:</PARA>
<PARA> to assess the potential to broaden the trade and industrial linkages into new sectors of manufacturing industry, such as biotechnology, and scientific and medical instruments, through ministerial discussions in Rome and promotional activities in Milan. </PARA>
<PARA> to encourage increased Italian investment in Australia's skins and hides and wool processing industries through Milan investment seminars and separate discussions with relevant firms. </PARA>
<PARA> to discuss with representatives of the Italian Government multilateral and bilateral trade issues, including the outcomes of the December 1988 mid-term review of the Uruguay Round of the Multilateral Trade Negotiations (MTN). </PARA>
<PARA>The formal component of the joint working group took place in Rome in the form of discussions with a delegation of Italian officials and industrialists led by Mr Ruggiero, Minister for Foreign Trade. This was followed by separate discussions with Minister Ruggiero on the outcomes of the mid-term review of progress on the Uruguay Round of the MTN. Senator Button affirmed Australia's commitment to the multilateral trading system and emphasised the importance of advancing those areas not agreed at Montreal. Senator Button also met with Mr Prandini, the Italian Minister for Merchant Marine, and discussed possibilities for closer cooperation between Australia and Italy in the fishing industry. </PARA>
<PARA> A trade and investment promotion seminar was held in Milan on 7 February. Over 150 Italian industrialists attended to listen to Australian industry representatives from the biotechnology, scientific and medical instrument, wool processing, skins and hides processing, and transport and construction industries. Senator Button provided a broad overview of the investment climate and opportunities in Australia while other speakers outlined specific industry sectors highlighted by the mission and provided details of specific opportunities at the firm level. The following two days involved a series of site visits and separate discussions for members of the delegation. During the same period, Senator Button met with Italian firms Benetton, Olivetti and Telettra to discuss their investment plans in Australia and the surrounding region. He also met with Mediobanca and the Milan Chamber of Commerce. </PARA>
<PARA> Although a detailed assessment of the outcomes of the mission has yet to be undertaken, initial responses from industry participants have been uniformly positive. Many of the delegation reported useful discussions with Italian counterparts and potentially valuable new contacts made during the Milan exercise. </PARA>
<PARA> During Senator Button's visit to Paris, he met with the Minister for Research and Technology and the Minister for Industry and held talks with a number of the major French firms investing in Australia. Discussions at the meeting with Mr Curien, Minister for Research and Technology, covered the need to give substance to the recently signed science and technology agreement and explored a variety of potential areas of cooperation. Senator Button outlined progress on negotiations with the European Community in Brussels for a science and technology agreement and sought French support for such an agreement. Minister Curien indicated French support for the initiative and suggested the agreement might be signed during the French presidency of the Council. Senator Button subsequently met with representatives of Thomson-CSF, CGE and Aerospatiale to discuss their corporate strategy and, in particular, their investment plans in the Australian market. He also addressed a private luncheon attended by 30 or so prominent French businessmen on the investment climate in Australia. In discussions with Mr Faroux, Minister for Industry and Regional Development, French expectations in relation to the single internal market for the Economic Community in 1992 were canvassed and Senator Button discussed opportunities for increased cooperation in the Asia-Pacific region, in the context of the rapid economic development occurring in this area. </PARA>
<PARA> A group of some 16 business people accompanied Senator Button to the Federal Republic of Germany for investment and industrial cooperation promotion seminars in Stuttgart and Munich. Daimler Benz and Siemens respectively hosted the Stuttgart and Munich exercises. The objectives of the mission were to promote German investment into Australia's manufacturing industry and to promote greater cooperation between Australian and German manufacturing firms. The seminars attracted substantial audiences in both cities. Speakers included representatives of Australia's automotive components, scientific and medical instrument, advanced manufacturing, aerospace and information and communications technology industries. In addition, there were speakers from German transnationals which have successfully invested in the Australian market. The initial response of the business delegation was positive, with many reports of new contacts made and new opportunities identified. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Button also held talks with Mr Lothar Spath, Minister-President of the State of Baden-Wurttemberg, Mr August Lang, Minister for Economic Affairs and transport of the State of Bavaria and Dr Helmut Haussmann, the Federal Minister for Economic Affairs. These discussions canvassed such issues as the opportunities for closer industrial and technical cooperation, the rapid economic development of the Asia-Pacific region, and general industry and investment policy. Separate discussions were also held with senior representatives of Siemens and Daimler Benz about their operations in Australia and plans for further investment in this region.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I can understand why Senator Button decided not to be here to read this statement; I understand that he is meeting with an Italian delegation and I do not make light of that. But the statement itself tells us where Senator Button went, whom he met and, in a very broad and descriptive way, claims results. It is fairly difficult to spell out precisely what those results might be. The thing that bothered me about the statement was the passage at the end of the first page which I think reflects the quite extraordinary complacency and, indeed, smugness of Ministers of this Government in the economic area. We find Senator Button saying, through the mouth of Senator Tate:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>I think that the excellent atmosphere which pervaded the meeting may reflect the respect which Japanese Ministers and officials feel for the achievements made in recent years by Australia, by the unions, business and the Government, in tackling many of the economic problems we face. </PARA>
<PARA>He then takes a passing slap at the Opposition, which is fairly characteristic of Senator Button, and he suggests that the Opposition:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . fail to grasp, that the union movement, many in the business community and of course this Government, have a clear idea of the new directions that must be taken to ensure that Australia can compete and thrive in the 1990s, and that great strides have been taken towards laying the foundations of a more modern, innovative and competitive economy. </PARA>
<PARA>That is a very worrying statement. Two years ago we were told by the Treasurer, Mr Keating, that we faced the status of a banana republic. The pressure on the Government seems to have dropped away. The main cause for this seems to be the increase in our commodity prices, which is entirely fortuitous. Nothing that this Government has done has affected the price of bauxite, aluminium, copper, wool, wheat, or any of the other commodities which, while still having a distressing and dangerous level of foreign debt accumulating year by year, have kept us from total panic stations. The truth is that, at the moment, there is a downward turn in the price of our basic commodities. Anyone with half a brain can see that this country will be in the most extraordinary difficulties. </PARA>
<PARA> Today, Senator Button and Senator Maguire in their speeches in this place reflected some of that complacency which is preventing this Government from coming to grips with the task which it must attack if we are to have any hope of avoiding a crisis in this country. For example, Senator Button referred to a passing comment of Sir Arvi Parbo made in about September or October last year, that it was good doing business in Australia. I made some comment and, in fact, I discussed that comment with Sir Arvi Parbo, because I must say that I thought at the time it was out of line with the frequent warnings that that businessman has given us about the fundamental imbalances in our economy. If we look at the first edition of a magazine published by the National Australia Bank, which I am sure all honourable senators would have received, we see Sir Arvi Parbo's February 1989 assessment was that this country faced 20 years of restructuring. We will not get the restructuring which is required in this country if we have the sort of complacent lead which is being provided by the Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce (Senator Button) in the statement which has been put down before us today. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Maguire, in his contribution to the debate this afternoon, referred to the United Kingdom and the difficulties it is facing with respect to inflation. When we look at the figures on the chart which I have, which relate to the indebtedness of countries around the world, we find that we are included in the dangerously high debt countries, along with Bolivia, Argentina, Peru, Turkey, India, Israel and Pakistan with a very high ratio of our debt as a multiple of export earnings. Our debt is 2.4 times our export earnings according to a table published back in 1986 and it would not have improved since then. The United Kingdom has a ratio of 0.7 and a little more room to move than we have. Japan has a ratio of 0.7 and Germany has a ratio of 0.6. This country, which is classified as being dangerously in debt, cannot afford the sort of smugness we have had from the Government benches this afternoon and in this statement. </PARA>
<PARA> I remind the Minister again of an assessment, quite independent that of the Liberal or the National parties, contained in the Business Review Weekly in an article prepared by Syntec published on 24 February which shows the comparative changes in unit labour costs. Senator Button went to Japan. He has talked about the satisfaction expressed by the Japanese in tackling basic problems; yet in Japan we find that unit labour costs are negative whereas in Australia the rise is the highest of the countries shown. Compared with Japan, Germany, France, Canada, Italy, the United States of America, the United Kingdom and Sweden, our rise in unit labour costs is the highest of all. I stress that Syntec is respected as an independent economic commentator. It says that we deserve a better explanation than the one we have been getting from the Hawke Government on the shocks that have been received on a fairly regular basis in relation to our external account position. Contemplating the chart, to which I have already referred, might help. It tells us that the surge in imports now undermining Australia's external account is not just a matter of an ebullient demand spilling abroad, as the Treasurer would have it; it is due at least as much to the fact that Australia's unit cost of production is deteriorating so rapidly compared with that of our trading partners, that increasingly it is a simple commercial proposition to get supplies from overseas. </PARA>
<PARA> When one looks at the productivity trends published by the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) in December last one finds that in the current triennium, 1987-1990, Australia's productivity is expected to show negative growth as against positive growth in all those countries with which we compare ourselves. The OECD average of positive growth is 1.2 per cent, whereas Australia's negative average is minus 0.2 per cent. That is fundamental and says a lot about the way in which the system is operating in this country. The smug expressions of satisfaction about where the Government and the economy are at is the worst possible news because we will not get the pressure for change which is absolutely essential whilst that smugness persists. </PARA>
<PARA> I remind the Government that it gave similar expressions of satisfaction back in 1987 when there was a similar mission. At that time there were some adverse comments from the leader of the Japanese mission on his return to Tokyo. Indeed, I raised that matter with Senator Button in the Senate just two years ago. On his return to Tokyo, the leader of the delegation expressed doubts about prospects for the Australian economy and he identified the uncertain exchange rate, interest rates, commodity prices and the level of foreign debt as factors which would discourage investment. Whilst we have had an increase in commodity prices-the factor over which we have no control and which certainly affects our exchange rate-our interest rates and our foreign debt have grown worse since that time. The so-called restructuring reforms which are part of the current national wage case will deliver some efficiency gains in a narrow band of industries, but I confidently predict that, overall they will simply deliver another across the board wage rise without regard to productivity change in this country. </PARA>
<PARA> I think it is absolutely inimical to Australia's interests to have the sort of expression of smugness which is contained in this statement put down on behalf of Senator Button today. Whilst the Government retains that degree of complacency, it will not maintain the pressure for structural reform which is absolutely essential if we are to avoid a real crisis in this country. I remind the Government that in May 1987 the Treasurer told the people of Australia that the great challenge for the Government was to obtain a more flexible labour market and a more flexible wages outcome. At that time he said that what was required was a wages system which delivered differential outcomes in different industries according to their capacity to pay. To this point-two national wage cases later-we have no sign of that emerging. The award restructuring process has reached the point at which, as Mr Kelty has said, it will deliver the same wage rise to 98 per cent of the Australian work force. This is not the time for a lengthy debate on this matter, but it is vital in terms of Australia's long term welfare. The significance of that was explained in great detail by a respected trade unionist. In 1986 Mr Charles Fitzgibbon gave papers to the Productivity Council of New South Wales and to the Economic Planning Advisory Council. Anyone who has not read those papers should do so, because they set out in great detail the relationship between differential rates of pay and the encouragement of excellence and improvement of the way we do business in Australia. It is extraordinary that Mr Charles Fitzgibbon can see this so clearly, that in May 1987 the Treasurer could diagnose so clearly what was required and yet we still get continuing expressions of government satisfaction about a total lack of progress since that time. </PARA>
<PARA> One would hope that the tour of the Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce, involving countries of commercial significance to Australia-countries which have a lot to offer us in terms of technology, investment, the taking of our exports and the provision of high quality goods and productive equipment for Australia-and the optimistic tone of the report will be vindicated by the results which flow from it. But if the optimism about the meetings held by Senator Button is based on the same sort of consideration as the optimism he expresses about the respect that people have for our tackling of many of our economic problems, it may well be that the whole statement is worth very little indeed. The fact that the Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce in the Government of Australia in 1989 can be as complacent as Senator Button showed himself to be in both the urgency debate this afternoon and in the terminology of this report is very bad news for Australia. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The ministerial statement by the Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce (Senator Button) relates to his visits in January and February this year to Japan, the Philippines, the United States, Italy, France and the Federal Republic of Germany. As the report sets out, he undertook a number of tasks. I wish to focus on those items concerned with trade. Since part of that visit, at least, was with the Asian area and concerned Asian-Pacific trade, I think it is odd that the report is not more expansive about the views that the Government wishes to express as to where trade in that area is headed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I say that because, at the same time as Senator Button was in those countries, the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) was also travelling and making some quite extraordinary statements. I think it is very difficult to know the way in which one would want to take those statements because they could be read as giving strong promotion to a bilateral trade context or even to the provision of an Asian Pacific trading bloc. The difficulty with those statements made by the Prime Minister at that particular time is that the current round of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) talks is in abeyance-a series of talks that are very delicately poised. The basic dispute at the moment is between those countries whose trade is based on agriculture and those countries whose trade is based on industry or services. Of course, amongst the latter group, the United States has been leading the thrust trying to get some type of agreement under GATT with regard to services. Quite rightly, Australia-particularly through the Cairns Group that this Government has sponsored and promoted; a very telling and useful group in the international trading arena-by and large has been saying that while there will not be any moves on the services front until there is some move on the agricultural front, we can get some better regime for international commodity trading. </PARA>
<PARA> Having regard to the Prime Minister's statements, I would have hoped that Senator Button might spell out a little bit more clearly whether the Government intends to go down the line of an Asian trading bloc. In other words, it has made a judgment that the GATT process is dead and we might as well move into a trading bloc arrangement as, of course, the United States and Canada are doing. The European Community will also do that in terms of its One Europe Act of 1992, and we know that trading blocs are current on the agendas of a very large number of countries. </PARA>
<PARA> I am not disputing that one way or the other. However, I hope that we will get a clearer view from the Government as to where that is taking us. I think we should still be attempting the exercise through GATT. Undoubtedly, if the world breaks up into trading blocs it will be to the devastation of many economies, particularly Third World economies and economies such as ours that are still based largely on agriculture. </PARA>
<PARA> It seems to me that at least in some part the last GATT Round showed an inkling that people acknowledged the problem and, in doing so, were willing to go forward. One would have hoped that in that round there would have been bigger moves on the part of the United States, as a main player in this area, particularly in the area of services, to come in on the side of agricultural reform. However, we are also fully aware that in the United States internal political pressures are such that seemingly not even the new Administration feels itself able to go beyond the rhetoric that President Bush has been using in the last few days and actually move to some concrete and substantial movements under GATT for a liberalisation and a lowering of the international rates of protection. I thought that that part of Senator Button's ministerial statement dealing with the trip to Japan and the Philippines was disappointing. </PARA>
<PARA> I now turn to that part of the statement dealing with the European sector, which is much more promising. I am particularly pleased with the emphasis placed on the Italian sector. It is interesting to note that Senator Button is unable to be in the chamber because he is engaged in ministerial duties with a visiting Italian delegation. The relationship between Australia and Italy has been one of the bright spots on the Government's negotiating table in the past few years. It has moved ahead in leaps and bounds. That is an important move for Australia. The reason is relatively obvious for those who have followed the internal operations of the European Community. </PARA>
<PARA> Essentially, with the accession to the European Community of Spain and Portugal and, a few years before that, of Greece, together with Italy, which was one of the founding members, the focus of attention in the European Community moved from Germany towards the Mediterranean countries. In terms of their agriculture, the Mediterranean countries are not helped one whit by the common agricultural policy of the Community. Traditionally, those countries have small holdings and those small holdings are not supported by the common agricultural policy. It is the larger producers who get most of the money out of that, particularly producers in France and Germany. France and Germany are relatively happy with it, but nobody else could possibly be, particularly the Mediterranean countries. That is why it is vitally important that Australia enhance its relationships with Italy, which is the leader of those Mediterranean countries within the European Community. I think it is as bold and barefaced as that and it is in our interests to continue that line. </PARA>
<PARA> In response, Italy has shown itself, particularly in its emerging economy, to be a very powerful economic force in the world. Certainly, in terms of the much more venturesome investment policies it has had compared with those of other European countries we are well placed, particularly given the fact that there has been a large amount of Italian migration to this country since the Second World War. Many of our major industries are dependent upon the Italian-Australian community. I mention one that is very important to me-the sugar industry. I grew up in a sugar town, which makes one realise the enormous contribution Italians have made to that industry in Australia. Of course, they are now moving out of the agricultural area. Their major investments in Australia and other countries have been through their technology applications, particularly in the area of scientific and medical instruments, biotechnology and machinery. If the optimistic note in Senator Button's statement is followed through, it will be a great advantage to Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> That part of the report dealing with Senator Button's visit to France and the Federal Republic of Germany also gives us a modicum of hope. When one reads between the lines one still finds a fair amount of frustration, particularly in regard to the French and their operations. Looking at the difficulties we have had in the trading area with the French, especially in the last 18 months, it is probably a good reason for us to go back there and keep talking. The German aspect is useful. I hope that at least some of those talks with possible investors, particularly Daimler Benz and Siemens, to which Senator Button referred at the end of his statement, may bear more fruit. There has been an on and off investment exercise in Australia by a number of major German firms. We hope that there will be a continuing and more pointed investment project. </PARA>
<PARA> I make one comment on that exercise of investment that is important: Australia needs to keep in mind, as I must admit it has in the GATT Round, that we are seen by many countries, particularly those that have a fragile and weak economy, such as many Third World countries that do not have the resources or capacity or skills to engage in many of the international negotiations that we do, as undertaking negotiations not only on behalf of Australia as a major agricultural producer but also on behalf of many of those countries that are massively in debt. Australia has a role to play in that respect and should see its role as being a positive and constructive one to enable those countries to move out of their debt-ridden position. Previously I have given the very telling example of the entire continent of Africa paying out more money every year in repayments on international debt than it gets in international aid. It is a net supplier of resources to the rest of the world and yet it is strapped for resources. </PARA>
<PARA> The world is in an extraordinary situation. It is important that, when Australia engages in such international exercises, it keeps in mind that we speak not only on behalf of ourselves as an agricultural exporting country but also on behalf of other countries which are heavily dependent on agriculture. Unless we can get a more equitable trading arrangement through GATT, I am afraid that the other moves Senator Button has tried to introduce under his ministerial responsibility for industry, technology and commerce will be of very little use. We are still in an agricultural mode. It will take us a very long while to move beyond that. While Senator Button has tried as enthusiastically as he can to move us along, it will be a long time coming, even if he is successful. In that intermediate period it is very important for us and many other countries that an intensive effort be made with the United States and the European Community to convince them that the problem of debt can be solved only by a liberalisation of the trading regimes in agricultural commodities. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I seek leave to make a statement on behalf of the Minister for Defence (Mr Beazley) relating to the Defence Intelligence Organisation and I seek leave to incorporate the statement in Hansard.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The statement read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA> I wish to announce today some changes to our Defence intelligence arrangements. At present we have the Joint Intelligence Organization which combines military expertise from the three Services and civilian analysts in an organisation that provides both current military intelligence and longer-term strategic assessments, and we also have a small intelligence group established in the Australian Defence Force Headquarters to provide direct operational support to the ADF. From 27 March these functions will be combined in JIO. Later in the year-when the necessary legal changes are made-JIO will become the Defence Intelligence Organisation, or DIO. The new name will better reflect its central role in the preparation of intelligence assessments for Defence and the provision of operational intelligence for the ADF. </PARA>
<PARA> These changes are part of the process of developing our self-reliant defence effort, which has been the central theme of this Government's defence policy. For Australia, high quality intelligence assessment of our security environment and assessing the possibilities for military threat is a front-line defence capability. It is at the core of our defence planning and guides the decisions we make about our force structure, the location of our forces, and their levels of readiness. </PARA>
<PARA> Good intelligence is also critical to our military effectiveness in the event of conflict. Australia is investing heavily in modern high technology intelligence collection and surveillance systems. We are also developing the communications and data systems necessary to use intelligence effectively and to provide timely support to operational commands. We have introduced new command and control arrangements under the Chief of the Defence Force for the conduct of independent operations for the defence of Australia. By combining our national Defence intelligence assessment effort in the one organisation we will strengthen JIO's central role in monitoring Australia's regional environment and preparing defence assessments. At the same time we will ensure that the Australian Defence Force Headquarters and the functional commanders are provided with an integrated and up-to-date operational intelligence service. </PARA>
<PARA> In periods of tension or hostilities the demand for intelligence to support the planning and conduct of operations and to protect against enemy action will grow dramatically and the system for providing that intelligence and in forming appropriate countermeasures has to be able to expand accordingly without the need for disruptive reorganisation or demarcation disputes over responsibilities and allocation of resources. </PARA>
<PARA> Additionally the system that meets the needs of the CDF and other senior Defence policy makers, has to also provide the senior commanders of the ADF at the operational level with the intelligence they need but cannot provide by employing their own resources. </PARA>
<PARA> Existing arrangements for intelligence support to the ADF have evolved over the last twenty years. They therefore do not necessarily match contemporary military strategy and defence self-reliance nor meet fully the ADF's requirements. </PARA>
<PARA> For these reasons we will gain considerably from integrating the ADF Headquarters intelligence staff into JIO. It means that instead of a small group in the headquarters responsible for operational intelligence, the military planners in the headquarters will now be able to draw directly on the full resources of JIO-without the need to go through co-ordinating channels. And the interaction can occur at a number of levels which greatly helps operational efficiency in a crisis situation. </PARA>
<PARA> The new JIO and-later-DIO will be headed by Major General John Baker who took up his appointment as Director JIO last week. General Baker will have the task of overseeing the transition from JIO to DIO and he will be responsible for the conduct of a comprehensive review of the arrangements for the supply and management of intelligence to support the command structure of the Australian Defence Force. That review will be conducted during this year and there will be scope for further adjustments to our Defence intelligence arrangements in the light of General Baker's report. </PARA>
<PARA> In announcing these changes I want to pay tribute to the excellent work done by the Joint Intelligence Organization since its formation in early 1970. JIO has a well-deserved reputation for carefully-considered and authoritative judgments of military and security situations, and this is particularly so in its work in the area of warning time, which continues to be a poorly understood concept in Australian defence thinking. I think it is poorly understood in part because people think about warning time as an exercise in prophecy. They resile from any notion that we can predict the future and they draw on a whole wealth of historical experience to demonstrate that surprise is at least as common in human history as accurate prediction. But that is not what warning time is about. Rather, the Australian concept of warning time is about calculating the possibilities for a major attack on us by placing limits on what is physically possible in terms of the forces and equipment available to a putative enemy, and the time that would be required to improve them. </PARA>
<PARA> This leads to a central point in our defence planning. There have been, and still are, possibilities for lower levels of conflict in our region that could arise with very little warning and which could be very demanding of our defence effort. I make no predictions about these, nor do I assess any of the possibilities as being particularly likely; but simple prudence demands that we have the military capacity to deal with them. This Government's defence policy has paid critical attention to these contingencies, whilst still maintaining the skills and equipment necessary for expansion to meet higher levels of threat. </PARA>
<PARA> What is important in considering such possibilities is to determine the limits to the military capacity that might be employed against us. This is not an exercise in prediction. Rather, it is a matter of counting and measuring regional military forces and assessing how they might be most effectively employed against us should presently favourable political intentions towards us change. In this effort we have the advantage of access to modern intelligence systems and techniques that allow us very great confidence in our assessments. These systems and techniques are at the very heart of JIO's capabilities. </PARA>
<PARA> Intent to use force is, of course, rather more difficult to measure. We have examples in recent history where governments have seen military preparations but misjudged the intentions of their adversary. There are less well-known examples of the converse-where both capabilities and intent have been properly judged and deterred. But again, simple prudence requires that we acknowledge the possibility of misjudgement of intent and that we are prepared to deal with the consequences of miscalculation. This reinforces the need to have the military capacity to deal with situations which could arise in fairly short time-scales-which, as I have stressed, has been a consistent theme of this government's defence policy. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to say something here about the claim that the Fiji coup represented some kind of intelligence failure. Of course we didn't know that there was going to be a coup, and very few others did either. Indeed, according to Rabuka's account he did not finally make up his mind until just beforehand. Thus, the precise prediction of such a decision is not possible and we cannot expect intelligence to do so. What good intelligence assessment does is to help to understand the circumstances that give rise to such events and to guide our policy responses. I make the further point that, while deeply tragic, what happened in Fiji did not represent any fundamental undermining of our national security. There was no consequent military threat to Australia, or any risk of threat. The only defence response required was to position our forces so that they could assist in the evacuation of our citizens should this be necessary. And I would add that-contrary to some reports-the ADF carried out this task efficiently and with great professionalism. </PARA>
<PARA> In considering possibilities for serious assault on Australia, we necessarily enter the world of speculation and assumption. This is sometimes a recipe for all kinds of loose-if imaginative-thinking about how Australia might be attacked with massive military force at some future time. But what we need are careful assessments of what would be necessary for sustained assault against Australia. We need to compare that to what is available in the region now and we need to judge how long it might take for any country to acquire the capabilities that would be necessary. Over 15 years ago such a judgement was commissioned by a previous Labor Government-and it was parodied as ``the no threat for 15 years'' assessment. But, in fact, the careful work of the then JIO, which was endorsed by the Defence Committee, in the Strategic Basis document of 1973, has been borne out by subsequent events. </PARA>
<PARA> It is not sensible for a Defence Minister to speculate about friendly countries attacking us at some future time, but I think it is important in the interests of an informed public debate that I set down in general terms the broad conclusions of some of the work done by JIO intelligence staffs and Defence strategic planning staffs as it has been conducted over many years. A central conclusion is that a very considerable military force would be required to launch and sustain any kind of major assault against Australia. If, for a moment, we put aside motive and contemplate the kind of force that would be necessary to mount a sizeable assault against Australian territory, we are talking about a minimum of a divisional group-that is an organised and balanced force of some 15,000-20,000 men. </PARA>
<PARA> Some might argue that such forces are already in existence in the region. Even if we accept this, those forces have little relevance unless they are deployable across the formidable realities of the sea/air gap to our north. The distances involved are many times greater than the English Channel, which has been so effective in deterring invasion of Britain for the last 900 years. An adversary seeking to invade Australia would first have to dominate the sea and air approaches to our continent and sustain that control for the period of conflict. This would be a most difficult task requiring massive amounts of specialised and long-range air power and naval forces-and forward logistic bases close to Australia capable of supporting such forces. These things are not available now to any regional power. They could not be acquired quickly or easily and they certainly could not be acquired without our knowing about them. </PARA>
<PARA> To take this point a little further, we might consider the kind of airpower that would be necessary to control the sea/air gap. We are not talking here about short-range fighters or ground attack aircraft that are in plentiful supply in many parts of the world. We are talking about advanced long-range surveillance and strike aircraft equipped with the most modern weapons and avionic systems. Australia is one of the few countries to have these in significant numbers. It takes time to acquire such aircraft and even longer to know how to use and support them. As the Australian Minister for Defence, I know only too well how difficult and time-consuming it is to develop the highly skilled manpower necessary to operate and support such aircraft. And yet I consider myself very fortunate in that Australia can draw on a population that is well-educated and technically competent, and certainly so on any regional standards. </PARA>
<PARA> There are many assumptions in this kind of analysis and I have given but two examples of the kind of problems any country would face in contemplating a major assault on Australia. It will be properly pointed out that an adversary may well see maritime harassment or interdiction as a more profitable means of putting military pressure on Australia. Indeed, this consideration is reflected in the emphasis that Australia placed on developing its maritime capabilities. There is nothing in the region that matches our maritime combination of P3 aircraft, submarines, surface combatants and long-range strike aircraft. And this Government is putting in place a force structure for the 1990s and beyond that will improve impressively our maritime forces with the new construction submarines and the ANZAC frigates. </PARA>
<PARA> It might also be properly pointed out that it is difficult to conceive of a motive for any kind of major assault on Australian territory. Again this is acknowledged by the Government. But we cannot assume that any and all possible adversaries would reach the same conclusion in all future circumstances. This is why we need a dedicated organisation in the JIO which devotes its considerable talents to constantly monitoring Australia's strategic circumstances. </PARA>
<PARA> This leads to what, I think, is a central conclusion that should be drawn from the work on the idea of warning time. It is not sensible to think of warning time as a finite period in which we will not be faced with military threat of any kind. Rather, the concept provides a basis on which we can assess our own priorities for defence preparation and the time-scales for our own defence effort. Should there be a trend in regional defence preparation towards the development of substantial power projection capabilities, we would have to consider what we would need to do to maintain the relativity of military strength we now enjoy. Monitoring these trends and assessing our own requirements are thus central to our defence planning effort. </PARA>
<PARA> Under the new arrangements for Defence intelligence these responsibilities for longer-term assessment will continue to be at the core of the work of JIO, and later DIO. What we are doing is to add to those core responsibilities the vital task of ensuring that the ADF is provided with comprehensive and timely intelligence in support of operations. This will include not only supplying more timely current intelligence to the Maritime, Land and Air Commands, but also developing a more integrated approach to foreign intelligence collection with information on the north of Australia and Australia's territories. By combining the major responsibility of these intelligence functions in the one organisation we are ensuring that the totality of our defence intelligence needs are properly met. It remains only for me to congratulate General Baker on his appointment, to wish him well with the tasks that lie before him and to thank the staff of JIO for the ability, dedication and commitment they have shown over the years. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the statement. </PARA>
<PARA>The statement which has been brought down by the Government today relating to the reorganisation of the Defence Intelligence Organisation is welcomed by the Opposition. It has taken a long time to implement. We have been waiting for action for some time. In brief, this boils down to an integration of the Australian Defence Force headquarters intelligence staff into the Joint Intelligence Organisation (JIO) whereby the military planners in the headquarters, as the Minister for Defence (Mr Beazley) said in his statement, will now be able to draw directly on the full resources of JIO without the need to go through coordinating channels. This is to take place on 27 March, and later in the year when the necessary legal formalities have been completed the organisation will change its name to the Defence Intelligence Organisation (DIO). It is to be headed by Major-General John Baker, who has been given the task of comprehensively reviewing the arrangements for the supply and management of intelligence to support the command structure of the Australian Defence Force. In the paper the Minister has gone on to discuss matters other than intelligence and I intend to do the same, while remaining relevant to the matter of the statement itself. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition welcomes the appointment of General Baker to this position and wishes him well in his new appointment. We hope that only good will come of this reorganisation. It is essential to remember how important the intelligence function is to the operation of an effective defence force. In referring to Australia's defence and the part played by intelligence in that effort the Minister has failed to mention that we cannot fulfil this task on our own. We need close and continuing reliance on and cooperation with our allies. I draw the Senate's attention to the serious impact which New Zealand's action has had both on its own intelligence efforts and on the cooperation in our region of the allied effort. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the things that concern the Opposition is how well this reorganisation will be implemented. Will the new intelligence organisation be properly funded? It is a reasonable question in the light of this Government's continuing record on defence matters where the wording and phraseology has been acceptable-in many cases it has been very acceptable-but the grim reality has been that the performance has not been there and nor has the funding. If there is not funding in an area such as defence, one might just as well spit into the wind. It will not do a scrap of good in seeking to defend this country if all one does is talk. </PARA>
<PARA> The reduced capacity of our defence forces makes it doubtful that any intelligence gathering organisation will be used to maximum effect. The successive, continuing and savage cuts to our defence forces in the operations and personnel areas have meant that the capability to implement action is seriously flawed. I fear that that is likely to worsen seriously in the near future. Yet we find on page 2 of the Minister's statement that the Minister refers to defence planning in this way:</PARA>
<PARA>There have been, and still are, possibilities for lower levels of conflict in our region that could arise with very little warning and which could be very demanding of our defence effort. </PARA>
<PARA>That, of course, is exactly what the Opposition has been telling the Minister for all the years he has occupied his position. The Minister then says in his statement:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . simple prudence demands that we have the military capacity to deal with them. This Government's defence policy has paid critical attention to these contingencies, whilst still maintaining the skills and equipment necessary for expansion to meet higher levels of threat. </PARA>
<PARA>Once again, it is a case where the words are right but the action is wrong. The Government has not paid critical attention to these contingencies because it has allowed skill levels in the defence forces to diminish. It has done that in several ways. First, it has allowed through the massive and haemorrhaging losses to our defence forces a dilution of our experience levels. There are soldiers, NCOs and officers all with reduced experience levels. The position will only get worse for the next decade or more. The position is serious and the Government is directly responsible for allowing the losses to continue at such a rate over its period in government. </PARA>
<PARA> Secondly, the Government, through financial cuts, has reduced training at unit level so that units can no longer get the operational experience they need. Thirdly, by plugging the manpower holes as a result of the personnel losses, officers in particular have had tremendous disruption to their career development and once again are doing a little bit here and a little bit there and inevitably their skill levels will be affected. The Government is directly responsible for that, yet the Minister claims that it is maintaining the skills necessary to expand to meet higher levels of threat. The Government is not even able to provide the skills and equipment necessary to deal with a low level of conflict within our region. The stark fact is that low levels of threat are very manpower intensive, yet the Government has lost trained people and cut manning levels. As a result, soldiers, sailors and airmen are overworked and in many cases less experienced than they should be. This flows directly from the Government's actions, and those actions speak louder than words. </PARA>
<PARA> The cutbacks in the defence budget have been such that the Government is now planning a major political exercise-I would not call it a military exercise because it has to be political-in spending some $100m on Exercise Kangaroo 1989, at the expense of practically all other training in the forces. It will take most of the operations vote for 1988-89 and I believe all the exercise funding for 1989-90. Once Exercise Kangaroo 89 has been completed, that will be it until the end of the financial year 1989-90. That is the position in which we find ourselves. It is particularly important to realise that there is grave doubt within the forces that this exercise will be very effective in testing our defence capabilities. It is much more of a showpiece and is doubtful in its long term value to the forces in testing their own abilities and skills. These forces would be much better served by smaller exercises without the same attention of the Minister and his media manipulators. It will be a good thing for flamboyant appearances by defence Ministers who like the toys of war, but I have grave concerns about the long term cost-effectiveness in testing Australia's defences. </PARA>
<PARA> When one thinks of testing our defences, a good test occurred in Exercise Morris Dance, where Australia deployed forces to Fiji to try to rescue Australian tourists stranded during the first coup. The Minister refers to the Fiji affair on page 3 of the statement:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . the ADF carried out this task efficiently and with great professionalism. </PARA>
<PARA>I have no quarrel with that. My quarrel is how effective the ADF would have been. It was efficient in getting ready and getting away. It did it all with great professionalism, which is exactly what this country would expect of the Australian Defence Force. The Force has had a long and proud history of efficiency and professionalism. But there are grave doubts about how effective it could have been in action. </PARA>
<PARA> The Force went away with 120 men. They were told not to take their machine guns. There was no helicopter carrier. There was inadequate operations training with the Navy beforehand. There was no training experience in evacuating civilians. The maps were inadequate. There was little or no coordination with our ally, New Zealand, in the exercise. There was no surgical team, and personal equipment of all kinds was insufficient. That is the story of the Force that we spent to Fiji to carry out this task efficiently and with great professionalism. I thank God that the Force did not need to go into action and fight an opposing force. This should at least be a good lesson as to how unprepared this Government has allowed our defence forces to become. </PARA>
<PARA> As a lesson from the Fiji exercise, the Government needs to take on board that one does not go off on a picnic in these exercises; one deploys for the worst case. That means that adequate numbers of properly trained personnel are sent away fully equipped for the worst situation they might have to deal with. Our personnel have suffered because of major cuts in the personnel and operations area, yet the Minister would try and tell us that he is doing the right thing by them. </PARA>
<PARA> As I understand it, the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) is champing at the bit in his keenness to announce a date to send the Force to Namibia to represent Australia in the United Nations force there. He is keen to get into the action. I think there is a bit of competition between him and the Minister for Defence Science and Personnel (Mrs Kelly) as to who will send the Force on its way and say `Jolly good show, chaps'. He is also very keen to travel around our region, offering the assistance of our troops, if need be, in Cambodia. He is now reportedly lending a sympathetic ear to the Prime Minister of Papua New Guinea promising him troops if there is any escalation of the problems with the military in that country. The Prime Minister is ready to use the forces when it suits him in making token gestures around the world. Perhaps he does not remember just how badly he has treated the forces and how unable they would be to cope with those requirements. There is no way we could give extended assistance to any neighbour in our region as the forces are currently constituted, with their present manning levels and the cuts that have taken place in their training and equipment. On page 4 of the Minister's statement he says:</PARA>
<PARA>We are talking about advanced long-range surveillance and strike aircraft equipped with the most modern weapons and avionic systems . . . It takes time to acquire such aircraft and even longer to know how to use and support them. As the Australian Minister for Defence, I know only too well how difficult and time-consuming it is to develop the highly skilled manpower necessary to operate and support such aircraft. And yet I consider myself very fortunate in that Australia can draw on a population that is well-educated and technically competent . . . </PARA>
<PARA>That is the Minister's usual passing reference to the personnel who are so vital to any use of the equipment on which he has staked his reputation. In the White Paper on defence, and in subsequent statements he has made, he has been prepared to make only token gestures to our manpower, the training of whom is very difficult and time-consuming. Yet they are vital to operate this equipment. We are lucky that we have a well-educated and technically competent population. The people who make up our defence forces are the people whom the Government is so undervaluing. It is so lacking in sympathy for them that it is not prepared to improve, for their benefit and for the benefit of their families, their pay and conditions of service. It is not prepared to provide the political leadership that they need. How often do we hear the Minister for Defence make a proper statement about these people, who serve their country so well? They are still leaving the defence forces. They do not believe that the Minister for Defence, Mr Beazley, cares much about them. They think that even if Mrs Kelly cared about them-and we are not too sure about that-she does not have the financial means to do much for them. </PARA>
<PARA> As I said earlier, the Minister's statement on the Defence Intelligence Organisation is welcome, but our intelligence-getting is only as good as our ability to make use of it. This Minister, who has reorganised the defence industry and who has made big strides in regard to the capital procurement problem, has failed. In spite of the positives he has failed. He has failed because the imbalance in the defence budget, which he has been directly and personally responsible for, has led to an inexperienced and depleted Force, struggling to keep going. The commanders occupy too much of their time juggling an impossibly limited amount of resources and manpower. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister has also failed because he has refused to perform the radical surgery needed on that monster across the lake, known as the Department of Defence. These will be major blots against his reputation as a Defence Minister forever. The reputation that he could have aspired to as a successful Defence Minister has not been achieved. His deep interest in defence matters, which we have all known about for so long-therefore, much was expected of him-has led only to a disappointing and flawed performance as Minister for Defence. </PARA>

Our opposition to joint facilities, American dependence and participation in intelligence processes which render us a nuclear target is well known and we do not withdraw from that. However, we welcome such reorganisation as will heighten our intelligence competence. We congratulate General Baker and his staff and wish him and his organisation well in their critical role. Certainly there is an increasing potential for low level conflict in our region. Intelligence is vital to appropriate government responses. It is the view of the Australian Democrats that it is unlikely that military responses will be the most appropriate ones, rather that diplomatic and other responses before the event will be more appropriate. We acknowledge, however, the critical role of intelligence in either response.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Democrats have been very critical of this Government's record on defence. I have moved motions, which have been carried in the Senate, which have been extremely critical of the Minister for Defence (Mr Beazley) and the Government but never of those in service. I recently moved an urgency motion calling for profound changes to our military organisation, funding and alliances. That would imply significant changes to our intelligence organisations. We see our forces as tragically demoralised and our nation as virtually defenceless. We have called for urgent and serious Government action. Such calls were recently rejected by both Government and Opposition. If this ministerial statement, and the organisational changes that it elaborates, move us in any way in that direction, that is, to a more secure Australia without subservience to any super-power and without rendering Australians nuclear targets, the Australian Democrats welcome them. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Opposition welcomes and supports this statement, which announces that the Joint Intelligence Organisation (JIO) will be combined with the military intelligence group within the headquarters of the Australian Defence Force and will operate as an advisory group to the ADF. So far so good. We would like to know though, what wider ambit the new defence intelligence organisation will have with respect to providing advice to the Prime Minister and the government of the day. But they are details, I guess, that will come along later.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is absolutely impossible to overstate the importance of intelligence in the security of a country. One must have high-grade, accurate and timely intelligence. It is something that is often overlooked by a lot of people in a discussion of defence. It is absolutely important that one knows what is going on in the region. Australia, of course, has a longstanding obligation, as part of the Western democracies, to provide the intelligence for the region in which we live. In return for the intelligence we gather here, we benefit from intelligence from more distant parts of the world, from the European, North American and other regions. It is, indeed, the only way we can obtain our intelligence supplies. It is quite beyond us to run a worldwide intelligence network with our forces. </PARA>
<PARA> I return to my starting point that the provision of adequate, timely, high-grade and accurate intelligence is absolutely vital to us. One of the points that I also comment on is that the Government of the day must be prepared to act upon that intelligence. If one looks at military history over the centuries, one will find that even professional military personnel have not always been prepared to accept intelligence advice when it has flown in the face of their plans or preconceptions as to what the situation was. One of the classic cases in the recent past, in 1944, was, of course, Operation Market Garden. The British Army tried to seize a bridge at Arnhem. At the last minute it received intelligence reports that there were two Panzer divisions actually deployed in the drop zone. That just did not fit in, after all the planning that had been done; the aircraft were loaded and ready to go. So the professionals at the time failed to recognise the importance of that intelligence. I do not know how many thousands or tens of thousands of men were killed and wounded as a consequence of the reluctance of the people in authority to accept that intelligence when it was relevant. </PARA>
<PARA> Expanding on that theme, I also have grave reservations as to what governments of any complexion would do. We have been living with the Australian Labor Party's no threat doctrine. I wonder what would happen if we had a threat given to the government of the day by the relevant intelligence organisations. I am not sure that it would respond to it or that it would increase its expenditure on defence matters, or start its preparedness going so that we met that threat. I think the Government would rather rationalise it away and talk its way out of it. If that happens there is really no point in having any intelligence organisations whatsoever. </PARA>
<PARA> I hope that the reorganisation of JIO with the organic military intelligence tri-service group that we already have in ADF headquarters leads to an upgrading in the performance-not that I think it is necessarily bad at present, but it is no secret that the intelligence gathering capabilities of Australia have been degraded under the present Labor Government. We need to go no further than the Fiji coups to demonstrate that point. </PARA>
<PARA> The statement by the Minister for Defence (Mr Beazley) is in his usual bombastic, self-congratulatory style. One of the points I take exception to is the way he uses the statement to justify the no threat doctrine. Quite a bit of the statement deals with warning times. The whole reason behind warning times and the doctrine of no threat for 10 or 15 years that the Labor Party has come up with is to justify the reduction in expenditure on defence preparedness and, therefore, national security that is so much part of a Labor government. There is no other reason for it. </PARA>
<PARA> The lessons of history show that one cannot predict the timing of threats and the nature of them. One must know what is going on. One must take the steps that are reasonably within one's power to cope with it. One does not sit back and try to define the threat and then meet it. To do that is simply to invite some sort of attack. The central part of this paper is a justification of the head in the sand approach, the no threat doctrine that we have seen fail so many times in history. No matter how good our intelligence is, if we do not have any defence forces to use that intelligence it is all in vain; it is all pointless. </PARA>
<PARA> What we have seen under the Labor Party is the three, admittedly small but very professional, defence forces-the Australian Army, Navy and Air Force-reduced to impotence through lack of funding and lack of leadership from this Government. We have seen 45,000 men and women leave, out of a force structure of 70,000, in about 5 1/2 years under this Government. The really crucial thing is the loss of the experienced professionals, the middle-ranking officers and the senior non-commissioned officers, the people in whom the actual professional expertise of the three Services is vested. The men and women with 10 and 15 years' service, the people who know and can teach in the light of that experience the new recruits coming on, have all left. They do not want a bar of this Labor Government because they know that it does not value what they are prepared to do for this country. To pick up the words of Senator McLean, who preceded me in this debate, we now have three defence forces that are tragically demoralised and a country which is undefended. </PARA>
<PARA> To return to the statement of the Minister, there is a great deal of dissembling about the Fijian coup. If ever I have seen a weak and weaselling explanation that tries to cover up the inadequacies of this Government in the defence field, it is those paragraphs where Mr Beazley tries to pretend that nothing was wrong with the Australian response to Fiji. Everything was wrong with it. We had no intelligence. We not only did not know that the first coup was on; we did not know that the second one was on. The dogs were barking in the street before the first coup happened. One had only to walk up and down the streets of Suva to know that something was happening. Mr Beazley in his statement said that no one at all could be reasonably expected to know. It may be that Mr Beazley could not be expected to know, but the rest of the human race would have known. The real clincher of Mr Beazley's argument is at the end where he says, in trying to rationalise away the inadequacies of the Government's response:</PARA>
<PARA>There was no consequent military threat to Australia, or any risk of threat. </PARA>
<PARA>In other words, he is saying that we were not troubled by it, so it really did not matter that we made a mess of it. Nothing could be further from the truth. It demonstrated to the region Australia's total inability to go to the support of a friendly government. It demonstrated that we simply did not know what was going on. </PARA>
<PARA> The importance of that, if I may illustrate it, lies with respect to India. Everybody knows that India as a Soviet client has embarked on a massive expansion of its military capability, particularly in its navy. India has no history of maritime responsibility or involvement. It now has two carrier battle groups and it is building a third. It has nuclear-powered submarines. It is a major naval power in the world. This has all occurred in the last 10 years. I do not know what appreciations Mr Beazley makes of Fiji, but I suggest to him that he ought to think very hard about what might happen if Australia took one point of view with respect to Fiji and India, with its great military capability, took a differing point of view with respect to the large Indian population in Fiji. Where would the Australian Government be in that situation? How would it cope with that? That gets us back to the matter we are talking about: adequate intelligence and adequate force capabilities to back up our national interests. I agree with Senator McLean entirely that the national interest in the international arena is mediated in the first place through diplomatic activity. We always try with words to get across our point of view and to get cooperation for the policies that we wish to follow. However, all the diplomatic activity in the world is worth nothing if we are not seen and known to possess the military forces to back the point of view that we are putting across. If we are seen to be absolutely unable, through having no military forces, to enforce our foreign policies, no one will take any notice of our foreign policies. Therefore, while the medium through which we work most of the time is the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and diplomatic activity, the existence of a well-constructed and appropriate defence force is absolutely essential for the prosecution of any policy of foreign affairs. </PARA>
<PARA> Apart from the no threat doctrine, the other thing that upsets me about this paper is on page 4 where in great detail Mr Beazley sets up a straw man and then knocks it over; I refer to the business of the invasion of Australia. At present, the least likely eventuality to befall us is an invasion of this country by a major power. That is not the risk we face, yet Mr Beazley puts up that argument. He is just stating as a reflex action the old Labor Party view that sees defence in terms of invasion and continental defence. He lacks the vision, experience and comprehension to be able to see that we are not an island country isolated to ourselves. We live in a region and what goes on in the region is almost as important to us as what goes on in our own country. The defence of Australia cannot be defined in terms of the likelihood of a massive invasion by several divisions. Mr Beazley goes on with a lot of nonsense about the sea-air gap and the existence of long-range strike aircraft and naval forces to dominate that. Although it is such nonsense, sadly he believes it and so does the Government. However, it is not the risk we face. </PARA>
<PARA> The most likely defence problem Australia will have to face is having to go to the aid of a friendly power in the Pacific region. That will happen in the next five to eight years. It is an absolute certainty that we will be involved in some sort of military adventure there and if the Labor Party is still in power we simply will not have the force structure to cope with it. The risk of interdiction to our air routes or our sea routes is just as important to us as any major invasion. What would our response be in the hypothetical case that some power interfered with our air routes either to Asia or to North America? We would have to make a response in such a case. The consequences of a breach of our air communications by someone putting a barrier across them would be very important. If anyone breaches or breaks our sea lines of communication, with our huge export tonnages of coal, iron ore and alumina, where would the economy be? We could not tolerate that; we would have to do something about it. Under the Beazley-Labor scheme we have no way of doing anything at all about it because we have this continental defence mentality which is so explicitly portrayed on pages 4 and 5 of Mr Beazley's document. They are not the risks we face. We live in a region and our defence forces and the intelligence gathering part of our defence are essential for the promotion of peace and stability in the part of the world in which we live and for the protection of Australia's essential interests beyond our shores. </PARA>
<PARA> On page 5 we come to the heart of Mr Beazley's argument. In the middle paragraph, he says that the concept of lead and warning times provides a basis on which we can assess our defence effort. That is the heart of it. It is the rationalisation, a way of saying that there is not threat at the moment so we can afford to run down our key defence forces and live secure in the belief that no-one is a problem to us for at least 10 years. This statement cannot be taken in isolation. The matter of the reorganisation of the military intelligence gathering capabilities of this country cannot be seen as standing alone. It has to be seen as part of the overall moves of the Government to look after the national security of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> The record of this Government with respect to the defence of this country is one of absolute disaster. Mr Beazley has done more damage to the defence forces of this country than any other single person or nation in our history. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am glad to hear in this chamber a statement about defence intelligence arrangements, because it is a subject which is generally taboo. Any questions I have ever asked on the subject have been met with a blunt refusal to comment on the grounds of national security. As I have often commented, it seems that it is not our national security which is being protected, but the perceived national security of the United States, which Australia constantly serves by providing a continuous flow of information through the so-called joint facilities like Pine Gap and Nurrungar. The statement of the Minister for Defence (Mr Beazley) is timely, following a useful feature article in the Bulletin last September entitled `The Spooks Exposed; Who are our Spies and Who are they Spying On?'. The authors observed that for a small nation Australia has an amazing number of spy agencies. He went on to refer to various acronyms which he presumed were to confuse our enemies-ASIO, ASIS, DSD, ONA and JIO. The article states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Some of these agencies watch Australians, some of them watch the rest of the world and some of them watch each other. </PARA>
<PARA>In this respect, the new Defence Intelligence Organisation (DIO) may at least deal with this nonsense of having so many intelligence groups for such a small country, even if we have not been told the details. I also welcome the Minister's comments on invasion threats in our area, as they have been a constant feature of white Australia's history and are still beloved by various figures in the military and on the Opposition benches. I recall one scenario conjured up by the Captive Natives Association in my home State, whereby the Soviets were going to zap down to Perth from Cam Ranh Bay in their Caspian Sea monsters and 24 hours later Canberra would also surrender. </PARA>
<PARA> As recently as last month, Brigadier Ted Serong addressed the Australian Defence Association in Perth. He warned that Australia had become an open target for military attack. He said that in his opinion Australia was now so vulnerable that a city such as Perth could be captured by a foreign invader with as few as 600 troops. He added that 3,000 men could do the job comfortably. Once Perth was occupied, there would be little anyone in Australia could do about it. The invader could just sit back and wait until the Government in Canberra capitulated or at least agreed to terms. He went on to say that at least three countries in the region had the capability to mount a successful invasion of Australia in her present lightly defended state. He named India, Indonesia and Vietnam. </PARA>
<PARA> I was therefore considerably relieved to hear the Minister tell us that it would require a minimum of 15,000 to 20,000 persons to mount a sizeable assault against Australian territory. Perhaps the Minister might also take advantage of the visit of the Indonesian Foreign Minister, currently in Canberra, to check out possible Indonesian invasion plans. Perhaps the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) also had the chance to sound out India's plans for invading Australia while he was talking to Sri Rajiv Gandhi last month and the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade (Senator Evans) was doubtless getting the lowdown on Vietnamese contingency plans while he was in Vietnam last month. </PARA>
<PARA> One thing that always perplexes me about these worst case scenarios is that the scaremongers never suggest why these countries would want to invade or attack Australia. Of the 130-odd wars fought since 1945, only 15 per cent have involved one country invading another. I am glad that the Minister reiterated the difficulties a potential invader would face in attacking Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> However, I do want to take issue with the Minister on this question of self-reliance. There was no mention in the statement of our intelligence-sharing arrangements under the 1947 UK-USA agreement so admirably outlined in a book available in any good book store in Australia, The Ties that Bind, written by Jeffrey Richelson and Des Ball. </PARA>
<PARA> I have never understood the secrecy which seems to obsess our spy masters when we can read about intelligence matters in books but are not allowed to discuss these matters in Parliament. Information publicly available cannot be referred to in this place on the grounds of national security, whatever that is. For this reason it is very difficult to comment in detail on intelligence issues when we are denied the information to discuss, which is, of course, exactly the intention of this or any other government. </PARA>
<PARA> Self-reliance is a contradiction in terms. We share our intelligence with the United States National Security Agency (NSA), along with the intelligence agencies of the United Kingdom, Canada and New Zealand. While this Government refuses to admit the existence in Australia of the National Security Agency, senators can read about this agency in a book in the Parliamentary Library, The Puzzle Palace, by James Bamford. In Australia the NSA operates out of Pine Gap, North West Cape, Nurrungar, and other places, working with our own Defence Signals Directorate and other intelligence agencies. Yet none of this is ever referred to in Parliament and questions about the NSA are met with a refusal to acknowledge its existence. When Mr Hayden asked a question about the NSA in 1977 when he was in opposition, the Prime Minister, Malcolm Fraser, refused to answer it. When I asked exactly the same question of Mr Hayden several years later, when he was the Minister for Foreign Affairs, he also refused to answer it with exactly the same form of words. </PARA>
<PARA> The obsessive secrecy of the intelligence world seems to affect whichever party is in power and thus denies us the chance to get an answer to the age old question: Who guards the guardians? Again in my home State, this Government has announced the setting up of a new satellite communications station near Geraldton as part of its so-called self-reliance program. We are not allowed to know what this station costs. The appalling imbalance in our balance of payments might be due to the import of the huge IBM computers for the Geraldton spy base or other defence departments. Again, we are denied the figures. We do know that, when they can least afford it, the unfortunate people of New Zealand are being forced to pay for a smaller version of the Geraldton spy base at Waihopai. This is on top of the frigates we are bullying them into buying, but again we are denied the opportunity of asking questions or getting information in order to have a reasoned debate about an issue that affects one of our closest neighbours. </PARA>
<PARA> Australia would be better employed in promoting closer understanding of its neighbours, training its diplomats in language and negotiation skills, increasing cultural exchanges, and strengthening regional and international institutions which can act as a forum for conflict resolution, rather than spending money on intelligence, or spying, whichever one prefers to call it. We certainly need to take an interest in what our neighbours are up to, but we can do that through extensive reading of foreign affairs and defence journals and using our diplomats to take an interest in what is going on where they are stationed, rather than spending large amounts of money on these highly secretive, highly technical listening exercises that now circle our planet as everyone spies on everyone else, thus increasing the general level of paranoia. I do not know who or what we are listening to because we are never given enough information to discuss these matters in detail. I suspect that a lot of the information we are fed by the United States is irrelevant to the defence of Australia. We are told that it is not, but when we are not given the details I think it is only sensible to be suspicious. </PARA>
<PARA> Intelligence is like a fix. The more you get, the more you feel you need. People in the so-called intelligence community crack up at the thought of being deprived of more and more of this material. It is like getting hung up on the technological bandwagon as a universal problem solver. A great deal of the information which passes through our Defence Signals Directorate and other intelligence-gathering organisations in Australia is probably irrelevant to our national security. Maybe a country has to go through cold turkey to realise this, in the way that New Zealand has found that it has not sunk into the Pacific since the United States denied it shared intelligence following New Zealand's ban on nuclear warship visits. </PARA>
<PARA> In the meantime, I welcome this slight crack in the window revealed by the Minister's statement and can only add that I wish it were larger so we could have a reasoned and open debate on intelligence and national security issues, particularly on the subject of self-reliance and our real continued dependence on our local pusher, the United States. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the report. </PARA>
<PARA>It is with pleasure that I rise to speak on this report. There could be no better day for the report to come before the Parliament than today. In the financial section of the Australian this morning there is a big article entitled `China pays $300m for wheat as price soars'. Not only was it a big contract, but the price has hit a record height of $219 a tonne. This has been brought about to some extent by the drop in the dollar and also by our catching up with world supplies. The only thing that does not do much for this article is the photo of our brilliant Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Kerin) on the same page. The article states that the guaranteed minimum price (GMP) for this year will be $153.37 a tonne, which is $5.77 a tonne more than expected. This will put a lot of extra money into the pockets of farmers around Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> On the first page of the report one sees that for the first time in many years world production of wheat has fallen below consumption. That is the reason why the price of wheat in Australia and the world has turned around in 1987-88. This has brought to the farmers in Australia the guaranteed minimum price of $153 compared with about $140 or less last year. In 1986 we had a disastrous low of about $116 a tonne. It is very good to note that things have moved ahead. Incidentally, on the GMP, it was announced yesterday that there will be $29 a tonne left in the pool when it is finalised in a few years' time. </PARA>
<PARA> I have noted from the report that the domestic market has used up 200,000 tonnes on the grower-to-buyer permit system and 700,000 tonnes were sold under the stock feed permit system. This shows that those two systems, introduced in the last few years, together with a certain amount of freeing up of the way the Board works in Australia, are certainly effective. I have also noticed that the consumption in Australia of wheat grown by us is 19.2 per cent of the crop. When one looks at the export totals for each country, it is apparent that the Australian consumer is the Australian wheat industry's biggest customer. This figure of 19.2 per cent compares with Egypt at 14.2 per cent-our biggest customer; the next biggest customer is Iran at 14 per cent. Those figures show that our own consumption is very important. </PARA>
<PARA> In the limited time I have available, I would like to congratulate the Wheat Board on its various efforts, the first of which is its encouragement of quality production in Australia. The standard of the Australian crop far exceeds that of any other country in the world. That is why our wheat is selling so readily on the world market, considering that there are corrupt prices in the European and American markets by their subsidisation. Incidentally, just the other day there was a big sale of subsidised wheat. Secondly, I congratulate the Australian Wheat Board on its marketing skills and, thirdly, for supplying the customers with clean wheat and wheat true to specification. The last point I commend it on is its performance on selling this crop, not only this year but also in the last two years, against the corrupt world prices, especially the big crop it had two years ago. It has done very well. I congratulate the Wheat Board all around for its performance and wish it a good future. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;5.41-I also commend the annual report of the Australian Wheat Board (AWB) to the Senate. I think it is quite significant that we have been growing wheat now in Australia for 200 years. We have built up an outstanding industry with wheat. The Wheat Board has only been in operation since the Second World War. I would like to highlight just a few parts of this report. As a wheat grower I believe that the Wheat Board has played a significant part in protecting my interests over many years. There are 44,000 wheatgrowers in Australia. We most probably all know that one in five of all Australian farms grow wheat. We have earned a reputation around the world of supplying a clean, high quality wheat-a white wheat, actually, which is quite interesting; many other places in the world have their red wheats. We have an outstanding quality of white wheats in Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am not talking to the Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs. The industry remains a market driven and a very efficient industry. As Senator Panizza has just mentioned, we have had problems with the European Community and the United States with their schemes of bolstering up their growers and really corrupting the whole of the Australian wheat market because of the things that they have done in the world. They have actually corrupted the whole of the world wheat market. But that is a subject for debate in another place, I would imagine.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The AWB has always had its strategy to supply regular markets with high quality wheat. It wants to achieve long term price maximisation whilst assuring loyal customers a ready supply of grain. It had trouble just recently supplying the Chinese market because the Chinese were buying some of the cheaper subsidised wheat from America at that particular stage. Because of the foresight and the forward looking approach by the Wheat Board, with its technical assistance to China and the construction and commissioning of the China-Australia Training Bakery in Tianjin, by spending $1m there, as we have read in the paper today, it has made a sale of some $300m worth of Australian wheat to China. I think that that is a great feather in the cap for the Australian Wheat Board. </PARA>
<PARA> The objectives of the Board are well worth spelling out to the Senate. They are: to market Australian wheat efficiently, maximise the financial return to the growers; establish and maintain cost-effective financial facilities; enhance accounting, financial and business systems; promote development of cost-efficient receival, handling, storage and transportation systems in Australia; determine and implement optimum quality standards, testing and control procedures; promote relevant marketing and technical research in the wheat industry-it has done an outstanding job in producing better quality wheats, making sure that we have disease free wheats, and keeping rust problems at bay-communicate AWB policies to the wheat industry, governments and the general community; and optimise utilisation and development of human resources. </PARA>
<PARA> As far as the farming community is concerned, the Australian Wheat Board is a body that has been forward looking, as I have just mentioned with its sales to China, but it has also been forward looking with its innovative changes to its handling of the wheat grain in Australia in the last few years. I commend the report to the Senate. I congratulate the Wheat Board on producing such a good and comprehensive report and the wheatgrowers for 200 years of wheat growing in Australia. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the paper. </PARA>
<PARA>The Senate has before it the 1987-88 report of the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO). It is a further milestone in the great national tragedy of this Government's handling of science. For the sixth successive year now we have seen significant reductions in the funding of CSIRO, which is our premier research body. That comes about simply because the Government is not prepared to meet its responsibilities and fund science-just as about a quarter of an hour ago I was saying that it is not prepared to meet its responsibilities in national security and the great cuts we have had in the defence forces. We have seen for six successive years, in every Budget that this Government has brought down, that the CSIRO has suffered, and suffered very severely. We have now an organisation that despite the glib sophistries of the Chairman, Mr Wran, is utterly demoralised, has no idea where it is going, cannot recruit people, and is simply reduced to a stage of totally bankrupt morale, purely because the Government will not put the money into it. There is nothing more important to us nationally than a concerted scientific effort to maintain the industries, whether they are rural, mineral or manufacturing, to play this country's way in the world. </PARA>
<PARA> The report of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development in 1986, only two years ago, criticised this Government for running down the funding of scientific research. It made a particular point in saying that the Department of Finance had a `poor understanding of the relationship between research and economic development'. This means that the Government cannot see the economic benefit immediately of spending money on research. That just shows that it has no comprehension of scientific methods, because one does not always see an instant return; sometimes one does, but in the great majority of cases the benefit is deferred. </PARA>
<PARA> The research and development effort of Australia is absolutely minuscule. It is just a bit over one per cent. Twenty years ago it was 1.5 per cent of our gross domestic product (GDP). The successful Western countries such as the United States and Japan spent in excess of 2.5 per cent of their GDP. Comparable countries in the Western democracies to Australia spend at least twice what we spend. </PARA>
<PARA> There is another factor to it that is also very important. The great bulk of research and development in Australia is spent by the CSIRO and, to a very much lesser extent, by the Defence Science and Technology Organisation. In other words, the Government's share of research and development in Australia is far higher than that of any other Western countries. So when one reduces the Government input, one has a much greater effect on the research and development activities than one would have in another country. Of course, it is wrong that industry does not pull its own weight, and I think that is a consequence of the taxation policies that various governments have followed, but it cannot be corrected in the short term. It is only in the long term that that can be corrected. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government simply has misled the Australian community with respect to the cuts for CSIRO. It has said that they are minor and they are picked up by industry. I just want to expand on that for a moment. When one is running an organisation such as the CSIRO, one has certain fixed costs-for salaries, heating, building, lighting laboratories, buying equipment and running the place. Only a small part-I just forget what the fraction is, but it is probably something like 10 or 15 per cent of the budget-goes for actual research. When one cuts the budget, it is the flexible part, namely the research part, that gets cut. The Government has said to CSIRO, `Go to industry and get support for it'. That is where the Government is wrong. Industrial support for research is directed towards short term goals. People want an immediate response. Twelve to 18 months is the limit of their patience. The things that CSIRO is involved in-long term solutions to the soil degradation of this country and the development of rural industries-need 15- to 20-year time spans. CSIRO needs to recruit people to come in to learn the skills and see that there is a future for them. </PARA>
<PARA> This Government is quite wrong in substituting industrial funding for short term gain. It must be complementary to, not a substitute for, the Government's responsibility to fund long term research. The consequence of this is that Australian science is suffering enormously because CSIRO is the central point from which so many scientific skills have been developed. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise also to speak to the 1987-88 annual report of the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO) and to continue the deprecating remarks that were just made by Senator MacGibbon. I think the way in which this Government has behaved with respect to science-indeed with respect to intellectual activity in Australia-is absolutely despicable. At this time we have an anti-intellectual, anti-science Government which has run down not only the CSIRO but also the universities and other academic institutions. It has introduced tertiary fees to make entry into university life and particularly into science and technology more difficult when, clearly, we are living in a more scientific age. Not only is it important-I would say it is less important than was recently indicated-to deal with science as an economic activity but also it is important to deal with it as a way of the community understanding the world in which it lives. If we do not put more effort into science education and support for science we will become an increasingly less relevant and less democratic society.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Mr Wran was put in to head CSIRO. He has presided over its dissolution. It is clear that Mr Wran is also a man who does not understand the role of science. In the report he states:</PARA>
<PARA> But scientific excellence requires more than just good science. It requires science and technology to be integrated. It requires management skills, entrepreneurial flair and public communication skills. </PARA>
<PARA>Elsewhere in the report we find the description of the development of a zirconia based ceramic by CSIRO. It has taken 15 years to bring it from its early basic scientific development to a point where it has now become a commercial reality. </PARA>
<PARA> The application of science is a great deal more than simply the pulling of economic levers. That factor alone seems not to be understood by this Government. I think it is worthwhile stressing again the figures which have already been mentioned by previous speakers. The graph on page 47 of the report shows that, in 1987-88 constant dollars, the expenditure on CSIRO has fallen from just over $400m to less than $350m and that that has not been picked up by private sources. Private sources have grown from about $40m to around about $70m. So there has been a net fall in the amount of money which is being spent on research in CSIRO-one of the premier science and technology institutions in this country. On pages 8 and 9 of the report we see a comparison of the expenditure of various countries. We see that, while most other countries have increased their expenditure in this area, in Australia the expenditure has essentially remained static from 1974 right through to 1989. </PARA>
<PARA> I addressed a rally for science late last year at the opening of the National Science and Technology Centre in Canberra. It was clear then that scientists in Australia were very angry about what is happening to science. At that meeting Mr Jones offered the establishment of an interdepartmental committee which would report early in the new year. I understand that that committee has still not reported. There was a Cabinet meeting several weeks ago to consider that matter. It was to be considered at the Cabinet meeting on Tuesday. It has still not been considered. That course of events indicates that even now this Government is not elevating the matter of science, the funding of science, the work of science, the role of science in society, to the status which it demands. I make a plea that the Government get off its backside and recognise the importance of science, recognise the importance of CSIRO, and do something about it. If it does not, we will become a poorer country financially and a much poorer country intellectually. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to comment on the increasing ambivalence with which the Hawke Government is viewing science as evidenced by the whittling away of funds and research grants over the past few years. I believe that the Minister for Science, Customs and Small Business (Mr Barry Jones) is a sincere and enthusiastic proponent of the development of Australian science, yet he has found the technocrats in the Treasury, supported by Keating and others, keen to slash funding to scientific research and development. This is a most disgraceful state of affairs.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Australia has an international reputation in several areas: immunology, soil research, marine and veterinary sciences and in vitro fertilisation, to mention but a few. We have developed this reputation through, first, a quality higher education system and, second, a commitment by previous Commonwealth governments to the advancement of science and learning. The Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO) has been the basis for this development as Australia's premier scientific research foundation. In his introductory foreword, the Chairman of CSIRO, Mr Wran, states:</PARA>
<PARA>The next few years will be a crucial period for CSIRO and we all need to pull together to meet the great challenges ahead; to see that CSIRO has adequate resources (financial and otherwise) . . . </PARA>
<PARA>It must be embarrassing for the Government to have one of its own political persuasion spelling out in clear terms the concerns of CSIRO over the reduction of government funding. </PARA>
<PARA> If I can turn to the activities of CSIRO, I note with satisfaction the increase in sponsored research undertaken by the Organisation for Australian Private Companies which has risen quite significantly. This is encouraging because it shows that the board and permanent officers of the organisation are forging stronger links with industry and business, which is an essential component of future scientific development. The other side of this, however, is the insistence by the Treasury that any money that CSIRO obtains from private enterprise reduces the Commonwealth grant. This is a shortsighted attitude because, on the one hand, it shows people in industry that the Government is not prepared to emulate their contribution and, on the other hand, it means that in the future industry funding will become even more crucial, thus effectively ruling out what I term pure research. </PARA>
<PARA> The chief executive, Dr Boardman, notes that Australia lags behind countries such as the Netherlands and Canada in research and development expenditure, which is still only a worrying 1.3 per cent of gross domestic product. In fact, there is a table on page 9 of the report which I urge honourable senators to examine and reflect upon. It shows the shameful level of government funds for research and development as a percentage of gross domestic product compared with some of our trading partners. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has recently tried to encourage more students both at school and tertiary level to study science, but they must create an environment whereby the scientific area will be attractive and exciting for young people to join. Otherwise, bright students will continue to move away from science to other subjects and the brain drain of good analytical scientists from Australia will continue. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like to conclude my comments on a positive note. I was fascinated to read some of the varied projects with which CSIRO was involved in the year under review. These range from work to eradicate the cattle tick, development of an Australian seedless grape, measures to strengthen ceramics, and the development of the lamination of the new $10 note to the developing of a technique of using radioactive particles in soil to find the source of eroded soils found in dams and water channels. Also, they must be congratulated on the discovery of a high potency muscle growth protein for the treatment of victims of burns, infections and injury. Although it is invidious to single out people in such an organisation, I would like to formally congratulate Dr Hugh Tyndale Biscoe, of the Division of Wildlife and Ecology, on receiving a CSIRO medal for his world famous work on the reproductive physiology of marsupials. I commend the report to the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the paper. </PARA>
<PARA>This is a departmental report and it is, indeed, an indictment of the Government's mismanagement of the provision of pay television services to Australians. The report, in fact, contributes nothing new to informed debate on the issues surrounding the introduction of pay television. As the report notes, as far back as 1982 the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal (ABT) recommended that Australia introduce, as soon as practicable, cable television services and radiated television subscription services (RSTV). In 1983 the then Communications Minister, Mr Duffy, invited expressions of interest in the provision of RSTV. Subsequently, the Hawke Government announced a four-year moratorium against the introduction of pay television services. However, as the report shows, technological issues are not holding up the introduction of pay television in Australia. It is clear that the issues that must be resolved are purely political. The hold-up has been the procrastination by successive Ministers, since Mr Duffy, in the Hawke Government who were unwilling to make the necessary decisions to allow the introduction of pay television. Meanwhile Australian viewers and industry are slipping further behind the rest of the world and the report shows that the citizens of many other countries have access to pay television services while Australians continue to wait. </PARA>
<PARA> Honourable senators will be aware that new satellite pay television services have been introduced recently in the United Kingdom and there are media reports which indicate that pay television services may be available in New Zealand this year. The expectations of Australians regarding pay television are continually raised then dashed by this Government. This report is another example of that procedure. The Government announced last April that this review would be conducted and the report was due last July: expectations were raised. Instead of July 1988, the report has been tabled in March 1989. And what is it? Simply a damp squib. All it does is set out all the things we knew about pay television last April when the review was announced. This report is just an exercise in buying time and I am sure that the Government will now take another seven months or more in which to consider this report and advise further. </PARA>
<PARA> I wonder what modifications the Minister demanded to the earlier departmental draft of the report which contributed to the delay. I put the situation that this report should have been and is a departmental document to introduce debate on the subject. But it is difficult not to suspect that the draft report which was prepared earlier by the Department had some teeth in it and the Minister demanded that the teeth be extracted because the report which has finally been tabled, notwithstanding that it is two full volumes, has in fact no bite at all. It seems strange that a departmental discussion paper required the clearance of the Minister and the Cabinet before it became a public discussion paper. </PARA>
<PARA> It is about time the Government made decisions which it has been avoiding since it was elected in 1983 and lifted the moratorium on pay television. But instead of making substantial decisions, all this Government does is hold inquiries. In addition to the inquiry of which this report is a part, there is a parallel inquiry. In November 1987, the then Minister, Senator Gareth Evans, gave a reference to the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Transport, Communications and Infrastructure on new broadcasting related services, in particular, pay television. That Committee only recently commenced its inquiry. </PARA>
<PARA> There are several questions that the Government could be asked about this report and the parallel inquiries. Instead of providing any answers or indicating the future directions for pay television in Australia, all the report does is raise further questions, the most important of which is how much longer must Australians wait before they are able to be provided with or have access to pay television services. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Committee has considered and reported on the Ombudsman's annual report pursuant to sessional order No. 7. This is the third time that this Committee has reported on the Ombudsman's annual report. In addition, the Committee has reported on two Ombudsman's special reports. In preparing this report, the Committee was pleased to receive both written and oral submissions from the current Ombudsman, Professor Dennis Pearce. The Committee welcomes Professor Pearce to the office and wishes him well during his term of office.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Ombudsman told the Committee that one of the matters which he intended to give attention to during his term of office was the strengthening of the relationship between the Parliament and the Ombudsman. He said that, in his view, the provision of means of control of Executive action was becoming more and more significant as governments exercise increasing power over citizens' daily affairs. As a result, he believed that the Parliament and the Ombudsman needed to work together to ensure that this power was not abused. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee has always taken an interest in the work of the Ombudsman and has followed the annual reports of the office closely. In so doing, the Committee has developed the type of relationship with the Ombudsman's office which Professor Pearce has indicated his intention to build upon. This report is a further example of the interest which the Committee takes in the work of the Ombudsman. </PARA>
<PARA> In this report, the Committee has considered several specific matters raised by the Ombudsman's annual report. I would like to briefly refer to one of those matters-the question of resources. The Ombudsman identified lack of resources as the most pressing problem that his office is encountering. This issue has been discussed in previous Ombudsman's annual reports and, indeed, dealt with by this Committee in its consideration of those annual reports. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee commends the efforts of the Ombudsman to maintain the level of service provided by his office within the prevailing climate of fiscal restraint. However, the Committee, in this report, recognises the special problems which exist in maintaining a small office under these fiscal pressures. Accordingly, the Committee endorses the need for the Ombudsman's office to be maintained at a proper level of funding. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There is nothing in the Standing Orders which would prevent the Joint Select Committee on Corporations Legislation from sitting. As I understand it, there are provisions which relate to the attendance of senators who are members of the Committee. I am concerned about the tendency of committees meeting while the Senate is sitting. I believe that there should be a very urgent reason for this necessity. That reason should be explained to the Senate. That has not been done on this occasion. On some occasions it is done-for example, when it is unforeseen that the Senate would be sitting at a particular time when a joint or Senate committee had made arrangements with witnesses to come to Canberra to give evidence. I would have thought that the Joint Select Committee on Corporations Legislation would have known that the Senate and the House of Representatives would be sitting tomorrow.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I oppose the motion. I can understand why Senator Short has put it forward. Whilst I said that I thought the Committee could sit, votes cannot be taken at the Committee, as I understand it, if not all the senators are present. Party members are able to go away from the chamber and be closeted in the committee rooms. They do not really know what is going on here. They are under the Whips and if there is a division the Whips call them and they vote one way or the other, irrespective of what has been said prior to their entering the chamber for the vote. </PARA>
<PARA> The practice which is developing for committees to sit at the same time as the Senate is very questionable. What it means in effect is that, no matter what honourable senators say here for and against a motion or a Bill, it has no effect on the outcome of that motion or Bill. That is what it means if committees are to sit at the same time as the Senate is sitting. I understand that the point I made when I rose is not, in fact, correct-that unless this motion is passed the joint Committee cannot sit. I would like to hear from Senator Short the urgent and overbearing reasons why the Committee should sit tomorrow while the Senate is sitting. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I intervene in this debate only briefly. I have heard Senator Harradine's views on this many times before. I am one who generally supports motions such as the one Senator Short has moved today, provided committees do not make a meal of it. This is the first time, I think, that the Joint Select Committee on Corporations Legislation has made such a request. I am sure it would not have done so if it had not had severe timetable problems. I imagine that with Easter coming up there will be some problems. This chamber should think a little more seriously about timetables before it sends references to committees. The tactic is to send a reference and then put an unrealisable date on it, just to prove that the chamber is not stalling legislation. We all vote for or against it knowing that the date will blow out. It is inevitable; dates blow out all the time. One always adds five months to the date put forward before the report is brought in.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This is a special case that differs from that of some of the other Senate committees in as much as it is a joint committee. We have different Standing Orders from the House of Representatives. I take the view that joint committees are a very valuable commodity; I regard them as being better than individual committees of either chamber. We do not want to get into a confrontation position. If Senator Short, representing the Committee, has to come back 10 or 15 times and move such a motion, some of us will start to object. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Harradine's point about whether people should or should not follow votes and the proceedings of this place is very well made, but this decision will not alter that pattern. People vote according to the direction of their Whips because they do not always follow the debates in here. That may be for many reasons, not the least of which is that they are as boring as all-get-out. Maybe if they were made more interesting, people would follow them more closely. Whether or not this Committee sits on a certain day will not alter the work patterns of honourable senators so that they can follow everything that is happening in this chamber. We certainly support Senator Short's motion. It does not make a meal of it. It refers to one date.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Harradine certainly deserves a fuller explanation for the reasons for this request. The reason is that the Joint Select Committee on Corporations Legislation has been given an extraordinarily tight timetable. He may recall that, according to the timetable that was established in October or November last year, the Committee was to report on the first sitting day in 1989 on the whole thrust, breadth and content of the Government's proposals to amend the corporations law in Australia. It was an enormous task.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Honourable senators may recall that yesterday I sought leave on behalf of the Committee to have the deadline extended to 13 April. It is still a very tight timetable. We still have two witnesses to hear. They are both important witnesses who have appeared before the Committee in its public hearings to date. They were both sufficiently important-one representing the Australian stock exchanges-that we want to have another brief public hearing before we commence the very difficult and lengthy preparation of the report. If we do not hold that public hearing in the next day or so, the prospect of our meeting the now extended deadline will be much more difficult. It will be a monumental task anyway, and it is for that reason that we have sought the Senate's approval for the Committee to have a public hearing tomorrow, during the sitting of the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA> I assure Senator Robert Ray, Senator Harradine and the Senate that this is the first time the Committee has sought an extension. We will certainly not be making a meal of it. I hope it is a once and for all case. The Opposition does share Senator Harradine's view that it is only as a matter of urgency and semi-emergency that one should seek to take this action and that, as a general rule, the idea of committees sitting when the Senate is sitting is not something that commends itself to us.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The issue I wish to address tonight concerns the development of airports in Australia. We have seen considerable media coverage in the last few days about the response of this Government in respect of the important matter of runways for Sydney (Kingsford-Smith) Airport. It is interesting to compare this Government's attitude to aviation when dealing with electorates which it regards as sensitive. I refer to seats in capital cities such as the one occupied by the Minister for Telecommunications and Aviation Support, Mr Punch, whose electorate adjoins the important Kingsford-Smith airport in relation to which a number of my colleagues advocate major and significant changes which should be implemented to facilitate air services for New South Wales.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I wish to take the time of the Senate tonight to refresh the memory of the Senate as to the Darwin and Alice Springs airports, with which this Government has dealt callously and in a cavalier manner. Honourable senators will recall that five years ago in an election campaign the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) sat on a bulldozer at Darwin Airport and promised major and significant redevelopment. Well, that has not happened. During the term of this Hawke Government we have seen nothing but constant and deliberate procrastination on any civil works programs to implement and to put into place new significant terminals at either Alice Springs or Darwin. Both are crucial to the economy of Australia. The tourist industry certainly uses them very significantly, and both Alice Springs and Darwin airports have been constantly pointed to as being important and as having vital interests for tourists, and specifically for the residents of the Northern Territory. </PARA>
<PARA> Last year in August Senator Collins and the Federal Member for the Northern Territory, Warren Snowdon, gave firm commitments that deliberate action would occur in respect of these airports within a matter of months. But none of that happened. They were unable to convince either the Cabinet or the Caucus of the priorities required for both Darwin and Alice Springs airports. The matter has dragged on and on through the media. It appears that it is now being fed out on a fishing line as if it is to become another electorate issue and that the timing will be very significant for whenever elections are going to be called. Perhaps we will again see the Prime Minister during election campaigns sitting on bulldozers at the Darwin Airport. I am sure I do not need to remind any honourable senator who has been to Darwin Airport in the last year or so that the conditions there are appalling. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I remind the honourable senator that in 1983, just prior to the election which Labor won, I obtained a firm and promised commitment from the then Fraser Government which the Australian Labor Party when it came to office immediately scrapped and put on the back burner.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We have seen in the last year constant changes in the Public Service form of administration by this Labor Government. It set up the Federal Airports Corporation (FAC). We have now discovered that that Corporation has been hidebound by the same procedures as those in the Public Service. It does not have the flexibility to operate with private sector licence with regard to construction or timetables in that area. It has been unable to engage the consultants that it requires and it has been constrained by this Government in where it can go and what it can do. </PARA>
<PARA> Last week, in debate in the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly, a number of issues were quite properly raised by the Northern Territory Government concerning the Federal Labor Government's having walked away from its commitments. The commitments that Senator Collins and Mr Snowdon gave last August locked us into particular timetables. The FAC has not been able to proceed with any degree of freedom in order to get the proper programs, the proper financing and everything else into place. Admittedly in recent weeks Senator Collins and Mr Snowdon, because it looks like there is an election around the corner, have been feeling very threatened. They feel that they have to screw down the hatches before things get very tight for them. Of course there has been reaction from both the Northern Territory Government and the people of the Northern Territory, who are feeling threatened and do not feel they can trust this Labor Government again. </PARA>
<PARA> There is now a draft preliminary redevelopment program for the Darwin Airport for 1989, 1990 and 1991. It is very interesting to look at some of the time constraints that have been built into the bar chart. There is still a Public Works Committee process to be gone through between May and October of this year, a period of some four and a half months, which ought not to be necessary. As Mr Finch, the Minister for Transport and Works in the Northern Territory, pointed out to me, not only has he had to deal with seven Labor Ministers in this portfolio in the last two years, two senior and five junior, but also a larger project in this regard, requiring more significant financing than the program that is currently under consideration, has already been before the Public Works Committee. Yet this Government is going to wheel the Federal Airports Corporation back before the Public Works Committee. It would be appropriate for the Prime Minister to bypass that program, to wipe aside that timetable. The Labor members of the Public Works Committee, who have the numbers, ought to be able to side flick that issue and save the construction program, and save Senator Collins and Mr Snowdon a great deal more embarrassment. That could be done and it ought to be done straightaway. </PARA>
<PARA> We also need to look at the standard procedures for the implementation of the design and construction program. It is obvious from the bar chart that the tendering procedures are going to be undertaken differently. The design and construction program is fuzzed in, so obviously there is now intended to be some form of fast tracking in this regard. We need to make sure that the FAC is empowered now to get the architects, the engineers and the project managers into place so that the project can go ahead properly. Under the program that has been outlined by the FAC, the duration of this project could be shortened significantly, by at least six months. Six months or more have been wasted since Senator Collins and Mr Snowdon made these commitments last August, which they were not able to honour. </PARA>
<PARA> Recently the FAC has become very involved in trying to fast track this matter because of the pressure, I gather, of an election being around the corner. I understand that an announcement was made this afternoon by the General Manager of the airports division of the FAC, Jack Moffatt, regarding a commitment to have the construction program commence by November this year. That would shave two months off the date shown on the bar charts. This project could certainly be brought on stream a lot faster, and the design and construction program tightened up, with the involvement of the architects and engineers on the ground, either in the Northern Territory Department of Transport and Works, which has good facilities available, or in the Northern Territory private sector, who have had the experience of working on projects in the Northern Territory and interstate. If this does not happen, the Northern Territory airports fiasco will continue. The people who will be affected will be those of the Northern Territory. They have to put up with the rotten facilities at both the Darwin and the Alice Springs airports. </PARA>
<PARA> Recently the business community has felt so threatened that it has formed an important lobby group. It has taken out expensive advertising. It has engaged in a project on which it ought not to have to waste community resources-putting the ginger up the Labor Government. But it feels so threatened that it has to do so. It has to keep the issue alive with Senator Collins, Mr Snowdon and, hopefully, the Labor Cabinet down here. We are facing serious cutbacks in the financial area because of the economic mismanagement of this Labor Government. We are not able to get simpatico support from the Government for the Northern Territory in this important area. The issue is continually shoved aside. The Federal Airports Corporation needs to get on with the job. It needs to be given the power by the Labor Government to proceed on the fastest possible tracking of this project, ensuring that the construction program does not start, as on the bar charts, in 1990-which will be after the next election-but as soon as possible. </PARA>

Senator Grant Tambling has displayed in the chamber tonight the profound ignorance about this proposal that he displayed today in the Northern Territory media. Senator Tambling, this latter-day champion of these important projects in the Northern Territory, has had a total performance on the airports question in this Parliament since he has been elected of asking two tired old questions without notice. I dug them out this afternoon. He has not spoken in a single debate on the subject. He has not made a single speech on the subject. He has not made a single visit to a Minister on the subject. He has not even picked up the telephone in 18 months to talk to anyone about the subject. He has trotted out only two tired old questions in Question Time since he was elected to this Parliament. Now he is the latter-day champion of getting the airports built. The two years that have preceded Senator Tambling's address this evening, castigating me and the honourable member for the Northern Territory (Mr Snowdon) for our sloth in getting these airports under way, have been characterised by almost non-stop efforts on the part of the Federal member for the Northern Territory and me to get these airports put on the program of the Federal Airports Corporations (FAC).</PARA></TALK.START>

The package of airports that was proposed for the FAC did not include Darwin and Alice Springs. It required a considerable amount of effort--</PARA></TALK.START>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Senator Tambling" NAMEID="6E4">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="6E4">Senator Tambling</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Why?</PARA></TALK.START>
</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="OF4">Senator COLLINS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Because the FAC did not want them. That is why. The dollars and cents scenario at Darwin Airport is such that, in return for the traffic that goes through that airport as against the dollars that have to be spent on construction, not even the FAC, with the very good deal it has had from the Federal Government on this, will make a cent out of that airport for 10 years. That is why they were not on the list; the FAC did not want them. It took two years of negotiation by the Federal member and me, numerous meetings with the Department of Finance, which was inextricably involved in that process, and with the Minister for Finance, Peter Walsh, to negotiate a package with total cooperation by the Federal Government wherein the airports became a financial benefit to the FAC rather than a total detriment. It took two years to put that in place.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Of course, Alice Springs will be profitable because it carries greater traffic than Darwin Airport. The difference between the two airports, which Senator Tambling would not know, is that Darwin has a far greater number of originating passengers whereas the majority of passengers that go through Alice Springs are transit passengers. However, in terms of return for the FAC, a $20m facility at Alice Springs, which will solve its problems, will return on the dollar invested by the FAC far more than the $65m it has to spend in Darwin on less traffic. I know that Senator Tambling finds it very difficult to understand under those circumstances the commercial realities of why the FAC would not be interested in taking on Darwin. Political lobbying achieved it. This constant reiteration by Senator Tambling that nothing has happened and nothing has been achieved is absolute nonsense. </PARA>
<PARA> The significance of having these airports placed on the FAC package is very fundamental. It removes the financial question of constructing those airports out of the direct Federal Government budget process. It puts it on to the FAC to raise that money. The General Manager of the FAC, a matter of only weeks ago, confirmed that this had been budgeted for by the FAC. The General Manager of the construction group of the FAC, directly responsible for the construction at both Darwin and Alice Springs-he is in the Northern Territory as I speak at the moment-confirmed again today that both airports had been budgeted for by the FAC; the money is there. </PARA>
<PARA> The reason that I canvass that issue is an extraordinary interview that Senator Tambling gave today on talk-back radio. It is necessary to give the Senate the background to this interview. In the last couple of days-</PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="OF4">Senator COLLINS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will make a decision about that; not Senator Hill. In the last couple of days a group of Darwin businessmen were panicked by a totally irresponsible, indeed criminal, furphy run by the Northern Territory's Minister for Transport and Works that the airports would not be constructed until next year. This was based on the same bar graph referred to by Senator Tambling. I hope he was holding it the right way up because it was probably the first time he had ever seen it. This bar graph had the word `draft' written straight across the front of it. Unfortunately, those businessmen were panicked into putting a lot of money into full-page advertisements in the Northern Territory News saying, `The airports will not be built until next year; we are soliciting donations for an airports action group'. Senator Tambling, sniffing a few cheap votes, for the first time since he has been down here took up the airports issue, climbed on the telephone and said to the interviewer on talk-back radio, `Look, I am anxious to present in the Federal Parliament any petitions that this committee might collect'. One must not forget the fact that Senator Tambling has not lifted a finger since he has been here on the project. With a few cheap votes in the wind, he is on the telephone. Col Krohn, not known for his Labor sympathy, spoke to Senator Tambling. Senator Tambling said to him:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>. . . I'll be happy to act in concert with them. I'll be presenting their petitions into the parliament and I'll be taking every opportunity to raise the issue down here with the Ministers in Canberra . . . </PARA>
<PARA>It would be a first if he did. He continued:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . and in the Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA>It would be a first if he did that too. He continued:</PARA>
<PARA>I'll be backing up the efforts of the committee and trying to gauge what community response is in the Territory. </PARA>
<PARA>. . . I'll be supportive of everything they're doing. </PARA>
<PARA>Col Krohn said:</PARA>
<PARA>Are you saying, Grant, that nothing has happened?</PARA>
<PARA>Senator Tambling said:</PARA>
<PARA>Well certainly the FAC has sought to get on with its job but . . . </PARA>
<PARA>Col Krohn then said:</PARA>
<PARA>Well you just said nothing has happened. Now you're saying that the FAC is getting on with the job. </PARA>
<PARA>Senator Tambling then said:</PARA>
<PARA>(inaudible) we would see results within a couple of months. The FAC has obviously been trying to put it into their timetable . . . </PARA>
<PARA>This is today's interview. He continued:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . but they're not being given Government support or finances . . . that we need. </PARA>
<PARA>Senator Tambling goes on to say-I will read that out too-that he has not sought to receive a briefing from the FAC on the airports. He has not been near them. I am not surprised that he could demonstrate such total ignorance of the situation as to say that the FAC cannot even get these airports on its timetable because the Federal Government will not give it the money to build the airports. I am happy to quote the FAC on this in a statement it issued this afternoon. I can tell you, Mr President, that the FAC is extremely unhappy and very angry with this sort of furphy being issued because two weeks ago the General Manager of the FAC, Bill Swindle, put out a statement in response to this nonsense and said:</PARA>
<PARA>The FAC has budgeted for both airports. There is no problem whatever financially with the airport construction proceeding. </PARA>
<PARA>Again, Mr Jack Moffatt, who is the General Manager of new airports for the FAC, today said:</PARA>
<PARA>As planned the Federal Airports Corporation will control the affairs of Darwin Airport from the first of next month and our first priority is the redevelopment programme. A critical factor which seems to have been lost in the debate is that the funding of the $65m development will not come from the Northern Territory or Federal Government monies. </PARA>
<PARA>It certainly seems to have been lost on Senator Tambling, who was the only conservative senator representing the Northern Territory in this chamber. It does him no credit that he could make such a profound mistake in respect of this very destabilising campaign. Why should he be criticised for it? I will tell honourable senators why. The Northern Territory has been going through quite a slump in the last two years. Because I am not a Jonah and because I am not a person who wants to talk it even further down, I have been saying on every public occasion that I have been asked this question in the last two years that it is a slump that the Northern Territory is coming out of. When Warren Snowdon and I announced that the airports had been secured for the Northern Territory-and they have-I said at that press conference, and I meant it, that there were two reasons why the construction of these airports was important to the Northern Territory in the current crisis that it is in with the lack of business and investor confidence in the Territory. </PARA>
<PARA> The first reason is that the airport terminals themselves would be constructed. But the second reason, and even more important, is that it would be a very public declaration of support and confidence in the fact that the Northern Territory's economy was going to improve. Nobody would want to build $90m worth of new airport facilities if, in fact, business was going to go down the chute. I said that quite deliberately; it was not accidental. </PARA>
<PARA> Until that point, I might tell honourable senators, Warren Snowdon and I had succeeded in a very cooperative, bipartisan campaign and program with Fred Finch, the Minister in the Northern Territory. Of course, Christmas and this year changed all that. To quote Fred Finch: now that there is an election in the wind, the bipartisanship that existed on this project has gone out the window and this year `the gloves are off'. Because Senator Tambling failed for the first time in the history of the Territory to even get a quota in the Senate elections, which is unheard of for a conservative politician, he snips a few cheap votes if he can muddy the waters. But the problem is that at the same time as he is trying to pick up a few cheap votes he is substantially assisting in destroying the public confidence and the business confidence that were returning to the Northern Territory as a result of these projects being on stream. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Tambling said today that the FAC is trying to get these airports on its timetable. Not only are the airports on its timetable but also two weeks ago it issued a design brief for the construction of Darwin Airport to Australian Construction Services. If Senator Tambling had gone into the Darwin office of Australian Construction Services last weekend he would have seen the officers of ACS working all day Saturday and Sunday on that design brief. But of course he has not been near the Australian Construction Services group which, because he is a senator, would be happy to brief him. He did not go near the FAC before he jumped on this bandwagon. He has talked to this Territory Airports Action Committee. He will present its petitions to Parliament. What did Col Krohn say to him today? I quote from the interview on talkback radio this morning. Krohn asks whether Senator Tambling has been briefed by the FAC. The transcript shows that Senator Tambling replied:</PARA>
<PARA> No, I haven't been briefed in that area. I'm certainly asking for . . . </PARA>
<PARA>The transcript continues:</PARA>
<PARA> Krohn: You have approached them, have you? You have approached the FAC for a briefing?</PARA>
<PARA> Tambling: I've been having constant representations yes. </PARA>
<PARA>They must have been very quiet ones. Col Krohn obviously loses patience with Senator Tambling and asks:</PARA>
<PARA> Have you approached the FAC for a briefing, Senator?</PARA>
<PARA>Senator Tambling replied:</PARA>
<PARA> I haven't, Col, because Fred Finch was handling that . . . </PARA>
<PARA>The transcript continues:</PARA>
<PARA> Krohn: Yes, but yet it's fair for you to get involved with this airport committee; to, indeed, represent them in Canberra and not get briefed by the FAC?</PARA>
<PARA> Tambling: Well, my written . . . </PARA>
<PARA> Krohn: Isn't this a contradiction of principles:</PARA>
<PARA>And here it is folks; Senator Tambling said:</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;And not a very good one. So Senator Tambling is quite happy to blow this restored business confidence in the Territory to the wind, despite the fact that both airports have been placed on the FAC's package. Secondly, the manager of the FAC has publicly confirmed that the total budget for the construction of both airports has been set aside by the FAC. Thirdly, despite the fact that the FAC does not in fact take formal control of the airports until April, a design brief on the Darwin Airport has already been given to the Australian Construction Services group in Darwin. It has been working on it for a week. For the honourable senator's information, the only reason Alice Springs has not been given a design brief at the moment is that a decision has not yet been made on the physical location of the terminal. The reason that the design brief has already been issued for Darwin is that part of the design brief is to use the existing facilities that were constructed on the north side of the airport which, of course, as the honourable senator does not know, includes the pad for the terminal. So the design brief already has been issued.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Alice Springs Airport has a problem. There is a great restriction on the area-Senator Tambling would not know this even though he uses the airport twice a week-between the front of the existing building terminal and the runway. The aircraft cannot manoeuvre; so the new terminal will be set well back from the runway. I have seen a number of conceptual designs for that location. I have been assured by the director of the airport group in Darwin that it will have the design brief on the Alice Springs Airport within two weeks. This honourable senator has the criminal irresponsibility-that is what it is-in the face of this lack of business confidence in the Territory to go on public radio today, despite the facts I have presented, and say that the FAC still has not placed these airports on its timetable. That is absolutely appalling for a Federal representative of the Northern Territory to say publicly. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Tambling says that he will hang on the coat-tails of the group of businessmen in Darwin. I say to Senator Tambling that I briefed the Northern Territory Confederation of Industry and Commerce last Friday on the airport construction. It was satisfied with what I told it. What we have seen has been purely a result of the political smoke- screens that are being put up by the Northern Territory representative down here to try to save his own bacon at the next election, and to hell with the good interests of the Northern Territory. I am like any other party politician. I rarely cooperate in bipartisan agreements with politicians. It is difficult, as Senator Tambling well knows. My record in the Northern Territory in the last 12 years, however, probably demonstrates that I do it far more often than most. It is a matter of profound regret to me that the highly successful bipartisan cooperation between the two Federal Labor members and the Chief Minister for the Northern Territory until the end of last year, which kept this matter off the front pages, significantly assisted the fast tracking of this project. That is the position now. I tell Senator Tambling that the new regime this year-`I am a politician and I am in opposition which makes it my job to try to pull these two people down, despite what they are trying to do for the Territory'-will substantially damage the gradually returning business confidence in the Northern Territory. Senator Tambling stands condemned for it. </PARA>

<PARA> Mr Moffatt's press statement today simply indicates the extreme frustration and anger of the professional officers of the FAC, who are trying to get on with the job Senator Tambling is trying to shoot down in flames. In the FAC media release Mr Moffatt noted that the stated aims of the Territory Airports Action Committee, which Senator Tambling recently joined, were the same as those of the Federal Airports Corporation and local and Federal political spokesmen. He said:</PARA>
<PARA>Everyone wants the Corporation to take over Darwin and Alice Springs on 1 April and everyone wants a construction start on the terminals before the end of this year. Both will happen. </PARA>
<PARA>The other factor that has entered into this is a totally unnecessary and destabilising debate based on nothing except a single piece of paper, a draft bar graph tabled at the first meeting that was held between the FAC--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Warren Snowdon and I are getting on with the job. We are going to get the airports built in the Northern Territory. That is the great difficulty for the Opposition, and Senator Tambling knows it. Senator Tambling and the Minister for Transport and Works in the Northern Territory, Fred Finch, now know, Mr Finch having been briefed on the actual detailed construction program for these reports, they are going to be built. They see a political opportunity slipping away from them. They are not in the least bit interested in getting $90m worth of badly needed facilities built in the Northern Territory. It is just a political opportunity to belt the Labor Party which is slipping away from them. They have climbed onto the bandwagon in a last desperate attempt to muddy the waters. This issue, which without any question will return the seat of the Northern Territory to the Labor Party at the next election when it is delivered on, and rightly so-and they know that-is going to cause them a great deal of trouble.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The CLP is also in a dreadful position having just selected an appalling candidate to run for the House of Representatives seat. The only party that he has not joined is the Christmas party. He has joined every other party-the Labor Party, the CLP, the Northern Territory Nationals-and is back to the CLP again. The CLP is going to have to try to shore up the chances of this hopeless candidate to win the seat. I understand that as a politician. There is no question at all that because of this sudden transition of cooperation last year to absolute, to quote Fred Finch, `gloves off political opposition' this year is purely an attempt to try to salvage a few votes for the hopeless ticket that the conservatives are running in the Northern Territory. The great problem with that relates to the second agenda that was involved in getting these airports secured, as they have been, for the Territory. I refer to the vital problem, about which Senator Tambling knows, of trying to stem the flow of net population loss that the Northern Territory has suffered in the last two years. It is the first time it has happened in 40 years. That agenda has been significantly blown out of the water and damaged irretrievably by the Northern Territory's own conservative Federal member. He should stand condemned for it. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I can assure the Senate that I will not be here for half an hour. There is a point that I would like to make. This time last year I spoke in an adjournment debate about the problem of pensioners being caught in the provisional tax net. In other words, when they received their pension plus a certain amount of money from non-pension areas, they were getting lumped into the provisional tax trap.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In the last Budget the Government announced that it would legislate-and it has legislated-to remove the imposition of provisional tax on the Australian pension. There is a certain amount of money on top of that pension, to the limit of $1,000, where the pensioner rebate cuts out and upon which there is no provisional tax raised. </PARA>
<PARA> We have now come to an anomaly. I have a constituent in Western Australia who has pointed out that he is receiving a British pension rather than an Australian pension, but that the legislation does not cover his situation. This client is receiving a British pension and a certain amount of other income, not being pension. This puts him above the threshold at which he has to pay provisional tax, whereas if he were simply getting an Australian pension he would not be liable for that provisional tax. </PARA>
<PARA> If one lives on a pension, it is a pension and nothing else. Whether that pension comes from overseas or whether it comes from Australia, it should be treated in the same way. In other words, neither pension should attract provisional tax. It is far cheaper for the Australian Government that this pensioner receives a British pension, because the Australian Government is not paying it out. It would be better for this person in Perth, and for many others throughout Australia who are in the same position, to turn in their British pensions and get Australian pensions. Going on just under $1,000 of other income, these pensioners would be better off to the tune of $146.25, which is a great amount for someone living on a fixed pension. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like the Minister at the table to take on board the fact that this anomaly exists in Australia and to ensure that something is done about it in the next Budget, if not before that. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="TJ4">Senator Walsh</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Treasurer has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) Capital gains tax applies to assets purchased after 19 September 1985 so that the first contribution to revenue under the capital gains tax provisions occurred during the 1986-87 fiscal year. No data are available which isolate the contribution to revenue of the capital gains tax in 1986-87, although this would not be substantial. For the 1987-88 fiscal year, the revenue directly attributable to the capital gains tax amounted to $89m, being collections from individual taxpayers of $43m and from corporate taxpayers of $46m. The estimated yield in 1988-89 from the capital gains tax is $100m. These figures do not include collections under the `purpose of purchase' rule referred to by Senator Maguire, which was abolished upon the introduction of the capital gains tax on 19 September 1985, or the so-called `12-month' rule. In relation to the `12-month' rule, the Government announced in the 1988 May Economic Statement that it would be abolished with effect from 25 May 1988 and that the gains to which that section previously applied would be subject to the capital gains tax provisions.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) It is likely that the capital gains tax provisions are indirectly generating revenue through other provisions of the Income Tax Assessment Act. This indirect income tax generation reflects one of the major objects of the introduction of the capital gains tax, which was to reduce the tax motivated distortion of investment toward assets that produce capital gains rather than income. The income tax revenue generated indirectly by virtue of the capital gains tax cannot be isolated by the Tax Office precisely since it is not separately identified in tax returns, but it is expected to be substantial. It has been estimated that it may be up to $300 million per year.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Treasurer has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) and (2) Since the changes to the Government's foreign investment policy in April 1987, proposed acquisitions by foreign investors of rural properties have only been examinable where the properties are valued at $3 million or more. The policy provides that such proposals are approved unless they are judged contrary to the national interest.</PARA>
<PARA> Many foreign acquisitions would involve properties valued at less than $3 million and would not be recorded in the Foreign Investment Review Board's statistics after April 1987. In addition, proposals which are approved may not always proceed to finality, while sales of rural properties by foreign investors to Australian buyers do not require approval by the Commonwealth Government. For these reasons it is not possible to maintain a comprehensive register of foreign landholdings. I note also that matters relating to the title and registration of land fall within the responsibilities of the Governments of the States and Territories, rather than the Commonwealth.</PARA>
<PARA> While the data collected by the Foreign Investment Review Board are insufficient to provide the information requested by the honourable senator, I have attached a table from the Board's 1986-87 Report which may be of some interest.</PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Bureau of Statistics also conducts periodic surveys on foreign ownership and control of selected Australian industries, its most recent survey in respect of agriculture relating to 31 March 1984.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="TJ4">Senator Walsh</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Treasurer has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> A bona fide redundancy payment will not be subject to tax on roll-over into an Approved Deposit Fund (ADF). Investment income derived from a rolled-over bona fide redundancy payment in an ADF will, as from 1 July 1988, be assessable for tax at the rate of 15 per cent in the hands of the fund. A fund will be able to offset or even neutralise the effects of this tax in various ways including, for example, by receiving imputation credits on franked dividends received from Australian companies and by investing in assets such as property which yield a high proportion of their return in the form of capital gains.</PARA>
<PARA> On withdrawal from the ADF, components of the payment will be treated differently for tax purposes, as occurs under current law. The amount referable to the original bona fide redundancy payment will continue to retain its identity and be taxed by including 5 per cent in assessable income. The amount of the withdrawal referable of earnings in the ADF will continue to be treated as an eligible termination payment and, as from 1 July 1988, will be subject to reduced rates of tax as announced in the May Economic Statement.</PARA>
<PARA> Because the reduction in tax on the earnings component of the withdrawal is likely to exceed the net effect of the tax on fund earnings, the total after-tax amount of the withdrawal from the ADF can generally be expected to be higher under the new arrangements.</PARA>

<PARA> (3) Following allegations raised by Mr Ken Wright MLC in the Victorian Parliament earlier this year, the Victorian Registrar of Co-operatives conducted a full investigation of the Co-operative. Some problems of accountability came to light, but these were not considered severe enough to warrant the discontinuance of funding, given that this would have ended the service provided to Aboriginals. Departmental officers in Victoria have been asked to maintain regular contact with the co-operative and provide assistance as necessary, consistent with the principles of self-management and self-determination. Departmental Officers have advised that they are now generally satisfied that public moneys are properly accounted for.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Primary Industries and Energy has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) There is no dichotomy in the positions of the Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce and the Australian Wool Corporation concerning further processing of wool. The objective of the Australian Wool Corporation is to increase the commercial returns to Australian woolgrowers. This is achieved by a number of means, one of which is the facilitation of wool marketing. The marketing powers of the Corporation, as set out in the Wool Marketing Act 1987 include to process, or arrange for the processing of, wool.</PARA>
<PARA> To this end, the Corporation has participated in an early stage wool scouring venture at Laverton, Victoria. This joint venture plant is utilising scouring technology developed by CSIRO and equipment manufactured in Australia and market access for half the output has been secured through one of the joint venture partners. Through participation in the processing sector, the Corporation aims to position woolgrowers in the manufacturing pipeline in order to protect their long-term interests; and to enhance the long-term viability of Australian woolgrowing. The Corporation also provides advice to potential investors in further processing.</PARA>
<PARA> The Corporation's approach is consistent with the Government's policy of encouraging further processing activity provided there is sound economic potential. Such commercially viable activity can play an important role in generating employment opportunities and export earnings for Australia's future.</PARA>
<PARA> I believe that the activities of the Australian Wool Corporation make a valuable contribution towards achieving these goals.</PARA>

<PARA> (2) Is the Australian Government privy to operational orders sent to American submarines at North West Cape; if so, has the Government the power to veto over such orders.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) Given that current United States of America nuclear strategy, which is known as `flexible response', will at some point in the escalation of conflict require the employment of the nuclear option, is the Prime Minister prepared to have any joint facility used for first strike, not retaliatory, nuclear strike purposes.</PARA>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="254" SPEAKER="Richardson Sen The Hon G.F." NAMEID="4E4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="NSW">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4E4">Senator Richardson</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Defence has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) The joint defence facilities are for defence purposes which have been jointly agreed between the Australian and US Governments. Control is exercised by the Australian and US Governments by ensuring that the facilities are used only for those purposes to which agreement has been given. This control is implemented through an integrated staff of Australian and US personnel with responsibilities for the operation and management of the facilities in accordance with the agreements between Australia and the US.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) At North West Cape, neither Government has a right of access to operational orders relayed through the facility to the armed forces of the other party. However the Government has in place arrangements which ensure that the Government receives full and timely consultation on US strategic and operational policies likely to involve North West Cape. This includes, inter alia, the regular Defence to Defense consultations established under the 1974 Barnard-Schlesinger agreement, the access guaranteed to the Head Australian Defence Staff (Washington) to senior US Defense officials under the 1983 Scholes-Weinberger agreement, and the creation of a new position of Counsellor Defence Policy in the Australian Embassy in Washington. In toto these arrangements safeguard Australian sovereignty by providing that the Government has advance knowledge of the purposes for which the US might wish to use the Station's capabilities.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) US nuclear strategy is that of deterrence, and deterrence works by persuading possible adversaries that the risks they run from their aggression outweighs any likely gain. To implement this strategy of deterring war the US, and NATO, have a doctrine of flexible response, together with versatile military capabilities. Flexible response does not involve automatic or inevitable escalation to the use of nuclear weapons.</PARA>
<PARA> The purpose of US and NATO military doctrine and war fighting options is to make clear that deterrence does not rest upon a bluff, and to make clear that effective military responses which are appropriate and not excessive are available in the event of aggression. In the remote and extreme event of Soviet attack, where the USSR did not restrain its aggression to non-vital Western interests, and where conventional Western forces proved unable to defend those vital interests, US and NATO doctrine has reserved a retaliatory option of first-use of nuclear weapons. The US and NATO have clearly disavowed any nuclear first-strike however. A threat of first-use of nuclear weapons is not a threat of a massive disarming first-strike intended to destroy the opponent; it is a threat of nuclear retaliation to conventional attack that threatens truly vital interests.</PARA>
<PARA> The conviction of all Western leaders that `nuclear war cannot be won and must never be fought' is clear. The Government is confident that the US and NATO strategy of flexible response is defensive and reactive; its intent is to deter all war and to minimise the consequences should any conflict occur.</PARA>

<PARA> (1) For the 1988 school year 82 members of the Australian Defence Force were paid Education Allowance in respect of 93 children.</PARA>
<PARA> Twenty-four (24) payments of extra Tuition Allowance were made during the same period.</PARA>
<PARA> These figures do not include education assistance for children of members posted overseas as the two allowances mentioned by the honourable senator are only paid to members serving in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) No specific study has been conducted to ascertain the number of children who could attract the allowances.</PARA>
<PARA> The demography of the child population of Defence Force members would not provide a measurement of the effectiveness of these allowances. It is a matter of free choice for parents whether they seek access to Education Allowance or have their children accompany them on posting. Likewise it is largely a matter of parental judgement whether a child requires extra tuition following a change of school.</PARA>
<PARA> It is possible for Education Allowance to be paid in respect of any child whose secondary education would suffer serious interference by having to accompany a member of posting.</PARA>
<PARA> It is worth mentioning that in 1988 only seven applications for Education Allowance out of a total of 100 were not approved. Applications not approved are carefully evaluated to judge whether the legal provisions are inappropriate.</PARA>
<PARA> It is also possible for Extra Tuition Allowances to be paid in respect of any child in the last or second last year of primary education, or for secondary school students, who accompany a member on a long term posting if the qualifying conditions for that Allowance are met.</PARA>

<PARA> (1) On the occasion of an election or referendum Navy and Air Force advise personnel of their voting rights and obligations. Army does not provide advice to personnel on their rights or obligations to vote. Army considers that promotional material provided by the Government is available to soldiers as it is to the rest of the community.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) When Navy is advised of a forthcoming election or referendum the information is promulgated from Navy Office Canberra by signal and facsimile to every ship, establishment and overseas location where members of the RAN are serving. All ships and establishments have a designated ``electoral officer'' who has the responsibility of ensuring that personnel are aware of the forthcoming election or referendum, of the requirement to vote and of arrangements made for lodging of votes.</PARA>
<PARA> Air Force establishments advise personnel periodically of their voting rights and obligations through the medium of Unit of Formation Routine orders. Air Force members, both in Australia and overseas, are advised of forthcoming elections and referenda and are reminded of their rights and obligations including postal and overseas voting procedures. A Returning Officer is usually established at Butterworth, Malaysia. Where voting facilities are not established at RAAF bases members may be conveyed to the appropriate polling facility by RAAF transport.</PARA>
<PARA> Army notifies all units of forthcoming Federal and State elections, by-elections and referenda. Because many soldiers are not located where they are registered to vote a specific effort is made to notify all members in sufficient time to ensure members can attend voting booths or apply for postal votes. Particular arrangements are made by units for those members on field training or on duty on election days. No member is denied their right to vote.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) HMAS Cerberus received a facsimile pertaining to the 3 September 1988 election on 3 August 1988. This information was promulgated in HMAS Cerberus Daily Orders and on notice boards. On 3 September 1988 a bus was provided for all Cerberus personnel, including newly appointed recruits, to go to Crib Point, the nearest polling facility.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4F4">Senator Button</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) and (2) While membership turnover of the Service Station Association of New South Wales is, in itself, not a reliable indicator to the health of that sector, I would point out that for some years service station operators have been facing increased competition, due to the relatively static demand for petrol combined with an excess number of outlets servicing the market. In fact, despite the relatively high failure rate for new small businesses in Australia (Professor Williams of Newcastle University suggests that 40 per cent fail within 3 years and around 66 per cent within 5 years), it could be argued that the detailed screening undertaken by the oil companies tends to discourage persons of insufficient business acumen from adding to the list of failures. There is no evidence to support the claim that oil company practices, per se, have been a direct cause of business failure in the service station industry. Nevertheless, as I have previously indicated, I am prepared to consider intervention where there is evidence of harsh or unconscionable conduct by an oil company towards its franchisees.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) I am advised that, in October 1988, Ampol purchased a minority shareholding in Solo Oil Limited and that the latter continues to trade as an independent, non-integrated marketer. Consequently, Solo sites are currently exempt from the application of the Petroleum Retail Marketing Sites Act 1980 (and, for all practical purposes, the Petroleum Retail Marketing Franchise Act 1980) until such time as Ampol should acquire a majority shareholding or that Solo otherwise assumes the characteristics of a prescribed oil company (ie. it either refines or imports the bulk of its petrol requirements).</PARA>
<PARA> (4) I am informed that Coro Pty Ltd is a wholly-owned subsidiary of BP Australia Limited, established for the purpose of permitting company operation of selected sites. As the legislation applies to all subsidiaries of prescribed corporations, eligible Coro outlets are deemed to be part of the BP quota under the Petroleum Retail Marketing Sites Act 1980.</PARA>
<PARA> (5) I understand that the move towards multiple franchising by some oil companies is an innovation aimed at establishing uniformity of site presentation and service standards (a ``true franchise''), as well as enabling franchisors to place a realistic valuation on the contribution made by individual activities to the overall value of the marketing premises. While the ``petrol franchisee'' is normally offered the first option on ancillary activities, the taking up of such options is ultimately a matter for commercial judgment by the dealer concerned.</PARA>
<PARA> (6) I am not aware of any official statistics relating to this question. However, my Department has made a broad assessment of the significance of franchised sites compared with other classes of resellers. This indicates that oil company-owned or leased franchised outlets account for around 45 per cent of retail sites and 66 per cent of retail sales of petrol.</PARA>
<PARA> (7) The principal source of protection for service station franchisees is the Petroleum Retail Marketing Franchise Act 1980. Briefly, the Act confers certain basic rights on franchisees in relation to, inter alia, the right to prior disclosure, security of tenure, grounds for termination, prohibition of price discrimination, etc. It is enforceable by private action only.</PARA>
<PARA> (8) At this time, yes. I would further point out that the Petroleum Retail Marketing Franchise Act 1980 and Petroleum Retail Marketing Sites Act 1980 are currently the only pieces of Commonwealth legislation of their type. However, the Trade Practices Commission, in consultation with my Department, is currently facilitating the development of a code of conduct for the different business interests in the market that complements and supports the legislation. The Commission is also looking to establish guidelines on price discrimination. I support these initiatives which I understand are designed to ensure that a fair and competitive trading environment prevails. Clearly, if the current level of industry support for the Commission's initiatives is any indication then, in the longer term, the legislation could become redundant.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 21 December 1988 (Hansard, page 4768) Senator Newman asked me a question without notice relating to quality aspects of the manufacture of the new Steyr rifle at the Small Arms Factory, Lithgow, and the cost of 5.56 mm ammunition from the Ammunition Factory, Footscray. The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> On 12 August 1988 the Minister for Defence announced the formation of Australian Defence Industries Pty Ltd. This new company, wholly owned by the Commonwealth will take over the activities of the Office of Defence Production which currently runs Garden Island Dockyard and the various ammunition, ordinance, engineering, small arms and clothing factories. The move is planned for March 1989. The term `privatisation' is not a correct description of this initiative. The Prime Minister has stated that the company will remain Government-owned.</PARA>
<PARA> The quality control system in force at the Small Arms Factory Lithgow is adequate and was reassessed by the Army to be so in December 1988. Both the Army Quality Assurance Service and the Small Arms Factory have taken every necessary measure in recent months to ensure that there was no compromise in quality during the initial production phase of the Steyr rifle, albeit at the expense of some minor delays. It should be noted that the quality problems encountered thus far with SAF were neither insurmountable nor uncharacteristic of an initial production phase for military equipment where the QC standards are high.</PARA>
<PARA> The initial production quantity of the locally produced rifles was delivered in November 1988 for further Army test and evaluation. Prior to this delivery, during part of the initial production process, one bolt sub-assembly which was under endurance testing at the time did fracture in the area of the control pin which connects the bolt to the rest of the weapon assembly. This problem was found to be due to interpretation difficulties with the process data included in the Technical Data Package supplied under the terms of the licence agreement. The problem was corrected and has not recurred even under comprehensive testing. This problem should not be considered as unusual during an initial production phase.</PARA>
<PARA> Production of SS109 NATO 5.56 mm ball ammunition has commenced at the Ammunition Factory Footscray. Manufacturing tolerances and quality standards for this product are extremely high and some difficulties have been experienced in consistently meeting these standards. It would be wrong to assume that similar difficulties would not be experienced by the private sector and overseas manufacturers when attempting to produce the round for the first time. As a result of delays due to these difficulties, the Army initially ordered relatively small quantities of ammunition from Fabrique Nationale of Belgium, to ensure that ammunition was available to meet deliveries of production rifles. The decision to purchase initial supplies from an overseas supplier was not based on costs. It was purely a matter of assuring availability.</PARA>
<PARA> Senator Crichton-Browne's supplementary question on the Ordinance Factory Bendigo does not provide sufficient detail to enable a response to be made.</PARA>
