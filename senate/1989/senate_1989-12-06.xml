<TITLE>Medicare: Abortions</TITLE>
<PARA>The Honourable President and members of the Senate assembled in Parliament. This petition of the below citizens of Australia draws to the attention of the Senate that we support the continued cover for all abortions on the Medicare schedule. We oppose any attempt to restrict access to the rebate under Medicare.</PARA>
<PARA> Medicare cannot pretend to be a Universal health care system without providing a rebate for a termination of pregnancy. Those who will be hardest hit by proposals to restrict access to items 6469, 274 and 275 on the Medicare schedule are poorer and disadvantaged women who will not be able to meet the cost of a non-subsidised abortion.</PARA>
<PARA> Your petitioners humbly pray and request that the Senate will vote against any attempt to restrict access to abortion or any abortion-related items on the Medicare schedule.</PARA>

<TITLE>Pornography</TITLE>
<PARA>To the Honourable the President and members of the Senate in Parliament assembled:</PARA>
<PARA> The humble petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth: That we the undersigned, having great concern that Canberra is now the ``Porn Capital'' of Australia and because of the spread of moral pollution in our nation, call upon the Federal Government to introduce immediate legislation in support of existing State Legislation:</PARA>
<PARA> 1. To provide strict controls over the importation, production, sale, hire or mailing of video-cassettes particularly in the A.C.T., with the open sale and/or hire of only G, PG, and M-rated video cassettes; and the total prohibition of the sale or hire of R rated video-cassettes, so that R rated films can only be viewed in an adult theatre by persons over 18 years. We totally reject the concept of ``X'' rated or ``N.V.E.'' rated video-cassettes, which would allow the legal sale and hire of hard-core pornographic videos for viewing in the homes of our nation, which would endanger our children; and</PARA>
<PARA> 2. To give whole-hearted support to Senator Walter's Private Member's Bill to implement the recommendations of the Select Committee on Videos; and</PARA>
<PARA> 3. To dramatically improve the Federal Attorney-General's Guidelines for Classification of Video tapes/discs, which restrict the importation, production, sale or hire, screening in private homes and especially mailing by Australia Post, so as to include the total prohibition of any pornographic, obscene or blasphemous video cassette, or film which exploits or degrades women as sex objects, or which contain child pornography, bestiality, sodomy, group sex or violent sex acts with women, such as rape and pack rape, sadism and torture, etc., or which promotes homosexuality or lesbianism;</PARA>
<PARA> Your petitioners therefore humbly pray that your Honourable House will protect our society, especially women and children from moral pollution and its harmful effects.</PARA>
<PARA> And your petitioners, as in duty bound, will ever pray.</PARA>

<PARA> The petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth, that:</PARA>
<PARA> We are concerned about the increase in violent television programmes for children and particularly those programmes promoting violent toys that are available for sale in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA> Your petitioners therefore humbly pray:</PARA>
<PARA> That you support the Broadcasting (Prohibition of Violent Programmes for Children) Act 1988 which has been presented by WA Independent Senator for Nuclear Disarmament, Jo Vallentine.

<PARA> The petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth that there is widespread community concern regarding</PARA>

<PARA> 2. the proposal to spend millions of dollars on research into nuclear power, the production of which has in other countries proven expensive and dangerous; and</PARA>
<PARA> 3. the lack of adequate funding for research into, and promotion of alternative renewable sources of energy, in particular, solar power.</PARA>
<PARA>Your petitioners most humbly pray that the Senate in Parliament assembled, should:</PARA>

<PARA> 2. encourage the use of known technology for hot water and space heating by tax incentives on solar heating equipment for houses and commercial buildings.</PARA>

<TITLE>Health Care for the Elderly</TITLE>
<PARA>To the Honourable the President and members of the Senate in Parliament assembled.</PARA>
<PARA> We the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth that,</PARA>
<PARA> Australia's population is ageing and most people require more health services as they grow older.</PARA>
<PARA> if open not-for-profit Health Funds are to be able to meet the costs of providing benefits to their older members at affordable rates, they need to share these costs equitably.</PARA>
<PARA> some health insurance organisations are being allowed to avoid meeting the health costs of sick and elderly people.</PARA>

<PARA> The petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth, that:</PARA>
<PARA> At present all Australians, including those who conscientiously object to war and the preparation of war, are required by law for a portion of their income tax to be spent on military use.</PARA>
<PARA> Your petitioners therefore humbly pray;</PARA>
<PARA> That you support the Peace Tax Trust Fund Bill 1989 which has been presented by Western Australian Independent Senator, Jo Vallentine. This Bill does not propose that anyone be permitted to withhold tax, but that the law should be changed to allow conscientious objectors to divert the military portion of their tax into more positive and socially useful programmes.</PARA>

<TITLE>X-rated and Violent Video Material</TITLE>
<PARA>To the Honourable the President and members of the Senate assembled in Parliament:</PARA>
<PARA> The petition of citizens of Australia points out:</PARA>
<PARA> that all State Governments, States Attorneys-General, most womens' groups and the majority of men in Australia, including significant numbers of Members of Parliament, are totally opposed to the importation and distribution of `X' and excessively violent `R'-rated video pornography in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA> that most `X'-rated material available in Australia is imported.</PARA>
<PARA> that the Federal Government, by its Customs power under the Constitution, and not the A.C.T. Government, is solely responsible for controlling the importation of this pornographic material.</PARA>
<PARA> that by continuing to allow the importation of such pornographic material, the Federal Government is neglecting its responsibility to the women, children and families of Australia.</PARA>
<PARA> Your petitioners therefore, request the Senate to:</PARA>
<PARA> 1. Ban `X'-rated pornographic material at the point of entry into Australia.</PARA>
<PARA> 2. Exclude from the `R'-rating all gratuitously violent material.</PARA>

<TITLE>Company Tax Collection System</TITLE>
<PARA>To the Honourable the President and members of the Senate in the Parliament assembled. The petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth that:</PARA>
<PARA> The Government's Budget decision to change the company tax collection system will be a crippling blow to many small businesses, already suffering as a direct result of the Hawke Labor Government's high interest rate policy.</PARA>
<PARA> The earlier remittance of company tax payments to the Government will substantially reduce the cash-flow position of thousands of small businesses.</PARA>
<PARA> Many small businesses will be driven under as a result of the Government's decision unable to find funds for both tax commitments and new stock, only able to borrow at record high interest rates and unable to claim any tax relief on such borrowings to meet their tax commitment. This having been placed on top of 23% interest and 3% Super etc etc. The Government's proposed changes to the company tax collection system has only been introduced as a greedy grab for more tax revenue.</PARA>
<PARA> The small business community would prefer the Government to completely abandon the proposal rather than make only minor alterations to the original Budget decision, which are not likely to alleviate the situation to any significant extent.</PARA>

<PARA> (1) are opposed to the holding of an Arms Bazaar, AIDEX '89, at the National Exhibition Centre in Canberra on 28-30 November 1989</PARA>
<PARA> (2) believe that it is inappropriate for Australia to seek to offset its balance of payments deficit incurred through the import of expensive and unnecessary military equipment by seeking to double military exports over the next three to five years</PARA>
<PARA> (3) regard it is offensive that on one hand we offer foreign aid to neighbouring countries to improve their material standard of being, while on the other hand the merchants of death seek to persuade their rulers to buy military equipment which is entirely inappropriate to the needs of the people</PARA>

<PARA>To the Honourable the President and members of the Senate in the Parliament assembled, we the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth that:</PARA>
<PARA> The Government's attack upon the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme has cast grave doubts over the future viability of our community pharmacies and their ability to provide much-needed service to the community, including particularly those in rural areas;</PARA>
<PARA>The proposed changes to the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme will further jeopardise the viability of pharmacists;</PARA>
<PARA> The latest decision to slash PBS payments to pharmacists by an average of $1.05 per script is simply unacceptable and will force the closure of many pharmacies.</PARA>

<PARA> If we are not allowed to discipline our children at home, in love and according to God's Word we fear that we will have a nation of completely rebellious children on our hands.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Before debate on this legislation was adjourned last night, I was putting a few figures to the Senate on the capital gains tax. The number of people who have to pay capital gains tax has increased over the last two years, and the amount of paperwork done by accountants in handling the sale of assets that attract capital gains tax has increased along with it. It was pointed out on 2 November by Senator Walsh in answer to a dorothy dix question that 23,225 taxpayers-0.3 per cent of Australians-were paying capital gains tax. We will give him the benefit of the doubt. He may not have had the latest figures, which should have been available, whether they were or not. The latest figure is that 64,453 individuals have paid capital gains tax in the last financial year. That is an increase of 2.8 times on last year. If one extends that to the financial year we have just completed, 1988-89, 177,000 Australians will have paid capital gains tax. Another year down the track, with the same percentage increase, 492,000 Australians will have to keep more and more records through the accounting profession. This may have been an unintended consequence of the Government's move to bring in capital gains tax but unfortunately it is with us.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There are many other unintended aspects of the capital gains tax. For instance, if one varies a partnership one becomes liable for capital gains tax-immediately if certain property was bought after 20 September 1985 and, if it was bought before that date, it becomes liable to capital gains tax in the next round. That includes variations to family partnerships. For instance, if a person decides to bring his or her son or daughter into the partnership of a small business it is deemed to be a variation of the partnership, a new valuation has to be made of the property and the next time around it is liable to capital gains tax. It is liable, of course, if the property was bought after 19 September 1985. </PARA>
<PARA> Last night I was talking about the impossibility of doing financial returns in 28 days, let alone the 15 days which the Government specified in the previous Bill. I believe that it will be impossible to do these returns even in 28 days, considering the amount of work the accounting profession will get all at once. It is one thing for the accounting profession to be snowed under with work but it also has to be paid. Unfortunately, it is the taxpayer who cops the accountant's bill on top of his tax. Of course, it would be much harder to put a taxpayer's profit for the last month of the financial year into dollars for the trading he has done in that time. After all, there is genuinely 30 days credit, from 30 June until 31 July, before one collects anywhere near all of one's profits for sales during that month. </PARA>
<PARA> Under the previous system provisional tax was paid in four instalments: by 15 August, 15 November, 15 February and the balance by 15 April. This was provisional tax for next year's income. That system worked very well for many years and, no doubt, would have worked well for years to come except that this Government wants to bring in the money earlier. The Government rides on the fact that there will be a saving in public debt interest (PDI) by bringing forward tax collections. I suppose that is a fact. But, on the other side of the equation, someone has to pay for it. In 1989-90 it is estimated that $11.5 billion will be collected in company tax. We are led to believe that, because of this legislation, early tax collections for this financial year will be $885m, largely paid by companies balancing their books early. In addition, there will be the $150m I mentioned earlier in 1991 for the same period. However, someone has to pay for this saving in the PDI. The interest bill, as a result of paying the tax earlier, will be removed from the Government and will be paid by the companies themselves. This will particularly affect small businesses which will have to pay increased interest as a result of borrowing to pay their tax earlier. As I said, this measure is a de facto income tax in its own right. Businesses will have to borrow money to pay tax which will not be tax deductable. </PARA>
<PARA> I move to self-assessment and the removal of the true and full disclosure provision. A self-assessment system for determining tax has operated in part since 1986. It operated virtually on a trial basis at the beginning but more so as time has gone on. Under this system, taxpayers lodge a return which is not subject to detailed technical scrutiny, with the Commissioner of Taxation calculating tax payable and issuing an assessment on the basis that the return is correct. Under the new provisions, firstly, companies will still be required to lodge a tax return, with less information than normal, showing taxable income and tax payable. Secondly, the return is to be lodged with the final payment, and an assessment is deemed to have been made on the day the return is lodged. Thirdly, the Government has removed the concept of true and full disclosure from the self-assessment system. Fourthly, the limitation period applying to amendments up or down on the taxpayer's liability has been increased to four years, except in the case of fraud and evasion. Previously it was three years where full and true disclosure was made. If that measure-that is, total disclosure-was not made, the Australian Taxation Office could amend it up to six years. Fifthly, the required period for the preservation of records for income tax purposes has been reduced from seven years to five. This is a measure I welcome. A lot of unnecessary paper can now be thrown out after five years rather than seven. </PARA>
<PARA> I have no comments to make on points one, two and five, but I have grave reservations about points three and four. Taking point three firstly-that is, the true and full disclosure aspect-it would be fair to say that, with more and more self-assessment being used, it is only a natural progression that this aspect could be eliminated. Certain sections of the accounting profession would say that it is only a natural progression for self-assessment to contain minimal amounts of figures and other information, but then it could never be deemed to be full disclosure. It could be deemed to be true disclosure, but not full exposure. Some people seem to agree that it could be done away with. However, I disagree with this notion. Though I agree with self-assessment in principle, it is of utmost concern to me that this provision in the Bill will do away with the protection afforded to honest taxpayers, especially those with limited resources. Correspondingly, the Commissioner will have greater discretion. </PARA>
<PARA> The next point I am concerned with is the question of contentious issues in taxpayers' returns. Senator Stone pointed this out last night. With self-assessment, even a contentious issue is taken to be correct for the moment of assessment. With the removal of full and true disclosure, there is no replacement protection for taxpayers from the substantial tax penalties in these cases. There is no mechanism for obtaining greater certainty from the tax system by way of binding rulings being obtained from the Commissioner. With true and full disclosure, there was protection where there were arguable issues. The position was that if one made a true and full disclosure on a contentious issue-it may not be a contentious issue, but a new interpretation-one could put in a tax return and the Commissioner would assess the return and give a decision on it. It is all well and good if he allowed something; if he did not, the assessment could be changed but there were no penalties. </PARA>
<PARA> Even under abridged tax returns, an option should remain for the taxpayer to have his or her assessment assessed and receive a definite ruling on a taxation matter which can have more than one answer. That option should be available to people whose returns are not necessarily contentious, but on which two answers could be given. We should bear in mind that under the new four-year amendment rule, a commissioner who gives a certain ruling this year may have a vastly different view in four years time. Ideas, political pressure, and media pressure can result in a changed view on the same facts. Hence, after looking at the same facts four years later, a commissioner or his staff could come up with a totally different interpretation. </PARA>
<PARA> There are further problems with this idea. For example, a small businessman puts in a tax assessment and the money remaining-the profit-can be invested further in his business. But if an assessment is contentious, one does not know whether the Commissioner is going to review it in four years time. One has to be careful to make sure that funds are available and that one does not have to borrow again if the Commissioner makes a different ruling in that four years. One would not only have to have the money to pay the extra tax, but also the penalties that go with it. That is a very important issue. That situation applies already to companies waiting for long term assessments. </PARA>
<PARA> I now move to the point of changing the three-year amendment rule to four years and the limitation applying to increasing a taxpayer's liability other than in the case of fraud. This also includes the reduction of liability. The Bill, however, will provide for the Commissioner to be able to seek an extension of this new four-year provision in the Federal Court of Australia. I have no trouble about that. It seems reasonable in principle, but it seems to me that there is no right for the taxpayer to put his view to the Court against the extension being granted. If the Commissioner seeks a tax liable variation beyond 20 per cent of the assessment, I believe the taxpayer has the right to appear before the Federal Court and put forward his case about why it should not be extended. I understand that if it is a liable variation which is less than 20 per cent, then he has not got that right. </PARA>
<PARA> It does not worry me if the Commissioner gets an extension in the case of dishonest taxpayers, I do not care if the extension is for 20 years. Leaving aside the case of less than honest taxpayers, the danger lies in a provision that the Commissioner can use to overcome inefficiency in his own Department. It would be simple for the Commissioner to appear before the Federal Court to ask for an extension on some pretence or other. The reasons that the Commissioner can ask for an extension are set out in the Bill. I do not have the time to go through them now, but they are quite varied and they can be used to get an extension simply if the Department is running behind time in carrying out field audits. I presume that most of the extensions asked for will arise from audits. If the Department is running behind and cannot deal with all the audits in time, it simply has to go to the Federal Court and apply for extensions to overcome its inefficiencies. Therefore, I believe that the taxpayer should have the right to appear and put his case. </PARA>
<PARA> The taxpayer must have the right to be advised of the Commissioner's intention to go to the Court so he can put his own case forward, if the liability is assessed at over 20 per cent, to test whether the Commissioner does have valid reasons to apply for an extension and not simply for the Department to be able to catch up with its work. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, I turn to the Bill's provision for deductability of fees paid to tax advisers for income tax advice and disputing an assessment, tribunal fees and court costs. Especially added to this is the cost associated with audits by the Australian Taxation Office. The audit costs are so heavy these days that one is even able to take out insurance to cover the possibility of such an occurrence. The cost of an audit, even in a small or medium sized business, would be tens of thousands of dollars because one would have to have one's accountants doing the tax returns and in attendance all the time. Their charges do not come cheaply. The deductability for tax advice is an overdue measure and I congratulate my colleague Senator Watson for the results of the work he has done on this issue. He brought forward a private members' Bill and the Government adopted the idea. </PARA>
<PARA> In conclusion, I support the amendments moved by my colleague Senator Stone and emphasise my concerns about in some of the more nasty provisions of the legislation. I am looking forward to speaking on the finer points at the committee stage. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Senate is cognately debating three Bills relating to the tax area. They are the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 4) 1989, Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 5) 1989, and the Income Tax (International Agreements) Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1989. There is very little that needs to be said about the last Bill. It simply provides legislative authority for the entry into force of comprehensive double taxation agreements between Australia and Papua New Guinea and between Australia and Thailand. Those are regular items that come before the Senate as Australia and other countries reach agreements in regard to taxation issues.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The important Bills that need some discussion here are the other two. The Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 4) 1989 is essentially a research and development (R&amp;D) measure. It broadens, as the Minister for Consumer Affairs (Senator Bolkus) said in his second reading speech, the income tax concession for research and development project expenditure incurred after 20 November 1987. It also extends its availability for a further four years with deductions being allowed at a rate of 150 per cent to 30 June 1993 and at the rate of 125 per cent until 30 June 1995. It is worthwhile pointing out that this reflects on Australia's poor R&amp;D record and on the attitude that the manufacturing sector and other sectors take in this country with regard to going into research and development projects in new technology for export development markets for developing new import replacement items. It may come as a shock to many people to recognise, when they look at Australia's record in R&amp;D funding in comparison with many other countries, that Australia is well and truly down the list. We sit here on a daily basis and grizzle about the fact that we have a trade deficit, that we are not developing new export markets, that we are not developing new import replacement items, and then wonder why this is happening. The fact is that most other countries, particularly since the war, have taken much more extensive measures than have Australia and Australian industry in gearing themselves up for new markets and new technological developments. </PARA>
<PARA> It is not surprising that a country like Japan leaves Australia for dead in its technological and other developments when we consider how much money it was prepared to pour into investment opportunities. The Japanese Government, for example, after World War II made a conscious decision that it would make available to anybody who wished to borrow it, cheap money for researching and developing new products. Like Australia, prior to World War II Japan was very much a rural based economy. It knew in the middle 1940s that it could not continue in that way and, by a variety of devices, including not taxing the interest that Japanese people earned on savings that they put into Japanese banking institutions, Japan acquired a significantly large amount of money to be lent at low interest rates to those people who were interested in researching and developing new projects. </PARA>
<PARA> The Australian attitude has been somewhat different. By and large, if we do not give a 150 per cent tax deduction to people who are looking at R&amp;D, they will not engage in those activities. The other problem that we face in this country is an attitudinal one. If Australian industry cannot produce the world's best mousetrap tomorrow, it has a tendency not to bother even looking into the matter. It leaves it to somebody else who will perhaps spend 10, 20 or more years in developing a system for new products and then wonder why we are left behind in international markets. It is about time that management, in particular, recognised that productivity and developing new markets are its responsibility. It should stop blaming the work force, high wages and high taxes in this country, when its colleagues in other countries-for example, those in Europe-have been prepared to face much higher taxes than here. It should get off its backside and do a bit of work, spend a bit of money, look a little further forward than the next election and produce the sorts of goods that Australia needs to get itself out of its economic malaise. </PARA>
<PARA> It is with some irony, but nevertheless approval, I suppose, that we see the Government extending those R&amp;D incentives to business and industry for a further five or so years. I hope that one day we will see a situation in Australia where industry does not have to be given a 150 per cent tax deduction before it is prepared to put its money where its mouth is, to stop whingeing about how we are non-competitive and to start getting around to some research and some development of new export items and import replacement items. </PARA>
<PARA> Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 5) is a different kettle of fish entirely. It contains some essentially non-controversial matters such as the land tax deductability of fees paid for the management and administration of a taxpayer's income tax affairs, enabling more people to get the advantage of the special tax exemption given to qualifying fixed interest approved deposit funds and so on under the May 1988 changes. Those are non-controversial and have not caused any particular comment either in this place or in the House of Representatives. </PARA>
<PARA> However, the Bill does two things which are regarded as significantly controversial. It is introducing a new system for the collection of company tax and it is moving to extend to companies the self-assessment procedure that currently applies to pay as you earn (PAYE) taxpayers. We have heard a great deal from the Opposition with regard to both proposals, in particular, quite rightly, with regard to the originally proposed new system of collection of company tax-including, by the way, from superannuation rollover funds-that was announced by the Government on Budget night. That announcement has since been significantly amended, due in no considerable part to the pressure that has been applied to the Government by non-government parties. In many ways, that change to the collection of company tax can be regarded as nothing much more than a one-off revenue-raiser that the Government perceived as being a good idea at the time. But it seemed not to take into consideration the considerable and very undesirable impact the changes were likely to have on small business. The Government decided to change the current system and bring forward the payment of company tax without taking into account in any real way, apparently, the cash flow problems or the credit access problems that are facing many small businesses in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> Until Budget night, companies with a tax liability of $1,000 or more paid their tax in four instalments spread over the year following the income year. The Government then decided that it could accumulate quite a nice little one-off nest egg if it changed that system and made the new arrangements such that the quarterly tax payments were replaced by a new system whereby all companies were required to pay 85 per cent of their notional tax in a single instalment due 15 days after the end of the income period. For most companies that meant 15 days after 30 June; that is, they were expected to produce 85 per cent of their notional tax on 15 July with the remaining 15 per cent being paid nine months later. The reason for this, if Mr Keating's calculations are anything to go by, was that this would produce something a little less than a billion dollars for this financial year's revenue and that the Government would save some $330m in public debt interest because it would get that $885m earlier and would therefore have to borrow less. However, it did not take into account the enormous pressure that this was going to apply to many small businesses. </PARA>
<PARA> Companies under the proposed arrangement were to get only 15 days from the end of the financial year to estimate their tax liability and then to produce 85 per cent of that to the Commissioner of Taxation. That meant that tax agents and accountants were going to be inundated with requests to calculate just exactly what their clients' corporate tax liability was and they were expected to do it in little more than two weeks. That is significantly unrealistic in any terms. Bringing forward a tax payment of this size will mean that companies will be forced to reduce their working capital to pay their liabilities. In many cases, they are likely to face the problem of borrowing the money at a time when, as small companies, they are facing cash flow problems of no small consequence-all of this happening at a time when company sales and profits are generally falling because the Government, one can only assume deliberately, has engineered a sort of mini-recession through a massive hike in interest rates. </PARA>
<PARA> These small companies are facing some quite severe financial problems. Anybody who knows anybody at all in small business will tell us that the normal 30-day credit that small businessmen allow people who buy their products has been extended, to all intents and purposes, to a de facto 60-day credit, simply because the people they sell to are having trouble meeting their own repayments. This means that the suppliers of the original small business are being asked to wait while business A waits to collect from business B. </PARA>
<PARA> They have a couple of options: they can stop selling to people who will not pay in less than 30 days, which immediately affects their own sales and profitability, or they can borrow or lift their overdraft rate in order to meet the demands from their suppliers. Neither of those is a particularly acceptable mechanism. To then have thumped on them a requirement that 15 days after the end of their income period they had to pay 85 per cent of their notional tax to the Government was an appalling imposition. Most of them would have been forced to borrow that money. That, in itself, would have increased their own debt problem, but it would have also placed-when one considers how many small businesses in this country are pushed into that position-enormous pressure on the lending institutions. That almost inevitably would have forced interest rates even higher than they currently are. I do not know who dreams up some of these ideas in Treasury or the Tax Office, but certainly he or she needs a long, quiet holiday somewhere because coming up with this kind of scheme effectively is going to kill one of the few geese in this country that is still laying a few golden eggs; that is, the small business community, with its employing prospects and its ever decreasing profitability. </PARA>
<PARA> It was with ironic pleasure, I suppose, that we noted that eventually the Treasurer, Mr Keating, got the message from small business and on 2 November announced that companies with a notional tax of a significantly higher amount than that did not need to comply. The Government decided that companies with a notional tax of between $1,000 and $20,000 could elect to pay the total actual tax liability on 15 December, instead of 85 per cent on 15 July, and 15 per cent nine months later. In the debate in the House of Representatives, Dr Hewson moved an unsuccessful amendment to increase the threshold for 15 December full payments from $20,000 to $80,000. That would have been a permanent amendment to the tax Act-or as permanent as amendments to the tax Act ever are in this country. The Government, jollied along, I presume, by the fact that the Treasurer was overseas, then decided to go even further and it introduced two more amendments. It increased the $20,000 threshold for 15 December full tax paying companies to $400,000. That, in itself, makes one wonder exactly who, if anybody, is thinking up there and what he or she is thinking about. We have jumped in two moves from $1,000 to almost $500,000 in what the Government is prepared to allow companies to earn before they have to bring forward. What in heaven's name is going on in some government departments?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Stone says, `Sheer expediency'. Maybe this indicates that we will have a February election; I do not know, and I do not much care except that it is an indicator of the incapacity of some decision-makers in government and in the instrumentalities that advise government to make bizarre decisions for single instance increases in the Government's revenue raising without looking at the ramifications for the greater economic context of this country and, in particular, the part played in that by small business.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> So, the Government increased the $20,000 threshold, having previously increased the $1,000 threshold to $400,000, but it did so only for the 1990-91 tax year. So it is a transitional measure only. I am concerned about that because that will mean, albeit with at least a year's warning this time, that companies will have to bring forward their tax payments the following year. The Government also altered the initial tax payment date from 15 days after the end of the year of income to 28 days after the end of the year of income. I suppose that we should be grateful for small mercies. </PARA>
<PARA> I am disappointed that the Opposition is not pursuing the Hewson amendment as a request from this place. I understand that the Opposition is not continuing with that amendment. At the very least it could have been put by the Senate as a request for the Government to make the changes in the 1991-92 year so that there were increased thresholds of earnings and notional tax applicable after the one year's grace, if one can call it that, that the Government has introduced through this one-off system that will take us into the next financial year. </PARA>
<PARA> The other concern that has been expressed about the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 5) is that it has extended to companies the self-assessment procedure that applies to PAYE taxpayers. I have had absolutely no correspondence from people in the business sector with regard to their concerns for self-assessment. At least, if I have done, it has slipped by me without my noticing it, and that is a fairly unlikely event. I do not think that it will cause the sorts of hassles and concerns that some members of the Opposition believe it will. PAYE taxpayers have been subjected to self-assessment since 1986. All that this Bill does is extend that system to companies. Under self-assessment, taxpayers calculate their own tax payable, lodge a return and at some stage may or may not be subject to an audit. I can only assume that there are a few people lodging company tax returns who are a bit bothered by the idea of suddenly being hit by an audit. If that is the case, maybe they will get only what they deserve. </PARA>
<PARA> Despite what it sounds like, self-assessment does not mean that people can choose to pay whatever tax they deem to be appropriate to the Tax Office, although I am sure that there are many ordinary individuals who would not mind being able to have a self-assessment procedure of that sort so that they can decide what they think the Tax Office deserves to get from them, and pay it accordingly. Treasury would be reduced to collecting next to nothing if that were the case. Self-assessment does not mean that a person sits down and assesses what he or she would like to pay, it essentially means that--</PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Senator Stone" NAMEID="LJ4">

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="1H4">Senator HAINES</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;People assess what they are liable to pay-what the Government is likely ultimately to drag out of them, whether or not they are kicking and screaming at the time, is irrelevant-and they have to pay that accordingly. What it essentially does is free up some resources that have otherwise been used within the Tax Office for other purposes in audit coverage. Maybe the concern of some members of the business community is that while tax officers are not tied up in going through individual company tax returns, they are going to be much freer and there will be many more of them able to undertake audits of companies they suspect of using tax loopholes or complicated tax systems to avoid paying the sort of tax that is their due. I think the revenue implications of this, therefore, could be quite considerable in several ways. First of all, substantial tax and penalties are earned from taxpayers caught engaging in avoidance or evasion practices. In the 1988-89 tax year the Australian Taxation Office audit program raised a little under $1 billion in extra revenue. That is something to be applauded. Nobody likes people who cheat on their tax. If there was, in that year alone, something like $1 billion-$910m, in fact-raised through tax audits, we ought to acknowledge that there are a lot of people out in the community, in companies and elsewhere, who are either deliberately or perhaps inadvertently, but much more likely the former, reducing their tax liability by a variety of means which are frowned upon by the Government and ought to be frowned upon by everybody else in the community.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Despite what some people think about the tax system, it is the revenue that provides us, if it is spent properly, with decent hospitals, decent schools, roads, research and development funding, if necessary, and so on. If the money is not raised it cannot be spent. I, like a lot of members of parliament, get letters from people complaining about the tax they pay, and similar letters from other people complaining that the Government is not spending enough on one service or another. One cannot have it both ways. To have some people, particularly major companies, avoiding their social responsibilities to the tune of $910m in the 1988-89 tax year is something that we ought to be concerned about. The increased audit activity is likely therefore, just by being there, to encourage-shall we say-better compliance with the tax laws, maybe by those companies who are worried about being audited, and certainly by those companies who have already been audited and found that they have had to pay back-tax plus a penalty. </PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Democrats are not at all concerned about the implications of self-assessment for companies. It can only mean that those companies who have been avoiding paying tax by whatever means in the past will be forced to pay that money. If we were living with a benign government, and in an ideal world, that means that the tax paid by the rest of us may even be reduced. Maybe some of us will live to see that happen. </PARA>
<PARA> Our major concern with the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 5) lies with what is going to happen down the track to small companies who are forced to comply with the bring forward requirements under this legislation. The one-year reprieve that most of them will get under the second of the Government's two amendments is fine as far as it goes, but I would like to hear from other Opposition speakers why they are not proceeding with the Hewson amendment, which we certainly would have supported by way of a request to the Government from this place. We cannot amend tax laws in the Senate but we can certainly request that the House accede to an amendment put forward by the Senate. In 1981 we had singular success in doing that with some sales tax laws that the Fraser Government introduced. </PARA>
<PARA> We still have a way to go in this second reading debate and a considerable way to go in the committee stage. I ask Senator Baume and Senator Short, if he has not already spoken, to indicate whether the Opposition will see fit to raise this amendment by way of a request and put some pressure on the Government to acknowledge that a one-year stand-off is not going to help small businesses. If it can by degrees raise the original level from $1,000 to $400,000, and the profitability level from $2,500 to nearly $1m, and if it can do that for a single year, it ought to be prepared to acknowledge that there will be subsequent problems in the 1991-92 tax year and do something to protect small businesses from that. They are, at the moment, to a major extent, the ones feeling the pinch in the business community from economic pressures as the Treasurer (Mr Keating) tries to keep the economy at the tight level that it currently is at. It is, therefore, incumbent on us to make sure that not too many of them go down the gurgler with the subsequent loss of services to the community, of choice to the community, and of employment in the community. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Bills that we are debating cognately today, the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 4) 1989, the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 5) 1989, and the Income Tax (International Agreements) Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1989, are a package which collectively imposes some very significant changes to the taxation of certain sectors of the Australian community, in particular the small and medium business community. I want to address my remarks today entirely to the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 5) and specifically to one part of that Bill. It is a very broad ranging and important Bill. It amends the Income Tax Assessment Act in many ways, including in relation to the collection of taxation, returns of income and the franking of dividends. It also amends the Crimes (Taxation Offences) Act 1980 and the Taxation Administration Act 1953.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Before getting into the detail of what I propose to speak about, the point must be made that, despite the amendments that the Government has introduced to this Bill since its contents were first announced in the Budget-and there have been two amendments proposed by the Government since then-this Bill will still have quite draconian effects on small and medium sized businesses, certainly after the next financial year. It continues what I believe has been a quite vicious tax attack on the small and medium business sector in this country over recent years. </PARA>
<PARA> In many ways small and medium businesses have been raped by the Commissioner of Taxation and by the Government to enable it to gain revenue to pay off its mates and do all the other sorts of things that have become the hallmark of this Government through its refusal to take broadly based and necessary measures of economic policy action, at both the macro and the micro level. We have had significant debate on the micro-economic reform failures of the Government in recent days. I do not propose to go over that again today. So far as I understand, there was no consultation at all with the business community in the development of this package of Bills that we are looking at. That is an approach that compares very vividly with matters which may affect the trade union movement. Then, of course, there seems to be total consultation and, indeed, in most instances, total capitulation to the views of the trade union movement. </PARA>
<PARA> If one looks at the treatment accorded the trade union movement, one can see what the Government and the Treasurer (Mr Keating) mean by so-called tax equity, because there have been huge taxation changes affecting the private sector in the past couple of years. The most notorious example perhaps-and it is one that I cannot comprehend the Government getting away with, and I do not believe it will continue to get away with it to the extent it has-is the enormous changes of a detrimental nature for all of us in relation to the taxation of the superannuation industry, at a cost of literally billions of dollars to the Australian community through the treatment of superannuation funds and superannuation companies. Perhaps that has been the most notorious of them but there have been many other examples as well, several of which are reflected in the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 5) 1989. </PARA>
<PARA> But if we look at the taxation treatment of the trade union movement over the last couple of years, we find a staggeringly different situation. It is not hit by these changes; it is exempted from the capital gains tax; and it is not hit by the fringe benefits tax. Indeed, we have a series of proposals designed to pull forward the revenues from thousands of small and medium sized businesses. In the process there is no doubt that we will see thousands of these businesses sent to the wall while the favoured half of the family of the labour movement-namely, the trade union movement-is left totally exempt from these taxes. </PARA>
<PARA> The amendments that the Government has moved to its original Budget proposals will not fundamentally alter the situation that confronts the small and medium sized business sector, other than in the first year. I wonder whether the small business community has really caught up with the fact that the amendments-and particularly the second amendment proposed by the Government, obviously hastily concocted for opportunistic, political reasons with an election coming up, but an amendment that was rushed into the House of Representatives on 22 November-will apply only for the first transitional year and, thereafter, the full draconian thrust of the Government's proposals will come into force. So for the Government to say that it has taken account of the fundamental concerns of the small and medium sized business sector in relation to the change in the tax payment arrangements is to state an absolute lie other than in the first year. </PARA>
<PARA> The Treasurer has continued the arrangement whereby the bulk of company tax will be required to be paid in two instalments: the first payment, being 85 per cent of notional tax, will be due on 28 July in the year following the year of income; and the final payment will be due in March of the following year; that is, in relation to companies that have a notional tax liability of $20,000 or more, and those are the companies that I am basically concerned with, at least in my contribution to this debate. The Government, in its amendment, said-and I am quoting from the explanatory memorandum:</PARA>
<PARA>as a transitional measure, the $20,000 threshold referred to above will be $400,000 for the year of income ending 30 June 1990;</PARA>
<PARA>I repeat: it is only in the first year. That contrasts very markedly with the proposal that was put forward by the Opposition in the House of Representatives when this Bill was debated there on 22 November, whereby the Opposition proposed that the tax liability limit be raised from $20,000 to roughly the equivalent of $80,000. In other words, a company with a taxable income of $200,000 or less would be exempt from these new changes in payment arrangements. Of course, that was a proposal of an ongoing nature which would have applied from one year to the next; not just the transitional year that the Government has introduced. I have considerable sympathy with the comments of Senator Haines in this debate, but that is a matter for the Opposition spokesman on taxation matters to comment on further. </PARA>
<PARA> The costing of the Government's changes I also find difficult to follow because we now have three. In the Budget, the Treasurer said that the changes then proposed would:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . bring forward $885 million in revenue this year but, more significantly, will generate an ongoing saving in public debt interest of about $330 million per year. </PARA>
<PARA>Between then and the Bill actually being formulated and coming into the House of Representatives in November, that assessment of $885m in this year and $330m for each year thereafter has been changed, according to the explanatory memorandum that was available to members of the House of Representatives when they were debating this Bill, to $880m this year and $150m in ensuing years. </PARA>
<PARA> I can understand the reduction of $5m from the Budget figure of $885-that is as a result of the minor amendment that was made and announced by the Treasurer on 2 November-but I do not understand how the $330m that was mentioned as the ongoing saving in public debt interest after the first year could conceivably have fallen as a result of that first amendment, the 2 November amendment, to a figure of $150m-that was the figure shown in the House of Representatives explanatory memorandum-because there is no way that that minor change of 2 November could have had that effect. I ask the Minister for Finance (Senator Walsh) to explain how that change could have arisen, and how it is that despite the second and more considerable transitional year amendment that has subsequently been announced, the figure for the ongoing revenue gain will remain unchanged at $150m a year. </PARA>
<PARA> Those figures just do not add up. It is an indication of several things. First of all, it is an admission that the Government has rushed into these changes without any real idea of what they will cost. My guess is that the Government did not have a clue as to what effect the original proposal would have. Certainly, it is quite obvious from the subsequent figures that we have been given that they must be regarded as rubbery in the extreme. </PARA>
<PARA> The other point that needs to be made about the changes that the Government is now proposing is that despite the cost to the revenue of the subsequent amendments, particularly the amendment of 22 November, no explanation has been given to the Parliament as to how that revenue loss will be funded. Presumably it will be funded simply by allowing the Budget net outturn to change accordingly, and that is in marked contrast to the way in which the Opposition has approached the amendment in the interests of the small and medium sized business sector that was produced in the House of Representatives on 22 November. We said that our concession to the revenue would be fully funded by the cancellation of the totally unjustified payment to Kodak (Australasia) Pty Ltd as a quick-fix political deal and by the equally and, indeed, more notorious payment to the airlines to enable them to try to keep sweet with the trade union movement and to preserve the accord. So our amendment was fully funded. It has been properly costed. It is not transitional; it is an ongoing proposal, and the Government's proposal, as I said, does not really solve the problem at all. We have in this legislation a continuation of a savage attack by this Government on the small and medium sized business sector. It is not just an attack through the taxation system; it continues an ongoing attack on the business sector, particularly the small and medium sized business sector--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As Senator Stone says, the pharmacists are a classic example when it comes to the Government changing the rules of the game, changing the playing field supposedly to make it more level. But, as we all know, that is absolute nonsense. The playing field has not been made more level; the Government has progressively disadvantaged those very sectors of our economy which we are going to rely on to get us out of the dreadful hole that the Government's economic policies have dug for this nation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is the small and medium sized business sector, along with families, that have suffered the worst of all blows from this Government, as a result of the incredibly increased burden that the interest rate structure has imposed on them-a direct result of the mismanagement of this Government. The changes to the tax arrangements proposed in the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 5) compound the interest rate problems that the small business sector is already facing because meeting the payment arrangements being proposed by the Government in this legislation will cause most small and medium sized businesses, after the transitional year, to have to borrow very heavily indeed immediately after the conclusion of their financial year-and they are already paying interest rates of between 21 and 25 per cent. The pressure that will be put on the financial markets and therefore on interest rates as small and medium sized businesses have to go to the market to meet their tax liabilities will be enormous. I doubt whether the Government has given the slightest consideration to the impact of these taxation proposals on the financial markets, particularly during that seasonal period in July of each year after this first transitional year. </PARA>
<PARA> I am sure we have all received numerous representations of concern from small and medium sized businesses about these proposals. They are very genuinely and logically based objections. I have here a copy of a letter from a company that wrote to the Treasurer on 1 November-before the amendments were introduced, but the thrust of the letter is still entirely relevant. It is from the Rider Hunt group of construction cost consultants and quantity surveyors in my own State of Victoria. It is a letter very representative of many of the other letters I have received. It is a letter to the Treasurer expressing concern about the proposals contained in Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 5) and makes the point, which has been made by many speakers on this side of the House during this debate, that not only will there be great pressure on companies to borrow to meet their tax requirements but also there will be difficulty in arriving at a figure within, now, 28 days of the end of the financial year and producing accounts which will give a reasonably accurate indication of their taxable income. I wish to quote several paragraphs from the letter:</PARA>
<PARA> By the middle of every month we prepare a profit and loss statement for the previous month and this enables us to monitor our performance to ensure that our business is running efficiently and any problems are picked up very quickly. </PARA>
<PARA> The monthly profit and loss statement is by no means an audited or final figure as many other factors have to be taken into account in the overall assessment of our profits for the year. </PARA>
<PARA> Such items as bad debts, fees accrued reserve, interest in the parent Company, overseas cross holding with Hong Kong and New Zealand are all factors that our accountants review when finalising our profits for the year. Any of these items can have quite a significant effect on the profit figures for the year. </PARA>
<PARA>The letter goes on to make a very important point; one that has been commented on by other speakers, including Senator Stone, and I know that Senator Michael Baume and Senator Messner are greatly concerned about this:</PARA>
<PARA> You-</PARA>
<PARA>that is, the Treasurer-</PARA>
<PARA>will therefore realise that although by approximately the 15th of every month we do have some idea of our profits this cannot be considered as a figure on which we would be prepared to finally commit ourselves for taxation purposes. </PARA>
<PARA> Therefore to impose a fine of considerable proportion if there is an error of 10 per cent is draconian to say the least and undoubtedly this, together with the earlier collection of tax, will lead to the bankruptcy of many small businesses. </PARA>
<PARA> You appear to be proposing a law that will seriously affect the small business community in Australia and I strongly urge you to reconsider, with your parliamentary colleagues, the arrangements proposed. </PARA>
<PARA> Normally it takes us approximately 6 months to finalise our accounts and I would not consider this to be an unreasonable period in which to allow a business to provide a proper profit and loss statement on which to calculate tax. </PARA>
<PARA>That is a statement reflected by hundreds-or more-of similar letters that I know we have all received and that I assume the Government and its advisers have received since these proposals were announced. The amendments introduced on 22 November, I repeat, in no way tackle the problems of the small and medium sized business sector, other than in the first transitional year. The fundamental problems will be ongoing. This Bill is a very bad Bill. It is a Bill the thrust of which is quite contrary to what this country needs. We should not be giving handouts through tax benefits or in any other way to the business sector, but for heavens sake why are we squeezing and squeezing that very sector of our economy which we require and which we are all urging, hour by hour, to be more productive and more efficient so it can be more competitive in a highly and increasingly competitive international environment? Why are our Government policies doing quite the opposite of what is really required? I join other Opposition speakers in strongly criticising this Bill, and I have pleasure in supporting the amendment moved by Senator Stone on behalf of the Opposition that, at the end of the motion that the Bill be read a second time, we add the following words:</PARA>
<PARA>``, but the Senate:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) condemns the Government for its flagrant disregard in its taxation policies of the circumstances faced by many small businesses in Australia, as typified by its original 1989 Budget decision on company tax collection; and</PARA>
<PARA> (b) rejects the Government's proposals on self-assessment of company tax because of the inadequate safeguards to protect the integrity of taxpayers''. </PARA>
<PARA>The Opposition has raised many points in this debate-and there is much else it could say-but this amendment puts our position very clearly. I hope that the Government will take account of some of the comments made in the debate before it finalises the enactment of this legislation. If it does not, it will be adding just another set of nails to the coffin of the small and medium sized business sector of this country. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I support what Senator Short has been saying and I certainly support the Opposition's amendments to this legislation. In particular, I point out to the Senate that this legislation represents the latest instalment in the Government's non-stop succession of mistakes. It has the capacity to mess up legislation, particularly taxation legislation which has involved non-stop changes and fiddles. Not only have we had a situation where the legislation has been announced months before it has arrived in this place but we then have the situation where, after it arrives before the Parliament, it gets changed and changed; in this legislation in three months we have had three versions of what the threshold should be. What sort of certainty does that give to the taxpayers? What sort of confidence does it give to anyone that this Government knows what it is doing or that the Australian Taxation Office knows what it is doing? In this legislation we are now giving the Taxation Office even more discretion.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I do not want to be a knocker of the Tax Office or a knocker of the Government but the fact is that I am sick and tired of having legislation come into this place that has to be dramatically amended because the Government does not understand. The legislation itself is prepared by people who do not understand and by a Government that does not understand the real impacts of this kind of thing on the private sector. We have continual change, continual mess, continual uncertainty and, I might say, increasing discretion to the Commissioner of Taxation. It is totally unsatisfactory. We have a situation here where the industry was simply not consulted. It was a sort of confrontation approach as to how to go about doing this sort of thing. </PARA>
<PARA> I remind the Senate that in the days when Mr John Howard was the Federal Treasurer, there was a Taxation Advisory Committee so that there were top practitioners-not only competent but totally honourable men, as the experience of that Committee demonstrated-who provided the Government with advice. So it did not make the sorts of silly continual mistakes that this Government has been making in the area of tax. </PARA>
<PARA> This Government is too arrogant to consider that the private sector would have any capacity to provide honest, decent and useful input. The fact is that if this Government were a little less arrogant, a little less concerned about papering over the cracks in its own policies-by artificially bringing forward, as this legislation does, close to $900m of revenue to make its surplus look a little more respectable this year-it would be a little more concerned about the impact of its policies and its actions on the private sector which is struggling to recover and to succeed in an environment where, as a result of this Government's policies, interest rates for small business in particular, are up around the 21 to 25 per cent mark. This Government should have more concern about what is really happening in the real Australia and less concern about its own arrogance, its own determination to be seen to be having a level of surplus that happens to make it look good, a level of surplus achieved not by cutting its own expenditures enough but by continually increasing tax revenues. That is what this legislation is all about. It is by increasing the level of tax, in this case company tax, that will make the surplus look bigger this year. </PARA>
<PARA> It is simply a timing device. But the timing device does a few other things. It massively increases business costs because the money has to come from somewhere, and it will come largely from borrowings. The people who will pay tax will have to pay interest on the borrowings to meet that tax. I will go into that later. How it will be established, how the Tax Commissioner will determine that X amount borrowed at a particular time is in fact for the purpose of paying tax which is not deductable as against being borrowed for the purpose of carrying out business, how it will make that subtle brilliant distinction we do not know because there is no statement from the Tax Office about how this is going to be administered. All these brilliant things we have to leave to the discretion of the Commissioner. I must say that I find this whole approach of a basic lack of understanding of the reality of the small businesses environment-in fact, of the total private sector-to be massively disappointing. It is a matter that has shattered the confidence of business at a time when it is already shattered by this Government's incompetent monetary policy, by its failure to take the fiscal measures that have meant that Australia's external debt is so huge and, as a result, that interest rates are so massive and now, of course, our bankruptcies are on the up and up, despite Government Ministers quaint attempts to try to prove the other day that the bankruptcies were going down. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Haines made some good points. I must say that I do not usually acknowledge that she has made good points because generally she has not. But this time she has because she correctly noted that the big changes in this legislation were forced on the Government by the non-government parties. The coalition of course was to the fore. It is no coincidence that on that very day the Government made this latest change-22 November-when it said, `Yes, the Opposition has been right. It is an unfair burden so, as a temporary measure during this transition period, we will not have such a low threshold which is $20,000, we will increase it to $400,000'. Is it not quaint that that happened on the very day that the Opposition moved an amendment to the second reading motion in the House of Representatives calling on the Government to increase substantially the threshold to which the two new instalment company tax arrangements will apply. The very day that the Opposition went out and said what it would do to fix this up, the Government magically discovered that it could increase that particular threshold to $400,000. No costing was mentioned, of course. If ever the Opposition puts up any proposal the Government says, `Yes, but what will it cost?' and tries to damage the credibility of Opposition statements because the Government says either the costings are not there or they are not realistic. This Government has not even provided a costing on this latest change. Apparently, it does not know what it will cost. If it does know it is not prepared to say. If it does not know it is incompetent; if it is not prepared to say then it is deceptive. It is about time that this Government came clean and did say what the reality is now that the changes have been made in a temporary way. </PARA>
<PARA> I must say that I look forward to a situation where, early in the new year, a new Government will take office and this mess will be fixed up properly. Dr Hewson in the House of Representatives on 22 November introduced that amendment requesting the level be increased substantially-it was defeated by the Government, of course-but then, later on that day, the Government substantially increased the cut-off level. Apart from the hypocrisy of that, I would have to say that we, as an Opposition, have given this clear statement through Dr Hewson, the shadow Treasurer, who will be the next Treasurer early in the new year whenever the Government calls the election. Dr Hewson has said:</PARA>
<PARA> We do not like this legislation . . . we undertake . . . to review . . . this legislation in government. </PARA>
<PARA>He went on to say that we would meet the cost of our decision to increase these thresholds this year by reversing the Kodak (Australasia) Pty Ltd decision and by terminating the payment of compensation to the airline industry-in other words, paid for out of the special handouts this Government has been spraying around in an attempt to placate special interests that have been disadvantaged by a whole range of activities, including some of the Government's. The following second reading amendment moved by Dr Hewson was defeated in the House of Representatives:</PARA>
<PARA> That all words after ``That'' be omitted with a view to substituting the following words:</PARA>
<PARA>``whilst not declining to give the Bill a second reading, the House:</PARA>
<PARA>(1) recognising the plight of small businesses in Australia, calls on the Government to increase substantially the threshold at which the new two instalment company tax arrangements will apply;</PARA>
<PARA>(2) rejects the Government's proposals on self-assessment of company tax because of the inadequate safeguards and protection of the integrity of taxpayers; and</PARA>
<PARA>(3) condemns the Government for its flagrant disregard in its taxation policies of the circumstances faced by many small businesses in Australia''. </PARA>
<PARA>Senator Haines indicated that she wishes that we were proceeding with that amendment. As I understand it, she would have supported at least the first part. That has been withdrawn for the very simple reason that the Government has substantially increased the threshold, as I understand it, beyond the one that we suggested. We were moving to amend the Bill to remove the impact of this tax on the small business sector, particularly on companies with taxable incomes of up to $200,000. The Government has now gone beyond that but in a specific and limited way. It is only a transitional proposal. </PARA>
<PARA> Quite frankly, there is no need for us to move our original amendment now because the simple fact is that that transitional arrangement will survive for the current tax year. By the time the next tax year comes around, from 1 July, there will be a coalition government. We have said that we do not like this legislation and we have given a clear undertaking to review it in government. As I said, there is no need to proceed with the amendment moved in the House of Representatives, because we will fix the matter up. There is no point in having this amendment beaten once again in the House of Representatives. The Government has already expressed its lack of understanding by rejecting that very sensible amendment that we moved in the House of Representatives only last month. </PARA>
<PARA> I am really concerned about the way the Government has handled this legislation. Apart from the fact that in three months it has had three totally different views about the appropriate way to adjust both the timing of the payments and the threshold, all of us have every reason to be totally cynical about these changes since the Budget announcement. The increase in the threshold is only for the transitional year. Clearly it is being done because there will be an election early next year. There appears to be no other reason. The Government has not said, `Yes, it is a serious and permanent problem that the Opposition has raised'. Not on your life! It has said, `Yes, there is a problem in the transition period'. The transition period magically happens to be the period in which there will be a Federal election. </PARA>
<PARA> Is there any reason why the Opposition or the people of Australia should be anything other than cynical about this decision temporarily to recognise the problem? As I understand it, the Government intends to restore the $20,000 threshold-the disaster threshold-in a year's time if it is still in power. Of course, it will be saved that problem because it will not be. But the straight cynicism involved in appearing to protect the interests of small business whilst cynically doing so for a period that just happens to cover an election is a bit rich, even by this Government's standards. </PARA>
<PARA> The costing of this interests me. Some rough figures have been prepared showing that the Government's proposals will cost about $120m this year and close to $200m next year. We have not heard from the Government about that. It would be nice if the Government would let us know whether those figures are reasonable. If so, it means a reduction in the forecast surplus for the current year and this will be totally unfunded. There has been no statement about where it will come from. That is in stark contrast to the coalition's economic statement, which funded everything. There was no way this Government could establish any flaws of any substance whatsoever in the Opposition's Economic Action Plan, which involved significant tax benefits to the family and a basic and major change in the approach that governments are allowed to have to taxation by assuring and guaranteeing the people of Australia that no longer will they be subject to the bracket creep that the Treasurer (Mr Keating) has imposed on Australians, pushing them all into higher tax brackets every time there is any inflation-and our inflation rate is roughly double that of our trading partners. That bracket creep has resulted in about $13 1/2 billion in extra tax for this Treasurer since he came into office. As I said, the Opposition has costed and funded its proposals. This Government, with its massive double standards, feels under no obligation to do the same when it fiddles its tax bill for cynical party political reasons. </PARA>
<PARA> I will finish up simply by commending the only good part of this legislation, and that is the part that involves the present Government absorbing into the legislation the private member's Bill that passed through this chamber, generated by Senator John Watson, a Liberal senator-and a very good one-from Tasmania who actually understands the tax situation. He certainly understands the tax law far better than this Government seems to. It is a great credit to him that his proposal has been taken up. Senator Watson's proposal was to allow the deductability of fees in relation to tax advice. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill will allow deductions for expenditure incurred by taxpayers in connection with the management or administration of their income tax affairs. Examples of expenditure that will be allowable as a deduction include fees paid by a taxpayer to a registered tax agent, solicitor or barrister for professional advice in relation to the income tax affairs of the taxpayer; costs associated with disputing an assessment or determination made by the Commissioner of Taxation; expenditure incurred in attending to an Australian Taxation Office audit; and costs associated with tax planning. That is all very sensible. It follows Senator Watson's private member's Bill, which was introduced in the Senate in May and passed unanimously. This is unusual. I commend the Labor Treasurer (Mr Keating) for incorporating into a Government Bill the thrust of a private member's Bill introduced by a Liberal Party senator. </PARA>
<PARA> It is interesting to note that while this is being done there is the extraordinary situation where companies which are being forced to borrow huge amounts of money to pay their taxes early, in many instances before they really know what their profit is, cannot claim the income on that borrowing as a tax deduction. I stress that many will not know what their profit is. Surely the Government realises that the role of an auditor in preparing a company's account is to resolve what can often be fairly heated disagreements between management and the auditor on what the profit really is. Practising accountants on our side of the chamber know this; they have been involved in it. </PARA>
<PARA> It is ludicrous to suggest that within 28 days of the end of the financial year there would be any prospect of most major companies or, in fact, many small businesses, knowing what their profit is. From 30 June the local suburban accountant will be inundated by small businessmen who have to know, within that very short period, what their profit is. There will be chaos for the accounting profession. For many companies it will be into August before there is an agreed profit for taxation purposes. There is a curious mixture. Some companies are desperately keen to make their profit look bigger, for a whole range of reasons, and many others are determined to try to make it look smaller for taxation purposes. The proper role of the auditor is to establish that the correct view is taken. Companies will not know what their profit is until, say, August and they will have to pay 85 per cent of their tax by 28 July. That extraordinary situation is another example of how the Government simply does not know how the private sector operates. As a result, it introduces silly legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> I will not proceed further on that point. In the last few weeks of sitting we have been inundated with legislation. This legislation was rushed through the House of Representatives under a guillotine, despite the fact that it has major significance and implications for the private sector. It was part of a mountain of legislation that was rushed through the House of Representatives. There was limited discussion and a limited capacity to examine properly what it is all about and now we are under some sort of moral pressure, if you like, not to keep everyone back over Christmas. As it is, we are sitting until 22 December. We are dealing with legislation which is simply ill-prepared, ill-considered and has a negative and damaging effect on the private sector. It is to the Government's discredit that it has proceeded this way both in terms of the presentation of this legislation, and the repeated changes to it, and the manner in which it has whacked such legislation through. </PARA>
<PARA> Maybe the reason the Government has made this transitionary arrangement to try to help small business is not the crude political one that I am afraid springs to mind. Maybe the Government's thinking is that only transitional measures are needed because business is going through a situation of temporary disaster. There is no doubt that there is a disaster at the moment. Small business in particular is feeling the pinch of high interest rates of 21 and 25 per cent. Corporate cash flows are being squeezed. The pilots dispute is crippling many in the tourist industries. The prospect of a significant slump in demand early in the new year grows as the Government keeps claiming success in being able to dampen down-that is, pour cold water on-business activity. Sure, business is going through a special crisis. However, the problem is that if the Government is re-elected it will be a permanent crisis. I am overjoyed to see that public opinion polls keep pointing to the fact that it will not be re-elected. </PARA>
<PARA> Nonetheless, it is absolutely vital that this continual attack by an incompetent government on the private sector, particularly the small business sector, stops. One of the reasons a coalition government is needed in Australia is to make certain that it does stop. I hope that all small business people and those who are employed by small business-that represents the great bulk of the Australian work force-recognise what the Government is doing to them, their job prospects and their prospects of economic survival. That is why, in what may well be the last session before an election perhaps as early as February, it is vital for us to have an opportunity to reveal and point out to the Australian people, in discussing this kind of messy, silly and anti-business legislation, just what the Government is doing to them. It is vital that we have an opportunity to debate fully the Government's hostile, negative and money-grubbing approach to small business. The Government wants to take all the money it can get no matter what the consequences. Provided we have an opportunity to keep pointing this out to the Australian people, I believe that when the next election comes they will throw the Government out of office. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I join with my colleagues on this side of the House in condemning the legislation before us. I will not delay the Senate, and I will focus on three main areas: firstly, the issue that most exercised Senator Baume's mind-that is, the new proposal for the collection of 85 per cent of notional income tax for corporations within 28 days of the end of the financial year; secondly, the question of self-assessment-the new system that is being proposed for corporations; and, thirdly, the question of the deductability of interest and finance-related expenses in respect of income tax that will be required to be paid under the legislation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In the 14 years that I have been a member of the Senate I have never seen such a vociferous reaction from the small and medium business community on any issue that I have seen in connection with the new corporate tax collection proposals. That led me to take an interest in the matter so I could ensure that people had their views properly expressed in the Parliament through a petition. I have presented to the Parliament a petition with several thousand signatures which indicates the depth of feeling in the business community, at least in South Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> The absolute despair into which the Government has thrown the business community by introducing this measure cannot be properly understood, especially by the Government since it fails to comprehend what kind of psychology exercises the minds of those engaged in private enterprise. It is that kind of lack of appreciation of the real concerns of business that has led the Government to make this disastrous decision to try to implement the proposal in this financial year. </PARA>
<PARA> What is the genesis of the proposal? I can only assume that somewhere in some room late at night the Treasurer (Mr Keating) had a bright light go on in his mind which led him to say that he would have to have a surplus in the current Budget of the order of $10 billion. Having cast about for a way to do this, he found that the good old stand-bys that he has relied upon-for instance, the new tax on superannuation and, more particularly, the profits that the Reserve Bank of Australia has been able to make over the last several years which have helped to reduce the Government's deficit-had run out. The Budget figures show that the Reserve Bank's profits have declined from more than $2 billion to under $1 billion. That hole had to be filled up somehow. So he came up with this brilliant idea of taxing the hell out of businesses and virtually sending them to the wall. </PARA>
<PARA> The 85 per cent tax proposal will go down in history as one of the most ill-thought out proposals that has come before us, at least in the period of this Government. There is no doubt that that is a very significant statement to make in the light of some of the other absolute cock-ups in legislation we have seen since it has been in power. The capital gains tax and the fringe benefits tax are two examples in recent history. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As Senator Baume points out, massively altered. We have had numerous attempts by this Government to pass amending legislation to correct the messes it has made over that period. But this must be the daddy of them all. We are now expected to pass today a piece of legislation about which the Government announced, before it had actually been passed in the House of Representatives, significant changes-not in a definite way but, rather, in a hurried, ill-considered fashion-which hint at reviews of certain vital parts of the legislation rather than spell out quite clearly what those changes will be. For instance, in the case of deductability of interest on loans used to pay company tax, Mr Dawkins in his press release on 22 November said that this issue was being reviewed. Yet we are expected to pass a Bill today which includes a provision to set up the provisos by which those kinds of deductions can be made, passing into law something which the Government itself does not believe in.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That is not the only example. We also have the self-assessment provisions. Again, there is a great deal of conflict between professionals and the Government about the form of the new proposals the Government has brought forward. I will come to some of the details of that a little later. The Government has now admitted, in Mr Dawkins's press release on 22 November, that that is going to be reconsidered as well. Yet again, in the Bill we are expected to pass we have a law set down which, on advice from the Government, in all probability will be changed. I do not believe that it is the proper role of Parliament to pass laws which the Government says it is going to change. It is asking the Parliament to roll over and have its tummy tickled in order to get on the books legislation which it has already admitted is faulty. As we have already mentioned, we have had examples in the past of legislation being in error or wrong or incorrect or-what is that phrase the Government uses?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Exactly. I do not believe that this is good enough. I do not believe that this Bill should be passed by the Parliament in this faulty fashion, especially since the Government has indicated that it will be changing that legislation before too long. When such things are put forward, it undermines the credibility of the Parliament. Obviously, it is done with an intent that has nothing to do with proper law or proper government. It is to do with political expediency.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Government is desperate to maintain some credibility for the Budget it brought down in August so that it can go to an election, probably as early as February, and claim that it is the greatest manager of economic affairs since Federation, or something to that effect. We have become used to listening to the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) saying that kind of thing often. Here we have political expediency overriding the proper role of the Parliament. That is a major issue in the way this legislation has been treated. We on this side ought not to agree to the passage of legislation in this situation; I believe that that feeling is shared by a great number of my colleagues on this side of the chamber. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us look at the new 85 per cent collection system. As Senator Michael Baume and Senator Short pointed out, the transition arrangements, which have now been modified by the statement by Mr Dawkins on 22 November, are in respect of the transition year only. They are not permanent changes to the law. They will have effect only during the next year so as to relieve the most onerous burdens on small and medium sized businesses in the period immediately ahead of us. They do not change the principle the Government has introduced, which itself is most onerous and dangerous to the health of small and medium sized businesses in this country. Again the Government has just bought time, for politically expedient reasons, to see itself through the next election. What other draconian things the Government has in mind for 1990-91, if it is by any mischance elected, remain to be seen. Of course, we are confident that that will not occur since we will be in power and able to modify substantially this cruel legislation that is before us. </PARA>
<PARA> When the legislation is finally in force, it will drag out nearly $1 billion of extra tax from small businesses. I know that in some sections of the Labor Party and in the bureaucracy people seem to think that all businessmen are in business simply to rape the public and to pinch money from the underprivileged in the community. The truth is that in this country we have 750,000 small businesses employing around half of the total work force in this country. The work force numbers something of the order of eight million; therefore we can say without any fear of contradiction that small firms employ roughly four million Australians. That is a most significant proportion of our total work force. The profits which small businesses make, pitifully small as many of them are, go to keeping these people employed, keeping Australians working, keeping the money turning over in our shops, and ensuring that more jobs are created. Yet this attack on small business, through the introduction of this new company tax collection system, is designed with no other purpose but, seemingly, to destroy that. </PARA>
<PARA> In the Government's Budget we can see that it has estimated that the Federal Government is going to save, by the introduction of this method of collection, $300m or thereabouts in interest. That is fine for the Federal Government, but it means that it is merely transferring the cost of interest from the government to the business sector. That means that the business sector will have to meet an extra $300m on top of the $900m of income tax that it will have to pay by virtue of this measure. That interest cost is a very sizeable hit in anybody's language when one is talking about an uncontrollable expense in a situation where interest rates, as they have been forced up by this Government, are so high. I think that it is an horrific situation when the Government is of a mind simply to transfer its own costs to the people. Of course, that will be reflected in prices, lower profits and fewer jobs for Australians. Surely, that is a very stupid way of going about business. We ought to be providing more and more incentives for small business to employ more people, not fewer. Yet, that is what this Government is on about with this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> As Senator Michael Baume said clearly in his remarks, this simply stems from a total misunderstanding or lack of appreciation of the need to foster business in this community so as to ensure that we stimulate more jobs, provide more welfare for people and ensure that the Australian economic growth level is maintained and improved. </PARA>
<PARA> I would now like to turn to the new self-assessment system that will apply to corporations. We know that in 1986 the Government introduced a self-assessment system for individuals. That affected some businesses but not corporations. We now see a system being introduced for corporations. The thing that is of concern to me in this particular proposal-even the Acting Treasurer Mr Dawkins, saw problems with it as he signified in a press release issued in November that it will be reviewed-is the new arrangement whereby the Commissioner of Taxation can review the taxation affairs of taxpayers and can go back four years even where there has been a full, fair and true disclosure of facts by the taxpayer in the submission of his or her tax return. </PARA>
<PARA> This is a natural consequence of the type of system which the Government is intending to introduce. I believe that this is going too far. It will leave people in limbo, with no end to the possible inquiry by the Taxation Commissioner, and no clear definition of what tax will be payable in each year. In the period of four years immediately following the lodgment of a tax return, taxpayers will still be wondering whether they have incurred all of the liability that they expected to incur. In the event of the Taxation Commissioner within that four-year period reviewing the taxpayer's return by way of an audit and subsequently determining that, even though there has been full disclosure by the taxpayer, an item of expenditure may have been claimed wrongly, but in good faith, that taxpayer will find that extra tax will be charged. Taxpayers will incur not only tax but very high penalties-perhaps at the level of interest rates which we suffer today. Those penalties will be incurred as a direct consequence of this new self-assessment system without people actually knowing that that has happened. </PARA>
<PARA> This is not a good principle to introduce into tax legislation. Surely one of the most important principles that should guide all legislators is that any law, be it in tax or any other area, should be certain as to its effects and consequences. This will open up enormous uncertainties for small and medium sized businesses which will find themselves in a situation that they may not have envisaged as a result of the introduction of this system. To put a slightly finer point on the matter, today taxation laws, as we all know, have become extraordinarily complex. Inevitably, in the affairs of individual corporations which lodge taxation returns, there will be some doubt as to the legality of every single claim for expenditure within the law. That is because the law itself is not entirely clear in many areas. There will always be room for debate and that debate will not finally be settled until all of the litigious consequences are worked through. </PARA>
<PARA> People can, in all good faith, make full, fair and true disclosure of all the facts surrounding an issue and still not be sure that they will not suffer some challenge from the Taxation Commissioner at a later time and therefore cannot rely on the last word having been said on their affairs for any particular year. That lack of certainty, which depends entirely upon the Taxation Commissioner's discretion to exercise his right of inquiry within that four-year period, ought to be thrown out. I believe that the Opposition is correct in opposing this part of the legislation. It is wrong to hand such enormous powers over to the Taxation Commissioner in these circumstances. As I pointed out earlier, this has been acknowledged by the Acting Treasurer in his press statement. He said that a review of this matter would be conducted. Yet, we are expected to pass into law a Bill which incorporates this very faulty piece of legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> The third matter I want to mention relates to clause 8 of the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 5) which will not allow the deduction of certain financially related expenses in relation to the payment of income tax. This has been raised by journalists and others in recent times. It is a matter which is of a great deal of concern especially in the light of a story that appeared this morning in the Australian Financial Review in which Mr Boucher, the Commissioner of Taxation, made the point that he sees no reason why interest incurred on borrowings in order to pay income tax should not be deductable under section 51 of the Income Tax Assessment Act. I hope that is what he is saying in this rather confused article in the Australian Financial Review. To be honest, from this article it is so unclear as to what is actually intended that it behoves the Minister for Finance (Senator Walsh) to answer this point and make sure that honourable senators fully understand what the Government is intending. </PARA>
<PARA> If one looks at the wording of clause 8 of this Bill, one sees that there can be absolutely no doubt that we are writing into law a prohibition on the deduction for income tax purposes of financing costs, such as interest on moneys borrowed in order to pay income tax. That applies, as I read this Bill, specifically in relation to the collection of income tax under the new corporate tax proposals and generally in relation to past payments of tax. </PARA>
<PARA> I am concerned about this because, as we have already discussed, one part of this Bill is about changing the self-assessment system and about removing the protection for taxpayers where there has been full and true disclosure of all the facts. If we tie these two things together, we have the situation in which interest paid in respect of borrowings to pay income tax could be deemed not to have been deductable for years immemorial-back to the commencement of the life of the corporation. By the removal of the full and true disclosure provisions, the Taxation Commissioner may well be able to go right back and throw out all income tax deductions for interest paid in respect of borrowings to pay income tax. That is a horrifying proposition. The Minister must explain this to the Senate so that we properly understand what the Government intends. Mr Boucher's effort in this morning's Australian Financial Review has served only to cloud the issue even further for some of the people who might have thought they understood it earlier. This is an important issue and it must be cleared up before the debate on this Bill is concluded. </PARA>
<PARA> A further point to which I draw attention is that both the issues of the self-assessment procedures and that of the deductions of the financing costs on borrowings to pay income tax have been specifically made subject to further Government review by the Treasurer in his statement of 22 November. Why then are we passing these matters into law? Why are we being requested and forced by the Government to pass into law a Bill that the Government knows that it will have to change in the not too distant future? It is wrong parliamentary practice. </PARA>

<PARA> I conclude by repeating that the Government is merely trying to fill up the potholes caused by a changing revenue situation to meet a political objective of ensuring that it has a $10 billion surplus for the purpose of going to an election in the not too distant future. That is what all this is about. The ruination that could occur to Australian business by the passage of this legislation is just too monumental to contemplate. As I mentioned earlier, in my parliamentary experience I have never seen a reaction from the small business community such as I have seen on this issue. If the Government and its Ministers could understand the depths of despair that have been inflicted on the small business community, they might understand why we cannot get the improved productivity that is needed in this country. That is the key issue. This destruction of the psychological state of mind of small businessmen, the reduction in their feelings of positive achievement and the dismay that the Government has spread amongst them, will not enhance the capacity of this country to pull itself out of the mess that this Government has got it into with huge foreign debt, lack of productivity and rising taxation levels. With that lack of incentive, one would expect any government with half a brain to be able to work out that it is going in entirely the wrong direction from what is needed to improve the stature of this country. Yet this Government sees fit not to cut expenditure or to take the knife to some of its own friends, but rather, to impose higher and higher taxation on its most productive sector and biggest employer group in this country. That is wrong and the Government should be condemned. </PARA>

A point on which I want to put the record straight concerns the phasing in arrangements for the payment of company taxation for companies with a taxable income of less than $400,000, or with a tax bill of $400,000; I am not quite sure to which Senator Stone referred. The cost to revenue of the changes is estimated at $25m in this financial year. That figuring is reflected in the financial aspect part of the revised explanatory memorandum. I am not in a position to put a figure on this, but on the outlays side of the Budget there would be a consequential increase in public debt interest, and I expect that that would amount to only a couple of million dollars. Otherwise, the Government will not accept the two second reading amendments moved by the Opposition.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to refer to clause 24 of the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 4), which I have already referred to in my speech during the second reading debate on the cognate legislation. This clause gives effect to a decision by the Government to rectify to some limited degree the treatment of capital gains-in other words, premiums-obtained by a lessor when he or she provides a lease and receives a financial premium for doing so. I will not go over again what I said on the matter in my speech during the second reading debate because we have no quarrel with what the Government proposes in relation to a principal lessor in that regard. What the Government is doing is arguable, perhaps, but we do not propose to argue it because that is not the gravamen of our concern.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Our concern relates to the situation of a person who has already undertaken a lease and is, therefore, a lessee but who then wants to sublet the property in question for a period-for any period, let alone the period of 50 years or more which is mentioned in the clause. As we read the Bill, what the Government proposes is that the lessee who is undertaking the sublease to a third party will still be liable for full capital gains tax on any premium obtained by him or her in respect of that sublease but will not be able to offset against that premium the costs to him or her originally of acquiring the original lease. That seems to us to be quite inequitable. </PARA>
<PARA> We can certainly accept the Government's view that, where one is talking about a principal party undertaking a lease of his or her property, capital gains tax should be payable-assuming one believes in the tax at all, which we do not, of course, but I will leave that aside-on the premium less any costs which are incurred in the entering into of the transaction. In that case the ownership of the underlying property remains in the hands of the principal and, therefore, it would not be appropriate, so to speak, to offset against the premium the cost of the property because, as I say, the ownership of the property remains his or hers. </PARA>
<PARA> But it seems to us that there is a different situation in the case of a person who has already acquired a lease and who then wants to sublet. That person has paid a premium for the rights granted to him or her under the lease and yet that cost will not, as we read the clause, be taken into account by the Government when taxing the premium received as a result of the sublease. I would like the Minister for Finance (Senator Walsh) to respond to our concerns on this matter. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have an answer which I believe and hope is satisfactory. I think I understand it, but just to make sure I will read what the officials have written for me. It concerns long term leases, broadly, of at least 50 years. Clause 24 introduces a tax concession for persons who grant long term leases or subleases. It covers that as well, I am advised. It will operate to treat the grant of a long term lease or sublease to include the disposal of the underlying asset. That is usually land or buildings. This effectively means that, if the long term lease relates to land or buildings acquired before the introduction of the capital gains tax in September 1985, there is no capital gains tax liability on the grant of a long term lease. The asset is reacquired for nil cost.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> But, if a taxpayer elects under this provision, that is, clause 24, to get this tax concession, the subsequent cost base of the asset-that is, the lease, sublease and the underlying asset-for obvious reasons will be nil. Accordingly, there is no indexation available in these circumstances. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am grateful to the Minister for Finance (Senator Walsh) for reading into the Hansard record the note that he has been provided with by the officials. I do not say the following by way of being critical of the Minister, because I know how difficult it is to pick up these highly technical aspects of the taxation law, particularly on the run, although the Minister and the officials have had before them for some time now copies of the Opposition's second reading amendment to the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 4) on which we have just voted, the second paragraph of which refers specifically to this matter. Indeed, in my remarks yesterday during the second reading debate on the Bill I also referred to the matter, as I said a moment ago, at some length. So I would have hoped that the Minister's officials might have taken the opportunity to brief him on the point more adequately than I would have to say, without wanting to be contentious, they appear to have done.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I say, without wanting to be offensive, that the Minister does not seem to be in control, in command, of the point at issue. In fact, he admitted as much, and I give him full marks for his frankness, by saying that he was going to read the officials' note to us because he did not fully understand it himself. But I would give him even more marks if he would actually master the topic and let us have a more considered and, if I may say so, less jargon-ridden response than the kind of piece of paper one gets from the Australian Taxation Office. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We are not moving a specific amendment to this clause. One reason we are not doing so is the highly technical complexity of the law in this area and our own lack of total certainty as to what exactly the Government is doing or is not doing. This is the state to which the people in this country are reduced now, given the complexity of the tax law. People do not really know what the law provides or even intends to provide. One reason we are not moving a specific amendment to this clause is that we had hoped to have from the Government some understandable, as distinct from merely jargon-ridden, explanation of what this clause purports to do and why our concern about its operation in respect of subleases is not justified.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I have heard nothing from the Minister to explain why our concern is not justified. He simply says that this clause gives effect to what the Government promised to do. I have no doubt that that is true. I do not question that. What we are saying is that the Government has not done or has not promised to do something which it ought to do. We would like to hear why not. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In responding to the second reading debate on the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 5) 1989, the Minister for Finance (Senator Walsh) failed to cover the concerns raised not only by the Opposition but by the accounting and taxation professional associations about the need for adequate consultation. The consultation that was necessary between the Taxation Commissioner and professionals should have preceded the introduction of what the Committee has before it today in this notion of full assessment for corporate entities. Under this legislation corporations now have obligations but no rights. The concepts of Commissioner discretion and self-assessment do not fit together easily since both are completely incompatible. This notion of self-assessment that we are expected to pass today demands not only full disclosure but also certainty. So we have two problems. We have a problem of a lack of adequate consultation and the establishment of mechanisms to ensure taxpayers rights, and we have the whole concept running right through the legislation of Commissioner discretions.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Two things should have preceded this legislation: firstly, the removal of those discretionary provisions to ensure absolute, 100 per cent, certainty, which is essential under self-assessment; secondly, an adequate and complete meeting of the minds between the professionals and the Commissioner of Taxation. I now seek the Minister's response, given that for corporations the Government is now proceeding down the same path of no consultation as it did in 1985-86. In those earlier years there was no consultation between the practitioners when they introduced partial self-assessment for individuals. I ask: can the Minister now give us some assurance as to what will be forthcoming from this Government and the Commissioner in relation to both of these issues?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In regard to the question of consultation, and I acknowledge the point that the Opposition has made, we believe that the Government and the Australian Taxation Office have dealt with it. The Commissioner of Taxation has established a working party with the profession to evaluate the operation of the present self-assessment system and will be considering its recommendations in the near future. There have been consultative processes already in respect of the company tax changes announced in the Budget and which are dealt with in this Bill. Some of the concessions, such as the reduction in the period for making debit amendments and keeping records, have come out of that consultation. The Government has foreshadowed that other associated reviews will be undertaken by the Commissioner. This will result in income tax rulings on which the profession will be consulted before their implementation.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Has the attention of the Minister for Resources been drawn to statements by Mr Neil Pickard, the New South Wales Minister for Energy, and Mr Bob Katter Jr, who was the Queensland Minister for Mines and Energy, suggesting that ethanol fuel is a practical answer to the problem of dwindling supplies of crude oil? Does the Minister have any information leading him to support the development of an ethanol industry in Australia and the use of ethanol as a blend with petrol? Is Mr Pickard correct that a number of countries are turning to ethanol and that it could be a cost-effective source of energy?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="3986" SPEAKER="Cook Sen The Hon P.F.S." NAMEID="RF4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="WA" MINISTERIAL="RESOURCES" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RF4">Senator COOK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;No, Mr Pickard is not correct that a number of countries are turning to ethanol. He is about as correct on that as he was about the promise he made to some south coast coalminers early in the year. Later he had to say that he misled them. Indeed, his announcement recently that he is setting up an ethanol investigation task force contains echoes of what Bob Katter Jr, the then Minister for Mines and Energy in Queensland, announced just a couple of months ago before the Queensland election, about ethanol in that State. Bob Katter Jr has a particular and unique distinction as a National Party Minister in Queensland. He was the only National Party Minister for Mines and Energy in the whole history of that State since Federation to have been the subject of a vote of no confidence by the mining industry in Queensland. However, the facts about ethanol are that--</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator Macklin interjecting-</PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RF4">Senator COOK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Not in the way in which it passed that vote of no confidence. What was said about the ethanol program in Queensland needs to be corrected. One comment is attributed to Transfield, the consortium that was formed under the guidance of Mr Katter to do what he said should be done; that is, to start an ethanol program in Queensland which would involve selling ethanol to refineries within 18 months, leading in a very short time a 10 per cent ethanol blend in petrol distilled in Queensland. It was said in support of that argument that the United States of America had 8 per cent of its fuel ethanol enhanced. In fact, 8 per cent of its fuel is a blend of which only 10 per cent was ethanol. So it is not true that 8 per cent of United States fuel was ethanol; only 0.8 per cent of the total fuel was ethanol.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It was also said that there would be no increase in petrol prices at the bowser. That could occur only if there were massive subsidies for ethanol as opposed to petroleum so as to cushion the consumer from the actual cost. It is true that ethanol would be competitive with oil if oil were selling at $US40 a barrel. Oil is trading at between $US15 and $US20 a barrel, and the medium term prognostication is that it will remain so. To envisage a price going to $US40 suggests that the price of oil at the bowser would be massively increased.</PARA>
<PARA> It is also important to observe that Mr Ahern, when Premier of Queensland for a short period, rejected this harebrained scheme as well. The Australian Minerals and Energy Council made a study in 1987 on alternative fuels and indicated that production costs for ethanol were then about 60c a litre compared with production costs shorn of taxation, which some members of the Opposition have interjected about, of 20c per litre.</PARA>
<PARA> The country that has done most about ethanol is Brazil. It is the world's largest user. Ethanol is regarded as uneconomic in Brazil by the World Bank. A recent study by the World Bank showed that the ethanol program in Brazil generated a $US2.7 billion deficit annually. In Sao Paulo agricultural land has been turned over to sugar plantations to cash in on ethanol when the nation could have earned billions of dollars by cropping that land alternatively.</PARA>
<PARA> In short, the studies of ethanol are not conducive to the conclusions being promoted by Mr Pickard or Mr Katter. This Government would rather look to liquefied petroleum gas and liquefied natural gas as transport fuels in the future and possible coal liquefaction. The only way in which ethanol could be made competitive is if there were a compulsory or regulatory requirement that it be included. We would prefer to see something based on commercial viability rather than compulsion and regulation in the sense being promoted by both these two governments.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I was rather surprised to read the remarks in the press attributed to the Director of Public Prosecutions, Mr Weinberg, concerning the possible prosecution of war criminals under legislation passed by this Parliament late last year. He talked about the difficulty of conducting the prosecutions. The terminology used in the Melbourne Sun spoke of a series of legal snags. This chamber, in particular, was aware of the difficulties that would be posed by the passage of time even though it was determined as a matter of policy that the legislation be passed to enable prosecution of those alleged to have committed those crimes. Indeed, this Parliament made special provision, as I recall, in section 13 of the Act to make it absolutely clear that the normal rules of evidence and procedure should apply to proceedings for offences against the particular Act. The powers of the court to prevent abuse of the process were also spoken about in our own legislation, particularly where a person was unable to obtain evidence that he or she would, but for the lapse of time or some other reason beyond his or her control, be able to obtain information that was necessary to conduct a defence.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I believe that this Parliament anticipated well some of the legal snags and problems derived from the passage of time to which the Director of Public Prosecutions referred. I sought some advice yesterday, in the light of this particular article, as to the current state of play between the Special Investigations Unit and the DPP, and I was informed by Mr Greenwood that there were some four matters which had reached a very advanced stage but that no matters had been passed to the DPP for the exercise of that officer's discretions as to whether a prosecution should be launched. As I said, some four cases have been subjected to very detailed investigation and are at an advanced stage. They have been elevated by Mr Greenwood to that particular category, if you like, but so far they have not been handed over to the DPP.</PARA>
<PARA> Of course, I have no knowledge of the nature of the 50 cases or of the four cases. I am therefore unable to answer the last part of Senator Durack's question, except that I would expect that the Director of Public Prosecutions would exercise his various discretions in accordance with the prosecution policy of the Commonwealth, which has been promulgated as a public document, which governs the exercise of his discretions and which has, I think, been tabled in this Parliament.</PARA>

Can the Minister confirm whether this theory is correct and, if so, is there any danger of Australia relinquishing control and ownership of its beef industry to foreign investors?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In his question Senator Colston has called this a theory. I acknowledge that it has been represented as a theory, but I would have thought that the correct definition of the word `theory' is something for which there is empirical evidence sufficient to cause a process called a theory to be developed, which can then be tested to see whether a principle in fact exists. I think to dignify this allegation as a theory is to take a shock-horror conspiracy idea and promote it as if there were some empirical evidence to justify it. I cannot find any empirical evidence at all to justify the development of a theory based on what is occurring in the fisheries industry or in terms of foreign investment in Australia in relation to the beef industry or abattoirs.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> An objective examination shows that it is true that some fisheries are being depleted at a rate that is not ideal. But objective evidence shows that the Australian Government has been very active in making sure that in this industry-in fisheries, above all others, or equal to others-the principle of sustainable development has been observed.</PARA>
<PARA> In the Prime Minister's environmental statement we made a major contribution to conserving southern bluefin tuna stocks and have a program so to do costing $1.45m over two years. As well, we have made considerable progress in areas such as opposition to long-line fishing, and gill net fishing. We work with the States through the Australian Fisheries Council to see that seasons are opened and closed commensurate with the sustainability of the fish resource. Australia has been active offshore with adjoining nations, notably Indonesia, in working out fishing agreements which guarantee sustainable development. I do not think the first principle of this alleged theory can be justified.</PARA>
<PARA> In regard to the second principle, we are, of course, subject to Foreign Investment Review Board guidelines and we maintain an open stance in terms of foreign investment in industry in Australia. Some foreign investment has occurred in the abattoir industry and in pastoral enterprises, but it is all consistent with the foreign investment guidelines. To cobble that together to pretend that some sort of theory can be justified is to stretch the meaning of that word in real English.</PARA>

The CSIRO Division of Wildlife and Ecology confirms that two specimens of the regent honeyeater were collected under permit at Gooroo Hill, in the Australian Capital Territory, out of the breeding season in February this year.The specimens were collected as part of a program to determine the evolutionary radiation and distinctiveness of the Australian bird fauna. The collection of the birds is part of CSIRO's research directed towards the conservation of endangered species.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The CSIRO Division of Wildlife and Ecology is well aware that the regent honeyeater is of some concern to conservationists as a declining species and that is why the sample was limited to two and it is envisaged that no more specimens will be taken. Further systematic studies of the regent honeyeater have been held up by the lack of material available for molecular analysis. Mr President, as this answer is somewhat long I seek leave to incorporate the remainder of it in Hansard. In terms of Senator Dunn's question I must say that, since I got notice of it, I have been worried about whether these two honeyeaters, which have been retained by the CSIRO, are alive or dead.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Federal Government has been well aware of these concerns for a number of years because in 1986 we initiated a national review of local government labour markets. This review has just been completed and we are optimistic that, because of a range of information that has been collected over the last three years and because of the commitment that has been given through the Federal-State Local Government Ministers Conference, action will start to be taken by State, Federal and local governments and particularly by local government industry training groups.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As I have said, the review has been completed and, as part of the review, a nationwide survey of occupational shortages and training in local government was undertaken. The survey sampled 200 councils throughout Australia which represented 20 per cent of Australian councils. In brief, the survey found that 54.7 per cent of the councils surveyed have difficulty recruiting labour, particularly health surveyors, accountants, civil engineers, building surveyors and building inspectors, and only 43.5 per cent of councils provide on-the-job formal training. There have been particular difficulties in training women and outdoor staff.</PARA>
<PARA> The review is concerned that some of the shortages could be attributed to outmoded recruitment and personnel practices. In 16 papers that have been issued a number of suggestions have been made to the local government industry. In May 1989, Commonwealth and State Ministers endorsed a number of principles recommended by the review. These include the need for councils to implement equal employment opportunity and to develop structures to encourage appropriate education, training and development opportunities for staff within local government. A number of my State colleagues are seriously addressing these issues. We will continue to monitor the situation closely and work with local government to overcome these concerns about shortages.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Australian Government assistance to Air Vanuatu has been a most effective use of the Australian aid program. It is worth recalling that Vanuatu's economy is very small and very fragile. Commodity export earnings traditionally came from only one source, copra, and the economy in the country as a whole was highly vulnerable as a result. For some time Australia has been helping Vanuatu in its own efforts to develop tourism as a major industry base. We are significantly lengthening the Bauerfield Airport at Vila and, as Senator Schacht has just indicated, we have supported Vanuatu's efforts to purchase and operate its own aircraft. That ownership has now let Vanuatu optimise airline schedules to and from the country to its own advantage.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Ownership of the aircraft, supported by a major tourism program, has led to impressive results. In the third quarter of this year Air Vanuatu's average load factor was a healthy 88 per cent and total tourism numbers were up by 50 per cent on the previous quarter. The occupancy rates for the two largest hotels in Vanuatu rose from around 35 per cent in 1988 to 70 and 50 per cent respectively. This has led to increases numbered in the hundreds in employment in hotel staff, tour operators and restaurants. The increase in tourism has, moreover, provided a significant contribution to Vanuatu Government revenue through turnover tax on hotels and restaurants. The Vanuatu Government has clearly expressed its appreciation to Australia for our assistance in improving Vanuatu's self-reliance and its export earning capacity in this respect. Although a number of factors no doubt contributed to the success of tourism in Vanuatu in recent months, the point is that the country has now been geared up and is capable of taking advantage of opportunities as they arise. It has been a very impressive success story and one of which Australia can feel proud.</PARA>

Why has the Australian National Parks and Wildlife Service refused to waive park entry fees at Kakadu for visiting tours of important overseas travel agencies at this very important time of establishing our international tourism reputation? Why has the Director of that body, Professor Ovington, denied the request of the Darwin Tourist Promotion Association and other parties to assist a party of 40-odd Hong Kong travel agents by some form of assistance which would have amounted to $170 for a most important and impressive tour, particularly in light of the support given to that tour by the Northern Territory Government and extensive local tourist business operators in the Top End of the Northern Territory?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Government very much welcomes the statements of President Bush and President Gorbachev following their two-day meeting in Malta, which has clearly been a very important step in the emergence of a new era of cooperation between the superpowers and between East and West more generally. Of course, it has laid the foundation for a fully fledged summit in the United States in June next year. In addition to what is on the public record and the preliminary briefings we have already received, I should mention that a senior United States official will be coming to Australia in the next few days to brief the Government in detail on the outcome of the talks. It is apparent that progress has been made in many areas, including arms control, on which I will say more in a moment, and also on projected Soviet participation as an observer in the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) following the conclusion of the Uruguay Round and the possibility of increased United States-Soviet economic cooperation. The matter of the United States of America's readiness to support observer status in GATT is something that Australia particularly applauds and welcomes. It was the subject of some discussion between Australia and the United States in the recent ministerial talks in Sydney.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> On the subject of arms control, I want to say that the Australian Government is particularly pleased about the important step that was taken at the summit towards the early finalisation of a chemical weapons convention, an issue on which Australia has taken a very prominent and active role in recent times. The United States has indicated its readiness not now to pursue the possibility of continued binary chemical weapons production after the entry into force of a comprehensive convention. We warmly welcome that further evidence of the commitment of the Bush Administration to the early conclusion of a chemical weapons convention. It will be recalled that this has been the subject of some controversy and it is a subject on which I have had very extensive dialogue with United States Secretary of State Baker, as have senior United States and Australian officials in recent months, most recently at the Australia-United States ministerial talks in Sydney.</PARA>
<PARA> Australia and the United States are also engaged in discussing strategies to promote early widespread adherence to a chemical weapons convention. The regional initiative which we set in train at the instance of the Prime Minister a few months ago has been picked up elsewhere, as I have already mentioned in this place, with Venezuela announcing a similar initiative for Latin America. We are working together with the United States and a number of other countries in Geneva in the hope that next year will be the final year, if humanly possible, in the convention negotiation process. Australia will be playing the role of coordinator of the Western Group at the disarmament conference next year. We hope that we can make some progress in that capacity.</PARA>
<PARA> More generally on arms control, attention at the summit focused on the centrally important START agreement-strategic arms reduction talks agreement-with both sides indicating their willingness to complete the agreement, which they hope will be ready for signature next year. President Bush proposed that the United States and Soviet Union work toward completing the agreement in time for the June summit. To this end, United States Secretary of State Baker and Foreign Minister Shevardnadze will hold several meetings over the next few months to discuss three main issues: air-launched cruise missiles; encryption of missile test telemetry; and accounting procedures for non-deployed missiles.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I refer the Minister for Resources to an answer he gave earlier in Question Time to a question from Senator Faulkner in respect of the production of ethanol from sugarcane and its viability or otherwise. In response to Senator Faulkner, the Minister said that for ethanol to be competitive it would need massive subsidies. I think that is the correct expression used by the Minister. I ask: Does the Government intend to absolve the ethanol from sugarcane from all secondary taxes, excise taxes and other taxes?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is a matter of plain fact on production costs alone from the statement attributed to Transfield Pty Ltd, after it had consulted with the Queensland Minister for Mines and Energy, Mr Katter, that there would be no extra cost at the bowser for consumers of ethanol blended petroleum in Queensland. On production costs alone for ethanol to be competitive, so that there would be no extra cost, the price of oil would have to be $US40 a barrel-it is currently between $US15 and $US18. The Australian Minerals and Energy Council, as I said earlier, in a 1987 study had indicated that production costs-I am only talking about production costs-were then around 60c per litre for ethanol compared to petrol at 20c per litre. To go to the point that I was making, if there were not to be a higher impost paid by motorists then there would be required to be massive subsidies. That point is valid, and remains valid, irrespective of the taxing regime. In terms of tax, that is a matter for both the Commonwealth and the State and those taxing regimes apply as both the Commonwealth and State appropriately invoke them. The point is not a question of tax, which is a neutral issue in this, but it is a question of production costs.</PARA></TALK.START>

As he would not answer my question in respect of Commonwealth Government secondary taxes as applied to ethanol, I ask him how does he explain that the Prime Minister, Mr Hawke, 12 months ago wrote to the Premier of Queensland and said that secondary tax would not apply but that he could not speak for future governments.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It would take only a Queensland Liberal Party, to the extent that it still exists in Queensland, to actually find something different between what the Prime Minister said and what my answer was. My answer is about the cost of production of ethanol compared to petroleum. The Prime Minister's commitment in that letter, of which I am aware, is consistent. The honourable senator's question still makes the point for me that if the cost at the bowser were to be the same it would still require a massive public subsidy. That is the point I was making in my contribution. I thank the honourable senator for assisting me to make it again. The taxation issue suggests, as the honourable senator has raised, that a degree of public subsidy will be applied because if a commodity such as ethanol is not to be taxed then the public good is not being met, in some sense, which would otherwise be attained by taxation.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;What an ignorant quip. There are two major objectives of the Federal Government's retirement income policy. Firstly, and fundamentally, is the provision of adequate income support; secondly, the creation of opportunities for pensioners to better use their savings. Senator Crowley's question goes very much to the second part. It goes to the provision of opportunities for pensioners to better use their savings. In this area, the Government is implementing a comprehensive information strategy. It is one that is based on allowing pensioners to take advantage of the new opportunities created in the retirement income policy. As part of that program, we have special pensioner hot lines; the Aged Pension News, a newspaper entirely devoted to aged and financial service pensioners; new financial counselling services; a clearing house for pensioner investments; and, most importantly, the new financial information service for pensioners. This service has had quite a successful introduction. It is operating from 20 Department of Social Security area offices. It is based on the work of staff which can explain how income from investments or earnings or loans affect a pensioner and, of course, it traverses a range of problems pensioners face under incomes and assets tests as well as in relation to fringe benefit purposes and for tax in general. I say that it has had a successful introduction as it has been in operation now for three weeks. In that period it has dealt with 1,000 clients and conducted about 300 interviews.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The strategy is designed to help pensioners benefit from the retirement income reforms which promote savings. These include: first, the radical three-stage reform of income test and tax measures providing incentives to maximise investment income for pensioners; secondly, and importantly, the concessional treatment of annuity under the income test; thirdly, the improved pensioners credit scheme; fourthly, disregarding under incomes tests of up to $40,000 received from a home equity conversion loan; and, fifthly, and most importantly and fundamentally, the indexation for the entire system of income test free areas, fringe benefit limits and the assets test limits. I made the point that the interjection from those opposite was ignorant because the last point about the indexation of both payments and these areas is quite fundamental. It is an essential part of the program. It is also essential because it provides certainty for pensioners.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is addressed to the Minister representing the Minister for Social Security. I hope that he can expand on his knowledge about retirement income policies in answer to me. I refer the Minister to the Government's Budget changes to its retirement incomes policy, and specifically to the introduction of income tax deductions for employees who are members of certain employer supported superannuation funds. Did the Budget Statements show that from 1 July 1990 employees will be able to claim the maximum allowable $3,000 tax deduction for contributions where the employer provides up to 4 per cent in contributions scaling down to zero where the employer contributions are over 6.5 per cent? As the Budget disclosed that the Government is proposing another 3 per cent award increase in wages for occupational superannuation on top of the existing 3 per cent, lifting the minimum level of employer supported superannuation to 6 per cent, does the Minister agree that the bulk of the work force would then be allowed to claim a maximum deduction of $1,000 only, or one third of the maximum that the Government provided for, with great fanfare, in the Budget? In those circumstances of little or no tax deductability being available for low income earners, where is the great tax incentive for them to provide for their own retirement through superannuation?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Can the Minister representing the Minister for Community Services and Health advise how many people had no cover under previous private health insurance schemes operating in Australia and how many are now covered under Medicare? How much does the average family save in health insurance under Medicare compared with previous schemes?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RF4">Senator COOK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This invites me to make a BM and AM comparison-a before Medicare and an after Medicare comparison. Before Medicare upwards of two million Australians did not have any health cover-either private health insurance, or they were not covered by the Commonwealth as pensioners, unemployed or low-income earners. So in the old era nearly two million of our fellow citizens were without health insurance protection. Of course, since the advent of the Medicare arrangement all Australian residents are now automatically covered for basic health costs, indicating one of the most far-reaching and significant social reforms achieved in medical coverage in Australia. This Government is well recognised for that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> To compare the costs before Medicare and after Medicare is a bit of a difficult task because one cannot strictly compare the two situations. However, by applying the increases in consumer price index to the average family basic medical and hospital insurance contribution of $14.50 a week or $754 per annum just before Medicare was introduced to June 1989 equivalents, we see that it would generate a family contribution of $21.60 a week or $1,123 per annum. This would need to be reduced to reflect the 30 per cent tax rebate that applied at that time, but this would still give a weekly outlay of $15 or an annual outlay of $786. This means that a family would need to be earning in excess of $62,000 per annum, after taking into account the tax rebate, before it would be worse off under Medicare. The Australian Bureau of Statistics in August 1988 indicated that the mean average family income was $655 a week or $34,000 per annum. Thus, we have $34,000 compared to $62,000. In other words, the average family could be up to $6 a week or $360 per annum better off under Medicare than under the previous Fraser Government user pays scheme that operated during 1982-83. In concluding my answer, I note that in statements attributed to the shadow Minister for health, Mr Peter Shack, it is indeed yet once again-boringly, repetitively-the intention of a conservative coalition to abolish Medicare.</PARA>

Is the Minister aware that the United States stopped air transport to the Casey region because of a number of near misses even though the United States aircraft were equipped with the more preferable ski landing gear whereas the Australian aircraft are to be equipped with the more limited landing wheels only? What is the cost of constructing the Casey runway and what provision has been made for emergency medical and rescue services because of the hazardous nature of these flights?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am aware that the Polar Queen is carrying some Air Force personnel who will be looking at the construction of a runway. As Senator Calvert and I think many other honourable senators would be aware, during the course of this season we intend to trial a number of flights to see how effective air transport down there can be. That will be an enormous undertaking. A report was done in 1985 but it did not review all of the methods that we will be trialling this year. This year there will be a couple of Hercules flights. It is difficult to say exactly how many as we do not know what the weather will bring. If this is to become a permanent feature, we intend to do far more in the way of weather forecasting. I hope that we can make sure that the operation is totally safe. Certainly the Air Force, when assessing last season whether there would be any flights at all, took that into consideration. The Air Force has regard not only for the safety of passengers and equipment but also for its own personnel. It would not be undertaking these flights without being convinced that they would be safe.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There have been a number of changes to the way in which the Division would like to see air transport used. If there was to be an ice-snow runway on which these Hercules could land, our intention was to use long range helicopters from Casey to the other bases. That has now been altered and we will be using fixed wing aircraft because our trialling of the other methods showed that this just was not possible. We hope to have the runway sufficiently frozen over by early February to allow us to begin some flights. I cannot be specific about the percentage that will go. There is a point at which, after leaving Hobart, a final check is made with Casey and if the pilot is not satisfied the plane turns around. However, given the time of year that the flights are going down there, the percentage of flights that will get in should be pretty high.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is clear from the number of statements made by Government Ministers in recent weeks that there is considerable misunderstanding of the links between the economy and the environment. This extends from the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) down and involves most senior Ministers. This ignorance is shared by most media commentators. It poses several serious threats to Australia's and the world's well-being and that is why this is a matter of public importance this afternoon. At the most profound level it means that the legitimate environmental concerns will be deflected by government application of bandaids which fail to address the underlying causes of progressive environmental deterioration. The environment will continue to deteriorate while the public is misled into thinking problems are being effectively addressed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Related to this is the damage done to informed public debate. Emerging recognition of significant global environmental damage should lead to extensive and informed public debate. Very profound changes which affect attitudes and many aspects of lifestyle will need to be made. These cannot and will not be made unless there is public information and the formation of a consensus. As present government and media, through their lack of understanding and their backward orientation, are impeding this process. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, even within the present flawed economic modelling, Australia is being left behind other nations because it is failing to recognise that large and significant economic improvements can be obtained even while addressing the problems of resource and environmental protection and that, particularly in the energy area, reduced energy use through conservation and use of alternative and renewable energy technologies are consonant with improved economic performance. Government attitudes and research and development spending in these areas are causing Australia to be left behind, even when looked at from the Government's narrow competitive view of the world economy. I want to pick up each of these areas in turn. </PARA>
<PARA> Firstly, there is a fundamental and irreconcilable conflict between the continual pursuit of economic growth and the establishment of a sustainable environment. To speak of sustainable growth, as do both the Prime Minister and the Treasurer (Mr Keating), indicates that both either do not understand that economic growth means an increased flow of resources through the economy and is therefore not endlessly sustainable or believe in perpetual motion machines, a belief firmly held by most economists. Indeed, the economist Herman Daly, in commenting on this, likens it to a biologist trying to understand animals only in terms of their circulatory system, with no recognition that they have digestive tracts. He says:</PARA>
<PARA> The metabolic flow is not circular. The digestive tract firmly ties the animal to its environment at both ends. Without digestive tracts animals would be self-contained perpetual-motion machines. Likewise for an economy with an entropic throughput. </PARA>
<PARA>Facing this fundamental conflict will require more than assertion that it does not exist or evasion on the part of government, but so far that is all we have had from government. Exponential growth in material consumption has clear limits. Energy consumption is a direct cause of greenhouse gas emissions and escalating changes in the composition of the global atmosphere. Energy use is closely linked with the extraction and use of all other material resources. Therefore, continued growth in the consumption of material resources is incompatible with ecological sustainability. </PARA>
<PARA> But what of labour, the other input to gross domestic product (GDP)? The United States and Japan have recently experienced economies growing much more rapidly than the increase in their use of material resources. The labour content of their GDP has increased far more rapidly, marking a shift from material resource use to an increase in labour input to that index of growth. But labour is also limited. There are only three ways in which an individual or community can increase the value of the labour component of GDP: work harder, work more hours or increase the value of those hours vis-a-vis the value of the hours of others. Working more hours or working harder at the same job clearly has strict limits. Moreover, one could seriously question the sanity of a society which sought to make its citizens work harder and longer merely to chase a growing GDP. Doing the same work or doing different work and charging more for one's time involves one person taking an advantage over another in a zero sum game. Inequity is increased. This places a limit on growing GDP or on a growth economy. </PARA>
<PARA> The zero sum nature of the labour component of GDP is important to grasp. It arises out of the fixed and equal number of hours available to everyone. For instance, if a pilot charges three times as much per hour for his or her labour as I do, I must work three hours to buy one hour of a pilot's time; if six hours, I must work six hours to buy an hour of a pilot's time. As the pilot's fortune rises, so my fortune falls in a precisely reciprocal way. So it is between nations. If the Japanese charge more per hour for their time, it follows that Australians must work more time to buy the products of Japanese labour. Inequality places very strict limits on growth through this course-the course of increasing the labour content of GDP. </PARA>
<PARA> This analysis also shows that human inventiveness does not resolve the conflict between growth and sustainability. Innovation will not of itself cause global economic growth but may allow one person or group or nation to grow at the expense of another. For those who are left behind by competitive labor costs, there is one temporary solution; that is, to attempt to feed their economic growth by increasing the rate of exploitation of material resources. But, as I have shown, there are strict limits to this. This explains how countries with growing economies-such as Japan, the United States and to some extent Australia-even those with relatively declining material input to those economies nonetheless exacerbate environmental despoliation and depress resource prices in those countries struggling but failing to make their own economies grow. </PARA>
<PARA> Many technological developments allow us to use resources more efficiently, but growth means growth in the dollar value of goods and services made each year after allowing for inflation. The pursuit of growth, therefore, means that the benefits of technological improvement are at least partly taken out as increased real inputs of material resources and/or labour somewhere else in the economy. Thus applied, improved technology results in an overall increase in throughput in the economy. </PARA>
<PARA> If we were not growth directed, we might take technological and other improvements as an opportunity to decrease economic inputs for the same output. We may then have a falling GDP while maintaining the same material and an improved non-material quality of life. We may, for instance, take the improvement as increased leisure rather than increased production. That is a sustainable economy, one that seeks to maintain a suitable stock of material things with a minimum and sustainable throughput, or GDP, of material resources and labour rather than merely attempting endlessly to increase the throughput. There is a sharp and irreconcilable conflict between these two economic models, a conflict which this Government has not yet recognised, much less sought to resolve. </PARA>
<PARA> The second area I wish to address concerns the unfounded assumptions that environmental protection and resource conservation come at such a high price that only limited protection and conservation are consistent with economic rationalism. I quote from a couple of articles by Ean Higgins in today's Australian. Commenting on the greenhouse, he says:</PARA>
<PARA> On a policy front, it would mean a concerted and expensive effort to combat the emission of greenhouse gases, such as imposing a `carbon tax' on fuels which let out large amounts of carbon per unit of energy. </PARA>
<PARA>He goes on to argue that this would be so expensive as to interfere with the economy. Reporting on the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation conference on greenhouse, going on in Sydney, Ean Higgins quotes Mr Jim Le Cornu of Shell as saying:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . the hoped-for lower cost, lower greenhouse impact options are essentially not available. </PARA>
<PARA>We find this attitude coming not only from the Government but also through the media. Compromise, indeed, is the word most often used-compromise between the dictates of economic growth and the desirability of protecting the environment. This attitude leads to the belief that the global, economic and industrial arrangements in the year 2010 will not be markedly different from what they have been for the last several decades, only more intense and extending over more countries. For instance, it has been asserted recently that there are no environmental constraints to conventional industry-based economic growth in China over the decades ahead. This belief finds practical expression in the allocation of research and development funds and industry assistance in this country. </PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Democrats believe that there has been, and is, a serious misallocation in these areas because of the inability or unwillingness of government to comprehend the portents for change which can be read in the deteriorating environment. Other countries are making better, more far-sighted development decisions than Australia. We are being left behind with yesterday's technology, despite the fact that some of the most brilliant research is being done in this country. For instance, in the last nine years, $640m has been spent on energy research in Australia. About 40 per cent of this has gone into nuclear energy and 27 per cent into coal research. It has been repeatedly shown that nuclear is not economic when fully exposed to a competitive market. Moreover, carbon emission taxes, which will discriminate heavily against coal, are already being considered in some countries. Thus, two-thirds of our energy research expenditure in recent years may have been in areas with a limited and declining future. Meanwhile, only 15 per cent of our research effort has gone into renewable energy and energy conservation. </PARA>
<PARA> Moreover, over time the funding for renewable energy and energy conservation has declined in real terms. Whilst Sweden spent US206c per head of population on renewable energy in 1986 and Japan spent US82c, Australia spent only US48c. Most developed countries spent more than Australia. One important consequence of this, and the attitude which caused it, is that while between 1973 and 1985 Japan reduced the energy required per dollar of GNP by 31 per cent, Australia improved by only 6 per cent. This occurred during 12 years when the Japanese economy was growing very rapidly and the savings were also won against a much less energy intensive base-the base from which the Japanese economy began. As energy savings are a direct addition to profits-that is, to the bottom line, not to the top line in a country's accounting-this suggests a path by which Australian industry could become more profitable without increasing output but with a lowered environmental impact. That this path is not being followed we lay fairly and squarely at the door of government. </PARA>
<PARA> Electricity use in Australia is inefficient. This inefficiency has been brought about by the control exercised by supplying utilities in the States. Excess generating capacity with associated large foreign debt is present in every State in this country. The excess will become enormous if energy efficiencies which are now achievable were to be practised. For instance, the most efficient available lighting uses a quarter of the electricity that the current incandescent lamps use for the same light output. Refrigerators and air-conditioners can achieve the same efficiency. We pose the question: Will Australia be left behind with out of date and inefficient technology which the rest of the world does not want? We believe the answer must be yes, if the blinkered attitude of this Government to energy efficiency continues. </PARA>
<PARA> As for alternative renewable and environmentally clean sources of electricity, California already has 1,500 megawatts of wind generating capacity using 17,000 wind generators. Denmark in the first four months of 1989 produced 70 gigawatt hours of electricity, saving the emission of 350 to 500 tonnes of sulphur dioxide, 210 to 420 tonnes of nitrogen oxides and 52,000 to 87,000 tonnes of carbon dioxide. Australia has some of the very best sites in the world for wind generators but where is our wind program? It has been shut down by Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation and other funding cuts. The Pacific Gas and Electric Company, a commercial company operating in California, spends $30m a year on renewables on the ground that photovoltaics will be competitive by the mid-1990s. Some of the most exciting research in this area is being carried out in this country but where is the development research funding coming from? It is coming substantially from overseas and that is the direction to which the research development will return. </PARA>
<PARA> Volkswagen, Volvo, Peugeot and Renault all have prototype four-to-five seat cars with fuel consumptions ranging from 81 to 124 miles per gallon. These could be introduced at no greater cost than present models. But we have the Button car plan which takes no account of greenhouse emissions or declining supplies of indigenous hydrocarbon fuels. A sliding sales tax on fuel inefficiency in motor vehicles with rebates for efficiency could fairly quickly steer Australian producers towards cars which the world must use in the future. Since 1979 in the United States, seven times as much energy has come from reduced energy intensity as from all net increases in supply. This has been done at less cost, not more. </PARA>
<PARA> In the 10 years 1973 to 1983, reduced United States electrical intensity has saved approximately 141 gigawatts of installed capacity at a marginal capacity cost of $200,000m. So one can achieve very sub-stantial economic savings and at the same time produce and use the energy much more efficiently and achieve substantial improvements in environmental quality with reduced greenhouse emissions. This Government is failing to recognise the advantages which both improved efficiency and renewables could bring. It is not adequately funding developments in these areas. In the words of the matter of public importance, the Government is failing to understand the indissoluble links between good environmental and good economic management. </PARA>

I gather that the failure of the Government to which Senator Coulter alluded is our failure properly to take account of how we might best deal with energy conservation and research. Related to that, I suppose he is alluding to some other failure in research. In the first part of his speech he gave some analysis of what growth means.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is distracting. My colleague said, `Don't be seduced, delegates, by the politics of growth'. The difficulty with that statement and with what Senator Coulter has said today is that it ignores what human endeavour has been about since time began. There is no question but that the great majority of people want growth and want better standards. A delegate from Tanzania said to me at a conference recently that the only time his people see electricity is when lightning flashes in a storm. The arguments about how we cut emissions from power stations amused him. Over 90 per cent of Tanzania's contribution to carbon emissions come from the burning of wood for cooking. He and the Third World are desperate for a growth path. We, having experienced growth and all the material benefits it brings, will simply not be in a position to say to anyone, `You cannot grow. You must remain where you are'. Rather, we will have to help them to manage their growth so that the damage which is done to our planet is minimised. All countries in the developed world will have to do the same thing. We can have economic growth and yet retain a more than responsible attitude to the environment and to the use of resources.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I recently returned from a conference in the Netherlands on the greenhouse effect. It focused its efforts on gas emissions and what governments could expect to do over the next 12 months. The facts coming out of that conference were that the whole world is waiting for the report of the international panel on climate change, which is due in July next year, before making final decisions on what might be appropriate targets for reductions in some greenhouse gas emissions. It would seem to be entirely reasonable that the panel was given the task to write the report. In the meantime the United Nations, the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation, the United Nations environment program and scientists within a range of developed nations will be spending a great deal of their time and their governments' moneys in working out how best to conserve energy in the meantime. The consensus around the world is that the best method of containing greenhouse gas emissions will be by conservation, by making sure we use energy better. </PARA>
<PARA> It cannot be said that the Australian Government is lagging behind in that respect. At a meeting of the environment Ministers of Australia and New Zealand held in Victoria in October we undertook a program to look at how the States can best conserve energy in the course of the next few years. We set a target of looking at the possibility of cutting greenhouse gas emissions by up to 40 per cent. People should not be too alarmed by that figure. Those who believe there will be too much pain in doing any of this should remember that we were able to get a reduction in halons and freons and the like of the order of 17 per cent. A figure like 40 per cent with respect to greenhouse gases, therefore, does not frighten me all that much. Naturally, all of the States of Australia and the Australian Government are like the European governments and most of the governments of the world in wanting to make sure that we set about some achievable programs. That is why they are waiting until the research comes in. </PARA>
<PARA> Everyone coming out of the conference in Nordvik had to be of the view that around the world everyone was serious about cutting greenhouse gas emissions, with the possible exception of the United States and Japan-two countries to which Senator Coulter referred a number of times during his contribution. They certainly took the hardest line against the possibility of targets being set in the near future. I do not look upon the stance taken by the United States as being a backward one. Like all democratic governments, the Unites States Government will have to go at a pace at which its people will allow. As honourable senators are no doubt aware, in the US Congress there is now a Bill which would greatly reduce emissions of sulphur dioxide, not such a huge problem in Australia. We do not have an acid rain problem here, but in the United States it is an enormous problem. That Bill places an immediate cost impost on industry of $5 billion. If one reads between the lines, one sees that the Bush Administration is a bit concerned about taking on carbon dioxide at the same time. Once the SO2 Bill passes, as I believe it will, the United States Government will move on with the next step. I must concede, however, that I did not glean from speaking to the Japanese delegation that Japan had any plans to reduce emissions seriously in any industry that was causing us concern. That was a real worry. I hope that international pressure will address that in the course of the next 12 months. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I acknowledge that there is always an argument about how many they take. Nonetheless, the environment Ministers of Australia took the view that we could look at a number of programs immediately. I will not go through a list of examples, although I will provide one to Senator Coulter if he would like. As an example, each State has agreed to participate in some pilot programs where, using particular electricity substations so the results can be measured and the areas from which power is being taken can be identified, the governments are going to provide households with light globes that are much more energy efficient. There are now some phenomenally efficient light globes. We hope that with a 12-month trial of that program we can change the attitude of all governments on questions like this and make sure that those are the sorts of globes that people begin to buy. They will be made to buy them if we make sure that there is such a cost impost on less efficient globes that people will not use them any more.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Amory Lovins from the Rocky Mountains Institute was in Australia last week and I had the opportunity to talk with him. I am trying to arrange for him to attend the next meeting of the Environment Ministers Council; it may well be that we invite energy Ministers to attend as well. As honourable senators may know, Mr Lovins is a world leader in looking at energy conservation. The sorts of things that he has to say are exciting. He has suggested that those in the energy field in Australia who look upon carbon taxes or even carbon dioxide emission reductions with great trepidation will have to come to realise that there is a very fertile field there for them to make much more money out of than they are currently making from producing power in the way that they do. Mr Lovins's ideas are not those of a crank. He is acting as a consultant to electricity authorities in a range of Asian countries, European countries and in Japan, which is a very good sign. He believes there is a lot of money to be made for those who get in early selling methods of energy efficiency in conservation. The Environment Ministers Council is also looking at what we can do with water heating, which in Australian households uses a great deal of power. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes; they are hopelessly inefficient in their methods. We are confident that very significant gains can be made in looking at just that one area. Obviously we have to take the energy Ministers along with us and that is why I am suggesting that we might have Mr Lovins come and talk to us. He also spoke to me about cars. We have made some real advances in our cars, with the introduction of lead-free petrol and the like in recent years, but there is obviously a long way to go.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In America there are cars now available on the market-not just prototypes-which are incredibly more efficient than those which we now drive. I would agree with Senator Coulter that Australia needs to look at these cars and their engines very seriously at the earliest opportunity because it may well be that we need to do something about introducing a timetable by which those who import them and those who make them for this country can start the change. That is certainly high on my agenda, although until I have much more information on it I do not think I will be in a position to propose a course of action. I intend to be in a position to do that by the middle of next year. When one looks at the sorts of arrangements that are already under way it is clear that the Government is well and truly looking at some of the things Senator Coulter raised. The matter of public importance states:</PARA>
<PARA> The failure of the Government to comprehend the indissoluble links between good environmental and good economic management. </PARA>
<PARA>I would have thought there were stunning examples not of our showing a failure but of our infinite capacity to grasp that link. In the last few years, the Government took a decision to ban rainforest logging in north Queensland. The decision on the use of the resource there was made after taking into consideration the cost not only in pure dollar terms but also in the quality of life for Australians, which is more important, in my view, than mere dollar considerations. </PARA>
<PARA> The Great Barrier Reef is a wonderful example of the Government understanding the link between good economic and good environmental management. That environment is being preserved, yet it earned over $1 billion from tourism last year. That leads one to the Wesley Vale decision, in which the classic balance had to be determined. We had to get down to the argument of economic management and environmental management. The Australian Government was prepared to take a stand and say that, unless guidelines that were far stricter than those laid down by the Tasmania Government were laid down, the project could not go ahead. That decision took courage. It was not a decision gained after acrimonious Cabinet debate; it was a genuinely unanimous decision. It was so because the facts were overwhelming. Next week-I had thought it was going to be this week and I apologise to Senator Durack, whom I told it would be this week-Cabinet will make a decision on the guidelines for all those who seek to use forest resources for the purpose of a chemical pulp mill. All potential operators will note when they see those guidelines that they are by far the toughest in the world-as well they should be. Again, the Government perceived the link between the two. Simply because the Government is laying down a set of guidelines for kraft chlorine mills does not mean that that is the only technology that is applicable. All chemical mills cause some damage-some much less than chlorine mills. The Government would be interested to hear from anyone who has a proposal to build something a bit different. The Tasmanian Government is encouraging companies to do that. The fact that the Government brings down these decisions will not necessarily mean that there will be a kraft chemical mill built next week in Tasmania. Wherever it is built, it will not be built at Wesley Vale. </PARA>
<PARA> In more recent times the Government came up with a truly courageous decision which has received a great deal of public criticism from those aggrieved by the decision, but nonetheless, it has received tremendous public support: That, of course, was the decision on Kakadu to take 98 per cent of the conservation zone and put it into the Kakadu National Park and eventually into the World Heritage area. Obviously, these are difficult decisions which are not taken easily. But when one looks at the results, one realises that it is very difficult to say-in my view, impossible-that the Government failed to comprehend the links between good environmental and good economic management. We have been prepared to take the hard decisions on the hard issues whenever they have come up, and we will continue to do that. Honourable senators can rest assured that the direction the Government is taking will not change. The Government is very firm in that course. I believe that the Australian people applaud us for it. </PARA>
<PARA> Rather than produce a motion in the terms of the motion we have before us today, it might be a little fairer if Senator Coulter looked at the very many pluses that the environment has had in the last few years. He will see that the environment has finished well in front. As Senator Coulter well knows, and as Senator Macklin knows no doubt, in spite of whatever Senator Puplick's private views would be, were the Opposition to be elected, the environment would be, unfortunately, due for a very rocky road. Development and economics would win every single time if the Opposition were to be elected to government. The environment would be under very serious threat. The main threat would have come from the former Queensland Government, but that Government has been successfully buried in the last few days and we will now have a Goss Labor Government, which will cooperate with us not only in ensuring that proper decisions are made on Cape York but also in withdrawing a court case on the rainforests which has cost the Queensland taxpayers millions of dollars. And what for? It is all for that blind ignorance and stupidity displayed by the Queensland Nationals, who now amount to not much more than a rump-although they still amount to more than Senator Parer's lot, the Queensland bobsled Liberal Party. There are only four representatives left, and they are all heading downhill and doing it at a great rate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Senate has before it a matter of public importance in these terms:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The failure of the Government to comprehend the indissoluble links between good environmental and good economic management. </PARA>
<PARA>For reasons which are quite different from those advanced by Senator Coulter, the Opposition supports the matter of public importance. It characterises comprehensively the failure of Senator Richardson and his Government in terms of the economic and environmental management for which they have been responsible over the last few years. No sense will be got out of this debate by listening either to the new age nonsense of the Australian Democrats or to the cynical green politics of Senator Richardson and his cohorts in the Australian Labor Party. </PARA>
<PARA> The most important single threat to the planet, to the biosphere, to our world environment, is the threat of poverty and the threat of overpopulation. Neither of those problems will be solved without economic growth. The moral culpability of people who say, `Let us have limits to economic growth and let us accept that people in India, people in the Third World, in the poor countries of Central America and South America, and of Sub-Saharan Africa, should be denied the benefits of economic growth, their standards of living should continue to be depressed, people should continue to starve to death, and people should continue to live in misery, rather than have the sort of economic growth without which the problems of world poverty and overpopulation simply cannot be addressed' is reprehensible. It is one of the most morally reprehensible statements that I have ever heard put before this chamber or into the public debate as a whole. This sort of macro-biotic Malthusianism that we get from the Australian Democrats is absolutely morally indefensible. It is for that reason that the intelligent participants in this debate, people like Prime Minister Brundtland, have produced a formula and have started to talk in terms of the slogan of sustainable development-not sustainable non-development, but sustainable development. I shall come back to what Mrs Brundtland and her committee and others have had to say about this in recent months. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to make a point about the sort of doomsday predictions that one gets constantly from Senator Coulter in this place. Senator Coulter likes to tell everybody that he is a scientist, and that economists are notoriously bad in making predictions. Yesterday and today he has been bucketing the economists-for whom I hold no particular brief. He tells us that it is only if we listen to the scientists that we will get all of this right. Perhaps I should remind him of Lord Kelvin's prediction. I quote Lord Kelvin, one of this century's most distinguished scientists:</PARA>
<PARA>Radio has no future. </PARA>
<PARA>Perhaps I should quote Einstein:</PARA>
<PARA>There is not the slightest indication that nuclear energy will ever be obtainable. It would mean that the atom would have to be shattered at will. </PARA>
<PARA>Perhaps I should quote Lord Rutherford:</PARA>
<PARA> The energy produced by the atom is a very poor kind of thing. Anyone who expects a source of power from the transformation of these atoms is talking moonshine. </PARA>
<PARA>Perhaps I should quote Lord Kelvin again:</PARA>
<PARA> Heavier-than-air flying machines are impossible. </PARA>
<PARA>Perhaps I should quote Thomas Watson, the founder and head of IBM in 1943:</PARA>
<PARA> I think there is a world market for about two computers. </PARA>
<PARA>Perhaps I should quote Lord Kelvin again:</PARA>
<PARA> X-rays are a hoax. </PARA>
<PARA>Perhaps I should quote the Astronomer Royal of the United Kingdom in 1956:</PARA>
<PARA> Space travel is utter bilge. </PARA>
<PARA>One could go on at length talking about the sorts of predictions made by people whose minds are firmly rooted in existing, or indeed pre-existing, technology and technological and political solutions and who have absolutely no capacity to understand the capability of human society to address and solve significant problems. </PARA>
<PARA> Similarly, we have had all of Senator Richardson's usual cant about how concerned he is about the environment, about the extent to which, if this side of the chamber were in government, there would be some assault upon the environment. Let me remind you, Mr Acting Deputy President, that, as you would well know, this side of the chamber was formally calling for the Australian Government to refuse to sign the Convention on the Regulation of Antarctic Mineral Resource Activities at the time that Senator Richardson, as Environment Minister, and Senator Evans, as Foreign Minister, were travelling around this country telling everybody that we ought to sign the minerals convention. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me remind you, Mr Acting Deputy President, that it was the commitment given by the coalition parties to work for a 20 per cent targeted reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by the year 2000 that Senator Richardson has consistently said is an irresponsible policy to which he and his Government will not commit themselves. So, as far as these things are concerned, Senator Richardson has indicated quite clearly exactly the balance that he seeks to strike, not between the environment and development or between environment protection and Australia's national economic interest, but quite simply in relation to the one-off calculus of the moment, where the votes happen to lie and whom one can confront at any particular time for no advantage to the environment, for no advantage to the Australian economy, simply for the crude political advantage of the Labor Party. </PARA>
<PARA> I said that Prime Minister Brundtland of Norway has, on a number of occasions made comments about the question of sustainable development. She has done so not only in the Brundtland report-she was the chairman of the World Commission on Environment and Development, which produced it-but indeed in the Sir Peter Scott lecture which she delivered in Bristol in October 1986. Prime Minister Brundtland said this:</PARA>
<PARA> The World Commission does not believe that a dismal scenario of mounting destruction of national global potential for development-indeed, of the earth's capacity to support life-is an inescapable destiny. The problems are planetary-but they are not insoluble. </PARA>
<PARA>She concluded her remarks by saying that solutions to these problems required:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . a broadening of the concept of development so that it covers not only economic growth but also social and cultural development. </PARA>
<PARA>Nobody would resile from that except, of course, Senator Coulter and the Australian Democrats. </PARA>
<PARA> I have said that the approach taken by Senator Richardson on a number of these matters has been based purely upon political considerations. It should not simply be taken that a member of the Opposition would assert that. He should stand condemned from the mouths of his own colleagues, so I propose to quote what the Treasurer, Mr Keating, said about the Wesley Vale decision which Senator Richardson turned his mind to a few moments ago. On the 7.30 Report of 16 March 1989 Mr Keating said:</PARA>
<PARA> Well I think part of the problem was that the Government relied on the State of Tasmania to set the environmental guidelines and in the end Tasmania threw the game and we were placed in a position where we couldn't adopt the Tasmanian standards because they were not adoptable. So the responsibility came to us. Now you may deduce from that it may always come to us but if it does on pulp mills we should develop a Commonwealth standard, it's a much better way of approaching the problem than trying to deal with each case by case. </PARA>
<PARA>Yet, six months down the track, the Government is still not honouring the promise it made to this chamber to put out acceptable standards on pulp mill guidelines by 30 November. Perhaps I should quote what Mr Kerin has had to say about Senator Richardson and about the way he has conducted his campaign in this country. Mr Kerin said of Senator Richardson:</PARA>
<PARA> He wanders around the country bagging the miners and the farmers and all the rest of it . . . </PARA>
<PARA>He is not making a significant contribution to the environmental debate. As we all know, Mr Kerin has been chastised by his Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) and by other members of his Government for exposing Senator Richardson on this matter. No wonder the Sun-Herald, in its editorial of 12 November 1989, said this:</PARA>
<PARA> Mr Kerin's arguments in support of `balanced, sustainable development' are sound. He is not a development at any cost politician, but a voice of common sense in a Cabinet largely comprised of howling, vote-catching Opportunists. </PARA>
<PARA>That is exactly right. One knows from what Mr Keating, Senator Button and Mr Kerin have had to say that the Government and Senator Richardson stand condemned for their total failure to understand the proper relationship between economic development and environmental protection and management. </PARA>
<PARA> In the time we have had available I have not been able to develop the detailed argument which should be developed in terms of the correct approach, the correct strategy, to be taken towards achieving this integration, other than to say that quite clearly there is now a major swing throughout the world to looking at market forces-those much despised forces that Senator Coulter denounces on a regular basis-as the correct solution, the correct technique. This is evident whether one looks at the Treasury Economic Round-Up paper of November 1989 entitled `Developing Government Policy Responses to the Threat of the Greenhouse Effect' or whether one looks at the other end of the political spectrum, at a recent address given by Professor David Bellamy, in which he said:</PARA>
<PARA> To set the world on a new path to a sustainable future will cost an immense amount of money. That money must come from industry, and the will to succeed must be market-driven. </PARA>
<PARA>It will be not by the regulatory tools suggested by Senator Coulter on every occasion but by the forces of the market place that most progress is going to be achieved in this area, underpinned by the necessary controls which governments rightly ought to put in place. It is on that basis that the Opposition parties have produced a series of policy statements dealing with this matter. In our own environment policy document we make it quite clear that our commitment is to the protection and conservation of the natural environment and that that is unqualified, that we believe we have policies which will integrate conservation and development. </PARA>
<PARA> Conservation, like development, is for people and, while development aims to achieve human goals largely through the use of the biosphere, conservation aims to achieve them by ensuring that such uses can continue. We have put out a specific statement entitled `Reducing Greenhouse Gas Emissions' in which we set out our program for achieving protection of the earth's atmosphere by achieving acceptable standards of greenhouse gas emissions and a target for their achievement. </PARA>
<PARA> The Chairman of our Federal rural committee, David Hawker, the Federal member for Wannon, recently released a paper entitled `Agriculture and Our Environment-Making it Work, A Charter for Sustainable Agriculture', in which he develops the arguments which need to be put in place for the management of the nation's agricultural resources in an environmentally sound and ongoing fashion. We have indicated our support for the effective use of the taxation system in this regard. Indeed Mr Peacock, in his `Millennium Milestones' address in August this year, indicated our commitment to have a review of the taxation system so that:</PARA>
<PARA> Our taxation arrangements should reward all those individuals and companies alike who act with the greatest degree of environmental responsibility and which penalise those who do not. </PARA>
<PARA>We have set out in that document-also in our environmental policy document; in our heritage policy document; in the document titled The Climate Challenge; in our sustainable agricultural policy; in our briefing notes on the reduction of the greenhouse gas emissions and, most recently, in my Alfred Deakin lecture which I gave on 30 November entitled The Environment and the Liberal Tradition-the ongoing commitment we have to achieving a proper link between good environmental management and good economic management. There is absolutely nothing wrong with the underlying principle which Senator Coulter is putting forward. Nor is there anything wrong with the motion which condemns the Government for its failure to understand the indissoluble link which exists between the two. However, Senator Coulter does not offer any realistic solutions whatsoever to overcome the actual problems of providing economic growth and development and, at the same time, sustaining the biosphere and providing a proper level of environmental protection and conservation. The resolution of those problems will wait; it will not wait long. It will only have to wait for the election of the Liberal-National Party government within the course of the next six months. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Senate will be relieved that I have no intention of following Senator Puplick's childish debating techniques or normal ad hominem diatribes, except to say that the type of venom that drives him obviously flows from his embarrassment as the environment spokesperson for the Opposition. For example, he could not even manage to get the Opposition not to vote against the Democrats when we were seeking to make the Antarctic a world park. He was scrabbling in a month later on that particular issue after we had led the way. Again, he was unable to get the Opposition not to vote against the Democrats motion to take sales tax off recycled paper. Yet he managed to scrabble in about three weeks later with a policy of his own which was identical to ours.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Again, he did not manage to get the Opposition not to vote against the Democrats when we sought to have effective policies in place to prevent chlorofluorocarbon emissions. He scrabbled in about a month later again with a cobbled policy of his own. So his venom is basically based on the fact that he has had to pick up all of the policies put forward by Senator Coulter and run with them himself; but always after the effect and not before it. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to concentrate on a point that he made and that was with regard to world poverty which, in his normal, rather wimpish way, was so far off the point as to be laughable. He made a very clear statement that poverty in the Third World has absolutely nothing to do with our industrial growth. This is absolute nonsense, as anybody who knows anything about the inter-connection of the trading environment in our world would know. The world poverty that exists is very much to do with the wealth of the Western countries. Today, I want to have a look at that other part of Senator Puplick's comments about the market forces which are going to `save us all'. Why private profit should save us was certainly never explained by Senator Puplick; it may be explained later by other Liberal speakers. It would be fascinating to hear where we are going to find private profit in the protection of our environment. </PARA>
<PARA> The economic debate has been hijacked by those people who have the most to gain out of it. The whole debate generally takes place in the context of the cost to Australia of economic protection measures. Certainly, the Government goes along with this. We have raised time and time again in this place the need for environmental protection and we are told by the Liberal Party and by the Labor Party about the substantial costs in terms of jobs, profit, income and consumer prices. We got the whole diatribe again from Senator Richardson and Senator Puplick today on that basis. The economic message that we are supposed to be getting is that if we hold business responsible for environmental damage then we are going to lose. The same is said about health, safety regulations in the workplace, economic justice to poorly paid people and about justice to women and to Aboriginal people. Exactly the same types of things are said: `Let us not have any regulation'. Senator Puplick ended his speech by saying, `Let's not have any regulation because the market will look after it all'-those magical people who for private profit are going to be nice to everybody else. The fact of the matter is that they never have been and they never will be. </PARA>
<PARA> Economics is seen basically by most people as a mechanism designed to protect businesses from the charges of exploitation, and it does that job fairly well. The fact of the matter is that the financial interests of the business community are not identical to the economic interests of the larger community. We have to look at what type of structure and what type of goods in an economic environment cannot be handled by this market mechanism. There is a number of them. The first group of valuable things in our community that we do not want provided by the commercial market includes roads and human lives. For example, there would be a very large market for buying and selling children, but we do not allow that and we have to ask ourselves why. The list also includes parks and political office. We have a State in Australia which, thank God, has now changed its government, that had an accepted business of buying and selling political offices. We do not buy and sell votes and the like. What do we put in place? We happen to think there are other values and qualities that need to be addressed. So basic food, housing, energy and health care are increasingly provided outside the market through social security programs. The community doubts, and has enormous reservations, as does the Labor Party and, oddly, the Liberal Party, the basic fairness of a market mechanism with regard to the allocations in those areas. Hence the Liberals are going to support some sort of a social security system if they come into power, although not a very good one. They are on the same track of doubting the basic fairness of market allocation. </PARA>
<PARA> The second group of valuable goods that we do not think commercial markets could handle well are things like defence, against both external and internal aggression-we are not keen on private armies or police forces-clean air, scenic natural wonders, species threatened with extinction, and stable, secure communities. It is hard to see how anyone could be excluded from enjoying these once they are provided. One can hardly expect people to pay for them in a commercial market setting, or expect somebody to try to produce and sell them at a profit. That is why the market will not and cannot be essentially involved in that type of exercise. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the most frequent assertions in public discussion of the environmental quality and the quality of life is that decisions on these matters are mainly non-economic; they are moral, social or of some other nature and then, of course, everybody's judgment differs so you really cannot take account of these particular things. Therefore, it lies, as they say, outside the scope of economics. </PARA>
<PARA> If this were true then clothing, motion pictures, music, radio, television, publishing, cosmetics, architecture, interior decorating, dining out and so on-which rely on human beings making quality judgments-would also be said to be non-economic and not subject to rigorous economic analysis. Clearly, producers and consumers in all fields make subjective analyses and judgments. There are substantial disputes over this. Nevertheless, they are seen as part of an economic debate. It is absurd to say that we are placing ourselves outside of the economic debate when we seek to protect environmental values. The reason there is a problem has nothing to do with no unanimity with regard to those judgments. It is because those sought after qualities cannot be provided by a commercial market. </PARA>
<PARA> While popular music is adequately catered for by the market, the music of a bellbird in the bush and the non-music of an international jet coming in are not provided for, but they involve essentially the same matters. The absence of a commercial market for environmental services does not make them any less important or any less economic. It is clear that in those types of examples we are pursuing similar qualitative objectives. </PARA>
<PARA> I will use another example: pleasant aromas can be pursued by purchasing expensive perfume or an inexpensive air deodorant. Alternatively, we can seek to improve the ambient air quality by reducing the level of various air pollutants that we have in our community. Likewise, we can decorate our surroundings by buying prints, paintings and other goods or, alternatively, we can attempt to save the trees that line the streets. We can purchase sophisticated recordings of music and enjoy them or, alternatively we might save the birds in our urban environments and reduce the level of ambient noise to our houses. The objectives are similar but items such as perfumes, fine art and music recordings can make a profit, while, clearly, others, such as clean air, trees in our streets and reduced levels of noise are not part of the market system. Public goods, from which people cannot be excluded, cannot be produced at a profit by a private firm. Nevertheless, they are an essential part of our economic environment. </PARA>
<PARA> The Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) has made a point that he is about to launch a campaign on the urban environment. Indeed, he should, since our cities are plagued with air pollution, congestion, noise and general grime. However, some suburbs have quiet streets, less noise and less congestion. The houses in these environments have a considerably higher price tag than an identically sized house of similar quality in a polluted suburb. Selling and buying houses is an important economic activity. The subjective judgments made on environmental grounds do not baffle home buyers or real estate agents; indeed, the private pursuit of higher quality environments has transformed our cities in the last 30 years. Millions of Australians-unlike what Senator Richardson has said-have voted with their feet with regard to the environment and are willing to spend tens of thousands of their own hard-earned dollars for better environmental circumstances in which to live. </PARA>
<PARA> Unfortunately with no-one in control until recently when government took a hand, these environmental aspects were not under the control of anybody. Hence we could release anything into the air, which we all have to breathe. In the absence of good zoning laws, property owners could do what they liked with their land. They could destroy parkland, vistas and outdoor recreational opportunities. They could create more noise, congestion and grime and, in the process, the very things that bring well-being were destroyed. </PARA>
<PARA> The exercise is very clear. It is probably made most clear when we look at the effect of air pollution on health. Most people would feel at least some sympathy on this matter. Medical reports from major cities around the world indicate that a 50 per cent reduction in air pollution leads to a 25 per cent reduction in lost work days and a 15 per cent reduction in days of reduced activity due to pollution-induced illness. If we cleaned up our air entirely, the average number of sick days in Australia would decline by 1.7 million per year. If the values assigned to non-fatal accidents are applied to this type of reduced illness, we are looking at an economic gain straight off of $57m. If we add pollution-caused deaths, estimated to be around 9,500, we are looking at an economic gain of the order of $800m a year. </PARA>
<PARA> Quite frankly, it is absurd to suggest in any way that people would want to vote with their feet on this issue. In fact, every time this question has been put clearly and unambiguously to the people they have opted for quality of life over standard of living. They want more secure communities, clean air, clean water and, by and large, the suburban and urban environments where people live to be environmentally safe, secure and pleasant. They are willing to do that at a cost, and they are willing to wear that cost. They ask: Why is it that public goods such as the ones that I have just raised should be converted into private profit? The people of Australia are now standing up and being counted on this matter and those who get in their way will be walked over. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Senate is debating a matter of public importance raised by Senator Coulter, namely:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The failure of the Government to comprehend the indissoluble links between good environmental and good economic management. </PARA>
<PARA>In my view that claim just cannot be sustained. If the Australian Democrats were to change to wording slightly and replace the word `Government' with `Opposition' it would certainly get my wholehearted support. It is clear on hearing Senator Puplick's contribution today that there certainly is not any grasp of the connection in the Opposition parties. </PARA>
<PARA> Before I go any further I will comment on one thing that Senator Puplick said. I do not think he said anything else that is worth commenting on. I notice that Senator Macklin also picked up this point. Senator Puplick commented that there was a problem throughout the world of population growth and poverty. I could not agree more with him that that is an enormous problem. He then went on to say that the answer to that is greater economic growth throughout the world. I find that quite remarkable because if we were to continue in the way we are with economic growth we would simply be creating circumstances where some people end up getting richer. It will do nothing at all to solve the problems of those suffering from poverty and starving in underdeveloped countries. Absolutely no argument could be put forward to refute that. Quite interestingly that is the tack that Senator Puplick took today on debating this matter of public importance. In another circumstance, when the present Opposition was in government in Tasmania, its policies on the issue of the environment were rejected by the people. On 30 June 1989, after the election, the following comment was made by Senator Puplick:</PARA>
<PARA>It's a significant loss, but I don't think it's a disaster, and in fact in some respects, it has this compensating factor. I think it indicates to the people on the mainland or, as my Tasmanian friends like to say, on the north island, exactly what the so-called green movement really is all about. Not a genuinely independent political movement, but essentially a political movement of the left and one which I think people in the rest of Australia will now see exposed as frankly just another political organisation. </PARA>
<PARA>Clearly, every time the Opposition spokesman for the environment is confronted with a question about the policies of the Opposition he tries to deflect the argument with the sort of nonsense that was in that quote and what he went on with today. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me come to the proposition that is before the Senate. As far as Senator Coulter's contribution is concerned, I think I am in the same boat as Senator Richardson. I will have to look very closely at the Hansard tomorrow. It would be reasonable to say that I support the principles put forward by Senator Coulter. I do not want to go over the ground which was covered by Senator Richardson and Senator Macklin in their contributions. I want to highlight two important areas in a practical sense to try to bring home the fact that it is not quite as simple as Senator Coulter would have us believe. He says that as a Federal government we can simply make decisions that will solve all of these problems. It is not that simple. He did make the comment-and I agree wholeheartedly with it-that there is an enormous waste of electrical energy in Australia. The difficulty is that we are dealing with State governments who are in control of the power production in the States. As Senator Richardson said, there are attempts being made to get some agreement to do something about that. But it is not just a simple matter of our making a few speeches in the Senate and fixing the problem. We need cooperation and we need to set about that in a very practical way. </PARA>
<PARA> I particularly want to highlight two areas in my State and some of the difficulties that we faced in those areas. I am talking about the decision not to allow the Franklin Dam to proceed and the Wesley Vale decision. There is no doubt that in those two decisions the Federal Government was motivated as much by economic circumstances as it was by environmental ones, and so it should have been. As far as the Franklin was concerned, the Federal Government had to make a decision to stop the State Government from proceeding with that proposal. In doing so, the Federal Government had enormous pressure applied to it by the Liberal Party of Australia, by businesses, and so forth-not just in Tasmania but throughout the country. They argued that it was interfering with decisions within a State. It has been proved beyond any doubt that the decision that was taken, not only on environmental grounds, was absolutely the correct decision, as was argued at the time. More importantly, in my view, it would have been a decision of economic stupidity to have proceeded. </PARA>
<PARA> Since that decision, the King and Anthony power schemes have been brought on line as substitutions for the scheme and work to construct those two schemes was started, substantially with money provided by the Federal Government. We are now well down the track with them. The decision has been made that it will take at least three years longer than anticipated to build them, not because the work cannot be carried out but simply because now the truth of what was said by many people during that debate is emerging: there was no need for the power. That is irrefutable. </PARA>
<PARA> When the debate with respect to Wesley Vale was on, we had all sorts of weird and wondrous things bandied about: it was going to create 500 to 700 jobs, and what a wonderful thing it was going to be for Tasmania. The truth is that, on the company's figures supplied to unions in discussions, there were to be 300 jobs in that mill. At the same time as that mill was to come on line, Long Reach would have been shut down and 250 jobs would have been lost. At Triabunna, because of the effects of loss of resource, a number of jobs would have been lost there. In Burnie, the possibility existed that, because of the antiquated machinery there, that one would have been shut down and a number of jobs would have gone there. It is a very conservative estimate to say that another 200 jobs would have been lost. Wesley Vale would not have created these 500 to 600 jobs that the gloom and doom merchants were saying would disappear if we did not proceed with it. We have to take into account the fact that, if it had proceeded and the Federal Government had been irresponsible, we would have wiped out millions of dollars for the fishing industry in Tasmania once the pollution started to belch out in Bass Strait. They are the sorts of decisions that have been taken by the Government. On those sorts of decisions and on a number of others that Senator Richardson spoke of, it is fairly hard to sustain the contention, as Senator Coulter has tried to do in this matter of public importance, that this Government has not been prepared to take the hard decision and link the environment and the economy together. Sure, we would all like to go much further, but in the real world-and here we get to the real nub of the problem-as Senator Coulter said in his contribution, there needs to be cooperation. There certainly does need to be cooperation. I believe that that process is starting to happen. </PARA>
<PARA> Again I refer to the situation in Tasmania, because I think that, in the whole question of environmental problems that we are facing, Tasmania has been one of the real battlefields. Great credit must be given to the people concerned, particularly now that there is a new Government in Tasmania which is prepared to cooperate. With regard to the forestry operations in Tasmania, there is today a delegation from Tasmania talking to members of Cabinet about a proposal which, I hope, may lead to there not being any need for logging in National Estate areas in the future. The people involved in the delegation demonstrate the level of cooperation we want. They are the Tasmanian Government, the Tasmanian Farmers and Graziers Association, the combined environment groups, the Forest Industries Association of Tasmania, the Tasmanian Trades and Labor Council and the Forestry Commission of Tasmania. We, as a society, must get together people with differing views, such as these groups, and convince them that the right track to go down is the track of getting people all of the information that they require to make an informed decision and of making all of that information available in a proper way to the public, in particular people in workplaces, because people in workplaces have been entirely misled for many years over these sorts of questions. </PARA>
<PARA> I might just digress for a moment and say that, when the debate over the construction of the Franklin Dam was at its peak, there were public statements made and a newsletter went around to every worker at Australian Newsprint Mills Ltd which told all of the workers that, if the dam was not built, there would be 1,000 people sacked in their industry. It was absolute nonsense. It was designed to scare people and to ensure that they voted in a certain way. If decisions that we make with regard to the environment and the economy of this country are made on the basis of people sending out those sorts of scare letters, and if there is no other means of education of the public or the work force, we will always have this conflict and we will not be able to solve the problems that we are facing. </PARA>
<PARA> In finishing, I simply say to Senator Coulter that I totally agree with him when he says that we must have cooperation. But I think Senator Coulter ought to have some discussions with some of the independents in Tasmania. They have been put in a situation, a very healthy situation, where, because they are really part of the Government in Tasmania, they cannot so comfortably get up in Parliament and publicly demand that things will be done knowing full well that they will never have to deliver. They have had to reassess their thinking on a whole range of matters and determine how they will approach them. I think that is very healthy. I suggest that the Australian Democrats ought to consider that sort of process. Maybe they ought to sit down more often with the Government and talk about some of these issues rather than simply suggest solutions by way of press releases and matters of public importance. Constructive discussions which take place behind the scenes often lead to a more satisfactory outcome. </PARA>

<PARA> The failure of the Government to comprehend the indissoluble links between good environmental and good economic management. </PARA>
<PARA>For a start, I think it is fair to say that it has really been quite interesting to hear the different subjects that have been raised by earlier speakers. I will deal with this matter in my own way. In the 15 minutes which I have to speak on such a broad subject, I intend to focus mainly on the question of forestry. But, in view of the contribution by Senator Devereux, I think I should also say something about the Wesley Vale mill. </PARA>
<PARA> I wish to point out that it is very easy for people with a negative frame of mind to look back and blame everybody who has gone before. The only reason for looking back is to learn. We should not condemn people for doing what, at the time, was deemed to be reasonably in our interests. It is an absolute cop-out just to look back and blame someone else. What we must do at all times is demonstrate that we have learnt from what has happened. It is our job in this place to look forward. We have to look at the present and at the future. We have to deal with our problems; that is why we are here. </PARA>
<PARA> Our legacy is the future and that is the matter I wish to deal with. We are expected to provide economic opportunities for the future and to do so within safe and sustainable environmental limits. I believe that that is a reasonable statement and that is the way this topic should be looked at. I believe that we should achieve a sound, safe and reasonable balance. `Balance' is a word that has not been used in the debate today. I believe that our future lies in this word. Development is absolutely essential and it must be done carefully. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn now to the pulp mill question. May 1989 saw Tasmania change government in what was a pulp mill election. A party with 34 per cent of the popular vote is now in government. The story of that campaign is absolutely pathetic and I guess that the part played by Senator Richardson and his colleagues will haunt them forever. The decision that Senator Richardson ultimately foisted upon us was stupid, short-sighted, ill-informed, poorly based, politically inspired and wrong. And all the time he had available to him the right advice, starting with Mr Kerin and Mr Kerin's junior associate. We saw the politics of ignoring the facts and falling for the desperate loony fringe and the sensational, distorted hysteria of the day. </PARA>
<PARA> In fact, the election was fought on one thing-the tonnes and tonnes of deadly dioxin that were going to kill everybody. But we were never told what this dioxin was all about. We were never told that it was the same dioxin that the people complaining about it emit from their cars, burn in their incinerators or in their backyard barbecues. Accordingly, we were given the impression that that sort of dioxin was all right, but that dioxin from a pulp mill was bad and we had to be careful about it. We saw an hysterical, overstated, politically inspired campaign of absolute rubbish. Of course, it was not until after the event that we started to find out a bit more about it. For instance, the Australian Associated Press report of 1 November states:</PARA>
<PARA> Some scientists had duped the public into an exaggerated view of the health risks of dioxin, a senior government scientist said today. </PARA>
<PARA> It has been played up by some unscrupulous scientists . . . so in that sense they (the public) have been duped . . . </PARA>
<PARA>The report also states:</PARA>
<PARA> The statement noted that there had been widespread community concern at the possibility that dioxin in paper products was a health hazard. </PARA>
<PARA>This hysteria was whipped up. But, really, we have to take account of the facts. How many dioxin-related deaths are there in Australia? How many do we suffer per year? The answer is: nil. There have been no deaths in Tasmania and none in Australia. The next death in the world that can be identified as being caused by dioxin will be the first one. Yet we fought an election on the hysteria generated by this matter. We must not capitulate to these problems. Our entire generation is taking notice of negative people when we should be saying, `We recognise that there is a problem and we will deal with it'. Let us deal with the problems; do not let us capitulate to them. Still, that is the way it goes. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course, the pulp mill proposal has been shelved. Ostensibly, it was destroyed on environmental grounds when we all know that it was really shot to pieces on political grounds. It suited the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Kerin) and his henchman to shoot it down. If there had been a degree of bona fides, we would have had the guidelines by May; we would certainly have had them six months later, by the end of November. But I believe that the Minister was hoping that we would be out of this place before these guidelines became available. Is it good economic and environmental management to run a country like this? We are talking of linking the environment and economics; that is what this matter of public importance is all about. </PARA>
<PARA> The Wesley Vale mill and the Huon Forest Products mill were going to utilise an otherwise unused resource. A recent survey which I saw and the veracity of which I do not doubt, said that, as a result of various projects that this new Tasmanian Government has shelved, put aside, or cancelled, 7,000 jobs have been lost in Tasmania. These two mills would have been able to produce and export a very good value-added resource which, in turn, would have led to a huge investment in our forestry plantation industry and I am sure that this is one of the things that even Senator Coulter would support. What a stupid example of a lack of balance between the environment and economics! Does Senator Richardson fully appreciate that, in our wood products alone, we have a balance of trade deficit of $1 1/2 billion per year? We are still rolling up heaps of logs in various parts of Tasmania and burning them because this Government will not provide an export licence so that they can be exported at a profit. They have no other value. </PARA>
<PARA> As a result of the way in which everybody treats it, poor old Tasmania's major mineral areas and vast areas of degenerating forests are being locked away and there is no prospect of their being unlocked. One of the major tourist roads that has been planned for years and was being worked on as at the date of the election has been stopped. The Antarctic industry in Hobart has been stopped in its tracks. The new tourism operator of magnitude in Tasmania, P and O is now putting its developments on hold because it does not know whether there will be any development. Where are we going as far as the environment and economics are concerned?</PARA>
<PARA> I turn now to the forests. The big news about forests is the one billion trees referred to by Senator Richardson. Mind you, that is not to be confused with the funding of the program or with the planting of the trees. It does not take account of the fact that people are supposed to plant these trees. These trees somehow will magically appear. It is a lovely piece of gimmickry and it sounded good the day that he said it. When one examines it, one sees that the commitment is different. </PARA>
<PARA> What have we done to the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO) Division of Forestry? We have hacked into it. What have we done to Mr Francis Clarke? On 21 November the Australian said:</PARA>
<PARA> Pragmatic conservationist Mr Francis Clarke has little faith in the Federal Government's environmental initiatives or research strategies. </PARA>
<PARA>. . . . </PARA>
<PARA> His intention was to assist the CSIRO with six research projects on the potential of planting trees for profit while maintaining the same number of cattle and sheep grazing numbers. </PARA>
<PARA>. . . . </PARA>
<PARA> But the six CSIRO projects . . . have all been abandoned because of funding cuts. </PARA>
<PARA>That was one of the great forestry projects of Australia. Thousands of farmers all over Australia were interested and involved in it. They were watching it. But, according to the Australian of 21 November, the project has been cut because the funds were cut. That is what this Government thinks about the forests and forestry, and environment and economics. </PARA>
<PARA> What are the plans? Is there a national plan for forests? Is the Government genuine? We all know that this billion-tree project is humbug, but what is the plan and what is the philosophy? The coalition supports the National Conservation Strategy for Australia of June 1983 which says:</PARA>
<PARA> Development and conservation are but different expressions of the one process. Together they are the means of providing for the needs of the present and the future. </PARA>
<PARA> The World Conservation Strategy's three main objectives are to maintain essential ecological processes and life support systems; to preserve genetic diversity; and to ensure the sustainable utilisation of species and ecosystems. That is what the strategies say and that is what we say. It is important that the World Conservation Strategy talks about utilisation. We must not get to the stage of thinking that if something is valuable it must be locked up. We are locking forests up and the ultimate result in Tasmania is that we must burn them to get rid of them when we should be conserving them. </PARA>
<PARA> I now want to look at the Resource Assessment Commission. I hope that it does a very good job but we should not forget that in 12 years Tasmania has already had 10 inquiries on forestry. Will this be another? Will it just delay the process another two years, which is the time limit of the inquiry? What is the Government's commitment? I have never heard it say what it is, but I hope it does so. Forestry and the forest products industry should be targeted industries. They need to be planned on a 20- to 50-year basis. There needs to be real and proper planning. We need a program of research in breeding, growing and harvesting, end use, product development and recycling. It is ludicrous that Australia has a deficit of $1 1/2 billion. </PARA>
<PARA> The Tasmanian forestry operation is a model as far as it goes but there are tens of thousands of hectares of old degenerating forests. They are lovely in theory but are death traps as far as carbon dioxide emission is concerned. They give off about five times as much carbon dioxide as they absorb. That is terrible in relation to the ecology of the country. Why do we not hack them down and put in good viable trees that will get us somewhere? Let us not fall for the `Stop it; we don't like it' approach. If there is a problem, we can fix it. I do not care whether it is the bush, the very fast train project, or whatever. We should not dwell on the problems; we should dwell on the solutions and fix the problems. It is up to us to look after the solutions for the next generation. Does the Government have a plan? Where is Australia going? Is Australia an industrial society? Is it research based? Are we a pre-banana republic society? What are we? Like most Australians, I want to be told. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I recommend that Senator Archer go back to his science books for some further and better particulars about the functions of old growth forests and the contribution they and new growth forests make to the carbon dioxide problem. I want to address the subject matter of our matter of public importance this afternoon. I have considered it and I think I agree with its spirit but perhaps not exactly the form of words used to express it. I do not believe that the Government has entirely failed to comprehend the link between good environmental and good economic management; it just has not done enough about it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Actions, not words-or even major statements such as the greatest environmental policy that ever was-are the measures we should use to judge the Government's commitment. Whether the Government understands the linkage or not, some members of the Government certainly have a firm grip on the rhetoric of the subject. Just a few weeks after fulminating about the vile and insidious influence of the environmental movement on the Government's Coronation Hill decision-or rather, non-decision-the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Kerin) was using all the correct liturgical environmental phrases like `sustainable development'-as if anybody would ever advocate unsustainable development. He did this during relatively considered reflection on the relationship between development and environmental protection. However, I suspect that by `sustainable development' Mr Kerin might mean something different from what is meant by conservationists. Many different issues and problems are lumped together under the `environment' heading. We have heard about a number of them during this debate. These issues ought to be considered properly as belonging to different categories that demand different responses because they have different bearings on our economic management. They can be divided into global, national and local issues. I want to take examples from each. </PARA>
<PARA> The first is the big picture-the global problems. This category includes the global problems that are basically pollution effects from human activities, including the greenhouse effect and the problems with the ozone layer. The possible economic influence of these problems in the long term is incalculable but we seriously need to be able to calculate them and to adjust our behaviour to minimise the damage and perhaps to survive in the new environments that will be created. </PARA>
<PARA> Obviously Australia cannot solve these problems by itself but there is a need for Australia to take them seriously by collaborating in international efforts to solve them and also by identifying the impact of these problems on our local region. For instance, a lot of atmospheric testing is currently being done in the Northern Hemisphere but we must search for solutions to the possible greenhouse effects in the Southern Hemisphere. Predictably such research is concentrating on effects elsewhere and not enough is being done here in Australia, as Senator Coulter has already pointed out. </PARA>
<PARA> These headline threats are the most serious but there are many others. We are just beginning to realise how widespread the damage to the global environment is. The discovery a long time ago of high concentrations of dangerous synthetic chemicals in animals living in the Arctic and Antarctic regions reveals that we are messing up the whole planet. This does not primarily demand the allocation of blame, as we heard earlier in this debate. Yesterday's miracle product has turned out to be today's problem. This calls for a new approach which neither the Government nor the Opposition is able to develop adequately. </PARA>
<PARA> On the national level, more and more of our environmental problems are being thrown into the national basket and perceived to be the responsibility of the Federal Government. This is properly so. The States lack the resources, the competence or the necessary national perspective to solve some of these problems. Perhaps the most critical problems we presently have are coastal pollution and coastal erosion right around the country. Many decisions relating to these matters are left up to local government, and we know that there are serious problems with local government in some areas, particularly in New South Wales and particularly in the northern regions, although I do not believe the problems are restricted to those regions. </PARA>
<PARA> The Federal Government is also expected to provide the planning for the profitable and sustainable use of our resources, both our human resources and our natural resources. Up to a point, I sympathise with the Government. It is being pushed into the future at a pretty frightening pace-but so are we all. We must expect more from government than suggestions like Senator Richardson's that in the future we might have a referendum to see whether the people of Australia are willing to pay the price for a responsible and sustainable approach to the environment. Of course, a referendum is not necessary. </PARA>
<PARA> In fact, the legislation I introduced into this place a couple of weeks ago would certainly give the Federal Government the power to protect National Estate areas and perhaps, by doing so, it would also develop the willpower to provide some immediate solutions to alternative employment in those areas, particularly in the south-east of New South Wales. We must have better leadership than this at a critical time. Our leaders, including Senator Richardson, ought to be presenting well-developed long term plans to the electorate and not just making the passive and vague suggestions that they do. It is a lot to ask but we have to ask more of our governments these days. The days when we hoped to find sport rather than politics or economics on the front pages of our newspapers are well and truly past. </PARA>
<PARA> One aspect of our economy that troubles me is our continuing dependence on the export of unprocessed raw materials. It is also the feature of our economy that generates most conflicts over the balance between industry development and environmental protection. This dependence makes us very vulnerable to powerful buyers and unscrupulous competitors in the international marketplace and in the past we have lost out badly. We need only look at the prices that are paid for Australian coal and look at the effect of United States wheat subsidies on Australian wheat. Our exports, I believe, of the raw materials that we have in this country ought to be the cream of our economy and not our staple diet. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us look at the south-east forests as an example of a State issue that has been dumped into the national basket, particularly this year. Changing our whole economic structure is a very big task but there are some immediate areas where change in this direction is not only possible and desirable but also absolutely essential. I have said quite a bit about south-east forests in this chamber. In fact, just a couple of nights ago I spoke on the subject of future planning for the forestry industry in the south-east. It is a good example of an unsustainable approach to resource use. I cannot resist quoting, just one more time, the words of our eminent Senator Button, who described the woodchip business as a `bastard of an industry'. I know why Senator Button said that. It was because he understood that we were losing much of our unreplaceable natural resources and we were getting so little for them. I accept that the export of woodchip will continue, for a while at least. But we cannot afford to degrade permanently our native forests, especially for such meagre returns.</PARA>
<PARA> A better approach to this particular situation has become increasingly clear, largely because of the efforts of environmentalists opposed to the status quo. It is the underresourced environmental groups which have come up with the most wide-ranging solutions to the problems of jobs in the south-east region of New South Wales. I believe that they have developed a reasonable program and only the details need to be filled in. Everyone seems to agree that hardwood plantations are a good idea and that they should have been established some time ago. </PARA>
<PARA> In the event of the failure of the New South Wales Forrestry Commission to establish them, I believe that the Federal Government should make some genuine and immediate commitment in this area, instead of having more studies done. It is obvious, and has been obvious for quite some time, that value added timber processing industries will have to be established in this region if employment expectations are to be satisfied. I have said many times that it would be a very poor victory for the conservation movement if jobs have to be lost in the south-east region. That is not sustainable development. We cannot afford to protect our environment and have, at the same time, people who are out of jobs, who are facing mortgages and who have children to feed and educate. We need to have long term planning to ensure that we do not have this sort of conflict in the community, which is a conflict that only arises out of the short term opposition to jobs in the environment, industry and our natural resources. </PARA>
<PARA> Returning to another area, I believe that vital research is necessary for both environmental management and agricultural productivity and sustainability and this area is being neglected, although some money is being put into electorally fashionable areas. On this very interesting matter, shortly after the great environmental policy was put out Mr John Langmore on 31 August asked a question in the other place about programs in the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO). It seems to me that it is quite hypocritical for the Government to put out an environmental policy to get electoral kudos and votes out of that environmental policy when, at the same time, the CSIRO programs are being decimated. There are pages of this in Hansard. Many areas have been cut back or could not be fulfilled because of lack of money for our most important national research organisation. But here are some important research projects which have been curtailed or terminated. Cuts have had to be made in research into the ecology of native forests. This research is critical if we want to establish native hardwood plantations. At the moment, we have another rabbit plague but I find in the Hansard the answer:</PARA>
<PARA>All rabbit control research other than that funded by the Wool Corporation has been terminated. </PARA>
<PARA>Turning over the page, I find:</PARA>
<PARA>New important initiatives not begun</PARA>
<PARA> Developments, via molecular biological approaches, to induce sterility in wild rabbits, as an effective means of rabbit control-</PARA>
<PARA>not begun-</PARA>
<PARA>Developments in the work on distinguishing land degradation from natural change, and on erosion forecasting, are over two years behind-</PARA>
<PARA>not begun-</PARA>
<PARA>Research into how to prevent species lost in the remnant vegetation of the western wheat belt has had to ignore all of the insects, owing to the loss of scientists. </PARA>
<PARA>The two most eminent entomologists in the CSIRO have lost their jobs. This is a much under-rated area of research in Australia and yet it is vital to our agricultural industry; it is vital to our possible hardwood plantations. Yet how much of this has got into the media? Very little of it. </PARA>
<PARA> There is a different class of local problem that is represented by the dispute over the third runway which is proposed for the Sydney (Kingsford-Smith) Airport. The environmental degradation aspect here primarily affects the urban area and its residents. It is not a natural asset. Nonetheless, in view of the conservation moves by the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) into urban areas, I think that this is another typical example of the Government's hypocrisy. It recently paid $100,000 to the community groups which are opposing the third runway when it has the option of alleviating the problem immediately. The third runway is merely a stopgap measure. The Badgerys Creek proposal is something that I was writing about in a local paper 10 years ago. We may well blame previous governments, but this Government has been in office now for six years and has not done anything about it. </PARA>
<PARA> The reason that this is so important is that efficient transport facilities are necessary for long-term planning in this country. The failure of planning, as in this case, will result inevitably in the environment of Sydney being severely degraded through the noise pollution, the air pollution and, in addition, the safety problems over the city. I have no doubt that that $100,000 was given because-in view of the experience of the Balmain electorate in the State election-the Government may well be very worried about mass defections from the Labor Party if that third runway proposal goes ahead because of the numbers of people in those electorates who oppose it. </PARA>
<PARA> If we do not begin to restructure, to provide sustainable industries based on a minimum of irreplaceable resource consumption and a minimum of environmental degradation, we will not have a place among the truly developed nations of the future. The maintenance of our environment, the control of what we put into it and take out of it are not luxuries that we can indulge in. If we feel that we can afford it, it is fundamental to our long-term economic performance. I must say that I was surprised at Senator Richardson's stunning examples and I for one am not stunned. I am thinking of more recent examples such as the non-decision on Kakadu National Park. I have no doubt that if the Labor Party is returned to government mining will go ahead at Coronation Hill. The Opposition speakers have already referred to the indecision on pulp mills. Of course, we have the continuing open wound of the south-east forests. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Richardson warns against a Liberal government environment policies. I would have to agree with him because I find them to be rather confused. But this is no reason to become complacent about the Government's policy. It should not be forgotten that the Government's environment policy was drafted only after the Tasmanian election results. Those results stress the importance of having environmentally concerned parliamentary representatives who are free of the strictures of the major political parties. It is the presence of those representatives in Parliament that will not only remind governments of their environmental commitments but also be instrumental in strengthening those commitments which are the basis of preserving the environment, protecting and enhancing our quality of life, and encouraging industries which are genuinely sustainable. </PARA>

<PARA>As pointed out by my colleague Senator Puplick, the Opposition supports that view of the Government. I will just discuss briefly what I understood Senator Coulter to be saying.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="KI4">Senator PARER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Sustainable development is a term that is publicly accepted. I was defining it, but I will come to Senator Coulter's comments on growth in a minute when I touch on his comments. It was interesting to note the definitions given by various people. Brian Loton, Deputy Chairman and Managing Director of Broken Hill Proprietary Co. Ltd, stated in a recent address:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>The sciences, combined with application and enterprise, have done wonders to deliver high living standards based on expanding use of the world's mineral wealth. By this success, though, they have also raised weighty questions about the management of many side-effects and by-products of the increased tempo of human activity. </PARA>
<PARA> Knowledge hasn't stopped there. The same blend of science and reason is capable of giving solutions to the new generation of industry challenges, as much as to the old ones. </PARA>
<PARA>That basically supports the optimistic view that I and Senator Archer would take as compared to the modern Malthusians as represented by Senator Coulter. That is the full significance of the concept and objective of sustainable development. </PARA>
<PARA> Our Common Future, published in April 1987 and sometimes called the Brundtland report, is the most recent of a series of global environmental statements, which are widely accepted by all sections of the community. In the foreword there is this important statement:</PARA>
<PARA> Environment is where we all live and development is what we all do in attempting to improve our lot within that abode. The two are inseparable. </PARA>
<PARA>Our Common Future, the Brundtland report, follows the world conservation strategy, which identifies three prime issues: the maintenance of ecological processes and life support systems; the preservation of genetic diversity; and ensuring sustainable use of species and ecosystems. Brundtland suggests that sustainable development is another goal but further suggests that sustainable development is also a method for reaching the common goals of the Brundtland report and the world conservation strategy. </PARA>
<PARA> In the time I have left I will comment on some of the remarks made by previous speakers, particularly Senator Coulter. Senator Coulter made a point which I find incredible. He said that growth is making poverty in poorer countries worse. I think it is recognised that one of the great problems in the poor countries is lack of development. We do not have to look too far afield-bearing in mind that we in this country are very fortunate with what we have in our inherent wealth-to see that if we could get the sort of developments in those poorer countries that apply in the more developed countries, many of their problems would be solved. We have recent examples of this. There are countries in our own region, the South East Asia region, which but a decade ago were Third World countries but today have left this country behind. Good examples are Korea, Taiwan and, more recently, Thailand. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I agree. If I had time, I would debate that a bit further, too, because Senator Devereux made some remarkable statements about that. Senator Coulter also spoke of the greenhouse effect and of stopping carbon emissions, and so on. It is interesting that when we mention greenhouse-friendly options such as producing power from nuclear energy, the Democrats throw up their hands in horror and throw themselves to the ground. Senator Coulter also said that nuclear energy is not competitive. The question I would ask of Senator Coulter is: If nuclear energy is not competitive, why are countries going into nuclear energy? Again, the answer is very simple. With Australia's natural wealth, we tend to make those fine criticisms, but here are other countries that do not have the energy resources that we have and rely on imports to feed their power generation units to provide electricity for their people. They have to make a choice certainly on the capital cost of nuclear plants and other factors that can determine the ready supply of the cheapest electricity they can get.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The countries that have moved to nuclear generation are, in the main, those that do not have other resources. Good examples are Korea, Japan-both running at about 30 per cent generation from nuclear-and France, running at about 50 per cent, because of the high cost of its indigenous coals and the high cost of coals from other European countries. </PARA>

<PARA> Senator Richardson, when defending his Government in its handling of environmental matters, said that when hard decisions had to be made, the Government made them. What incredible nonsense! Sure, Senator Richardson makes a hard decision when it relates to a small number of people and where it does not affect in any way the political outcomes in a seat of government. But what about the fact that our roads are chock-a-block with semitrailers that go from Melbourne to Sydney and to Brisbane? Has the Government confronted the really hard decisions of coastal shipping and the waterfront? They are the decisions that count. It is absolutely obscene that it is cheaper and more effective, per unit, to move half a dozen motor vehicles on a semitrailer from Melbourne to Brisbane than to put them on a boat and take them up in maybe 100 or 200 lots. That is what we mean by hard decisions-which Senator Richardson will not and cannot confront. </PARA>

He puts all the problems of the world down to the fact that people need to make a profit to survive. What is forgotten is that the tax paid on those profits, whether by way of company tax or pay as you earn tax, enables government not only to function but also to exist and to provide roads, hospitals, power stations and all the other things that people need. Today there seems to be a political battle between the Australian Democrats and the Government to capture the minority lunatic fringe and not responsible conservationists.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-The statement Australia's Regional Security which I table today is a substantial document covering not only an analysis of the global and regional security environment, but also the formulation, implementation and presentation of Australia's policy responses. In these introductory comments, I intend only to highlight the statement's main themes, with particular emphasis on the multidimensional approach to security policy advocated in it. I should say at the outset that this statement was not motivated by any concern that Australia's strategic environment was deteriorating, or that we needed to revise the basic policy assumptions behind our regional security policies. Rather, it resulted from a prudent wish, at a time of rapid and fundamental change in the international and regional environment, to review our regional security interests and policies, and to set out in a comprehensive and integrated way our approach to the pursuit of those interests.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The overarching theme of the statement is that the most effective regional security policy is a multidimensional policy: one in which all the components of Australia's network of relations in the region-military and politico-military capability; diplomacy; economic links; assistance with development and so-called non-military threats; and the exchange of people and ideas-work together to help shape a security environment which is favourable to Australia's interests. </PARA>
<PARA> The statement acknowledges the very important contribution that an effective military capability makes to national security. But it also seeks to set defence policy in the wider context of Australia's regional relations, emphasising the way in which defence policy is both supportive of wider policy and in turn supported by it. Military capability is just one among many instruments of an effective security policy. The geographical scope of the statement encompasses the South Pacific, South East Asia, including Indo-China and Myanmar, and the eastern reaches of the Indian Ocean-essentially the same area described in the 1987 Defence White Paper as our region of primary strategic interest. </PARA>
<PARA> The maintenance of a positive security environment in our region, so defined, is only one of our overall foreign policy priorities. Other priorities include pursuing trade, investment, and economic cooperation, where North East Asia, North America and Europe are of major importance; contributing to global security, including through our alliance with the United States and our active involvement in multilateral disarmament negotiations; and playing our part as good international citizens in the resolution of global-scale problems from threats to the environment to human rights abuses. </PARA>
<PARA> Even within the field of security interests, the statement's regional focus does not imply that developments outside the region are marginal to Australian security. The avoidance of nuclear war, the security of the Persian Gulf, the conventional balance in Europe and the military balance in North Asia all have implications for Australian security. Moreover, in a world of extensive economic interdependence, the boundary lines between regions are increasingly blurred. South East Asia is becoming more and more integrated with the economies of North East Asia, vertically and horizontally, as the Asia-Pacific chain of development is pushed south. Australia itself is already closely tied economically with the dynamic economies of North East Asia. These are all trends which will become more pronounced over the 10 years-plus time span that the statement covers, and it would be unrealistic to expect that the strategic map of the region will somehow be insulated from this changing economic map. </PARA>
<PARA> Yet currently, and for the foreseeable future, the broad South East Asia South Pacific region remains the one which most influences Australia's immediate strategic environment. It is also the region in which Australia can exert influence on strategic issues in ways which are not open to us elsewhere. Within this region, Indonesia and Papua New Guinea are of particular importance because of the inescapable geographical reality that any military threat to Australia-unlikely though that currently is-would almost certainly be posed from or through our north. </PARA>
<PARA> The strategic analysis in the statement is set against the background of a rapidly changing global and regional environment. The international order crafted in the aftermath of the Second World War and sustained through the Cold War is drawing to an end. The flow-on effects of this period of transition are, in South East Asia and the South Pacific as elsewhere, far from clear. What is clear is that the equations of power in Europe and the Pacific are changing as the roles and capabilities of the two superpowers change, and the United States and Soviet Union are joined by Japan, the European Community, China and India as major global influences. </PARA>
<PARA> All these trends-and others such as economic globalisation-are likely to have implications for regional security. In particular, the point is made that it would not be wise to assume that the United States will continue to maintain its present level of security activity in this part of the world. The United States will want to continue to protect its major strategic interests in maritime passage through the region, and its current interest both in renegotiating the Philippines bases agreement and in developing modest military facilities in Singapore certainly shows that it wishes to maintain a presence in the region for the time being. But with the decline in ideological competition and other global and regional developments, United States attention on the region may well become over time increasingly less geopolitical and more oriented to its major economic interests. </PARA>
<PARA> Overall, the statement assesses the security picture in South East Asia as relatively favourable, with most of the countries in the region, for all their various internal problems, more likely than not to continue down the path of nation building based upon participation in the global economic system and a generally pro-Western foreign policy outlook. Indo-China appears to be the main exception, but even here there are signs evident of a more outward-looking economic orientation. </PARA>
<PARA> The South Pacific faces rather more problems. A number of the island nations confront economic, environmental, cultural and demographic pressures which will place increasing strain on their political systems. In view of its crucial strategic location for us, the course of Papua New Guinea's development will have particular significance for Australia's security, requiring a sustained and sensitive Australian policy response in the months and years ahead. None of this is to suggest that the South Pacific region as a whole is likely to pose major strategic problems for Australia over the next 10 years or so. But there is certainly the possibility that we will see over this period in some of the island nations a renewal or a continuation of many of the political tensions which have been evident over the last few years. </PARA>
<PARA> I should perhaps make the point that while New Zealand is geographically very much part of the South Pacific region, our diverse and close relationship with that country is not dealt with in any detail in the statement. New Zealand has a very special status for us, as an ally and closer economic relations partner, and in terms of the way in which we conduct our bilateral business and consult on wider issues. Thus, in the context of what is essentially an outward-looking statement, the discussion of the South Pacific focuses primarily not on New Zealand but on the other Forum countries. </PARA>
<PARA> The statement identifies seven areas around which Australia should build its multidimensional approach to regional security. First, there is the acquisition and maintenance-in line with current defence policy-of a military capability designed to deter, and if necessary defeat, aggression against our territory or maritime jurisdiction. This capability, based on the principles of self-reliance and defence in depth, should be seen as relevant not only to the defence of Australia, but also to the security of the region as a whole. Australia's possession of significant but non-aggressive military power contributes to the strategic stability of our neighbouring regions by providing a `secure south' for South East Asian countries, and a `secure west' for South Pacific nations. </PARA>
<PARA> Secondly, Australia should use its military assets and presence in the region to help foster the gradual development of a regional security community based on a sense of shared security interests: this is described in the statement as the exercise of politico-military capability. We should not be embarrassed about using the military capacity we possess, with prudence and sensitivity, to advance both Australia's security and the common security of the region. </PARA>
<PARA> The statement also addresses the sensitive and difficult question of the extent to which we should be able, and prepared, to use military force in pursuit of security interests going beyond the defence of Australian territory, noting that this is an issue which arises more in the South Pacific than the South East Asian context. It makes the point that the use of military force may conceivably be appropriate in unusual and extreme circumstances and that any such decision can be made only on a case by case basis, bearing in mind certain cumulative criteria which are canvassed. The statement explicitly rejects any notion of Australia claiming the role of regional arbiter of political legitimacy or moral acceptability. </PARA>
<PARA> Thirdly, we should use traditional diplomatic skills of persuasion to manage tensions and frictions, to ensure that small problems stay small, and to achieve accommodations of interests with mutual benefit. Diplomacy should also extend beyond the region itself to dialogue on regional security issues with those external actors capable of exercising influence within the region. The statement, here as elsewhere, carries some important implications for departmental resources, which I will be addressing within the context of our overall needs and priorities in the lead up to next year's Budget. </PARA>
<PARA> Fourthly, the statement emphasises the importance of trade and investment in creating more substantial and mutually beneficial links, especially in South East Asia, where economic complementaries offer a great deal of scope for expansion. We must devote a level of effort and resources to our current economic relationship with the region greater than its current relative economic importance might otherwise justify, bearing in mind that, in this region as elsewhere, our success will depend primarily on the success of our efforts to restructure the Australian economy into a strong and internationally competitive entity. We do not pretend that nations which trade together always stay together, but extensive economic linkages create mutual interests which can work to restrain any resort to military conflict. The Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) process, notwithstanding its exclusively economic focus and broader membership, is an excellent example of how new connections can be built up in the region. The Timor Gap Treaty with Indonesia, to be signed next week, is another example of a non-military solution to a problem that historically has often led to conflict-a disputed boundary involving prized resources. </PARA>
<PARA> Fifthly, development assistance programs can contribute to our national security interests in the region in a variety of ways: promoting economic and social development; reducing the political disaffection caused by economic deprivation; creating further economic linkages with Australia; and encouraging perceptions of Australia as a sensitive, practical and technologically competent neighbour. Sixthly, Australia can further demonstrate its neighbourly credentials by assisting regional countries with so-called `non-military threats' such as environmental degradation, acquired immune deficiency syndrome, narcotics trafficking and unregulated population flows, including the problem of refugees. Finally, there is scope for a great deal more to be done in the area of exchanges of people and ideas to reduce the cultural distance between Australia and the region and to overcome the significant image problem we still tend to have in South East Asia and the South Pacific. Mutual understanding, like all the other strands in this multidimensional approach, is no guarantee of peace. But mutual ignorance is a greater risk, and so-called `second track' diplomacy-seeking to get our message across through various non-governmental channels-has an important role to play in countering it. </PARA>
<PARA> The concluding section of the statement identifies some broad themes which should govern our approach to the formulation, implementation and presentation of all the different policy strands I have just outlined. We should recognise the impact on our wider security interests that a number of apparently non-security-related policies have, and give them greater emphasis, as a result, than they might otherwise get; we should develop policy responses with creativity, alert to opportunities for new agenda setting, and pursue them with discipline and persistence; and we should be sensitive to regional perceptions of us, and behave accordingly. In this last respect, the statement develops the point that we need to be aware of the extent of Australia's perceived `otherness'-our unique character and position as seen by our neighbours. Australia's history, cultural affiliations, values and traditions, ethnic makeup and the like do make us distinctly different from the countries of our immediate region other than New Zealand. Our `otherness' is not a constraint on our freedom of action, but does affect how we should exercise it. Thus, we should be conscious that in some contexts public and formal initiatives will be appropriate, but that in others the emphasis should be on informal and incremental activity. Particularly where there are political sensitivities involved, other governments may prefer discreet and gradual movement. While ambiguity and imprecision may not be viewed positively in the Australian cultural context, in other settings these attributes can usefully clothe initiatives and activities which would provoke opposition if starkly delineated. This point is particularly applicable to South East Asia. </PARA>
<PARA> Pulling all these policy responses and themes together, the statement suggests that our long term goal in South East Asia could best be described as `comprehensive engagement' with the countries of the region, while in the South Pacific we should continue with the policy of `constructive commitment', which I announced in September 1988 soon after assuming the foreign affairs and trade portfolio. In South East Asia our approach should be `comprehensive' in that there should be many elements in the relationship, and one of `engagement' because it implies a mutual commitment among equals. Security threats requiring a military response arise when there is a motivation, an intention to do something about it, and the capability to do it. If we develop a substantial and mutually beneficial range of linkages with our regional neighbours, the motivation and intention to threaten us will simply not arise. Moreover, the linkages will do more than save us from threats; they will become networks of connective tissue, binding together us and our neighbours in a strong regional partnership, with a sense of regional commonality of interest. </PARA>
<PARA> The essential elements of `comprehensive engagement' can be described as building a more diverse and substantive array of linkages with the countries of South East Asia so that they have an important national interest in the maintenance of a positive relationship with Australia; continuing to support the major existing regional association, the Association of South East Asian Nations, and working with the countries of the region to shape additional regional organisations or arrangements, such as APEC, which can contribute to the social and economic evolution of the region; participating actively in the gradual development of a regional security community based on a sense of shared security interests; working for the involvement of Vietnam, Cambodia, Laos and Myanmar in the cooperative framework of regional affairs; and recognising that Australia, in vigorously pursuing its national interests in the region, should do so as a confident and natural partner in a common neighbourhood of remarkable diversity, rather than as a cultural misfit trapped by geography. </PARA>
<PARA> In the South Pacific we are already pursuing a policy of `constructive commitment'. By this we mean essentially that, notwithstanding our greater size and economic capacity, we want to approach the region within a framework of regional partnership, not dominance-not regarding the South Pacific as our sphere of influence but as a region of mutually reinforcing opportunity. The essential elements of `constructive commitment' are described in the statement as the promotion of close, confident and broadly based relations with all Pacific island countries on a basis which recognises their individual differences; fostering effective regional cooperation, through the South Pacific Forum and its agencies, and the South Pacific Commission; recognition that for the island countries security hinges on economic and social development, and offering assistance to help them achieve both; respect for the full sovereignty of the island states in relation to both their internal and external affairs; but, at the same time, promotion of shared perceptions of the region's strategic and security interests, laying the basis for a regional approach to situations, internal or external, which put regional stability at risk. </PARA>
<PARA> The overall prospects for our regional security environment are positive, but there are also many uncertainties and, undoubtedly, many surprises in store for us. We cannot assume that in the next 10 years or so states in the region or outside it will not use military power and influence to achieve goals contrary to our security interests. For Australia, the essential fact is that we are dealing with a more fluid and complex region and that in doing so we will be required to be much more the master of our own fate than we have been prepared to accept until recently. </PARA>
<PARA> In the 1950s, the 1960s, and during some of the 1970s, Australia tended to perceive the relevance of South East Asia and the South Pacific to our security largely in military terms. We now have the capacity to reinforce our national security by utilising the many dimensions of our external policies in an informed, coordinated and vigorous way to participate in the shaping of the regional environment. It is very much in our interests to be seen as a significant partner to the region, an accepted and natural participant in regional affairs. Effectively implemented and properly explained, the multidimensional approach to regional security advocated in the statement is the best way of maintaining our national security into the next century. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the statement. </PARA>
<PARA>We are pleased that Senator Gareth Evans has finally put down in the Parliament a statement on some issues of foreign policy. Under Senator Gareth Evans, the Parliament has been given little courtesy in terms of enunciation of the Government's foreign policy directions, and that is a matter of regret. Senator Evans could have taken a lesson from his predecessor, who was much more willing to put down positions and have them debated in the Parliament. Having got the statement finally, we regret that it is so shallow. Clearly, it has been produced for propaganda purposes rather than for substantive debate, as is demonstrated by the fact that it is filled with photos of Messrs Hawke, Beazley and Duffy, Senator Evans, who gets eight photos, and Senator Cook-all, of course, doing important things with important people. </PARA>
<PARA> The statement is entitled `Australia's Regional Security'. Its thesis is that protection requires more than a sound military and that it can be contributed to by government diplomacy, education, cultural contacts, tourism, visitor programs and the like. In other words, security is multidimensional. What an amazing revelation! I remember the report of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade of eight years ago entitled Threats to Australia stressing that point. I am sure that those in this chamber who go back further than I do will remember that this stating of the obvious has been said many times before. </PARA>
<PARA> There is a rumour that the report was written personally by Senator Evans. We on this side of the chamber hope that is so because, if it is the sum total of months of work by the Departments of Defence and Foreign Affairs and Trade, our problems are more serious than we first realised. It has certainly been tarted up for the media. Our relationship with South East Asia is comprehensive engagement; our relationship with the South Pacific constructive commitment. We suggest that this jargonising is a poor substitute for serious policy contribution. </PARA>
<PARA> I would argue that Australian foreign policy terms under this Government have become more irrelevant, particularly as our economic position has declined. There is little recognition in this paper that our principle role in the eyes of Asia remains as a supplier of raw materials to north Asia, particularly Japan, Korea and Taiwan, from which those countries then build wealth. Our economic relevance to South East Asia is low and decreasing. Had that, and how we can together build an economic future to mutual advantage, been the thesis of this paper, I respectfully suggest that it would have been a more worthwhile contribution. We are now reminiscent of so many Third World countries that have little economic clout. We are boasting of our military power as giving us status. What a sad day. </PARA>
<PARA> In my view paragraph 72 of the paper reflects a new low in Australian diplomacy. We once boasted of our democratic traditions and our liberal values. For a while we could talk about our considerable economic achievements. Now our national status is linked to our significant military power. That could be another debate in itself. That reminds us of the genesis of this paper, which was a series of press articles in June this year headed `How bomber Beazley blitzed Bill Hayden' or, in other words, how we came to have a defence driven policy in this nation. </PARA>
<PARA> The statement delivered today was to be the answer to foreign affairs, demonstrating that our influence is based on much more than defence policy, and that it fails to do. We can no longer look at our own region-the expression used in the paper-in such limited terms. The world has become too integrated. If we are to look at the region which most directly affects us, we must include Japan, Korea, China and Taiwan-four of our largest trading partners. If we accept that argument, we cannot look at protecting Australia's security without, for example, addressing the issue of China's future economic and political stability; the issue of Taiwan; the issue of Hong Kong in the lead up to 1997 and afterwards; the issue of the two Koreas with the suggestion that we heard in this chamber this week of North Korea seeking nuclear weapons; and so on. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not think that we can look at Australia's security interests for the future without addressing the complex and changing en- vironment in south Asia. All of these major security issues are either avoided altogether or touched upon in a most superficial way in this document. China gets one paragraph which, in itself, condemns this statement. China has an influence in practically every key issue of the region. One need only think of Cambodia, of relations with Indonesia, India and so forth. </PARA>
<PARA> I am also appalled at the down playing of Japan's future significance in this document. I refer to paragraph 19. The West has consistently underestimated the capacity and determination of the Japanese people since the Meiji restoration at the start of this century. It seems that the Australian Government, so far as Senator Evans is concerned, is still doing so. To argue, as this document does, that Japan cannot achieve great power status because it is resource poor is to resort to an argument which was outdated a generation ago. In this information age, real wealth and power does not come from being blessed by nature. In the future the major Japanese plants will not even be located in Japan, but the wealth will be transferred home. This degree of naivety would be amusing were it not so serious. </PARA>
<PARA> I guess that we should at least be gracious enough to acknowledge the endorsement of our cautious policy in relation to the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR). Honourable senators will remember this Government bagging that policy, when we put out our statement, as continuing the cold war. Now we find that it maintains the same reservations itself. There is also an implied acceptance of the limitations of Australia's capacity to influence and, therefore, a recognition that there needs to be a greater concentration of effort. It is about time that this air of reality was recognised by the Government in our foreign policy. Again, I commend the Government for listening to us in this regard. Whilst it is very idealistic to talk about a goal of our foreign policy as the cause of good international citizenship, every other country of the world puts its own interests first. We suggest that it is time to become a little more hard-nosed about what is in Australia's best interests. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us have a look at South East Asia, which is the focus of this Government paper. We will start with Cambodia. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Gareth Evans interjecting-</PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="BH4">Senator HILL</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I gave the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade the courtesy of listening to him; I suggest that he do the same. Cambodia, a country suffering the continuing misery of people continuing to be killed each day, hardly rates a mention. That challenge in which regional and wider diplomacy continues to fail is avoided in this statement. Why? No doubt because of the differences between Senator Evans and the Association of South East Asian Nations (ASEAN). A week ago without warning or advice from his Department but under great pressure from within Caucus-I congratulate Senator Schacht-Senator Evans ditched the ASEAN position and adopted a more domestically appealing position, previously advocated by Congressman Solarz with whom Senator Evans seems to have struck up a mutual admiration society.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The thesis of working with other states in the region, which Senator Evans emphasises in this document, to achieve a common goal is abandoned at a hint of domestic pressure-of course, on the eve of a Federal election. What does that tell our regional friends about the way Australia develops its foreign policy? One day in the United Nations Australia is part of an international consensus as to the best chance of achieving peace in Indo-China; the next day, without negotiation, without consultation, that policy is ditched. So the Khmer Rouge communists, supported by China, and the Hun Sen communists supported by the Soviet Union continue to fight it out and the position of countries such as Thailand, trying so hard to force the four Khmer factions together to some accommodation, is undermined. The change, when it comes down to it, is really in any event cosmetic. Even Senator Evans ought to be gracious enough to admit that there will not be a cease-fire and an interim United Nations administration in Cambodia without the agreement and support of the Khmer Rouge-no matter how much all of us might regret it. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me move on to Myanmar, formerly Burma. This does not receive a paragraph, or even a full line, in the statement. Why not? Because to date Australia has got it all wrong and criticisms such as that from Garry Woodard, a former Australian diplomat, have been highly embarrassing to this Government. At the time that Senator Evans was standing up in the Parliament saying that the election program was on track in Myanmar, the Myanmar regime was setting up martial law courts, cutting telephone and other links and arresting Opposition leaders. Through poor intelligence or poor interpretation, the Hawke Government was the first to resume aid after last year's massacre of students and workers. Why? Senator Evans has said that it was `in order to ensure for technical reasons that a major earlier funding program would not be wasted'. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us move to Vietnam. Senator Evans sees great hope, great economic opportunity, in Vietnam. He has said that Australia under Labor has made a considerable investment in Vietnam. So why is there so little mention of it in this document? Perhaps it is because Vietnam has not learned the lesson that it is impossible to liberalise economically yet maintain a hardline communist regime. Impoverished Vietnam, in its United Nations speech this year, condemned the reforms that are taking place in eastern Europe. In this conundrum it seems to Senator Evans that the best option is to avoid the difficult issue of Vietnam; so there was no mention of it. </PARA>
<PARA> The Philippines also demonstrates the fragility of democracy in this region of the world, where President Aquino is being battered not only by the continuing communist insurgency but also by disloyalty and insurrection within her own defence forces. This statement does not mention the continuing economic pain in the Philippines and the frustrated expectations that are being experienced in that country. Where does this sad picture fit into Australia's security interests in the region? Honourable senators will not find the answer in this statement on Australia's security interests. </PARA>
<PARA> As time is against us, I will move briefly from South East Asia to the South Pacific. I commend to any serious student of this subject the recent report of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade on relations with the South Pacific because it contains a much more useful account of the difficulties facing that region than does this statement. Of course, the South Pacific has been an area of great failure by this Government. We read Senator Evans's comments about constructive commitment, but then ask, `What has changed?'. It is hard to find significant changes. Fiji remains a dilemma. It still does not have a constitution. Elections are not expected for another two years. Colonel Rabuka has still not returned to the barracks. Will the policy of stand-off be maintained for another two years? Honourable senators will not find the answer in this document. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us move to the difficulties facing Papua New Guinea (PNG), which are at least recognised in this document. The difficulties are recognised, but there is no policy prescription. Rather, in a comforting way, Senator Evans said:</PARA>
<PARA> In the months and years ahead detailed attention will need to be paid to the country's needs and problems. </PARA>
<PARA>That is a disappointing contribution set in the background of the recent high profile public dispute between Senator Evans and Mr Beazley-of course, won by Mr Beazley in support of the Jenkins thesis-over the supply of helicopters to PNG. There is a serious debate here. Recently at the Australian National University General Gration quoted an American leader:</PARA>
<PARA> If your neighbour's house is on fire, you lend him your hose. </PARA>
<PARA>But later, in answering questions, he said:</PARA>
<PARA>Australia is not the South Pacific's policeman. </PARA>
<PARA>So it seems that this important debate is too complicated or too difficult for a paper such as this. Again, I am pleased to be able to say that the Joint Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade Committee is at least taking the function of government in this area and looking at a detailed analysis of relations between Australia and Papua New Guinea and how we might assist that country in the difficult years that lie ahead. As the only politician from this place who has visited Bougainville since the mine ceased operation due to the local insurgency, I for one know the urgency of looking seriously for ways in which we can be of help to PNG. </PARA>
<PARA> New Zealand is dismissed in a paragraph in the statement. It was obviously an oversight because it was picked up in the oral contribution by Senator Evans today. It seems that the Australian Government has abandoned hope of New Zealand's again accepting a wider defence responsibility. I guess that is said by Senator Evans as a result of Australian Labor's and New Zealand Labor's fraternal relationships. It is all very negative and very disappointing. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me move briefly to what this paper was to be about, that is, justifying the Government's performance in areas other than defence as contributing to Australia's security in the region. On the subject of diplomacy, we are told that our foreign service assets are under severe strain. That reflects Government priorities. What we have witnessed is a mass exodus of experienced officers from the Department, with little effort to stop the haemorrhaging. We have seen serious management problems and a lack of political leadership. The officers are professional and will respond to policy directions if they know what the policies are. A week or two ago Ambassador Butler in Thailand was advocating a step by step partial settlement for Cambodia because he was unsure of the Government's position. Ambassador Flood was recently confused by some of Senator Cook's pronouncements which caused some difficulty. Ambassador Sadlier in China was unsure whether it was in Government policy that he should attend the national day fireworks display. Their confusion is quite understandable. </PARA>
<PARA> Human rights are mentioned in this document, but I regret that my observation of this Government is that it is more willing to criticise human rights abuses further afield, such as in Central America. We did not hear the condemnation of abuses in Tibet or in Myanmar that we should expect from the Australian Government. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us move to the importance that this document places, not surprisingly, on personal relationships at government level. I suggest that another lesson from the experiences in China should have been that Australia had to develop international relations of greater substances and depth than the personal relationships of the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) with other national leaders. The Government says that we may need to reinforce our diplomatic assets in the South Pacific. That should have been a lesson from the events in Fiji in 1986. By now the gaps should have been filled. The Government has been in office for some six years. </PARA>
<PARA> The economy does get a mention. This part, which should be the key to the multidimensional approach to security, is particularly shallow, as I indicated earlier. There was obviously no business input to this document, which is the same criticism we have heard from business in relation to the recent Asia-Pacific economic cooperation (APEC) conference. Of course, Government knows better. I would like to ask business for a definition of `Greenfields' trade that is referred to or to tell me how they are being helped by the Ministerial Group on Coordination of Bilateral Trade Issues. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister mentions bilateral civil aviation. That surprises me. With the mess that the Government has got itself into over the Taiwan-Australia direct air link, I would have thought that that subject would have been avoided. More than any other part, this section dealing with economic relationships demonstrates a government out of touch. On the subject of development assistance, I simply remind the Government that it cut aid to the South Pacific in the last Budget. </PARA>
<PARA> Cultural diplomacy is commended in this document. But our contribution to cultural diplomacy is negligible. It is almost too embarrassing to mention, being $2.2m to the Australian Abroad program out of a foreign affairs vote of about $1.5 billion, compared with the efforts of France, the Soviet Union, Japan and so on. We have never appreciated-certainly this Government does not appreciate-the role that culture can play in extending our influence. The Minister mentions education. I am glad that he at least recognises that we cannot afford a repetition of the recent English language intensive courses for the overseas students debacle in Shanghai. There was no option but to get the Chinese Government offside in the post-Tiananmen environment. But now we have the Chinese people offside as well. We took their applications, which required them first to resign their jobs. We took their money and then we changed the criteria. It has been a sad chapter of Australia's international relations at the people to people level, and it still has not been fully written. </PARA>
<PARA> In the time remaining, I want to look at some of the issues that should have been included in a document of this type, which has been styled in the terms given it by the Minister. There are at least three areas of change likely to pose major challenges for the region and for Australia. They are the power relationships in North and South East Asia, economic growth and trade relations and the impact of economic change on political stability and institutions. </PARA>
<PARA> Looking briefly at the power relationships, the Asia-Pacific region will continue to have a major potential for interstate conflicts and regional instability. The recent improvement in superpower relationships is not likely to alleviate these problems decisively. The recent distinct improvement in relations between the superpowers-the United States and the USSR-has primarily revolved around and been influenced by developments in Europe. They are not directly or easily transferable into the Asian region. In Europe there has been a pattern of conflict revolving around two major players, the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation and the Warsaw Pact, and there had already been major attempts to stabilise their relations well before the Gorbachev era-for example, the Helsinki accords. In Asia, there is a multi-polar power disposition and there has not been any agreed framework for promoting stability in regional power relations. </PARA>
<PARA> The USSR and Japan have remained in a stand-off, without a peace treaty and with ongoing disagreements over the northern islands. There are several major Asian powers with significant strength and which exist and operate either largely or completely independently of the superpowers, especially China, North Korea and, in South Asia, India. Several of the regional powers have policies and approaches which are to a degree unpredictable. China has a rising military capability-and these are some of the issues which the Minister should have addressed-but faces serious political and economic problems post-Tiananmen. China has in the past shown a willingness to use force to assert its national interest-for example, against Vietnam in 1979, in the South China Sea in 1974 and 1988 and in Tibet-which is so often overlooked by this Government. India has in recent years shown a tendency towards intervention in South Asia and has rapidly built up its navy. There is also potential for nuclear competition with Pakistan, although their bilateral relations have improved since the change of government in Pakistan. </PARA>
<PARA> There is considerable potential for conflict in the Asia-Pacific region in the 1990s. Although the Cold War started in Europe and is now being seemingly decisively eased there, Asia has been left with some of the most intractable legacies of that period. For example, there is still an unresolved conflict between China and Taiwan, and China would be most reluctant to accept any move by Taiwan to assert a long term independence if a Taiwan, post-KMT, government tried to pursue this. The Koreans are still in a state of Cold War hostility and confrontation which I mentioned a moment ago. As I also mentioned a moment ago, Cambodia remains racked by conflict between the four Khmer factions and ultimately between China and Vietnam. </PARA>
<PARA> As economic prosperity and growth produces stronger economies and enhanced military potential, the prospect of force being used in regional conflicts may well rise. This growth can fuel not only long term `Cold War' foci for conflict, but also conflicts over access to resources such as those in the South China Sea. </PARA>
<PARA> Looking briefly at the challenges that might be ahead in an uncertain economic environment, if an unsuccessful Uruguay round is an ultimate result there is the suggestion of a differing relationship between the newly industrialised economics of North Asia and those not as industrialised in South East Asia-a new level of challenge. There is the effect of the US-Japanese economic relationship and the strains that it is presently going through. I might say that Japan is asserting its position with some vigour. There is the advent of the European Community's single market and the opening up of a number of eastern European states to trade and investment which will add a new foci for economic activity and possibly new sources of competition for markets and investment. The APEC process-which we have supported-if it can be sustained, will obviously continue to be particularly important. </PARA>
<PARA> I will now look at how these changes in economic relationships may affect political and institutional stability. The states of the region have major problems in adapting to the political implications of economic growth and change. In some countries there have been clear signs that rapid economic growth and change can outrun capacities to institutionalise demands for political participation and reform. There is now automatic process by which economic growth can be accompanied by a transition to more pluralist and democratic political processes. It has occurred in some countries in the region-and Thailand is a good example-but most countries are facing major problems in coping with the political fruits of economic growth. </PARA>
<PARA> Several of the most successful east Asian economies face sensitive periods of trying to pursue more pluralist paths-for example, Taiwan and South Korea. In a number of countries, a particular problem is posed by the growth of labour movements demanding a greater share of the fruits of export-produced economic growth. Peaceful and orderly leadership transition is another major ongoing problem. Several important states have yet to demonstrate a capacity for orderly replacement of leaders with widespread popular participation. The serious coup attempt in the Philippines, that I mentioned a moment ago, which has taken place less than three years after the constitutions in some regional states. One can add to this complexity the situation of the Asia-Pacific communist states where there are major issues of political stability as their economic positions evolve. </PARA>
<PARA> As I indicated, most of the communist states of eastern Europe have been prepared to recognise that they cannot achieve economic liberalisation without political liberalisation and political reform. So far, the communist states of Asia have rejected the possibility of major political change that would allow the dominant role of the party to be seriously challenged. China, of course, tried to pursue economic reforms while blocking political change. Vietnam has so far rejected the prospect of major political change. North Korea remains isolated. A key issue for regional stability will be whether the Asian communist regimes can pursue a process of productive economic and political liberalisation that would enable them to participate confidently and capably in the region's economic growth. </PARA>
<PARA> So the picture is much more complicated and much more challenging than this Government would have us believe. It is a matter of great regret to those on this side of the chamber that the Government has avoided in its rather simplistic statement today all of these difficult issues and, therefore, has not made a contribution of any great substance to any important debate on Australia's regional security. It reinforces the impression that this Government has failed in this vital area and that should be something of concern to all Australians. </PARA>

<PARA> It is not my intention to respond to all of the points raised by the Minister in his statement, or to engage in a bulletin-style exercise such as Senator Hill has just done. I want to concentrate my remarks on what I see as the important aspects of the paper and the recommendations arising from it. First, the Democrats accept the Minister's acknowledgment that this statement was not motivated by any concern that Australia's strategic environment was deteriorating. While there have been developments over the last few months in our region that are a cause of concern for any liberal, democratic country-notably, the continuing problems in Bougainville and the recent events in the Philippines-Australia's broad strategic environment is a stable one. </PARA>
<PARA> Given that assessment, however, what has occurred in respect of Australia's new militarism is of great concern to the Democrats and, I think, to the international community. The recent AIDEX arms exhibition in Canberra, which was the largest such exhibition every held in the southern hemisphere, and which was supported by the Government, represents an alarming trend towards the promotion of military exports by Australia. I want to put on record how strongly the Democrats are opposed to these types of developments. Indeed, the Labor Government has come under strong criticism for fostering what I think many people see-and certainly we do-as an aggressive military build-up and for allowing its relationships with regional peoples and governments to be driven by the Department of Defence and not by the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade. </PARA>
<PARA> In particular, the 1987 Defence White Paper, followed by the regional statement by the Minister for Defence, Mr Beazley, in February last year, has set the tone for the recent rise in military activity by the Australian defence forces in the South Pacific and South East Asia. The former head of the Foreign Affairs Department, Stuart Harris, wrote in a recent letter to the Independent Monthly that the Defence Department did not consult Foreign Affairs in producing the White Paper. Yet the White Paper heralded the largest defence capital investment in Australia's peace time history. It set the scene for a drive to double Australia's arms exports, mainly to South East Asia, and for a revitalisation of the five-power defence agreement, linking Australia to the defence of Malaysia and Singapore. </PARA>
<PARA> Australia's naval defence in the region has grown markedly, as has our military aid to the South Pacific states. A major campaign to convince the New Zealand Government to buy four of the so-called Anzac frigates has been waged against the wishes of 70 to 75 per cent of New Zealanders. Most of all, Australia's military forces have been mobilised to intervene during internal upheavals in the South Pacific states with the stated aim of rescuing Australian tourists. Consequently, Australia's military activities have provoked a great deal of criticism and uncertainty in neighbouring countries. Officials from South Pacific states recently told a Canberra seminar of their fears of military intervention by Australia. Strong criticism has been directed by prominent Papua New Guineans at the donation of the Iroquois helicopters to the Papua New Guinean Government's bloody campaign to reopen the Bougainville copper mine. There is serious dissatisfaction in most levels in New Zealand society about the Australian Government's role in the frigates decision. </PARA>
<PARA> It is clear that there is a substantial body of opinion in the Indonesian elite which is wary of Australia's military intentions. One can only guess what the Vietnamese Government thinks about last year's five-power air exercise against the Soviet base at Cam Ranh Bay, an exercise which was commended by a Royal Australian Air Force officer. Clearly the Defence Department and the Defence Minister have had a profound effect on our regional relations. Yet this paper is the first attempt by the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade to cobble together a synthesis linking military issues with wider security concerns. </PARA>
<PARA> Before dealing with the contents of the paper, some comments about process surely are in order. In most areas of government policy, formal public consultation is the norm. Examples abound in the areas of health, education, the environment, industrial development, industrial relations, the law, the economy and so on, but not in the matters of national or regional security or defence. The winds of democracy are not to be felt in these areas. This paper repeats the formula of presenting a document which has received no formal public input and which will be subject to no formal public inquiry. This is an outmoded, outdated and discredited method of policy development. Above all, it is profoundly undemocratic in an area of vital concern. There seems little doubt that this document is more an attempt to hose down mounting criticism than to foster a widely supported and carefully crafted policy based in the community. </PARA>
<PARA> As for the contents of the document, the mere fact that non-military dimensions of national and regional security have been acknowledged and addressed is something of a breakthrough. Having said that, the way they have been addressed and the priority they have been accorded leave a lot to be desired. On reading the document, one is struck by the over-emphasis on the importance of Australia's military contribution to national and regional security. It is a scandalous misappropriation of resources. The Kangaroo 89 exercise, a military exercise predicated on a threat which realistically could be posed only be Indonesia, was funded to the tune of $230m, while the Australia-Indonesia Institute, which could very well help to create a climate where such conflict could be easily avoided, receives $700,000-$700,000 for the peaceful linking of our countries compared with $230m for the continuation of outmoded military exercises. This imbalance surely is reflected in this paper, which puts our military capacity at the top of the list of Australia's policy responses to our regional security environment, while human rights, development assistance and the responses aimed at so-called other non-military threats are relegated to the bottom. </PARA>
<PARA> Much more emphasis in this document should have been given to people's diplomacy, yet the people's diplomacy that is talked about is through naval ships visiting the South Pacific rather than more effective and peaceful alternatives. What sort of neighbour are we when we regard machines of war as important symbols of friendship? Of course, nothing is said about conventional arms control. </PARA>
<PARA> The document acknowledges that the prospect of a reduced United States military presence in the region would leave a vacuum which states like India, China and Japan might seek to fill. Yet no criticism is offered of the rise in those nations' military capacities, particularly those of India and Japan. No concrete proposal is made to fill the vacuum with non-military security arrangements of the kind that are being developed in Europe. It is assumed that the United States has a natural right to obtain military facilities in Singapore, for example. The dilemma for the Government is that Australia's own military build-up is in conflict with any attempt to curb regional arms build-ups. Our support for United States global military deployments makes it difficult, if not impossible, to criticise other large powers who are developing similar types of ambitions. </PARA>
<PARA> A much more aggressive approach to regional arms limitation is needed, backed up by restraint on Australia's part. This document dismally fails to meet that need. It does not challenge the notion that Australia has a natural right to send its military forces into South Pacific states to rescue tourists or to prop up governments. The use of the military for this purpose is confined to small states with limited defence capacities. When Australia's tourists were threatened during the Beijing massacre, the Government sent in Qantas to rescue them, not the Army or the Navy. Civilian means should be used for tourist rescue, not military means, which carry a clear implication of intervention. After all, a document drawn up by officers in the Fiji military forces and recently leaked to the media indicated that they would have treated the landing of Australian troops as intervention. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister's statement identifies seven areas around which Australia should build its multidimensional approach to regional security. I wish to look now at area No. 5, regional development assistance programs. The Minister in his tabling statement, as distinct from the document itself, said that development assistance programs can:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . contribute to our national security interests in the region in a variety of ways: promoting economic and social development; reducing the political disaffection caused by economic deprivation; creating further economic linkages with Australia; and encouraging perceptions of Australia as a sensitive, practical and technological competent neighbour. </PARA>
<PARA>The Democrats certainly welcome this recognition that foreign aid, as it is more colloquially known, is one of the major elements of Australia's broad foreign policy agenda. </PARA>
<PARA> For a more concrete example of the importance of foreign aid in the overall context of our national policy, I will refer to figures in the 1989-90 Budget. An examination of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade budget reveals that by far the largest amount is directed towards international aid. Of the total 1989-90 Foreign Affairs and Trade budget of $1,563m, some $1,125m, or 72 per cent, is devoted to the foreign aid component. The vast majority of this total foreign aid is administered by the Australian International Development Assistance Bureau (AIDAB), which reports directly to the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade. For a country of Australia's size and status, the judicious distribution of the aid budget provides the best means of achieving many of Australia's major foreign aid policy goals-such as the achievement and advancement of Australia's national interests and the promotion of peace and stability in our region. They are not promoted by touring warships. </PARA>
<PARA> Since the Australian Labor Party (ALP) took office in 1983, official development assistance has slipped alarmingly. The ratio of Australia's overseas development assistance to our gross national product has fallen from 0.51 per cent in 1983, under a conservative government, to 0.33 per cent in the 1989-90 Budget. This is historically Australia's lowest aid contribution for many decades. As a donor nation, Australia is roughly in the middle of organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development nations. However, we are well below the United Nations recommended figure of 0.7 per cent of GNP. The Government is also providing less than the level preferred by the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade-0.4 per cent of GNP for official development assistance (ODA). The Australian Council for Overseas Aid Organisations (ACFOA), Australia's peak body involved in non-government aid organisations, in its submission to the Government's Expenditure Review Committee earlier this year, recommended a rise to 0.4 per cent of GNP. ACFOA issued a strong statement after its annual conference in August saying that:</PARA>
<PARA>the continued reduction in overseas aid makes Australia appear selfish and unconcerned about the immense poverty and suffering in the region. </PARA>
<PARA>The Government has made it clear that within difficult economic circumstances, the aid budget has had to suffer. It has fallen victim to the hard heads and economic rationalists that rule the roost in the ALP Caucus and Cabinet. The aid budget is a soft target and has suffered disproportionately against other government outlays. As a senior AIDAB official mildly put it, over the past decade, Australian overseas aid expenditures have been `subject to very tight constraints'-so tight in fact that:</PARA>
<PARA>while total government expenditures have risen by over 70 per cent since 1972 in real terms, overseas aid expenditures (again in real terms) have not risen at all. </PARA>
<PARA>Against this background, the Democrats believe that the Opposition would certainly do better than the Government. That is, they would reduce the aid budget further. It is the only area where they would probably do better. As part of the Liberal-National Party economic policy launch in the latter part of this year, the conservatives announced they would slash the total aid budget by another $100m. A recent departmental review found that the effect of the Opposition's proposals would be a cut of $200m in the aid budget. Not surprisingly, Senator Hill, who had the audacity to talk about aid, has been reluctant to say where the money is going to come from. He is probably thinking that if he gets into the job he is not going to have much difficulty with the electorate, but he will have enormous difficulty explaining to recipients who will have to lose out. </PARA>
<PARA> The massive cuts in the Labor Party Budget and those foreshadowed by the conservative Opposition go firmly against the advice of experts within and outside government with regard to the type of support that our foreign policy needs in this area. The all-party Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade, which Senator Hill quoted from on a number of times in his speech, in its very thorough report on a review of AIDAB and Australia's overseas aid programs recommended:</PARA>
<PARA>by 1992 Australian aid should once again stand at 0.5 per cent of GNP. </PARA>
<PARA>That was one of the items not quoted by Senator Hill. The Committee commented that Australia's adherence to the 0.7 per cent ODA-GNP target was in danger of becoming `purely rhetorical'. As part of the high profile One World Campaign, ACFOA has called on the Government to restore Australian aid to proper standards. I put on the record again the Australian Democrats' policy which calls for an immediate rise in the aid budget to 0.1 per cent of GNP. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is 0.1 per cent of GNP immediately. While that is a large figure compared to that currently being given by the Government, it is well to bear in mind that small northern European countries have been able to provide this level of expenditure for many years. Australian can and should do likewise.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As well as increasing the aid budget, there is a strong case for improving the quality of the aid which the Minister's statement refers to. In fact there are economic, humanitarian, environmental and political reasons for providing more development assistance, and improving the quality of that assistance to South-East Asia and the South Pacific. The influential report of the World Commission of Environment and Development, Our Common Future, highlighted the complexity of world poverty issues. It argues that the issues of human and economic development, environmental quality and natural resource husbandry are highly interdependent. The matter of public importance that we debated this afternoon was directed to that proposition. Sound development requires a sound environmental and strong natural resource base; an unhealthy environment and resource depletion ensures poor development. The Commission found that:</PARA>
<PARA>aid from donor nations has not only been inadequate in scale but too often has reflected the priorities of the nations giving the aid, rather than the needs of the recipients. </PARA>
<PARA>The Commission offers a blunt message to aid donor nations and multilateral aid organisations both in terms of the quantity and quality of this aid. Unfortunately, the Government has not registered that warning. For example, it is stated on page 32 of the ministerial statement:</PARA>
<PARA>we need to be attuned to the possibility of adjustments in the balance and content of our own (aid) programs in order to better serve our interests. </PARA>
<PARA>Surely it is time to recognise, first and foremost, what development aid is about. There has been some recognition of this complex relationship between aid development, poverty, the environment and Third World debt. There needs to be far greater focus on it in terms of the future. Not surprisingly, some sceptics have argued that the Government's recent interest in environmental concerns in the domestic and international arena have been as a result of a reaction to popular opinion. A recent survey found that 80 per cent of voters said the economy was a very important issue in determining how they would vote. Seventy-one per cent of them also said that the environment was a very important issue. </PARA>
<PARA> Foreign aid is particularly relevant in our own Asia-Pacific basin region. Australia is a very large power in the region and a wealthy neighbour to some of the poorest people in the world. While the benefits to Australia's foreign relations and strategic interests of providing aid are not readily quantifiable, development assistance supports the broader diplomatic strategies. For example, the continuing focus on the developing nations of our region is an expression of Australia's more general commitment, in foreign policy terms, to its developing neighbours. Australia is a very large supporter of Papua New Guinea and the Pacific nations. Some 33 per cent of our total overseas aid budget goes to Papua New Guinea and the South Pacific region, as it should. </PARA>
<PARA> Australia's official aid organisation, AIDAB, cites the capacity of aid to underscore Australia's stance on a number of foreign policy issues. A specific example is increased development assistance to the nations of southern Africa-the so-called front-line states to South Africa. AIDAB also identifies the special role which aid can play through international organisations. It states:</PARA>
<PARA> Australia's reputation as a compassionate nation, and our international bona fides were enhanced by increased allocations to for example UN relief in Palestine and other emergency relief in Africa. </PARA>
<PARA>Australia's own region poses many challenges for development assistance. There can be a high degree of complementarity in foreign affairs and humanitarian motivations. For this reason the regional focus of Australian aid should and must be maintained. </PARA>
<PARA> I wish to comment on one specific item, Australia's aid to Cambodia and Vietnam in the light of the Government's policy of comprehensive engagement in the South East Asia region. In light of recent developments in that region, the Democrats believe that the Government should now be looking at resuming official development assistance to Cambodia and Vietnam. We are very concerned about recent developments in Cambodia, particularly the internal fighting which has flared up since the withdrawal of Vietnamese troops in September. While we support any Australian move to assist in bringing a lasting and just peace to Cambodia, we had reservations about the Government's policy with regard to the involvement of the four major factions, particularly with regard to the inclusion of the Khmer Rouge in any transitional regime in Cambodia. </PARA>
<PARA> The Democrats are also opposed to the current representation of Cambodia in the United Nations by a member of the Khmer Rouge faction, which does not legitimately represent the aspirations of the Cambodian people. However, on 24 November the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade announced the Government's altered policy stance. It holds out a very real and concrete proposal for the establishment of a United Nations transitional administration in Cambodia. We believe that this is an excellent proposal that ought to have the support of all Australians. We see that it has merit not only in terms of the United Nations, but also because it removes any necessity for a role for the Khmer Rouge. Cambodia is one of the poorest countries in the world and clearly warrants the resumption of Australia's bilateral humanitarian and developmental assistance. </PARA>
<PARA> The public supports this exercise. A recent Australian National University survey found that three out of four Australians either approve or strongly approve of Australia providing foreign aid. Against this, only 11 per cent disapprove or strongly disapprove. While 45 per cent of respondents rated the nuclear arms race as the most serious issue facing the world, 41 per cent rated hunger as the most serious issue. Adding together those who thought an issue most serious and those who rated it in the second category of priority, that is, very serious, hunger scored highest at 78 per cent, followed by the nuclear arms race with a score of 71 per cent and disease with a score of 70 per cent. Poverty and lack of economic development rated 68 per cent. Unfortunately, politicians too often ignore the fact that the Australian population is aware of and knowledgeable about the importance of our support to other peoples in the world. I hope that Australia's humanitarian assistance, which has been so much a feature of our efforts in the past, can be brought back into focus and again be seen as a major element in our relationships with other countries. </PARA>
<PARA> Today we are talking about foreign affairs, about our relationships with other countries in the world. When one realises that 20 per cent of the world's population is living in dire poverty and when a report on the state of the world's children is about to be launched in Parliament House, one must be aware that the increase in poverty and disease among the poorer sections of the community, amongst children, breeds unrest and tension. Recently, a liberation has taken place within the Warsaw Pact countries. The freedom of people in those countries to determine their own affairs is very important for Australia and the world. However, there is a tendency to ignore the fact that while that change takes place, other people are bound in chains which are far more tight and vicious than those of the regimes that operated in eastern Europe. I refer to the chains of dire poverty and imminent death. </PARA>
<PARA> The fact that the Government has been able to reduce its donations and its development assistance and the parties purporting to be an alternative government are talking about reducing assistance by another $100m does not spread any lustre on Australia; indeed, in the eyes of most it would be seen to be our weak link. If we link that with the increased expenditure on military operations, we see that our foreign affairs are in difficulty. They need more than a statement to resurrect them; they need a change of policy, a change of emphasis, and ultimately they probably need a change of heart. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to speak briefly on the ministerial statement relating to regional security. First, I support the thrust of the document. Senator Gareth Evans has tabled in the Parliament an important document that adds further explanation to the Australian Government's foreign policy and defence policies. Above all else, the document brings together the thrust of both areas of policy in a way which is comprehensible. Some people will criticise the statement for placing too much emphasis on defence; others will criticise it for placing too much emphasis on the diplomatic. I believe it achieves a reasonable balance.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Some people will criticise, in particular, the defence expenditure of the Government. When Bill Hayden was the Minister for Foreign Affairs, at a national conference of the Labor Party he told people who were critical of our defence expenditure that the very same people were supportive of Australia having an independent foreign policy. He said, `You cannot have an independent foreign policy with a pacifist defence policy'. I think that is a truism in this document. There is reasonable defence expenditure. We spend about 2.3 per cent of gross domestic product (GDP) on defence. It is by no means excessive by any comparison with what countries in our region and elsewhere in the Western world spend. The Australian public believes such a level of defence spending is necessary for the security of the country and our neighbours overwhelmingly accept that level as reasonable. Nobody is running around our region or the world saying that Australia is a militaristic country because it spends 2.3 per cent of GDP on defence. Some countries are spending a lot less; that is their decision. Many countries who are our allies spend a lot more and sometimes make criticisms that they spend more, so other countries spend less. I believe we have the balance about right in Australia between what we spend on defence and what we spend on foreign affairs. I admit a prejudice-if one could call it that-in that I would like to see Australia spend a lot more on foreign aid. However, I note that the Australian Democrats said that their position is to spend one per cent of gross domestic product. That would mean that, instead of spending $1,100m a year, we would be spending about $3.3 billion a year. I would like to hear from the Democrats the sort of timescale in which they want to see that sort of expenditure increase implemented. There is no way that the Australian Development Assistance Bureau (AIDAB), our overseas aid agency, could at present soak up or digest that amount of money without there being extraordinary waste. Unless these targets, though commendable in the theoretical, are put down on paper and it is explained that they are to be implemented over a long period of time, we will end up having a more disastrous overseas aid policy even though we are supposedly spending more. </PARA>
<PARA> If one wants to see an example, have a look at what the Japanese have done in the Pacific region and South East Asia. They have suddenly increased massively the overseas aid development. Those of us who toured the South Pacific last year as part of the Joint Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade Committee saw a number of examples of where Japan has poured money into these small countries which has basically been wasted. I suppose the most famous of all is the Tonga Cultural Centre-a $6m building that the Tongans cannot afford to run because the air-conditioning and electricity expenses are too big a drain on their budget. Though I, like many people in the community, want to see more aid spent, I do not want to take the Democrats' position that it is just one per cent and away we go. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to return to the remarks made by the shadow Minister for foreign affairs, Senator Hill. In my view, his remarks were a potpourri of picking here and there, but contained no comprehensive statement of what the foreign policy would be of the coalition in government. It went all over the place of individual criticism. It is very easy in foreign affairs to make individual criticisms about what is happening in various parts of the world. For a coalition that ruled in Australia for 30 of the the last 40 years and had a foreign policy of utter obsequiousness to the United States, one would have to say that it is very hard for our side of politics to take seriously its criticism that Australian foreign policy at the moment is not being effective.</PARA>
<PARA> I want to turn to three specific areas that Senator Hill mentioned where I think he was just wrong. They are Cambodia, Myanmar and the South Pacific. First of all, Cambodia: I, like many people in the community, have an interest in Cambodia. I had the good fortune to visit Cambodia last year and have followed the affairs of that country with considerable interest. I do not claim to be an expert on Cambodia. I think anybody outside of Cambodia who claims to be an expert is deluding himself. Trying to get a resolution of the Cambodian situation really is a most complex political problem. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Evans announced, only 10 days ago, that Australian would support a comprehensive settlement whereby the United Nations would take over the running of the country in a similar way to the Namibia peace process. United Nations public servants, possibly 200 or 300, would be put into Cambodia to oversee the administration of the country pending free and fair elections. That would mean that none of the four factions, including the Hun Sen Government, would have absolute control in the running of the affairs of that country. The big advantage of it for most of us is that it would exclude the Khmer Rouge from having a role in an interim government. I do not think any reasonable person in Australia would agree to that. </PARA>
<PARA> In saying that, I have to point out to Senator Hill that in the last few months the Opposition has had a number of positions on Cambodia that are quite confusing. First of all, Mr Spender, when he was shadow Minister earlier that year, said that there should be no role for the Khmer Rouge at all in Cambodia in a peace settlement. Then only about 3 1/2 to four weeks ago, I think it was, there was a statement from Mr Peacock which said that the coalition supported a comprehensive settlement and an interim government in which all the factions would be represented, and that included the Khmer Rouge. That was the position 3 1/2 weeks ago. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I must admit, Senator Hill, that that was our position two weeks ago. The coalition had that position 3 1/2 weeks ago, which was contradictory to Mr Spender's position of earlier this year. Then finally, only last week, I think because of embarrassment that the Liberal Party is seen as taking a policy of supporting the Khmer Rouge being in the interim government, we have Mr Peacock supporting an international tribunal on war crimes to have the Pol Pot clique from the Khmer Rouge tried. This is something that Bill Hayden supported, I think, three to four years ago.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I find it interesting that when Bill Hayden, in the mid-1980s, was attempting to find a settlement to the Cambodian impasse he was roundly criticised and abused by the Opposition for deluding himself. One of the things he said at the time was that there should be an international tribunal on the war crimes of Pol Pot and his clique. Now, four years later, Andrew Peacock suddenly announces that that is the Liberal Party's position. The Opposition has no comprehensive or credible policy on Cambodia. It does not understand the situation in Cambodia. It makes no attempt to understand it and it jumps all around the place. I would hope that the initiative taken by Senator Evans, and this Government, in the last 10 days leads to success. I must say, in view of Senator Hill's interjections that, since Senator Evans made his announcement there has been no public criticism, no major criticism of any of the major players on the Cambodian issue. China has made no public statement criticising the proposal. The initiative has been well received in a number of quarters. It may not work. Anybody who can predict what is going to work in Cambodia is, as I say, deluding himself. It is quite clear that what Senator Evans has put down on behalf of the Australian Government has been well received both in a number of countries in the Association of South East Asian Nations and with the other major powers--</PARA>

I believe Senator Hill's criticism of this area of the statement, and of Senator Evans, just does not hold water.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Myanmar is the next area that Senator Hill criticised. It is an area that I do feel I have some knowledge of, but I do not claim to be an expert. Senator Hill said Australia was the first to restart aid to Myanmar. That is just not correct. The first country was Japan. The only aid program we started, or restarted, in Myanmar was the famous, or infamous-whichever way one likes to put it-Mandalay dairy project. Guess who put the Mandalay dairy project into Myanmar? It was the coalition, when in government. When it cut off aid to Vietnam it was left with a dairy factory that could not go to Vietnam, so it plonked it into Burma. It is one of the aid programs that any aid agency, or any aid expert, would say would never be done again because it was starting off from scratch without the infrastructure. </PARA>
<PARA> I fully supported Senator Evans restarting that program earlier this year, because when I was in Burma in February I saw the factory. I saw the equipment which Australian taxpayers have paid for sitting in the yard rusting, being inappropriately put together and going to be destroyed through misuse. If we had stopped there, with no technical experts, we would have wasted $3m or $4m of taxpayers' money. Guess who would have been the first ones in the Estimates committee to complain about the loss of taxpayers' money. Members of the Liberal Party would have said, `You've wasted all of this money'. All we did was restart the program so that the material and equipment already there could be put to use without loss to the Australian taxpayer. No aid program has been restarted in Myanmar other than that one. </PARA>
<PARA> Members of the Burmese community to whom I have spoken, in this country, in Thailand and in Burma, did not see the restarting of the Mandalay dairy project as being a breakout from the isolation imposed by other Western countries. One person, Aung San Suu Kyi, who is now under detention, put criticisms to me, and I said I thought that Australian taxpayers would not put up with having several million dollars of their funds wasted on equipment lying in a paddock outside the half-assembled factory, going to rust. I must admit that she did not say that I had convinced her, but she did take the point that it would be a problem for Australian taxpayers and probably for the Australian Auditor-General. </PARA>
<PARA> The final area I want to mention is the South Pacific. Senator Evans has quite appropriately divided the report into two sections dealing with our policy towards South East Asia: `comprehensive engagement'-and I have dealt with a couple of related areas-and `constructive commitment' in the South Pacific. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Australia was not involved in the negotiations, but I think Australia's position was overwhelmingly vindicated because a constructive policy was put forward by the French Government which we can fully support and which substantially reduced tension in the communities, despite the tragic assassination of Jean-Marie Tjibaou earlier this year. In the end the Rocard Government adopted a policy that shows a constructive way out of the morass of New Caledonia and its colonialist history. That was in line with what this Government has been arguing for several years. I know that Senator Hill has held a similar view, but most members of his Party have not held a similar view about how to handle the situation in New Caledonia. This constructive commitment has worked and we have now made arrangements with the French Government to start an aid program in New Caledonia. French officials from New Caledonia have visited this country, as have Kanaks, to start a dialogue with what I hope by 1998 will be a new independent country in the region and one of our closest neighbours. That is just one area in which we have had a constructive commitment to the South Pacific, which has worked.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In regard to our aid program in the South Pacific there are areas which can be criticised regarding money being misspent. Since AIDAB has been rebuilt and reformed, since the report of the Jackson Committee to Review the Australian Overseas Aid Program, in 1984-85, the delivery of appropriate aid to those countries has been significantly improved. The aid is now more in tune with what those countries need. Although we would all like to see more aid being given, the aid being given to these countries is being digested into those countries' own systems. I believe that in this area alone the present Federal Government can take some credit for the reforms of AIDAB. I congratulate AIDAB and its officers on its country program in the South Pacific. </PARA>
<PARA> I know that many other senators want to speak in this debate. I believe that the document tabled by Senator Evans is a very constructive one and provides a further stone or plank in the overall development under this Government of an independent foreign policy and a self-reliant defence policy in our region that have substance and political will, and which will work, unlike the rambling and episodic comments made by the shadow Minister when he replied to the statement earlier today. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Senate is debating a very peculiar statement entitled Australia's Regional Security. One cannot really work out why it has been made. The best thing one can say about it is that it is better than the long, rather rambling foreign policy statements that Senator Gareth Evans has made in recent months in answer to dorothy dixers in Question Time, because they cannot be debated. At least this statement can be debated. One must ask why it was made and why by Senator Evans, the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade. Essentially, it is about defence. One suspects that the reason that the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade has made this statement is that it is a counterclaim to the allegations that the Minister for Defence, Mr Beazley, has been making foreign policy, particularly in the South Pacific area. I suppose that the Senate has to put up with claims and counterclaims by two rival Ministers in the Hawke Cabinet, but it seems a peculiar basis on which a statement on defence policy should be made in this chamber. Surely it should have been made by the Minister representing the Minister for Defence.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As I said, it is essentially a very peculiar document. It seems to be a collection of former press releases cobbled together to make a supposedly new statement. It also seems to be, as I said, a propaganda campaign by the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade against the Minister for Defence in what is essentially a defence area. For instance, in the document there are eight photographs of the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade and two of the Minister for Defence-a ratio of 4 : 1 in favour of the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade. It seems a rather petty basis on which to make what is supposed to be a serious statement about Australia's regional defence problems. </PARA>
<PARA> The statement is disappointing. I think the way in which to sum it up would be to refer to what is alleged to have been said about someone's essay on one occasion. The supervisor said to the student, `In your paper there is much that is good and much that is new'. As the student was preening himself, the supervisor said, `What is new is not good and what is good is not new'. I am afraid that is the way in which I would sum up this document, except to say that there is very little new in it. It is only a cobbling together of old press releases to make this very disappointing statement. </PARA>
<PARA> We are living in an extremely turbulent era. No-one knows what the outcome will be. I was recently a delegate-until I was recalled rather peremptorily to preside over the Senate in a debate on the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission Bill-at a meeting of the North Atlantic Assembly. There were two guest speakers before this body. The two guest speakers were the American Commander-in-Chief of the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation, General Galvin, and the Russian Chief of Staff of the Warsaw Pact, General Lobov. They spoke jointly and severally to that meeting and answered questions asked of the delegates. That would have been inconceivable until two years ago. Extraordinary changes are taking place. That does not mean to say that we can predict what is going on. I attended that meeting in October, just a few weeks ago, and no-one there would have predicted the events that have occurred in East Germany. Everybody thought that East Germany would be the last hold-out of the rigid communist doctrine. I think they underestimated the effect of television beamed from West Germany into East Germany on the East German population. Nevertheless, they knew about it; they did not assess it correctly. On an issue with which they were familiar, they did not get it right. It is so difficult to predict events, and that is what one must always remember: things change, both for the better and for the worse, with astonishing rapidity. If we look at Australia, say, in the depths of the Depression in 1931, who would have assessed then that in 10 years Australia would be at war with Germany, Italy and Japan? I suggest that if anyone had said that in 1931 they would have been regarded as insane. It is so difficult to predict in this turbulent world-and we are living in a particularly turbulent era-but the signs appear to be very favourable, much better than they have for many years. Nevertheless, we must remember the very great difficulty of long term projections. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Hill interjecting-</PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4H4">Senator HAMER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, of course the turbulence of this type has not yet hit Asia. North Korea, which might be regarded as the East Germany of Asia, is still locked into a rigid dictatorial communist regime. China seems to have taken the path away from liberalisation. As I discussed earlier, the problems of the ex-French colonies of Indo-China are certainly very far from solved. The point I am trying to make is that in defence preparations, which are inevitably long term, both in personnel and equipment, one must be aware that rapid changes, both for better and worse, are possible. One must not assume long term predictions when such predictions are inherently fallible. I would like to point out that in this document which, as I have said, appears to be a cobbled together collection of press handouts, there are some very curious omissions. For instance, much of what it says about India I would agree with. The paper says:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Its already significant military capabilities, which make it the predominant power in South Asia, will be followed by increasing strategic reach, including into South East Asia. It sees itself as a great power and a major actor on the global scene. </PARA>
<PARA>I would agree with that. It goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . its power projection capabilities are growing. </PARA>
<PARA>It finishes by saying:</PARA>
<PARA> The increases in India's military capabilities appear to be motivated by preoccupations in its immediate region and considerations of prestige, rather than by a desire to intervene out-of-area. </PARA>
<PARA>I think that is true, although, one of the dangers of having a capability is that people may use it unexpectedly. Perhaps, the Argentine invasion of the Falkland Islands is an example of that. Argentina had the capability and unexpectedly used it, taking people by surprise. What is so curious, and I am dealing with omissions in this paper, is that the Government and the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, or both, do not seem to be aware that there has been a change of government in India. The direction that has been going on with the expansion of the Indian Navy may not be continued by the new Government. I do not know and I am certain that the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade does not know. It seems extraordinary that in a statement of this nature it does not point out that the Congress Party, which has been in power almost continuously since independence, has been defeated. There has been a change of government in India and that may well mean a change of direction. It is not mentioned in this paper which is supposed to deal with our regional security. </PARA>
<PARA> Another curious omission is that Mr Gorbachev, just a few months ago, made a series of disarmament proposals, one of which was that there should be a zone of peace in the Indian Ocean. That is now on the table. There are many arguments as to whether it would or would not be in the interests of the littoral states of the Indian Ocean, including Australia. There is no mention of that in this document, which is meant to be discussing Australia's regional security. The proposal has to come to a head, I would think, in the next few months. </PARA>
<PARA> New Zealand has always been a close ally of Australia. We are involved very much together. It is dealt with in six lines on page 11. There is no mention in this paper of the South Pacific nuclear free zone or what its advantages are. I, of course, am an opponent of it, but one at least would think that it would be mentioned in a paper purporting to discuss Australia's regional security. </PARA>
<PARA> ANZUS, I would have thought a central core of our defence policy, receives seven lines on page 15. ANZUS is a vital treaty for us. People misunderstand it by thinking that it is a guarantee of American support which it most certainly is not. America, if we are ever threatened, will come to our aid if it thinks it is in its strategic interests to do so which, if we think about it, would be absurd on any other basis. The advantage of the ANZUS Treaty to us is not that. It is that it allows our forces to be compatible, interoperable with the American forces so that if they came to our aid they would be effective. When America came to our aid in 1942 there was no common communication system, no common tactical system, no common ammunition or logistics. It took a very long time-over a year-before we could really operate together. At least ANZUS assures that if the United States comes to our assistance, it will be immediately effective. Of course, ANZUS, with the exchange of intelligence, which is of enormous importance to a country like Australia with small forces and vast distances, is of inestimable value, enabling us to link into the American logistics network. This saves us billions of dollars. It has been assessed-I think accurately-that if we did not have the ANZUS Treaty to provide our present modest defence capability we would have to double the defence vote. It receives seven lines on page 15 in this paper which talks about Australia's regional security. </PARA>
<PARA> Indonesia is dismissed in the most cursory way. I do not want to get into the subject of where particular threats to Australia might come from. Senator Macklin, I think rather unfortunately, raised this issue. I do not see any threat from Indonesia, certainly in current times. Nevertheless, looking at the long term security of Australia, our territorial integrity cannot be threatened while the Indonesian archipelago is firmly held in friendly hands. It must be an overriding purpose of our defence and foreign policy to ensure that the Indonesian archipelago is held in friendly hands. That, surely, is central to our long term strategic security. It is not discussed at all in this paper about Australia's regional security. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4H4">Senator HAMER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Of course I have read it. It is not discussed in any sensible way. I would like to turn to the section on Australia's military power. I agree with what it says. It states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Australia's national defence policy is genuinely defensive: we harbour no aggressive intentions towards any other nation. Our military capability, while substantial in regional terms, is not based on the need for comprehensive power projection within our region, but rather on what is required to defeat aggression against our territory or maritime jurisdiction. </PARA>
<PARA> The foundation of Australia's defence planning is self reliance . . . </PARA>
<PARA>In the remainder of time available to me I would like to concentrate on this aspect of defence because I agree with what is said there. I agree with many things this Government has done about defence. I agree with the emphasis on self-reliance. I have been arguing for it, both inside the Defence Force and in this Parliament now for 30 years. The days in which we were regarded as mere contributors to an alliance were, in my view, disastrous for coherent defence planning. The problem was that we, as minor contributors to allied forces, had no real guidance to structure our own Defence Force. In many key areas we assumed that these capabilities would be performed by someone else. </PARA>
<PARA> I will give one example. In 1975, when we were still responsible for the defence of the internal security of Papua New Guinea, there was, as there is now, an attempted secession movement in Bougainville. The Chiefs of Staff in 1975 were then asked, if necessary, whether it would be possible for us to put a battalion, for security purposes, into Bougainville. The Chiefs of Staff said, `Well, yes, but you understand that we have no amphibious assault capabilities'. We assumed that would be provided by the Americans. `We have no airborne assault capability'. We assumed that would be provided by the Americans. `We could only get a battalion into Bougainville if the airfield were firmly held in friendly hands'. That was an example of the very great difficulty we had if we wanted to pursue a national objective and if we were a member of an alliance and we were only partly self-supporting. Therefore, I agree very strongly with the concept, as I have always expressed it, that we must structure our Defence Force around the things we might have to do on our own. It should be so designed, organised and equipped so that it can operate with allied forces if something beyond our own capability to deal with, on our own, arises. That is, in my view, the importance of the ANZUS alliance. That aspect of interoperability has been, to some extent, neglected. The neglect is reflected in this paper. ANZUS is mentioned on seven lines and New Zealand on six lines in a long report. </PARA>
<PARA> I also agree with many of the equipment decisions that have been made, though I have some doubts about the selection of the Swedish submarine which was a very expensive program. I do not think that was costed correctly. There may well be very serious cost overruns with that project. The danger of that is that, in a limited defence vote, cost overruns and capital equipment have to come out of other capital equipment we need or, as has happened under this Government, out of the pay and conditions of servicemen. </PARA>
<PARA> We have serious equipment shortfalls at the moment. We have no airborne early warning capability. Our in-flight refuelling capability is derisory. We have what is charmingly described in the paper as only limited amphibious troop lift capacity. I would modify that to say that we have no useful amphibious lift capability. That weakness is a very serious one in our area. We have serious equipment defects, and cost overruns in existing projects would eat into our ability to deal with these in the near future. But I agree with the equipment decisions that have been made. </PARA>
<PARA> I also agree in part with the reorganisation that is going on in the Department of Defence. It has been a very unsatisfactory department in the past. As organised under the so-called Tange reforms, it was made into a confrontationist establishment-servicemen against public servants. It was a very unsatisfactory environment from which to get sensible decisions. It is gradually changing. I am very pleased to see that the planning for each element of the Defence Force-the Navy, the Army and the Air Force-is being taken over and coordinated centrally under the Chief of the Defence Force. That was vital. As was going on before, there was a confrontation atmosphere within the three Services-not looking at what was needed for an effective Australian Defence Force but at what was best for their own separate service. That, I hope, will be ended. </PARA>
<PARA> There has been some timid move towards reducing the gross overbearing of senior officers, but regrettably the fundamental cause of this has not been tackled. What has built up in recent years is an extraordinary overbearing of senior officers. I have the figures here for the end of last year. In the Navy there were 13 admirals and 30 commodores; in the Army, 16 generals and 49 brigadiers; and, in the Air Force, 14 air marshals and 34 air commodores. That is absurd in relation to the scale of our forces. The reason this happened is that, when the Defence Department was integrated, public servants were given quasi-military rank. It was said that a lowly assistant secretary was the equivalent of a one-star officer-a brigadier; a first assistant secretary was the equivalent of a major-general; a deputy secretary was the equivalent of a lieutenant-general; and so on. </PARA>
<PARA> The problem was that, having done that and then requiring comparable ranks in all the multitude of committees that the Defence Department had, there was an explosion of these ranks. The Navy, for instance, fought the Second World War with 40,000 men, including three admirals and four commodores. It now has 15,000 men, 13 admirals and 30 commodores. One might think that that does not matter much but if there are only a limited number of operational jobs, there are a very large number of senior officers with no recent operational experience and no expectation of getting any. That makes for a very inefficient defence force. </PARA>
<PARA> There has been a move now to reduce the number of senior officers by 20 per cent and make a comparable reduction in the number of senior public servants. That is good. But the cause of the problem-that is, the improper linkage between service rank and public servants-has not been removed. While that remains there will always be a gross overbearing of senior military officers who will be unable to achieve and receive adequate operational experience. As I have said, that makes for a very poor defence force. </PARA>
<PARA> There are some aspects of what is going on in the defence area that I would disagree with. In order to pay for the new capital equipment, with a limited defence vote of roughly 2.3 per cent of gross domestic product, other areas are cut back. The areas that have been cut back on are in the supply support of the Defence Force-the amount of ammunition that can be fired and the amount of training that can be done. Soldiers in the operational deployment force in Townsville, which is a key deployment force, spend $400 of their own money in order to buy satisfactory backpacks. They cannot get satisfactory backpacks out of the service machine. Their snipers are buying their own rifles because the service ones are not satisfactory. The training command has no slouch hats for new recruits. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It was boots not long ago. These will not destroy our Defence Force, but they are indications of an attitude which permeates the morale of the Defence Force. If members of the Defence Force feel that they are being undersupplied or ignored in this way what happens is that they vote with their feet; they do not re-engage. We have to remember that the training of a private soldier costs $50,000: it costs $50,000 to train a single soldier. It costs several million dollars to train an airman-a pilot. We are penny-wise and pound-foolish-these days I ought to say `cent-wise and dollar-foolish'-if we do not give these people proper equipment, proper pay and proper support, because otherwise they go somewhere else where they are more accepted and rewarded. The losers will be the Government and the country-in the efficiency of the Defence Force-as will be the defence vote, because it costs so much to train their replacements.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This personnel wastage is the biggest problem we have. It is extraordinary, in view of the level of unemployment, that there is so much personnel wastage. We have to tackle this problem. The Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade has made some recommendations on this. It will have to make many more because the matter is not being seriously tackled. One of the most important statements put down, a very fine one made by Senator Newman-I will not go through it in detail-made recommendations and promises in our defence science and personnel policy to tackle the problems of pay and allowances, Defence Force retirement benefits, to get a better career path for our servicemen and to tackle the very serious problems of accommodation both for single servicemen and married people. It promised that we would look at the problems of removals, personnel support services and family support services. </PARA>
<PARA> If we want to keep a high morale, efficient Defence Force, we have to stop this appalling wastage which very seriously lowers the efficiency of our Defence Force. If we want to stop those things we have to tackle them. As I have explained, I agree with quite a lot of the things Mr Beazley has done, but he seems bemused by capital equipment and finds the problems of the people who are going to man, operate and direct this equipment of no interest to him. That is a very serious shortcoming in our defence preparedness and one which the incoming government will have to tackle urgently. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I find it appalling that, despite the assertion that the statement of the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade (Senator Gareth Evans) has been delivered in a bid to counter suggestions that foreign policy is being subordinated to military planning, all we have is a document which proves that that is exactly the case. Military aspects totally dominate this paper. There are 7 1/2 pages on the military and only 1 1/2 pages on diplomacy and two pages on aid programs. Military aspects come through at every point. It is depressingly obvious that what we have here is a defence-driven foreign policy.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In his lecture at the Australian National University on 6 December 1988, reprinted by the Australian Fabian Society this year, the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade stated that in a very real sense the Hawke Government's defence policy had once and for all liberated Australian foreign policy. What absurd nonsense. What on earth did he mean by liberation? Did he mean liberation from the straitjacket of subservience to willing, grovelling subservience? Foreign policy should be decided before defence policy makes its demands, sets its parameters, limits the boundaries of the operation of our foreign affairs policies. Neighbours, alliances, methodology for peace-building, all need to be identified before defence planners go to their drawing boards. </PARA>
<PARA> Defence agreements with the United States of America absolutely and utterly underpin our foreign policy and constrain Australia's role in the region. In this statement we have what some of us have come to refer to as dual rhetoric because it represents the confusion over which direction Australia should be moving in. In the Ray Milne lecture given in April 1989 the Minister referred to the significance of the North-South divide, but he has become trapped between his own inclinations and the old fears of his advisers and their controllers in the United States, who are living out the last days of the Cold War which has so dominated their lives. The Cold War is over and we now have the spectacle of the military desperately looking for a threat to justify Australia's largest peacetime capital expenditure build-up: that is, $25 billion over 15 years. In fact, Australia might well be defined as a country that has always been looking for a threat. As the Minister for Defence (Mr Beazley) aptly put it to an American journalist four years ago:</PARA>
<PARA>I have $6.3 billion in search of a threat. </PARA>
<PARA>The new line is that the Asia-West Pacific region is unstable, that new middle ranking powers such as Japan, China and India are emerging as military forces to be contended with, and that Australia must get into the game. The new strategy is regional forward defence as the United States seeks to persuade its allies of the need for burden-sharing to take the financial load off its shoulders. The US has suffered the cost of being the world's global policeman, and its own people are saying, `No more'. The result is this new strategy of self-reliance within ANZUS which is a contradiction in itself, and a continuing high level of military expenditure which is no more justified than the coastal fortifications that we constructed in Australia to ward off the French and the Russians in the nineteenth century. </PARA>
<PARA> We cannot seem to shake off this appalling dependence on a great and powerful friend, despite the Minister's unconvincing rhetoric that Australian foreign policy has been liberated. That is a very bad joke. We now find ourselves like someone doing the splits, torn between the reality of where we are in the world, which the Minister recognises, and our total inability to make a break with the past. Australia is like a child who is unable to leave home, even though he has grown up and should have gone out into the world on his own long ago. The dual rhetoric says that we belong to the Asia-Pacific region, that we should improve our understanding of the region, that we should learn Asian languages, and that we should promote trade and investment to develop a more integrated regional economy. The Minister talks of the exchange of people and ideas. That is excellent. I applaud this recognition. Yet at the same time we are told that the threat comes from this same region, although we are never told which countries it might come from or why. </PARA>
<PARA> Where foreign policy is not defence-driven it is trade-driven-opportunities for Australians to extract dollars from our neighbours rather than any altruistic motivation. The latest `opportunity' is the Timor Gap Treaty, which will be ratified soon, in mid-air I believe, between Australia and Indonesia. The Timorese, who could justifiably claim to own the resources, were not consulted. Maybe that is why the meeting is being conducted in mid-air. The parties cannot quite decide whose territory is involved. </PARA>
<PARA> Embarrassingly, development assistance is given two pages in this 46-page document. Perhaps it is just too embarrassing to talk about, seeing that Australia's contribution to foreign aid is dropping year by year and is currently less than half the United Nations recommended level of 0.7 per cent of gross national product. Australia is in the category of the meanies. Where is our generosity of spirit, which is so obvious among the people? This statement does not reflect that generosity of spirit. What about humanitarian concerns? What about the massive poverty and population problems which beset people in our own region? Australia is so resource rich, so wealthy, but it has no concept of actually sharing the resources it has with people in its region. This is not seen as a good way of building better relationships with them. It is no wonder that there is so little in this paper about foreign aid.</PARA>
<PARA> In the recent Budget the Department of Defence received a whopping 9.6 per cent increase. On the other hand, the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade received 1.8 per cent, only a small proportion of which is spent on aid. In this paper there is no philosophy, no priority outline, no guidelines for foreign aid. I agree that the foreign aid we do give must be very carefully spent. I acknowledge Senator Schacht's example of Japan's very inappropriate expenditure in some areas in the South Pacific. Obviously, the locals were not consulted. That is a primary priority when setting foreign aid guidelines, but there is nothing about that in this document. It is about time this Government realised that we can achieve good relationships with our neighbours by helping them in environmentally sound self-help projects, which are ultimately in our best interests. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course, the Opposition is no better. In fact, it is a lot worse. It proposes to cut the foreign aid budget by at least $100m. That is its promise. That is out of step with the will of the Australian people to be more humanitarian in our region, at least from the point of view of self-interest. The Opposition cannot even see the benefit that Australia could gain by more active foreign aid distribution, preferably through non-government organisations, who are the best deliverers of foreign aid because they are more closely in touch with the people that foreign aid is meant to be helping.</PARA>
<PARA> At least lip-service is given in the document to some environmental considerations and there is a short section on non-military threats such as environmental degradation in the region, drugs and illegal immigration. Surely they are the real threats to Australia's security-so often identified by people in the north-west as I was travelling in the Kimberleys during the amazing episode of Kangaroo 89, in which we had to invent an enemy to fight against. People said, `What about illegal drugs? What about illegal immigration? What about illegal fishing?'. That is where we need to be spending our defence dollars. </PARA>
<PARA> Another omission I must comment on is that of New Zealand. Senator Hill suggested that this was because of chummy trans-Tasman Labor Party relationships. I suspect that this is not correct. The Minister's excuse for the omission of our close neighbour was unconvincing. We should not take New Zealand for granted, as I think we sometimes do, nor should we underestimate the right of New Zealanders to self-determination. I mention very briefly two cases in point. In the nuclear warships ban, which was initiated in 1984, New Zealand was not supported. In fact, in a letter written by the Prime Minister, Mr Hawke, to the then Prime Minister of New Zealand, David Lange, the Australian Government indicated that Australia was very put out by this because our other alliance partner was put out. In effect, Australia went in to bat for the Americans against our trans-Tasman neighbour on that point. In the second and more recent case, the Anzac frigates project, New Zealand was unmercifully bullied. </PARA>
<PARA> Relationships between the trans-Tasman Ministers may be suitably massaged to give the Ministers and their minders the reassuring impression that all is okay, but at the community level the relationship has soured. All is far from okay. The Australian Government should acknowledge that problem, which is of its own making. Maybe that is why New Zealand was left out-another item for the too-hard basket. Again, these problems stem from a fetish with a defence orientation rather than with what foreign policy should be-foreign policy setting the tone, setting the pace, rather than a defence. Unfortunately, this document represents the capitulation of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade to the Department of Defence. It seems that the battle between the two departments is all over. There is not even any shouting any more. We have seen this coming with the relaxation of export controls on military equipment and the responsibility for those exports moving from the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade to the Department of Defence. </PARA>
<PARA> I feel very disappointed with this depressing defence-driven document. Really, I had hoped for better from Senator Gareth Evans. The most positive thing I can say about his role since he has taken over the portfolio is that he has been active in promoting human rights concerns in the many countries he has visited. Of course, I do not want to take an entirely critical position, so I offer a constructive alternative. Those of us who are being critical of what we term Australia's new militarism are suggesting that Australia should use these momentous times to recognise the obsolescence of ANZUS and to implement a policy of non-provocative defence that covers Australia and nowhere beyond. Linked with this, there should be an emphasis on implementing measures towards common security in the region, just as the Europeans are also discussing similar proposals and defence strategies for the future of their continent. The Cold War, which has held the continent of Europe in its icy grip for 44 years, is rapidly melting. We need to ask what we can do to respond to this thaw in our own part of the world, or are we too afraid of peace breaking out? More community input into Australia's foreign policy would be a good idea. This would help in formulating a more realistic, compassionate and truly independent foreign policy. </PARA>
<PARA> I have a lot more to say, but in deference to other senators I am cutting my speech short at this point in the hope that the favour will be returned at a future time. As an Independent, I am so often either left off the speakers list altogether or put so low on the list that I have to share the available remaining time. I shall conclude my comments in a future adjournment debate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The main significance of the statement put down by the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade (Senator Gareth Evans) is that it is a personal statement. It is a political statement which reflects his vocabulary and values. It is clearly not a production of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade or else it would be much more substantial. Most speakers in this debate have said that the statement is thin, that it is lacking in substance and that it is stating the obvious. I can only summarise it in those terms and in this way: it is the kind of statement which any one of us might make to an interested body in Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I believe that the statement is designed for domestic consumption. An election is coming up which, very likely, will mean the end of the term of office of this Minister in the foreign affairs and trade portfolio. Before the end of that period, the Minister wants to put down his own personal statement about our own region. He got a lot wrong. He left out the global context. He defined South East Asia and the South Pacific in a narrow way-in a way that one might, with few resources and little time, begin to address something that one personally felt to be important but which, inevitably, is dealt with in an inadequate fashion. </PARA>
<PARA> There is a brief introductory reference to global matters and to the superpower relativities. References are made in some sentences-and at the most, paragraphs-to Japan, China and Europe. Yet, the developments in Europe and the transition from the two superpower dominated world to a polarity with six major military and economic powers require much more of a statement than these brief and bare references. The final sentence on page 46 of this brief statement gives a clue as to why Senator Evans wanted to put down this personal, last gasp statement about foreign affairs in our region. It is a reaction to the criticisms that many of us have made that there have been too few statements by the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade and that he feels overshadowed by the 1987 White Paper on defence. Indeed, Mr Beazley, who is seen by many as a competent Minister for Defence and who has brought many gains to this area for Australia's good and for the security of our region, has overshadowed Senator Evans. So the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade wants to try to right the balance. In the last paragraph on page 46 he says:</PARA>
<PARA> Australia in the past has tended to perceive the relevance of South East Asia and the South Pacific to Australia's security in largely military terms. We now-</PARA>
<PARA>having received the Minister's statement-</PARA>
<PARA>have the opportunity to reinforce our national security by utilising the many dimensions of our external policies in an informed, coordinated and vigorous way to participate in the shaping of the regional environment. Effectively implemented and presented, this multidimensional-</PARA>
<PARA>Gareth Evans-</PARA>
<PARA>approach to regional security policy is the best way of maintaining our national security into the future. </PARA>
<PARA>It goes out in a blaze of lights. In making those remarks, particularly the one that describes this statement as stating the obvious, I want to make it clear that the motherhood statements, the obvious statements, in this document are so shared by the majority of senators in this place that we would not want to detract from those universally held aspirations by making any criticisms. We want to see a secure region. We want to have excellent relations in the South Pacific and South East Asia and, indeed, with all of our trading partners and allies in the whole global context. </PARA>
<PARA> It is insufficient for the Minister to bring down a glowing, brief, obvious statement and to omit so much that ought to bear upon any sensible discussion in this chamber, let alone in any forum in Australia, of our regional security. The focus of the statement is so narrow that it begs some response to the defence statements of Mr Beazley which are, by necessity, confined to this region of the world-the South Pacific and South East Asia; the immediate neighbours of Australia. I find that the criticisms of the inadequacy of the statement that have been made by so many in this debate stand. </PARA>
<PARA> Many ambassadors to this country and many foreign observers will look at this statement in terms of the values and vocabulary of Senator Evans's own mind. It is clear that this statement has Gareth Evans's vocabulary all through it. Much of that is obvious and his aspirations are shared by those in this chamber. Anything that is distinctive in the document, or anything that is new, is best read in the context of understanding what this failing Minister for Foreign Affairs is all about. He is making a last gasp statement before the end of this Hawke Labor Government. </PARA>
<PARA> I wish to draw particular attention to two emphases which I think have dangerous aspects. One danger is the way in which Senator Evans describes the United States without any clear reference to ANZUS, without any clear reinforcement of our close alliance. Rather, he gives the expectation that the United States will have less and less interest in the security needs of this region and of Australia as a major ally of the United States. Page 5 of the statement says:</PARA>
<PARA>South East Asia and the South Pacific thus may well be relatively less in the focus of the United States priorities than in the past; certainly it would not be useful to assume that the United States will continue to maintain its present level of security interest and activity in this part of the world. </PARA>
<PARA> On page 4 of his tabling statement the Minister said:</PARA>
<PARA>But with a decline in ideological competition and other global and regional developments, United States attention on the region may well become over time increasingly less geo-political and more oriented to its major economic interests. </PARA>
<PARA>The implication is that if it is not in the economic interests of the United States to play any role in the security arrangements of this region, or the Pacific as a whole, it will not do so and that Australia ought to be realistic and change its expectations that what we have always understood is involved in ANZUS is now dated and will no longer occur. </PARA>
<PARA> Linked with this is another emphasis which is dangerous in so far as it raises expectations of a security arrangement of a kind that was entered into with the South East Asia Treaty Organisation or the present five power defence arrangements-some sort of North Atlantic Treaty Organisation of the south! On page 20 of the ministerial statement, Senator Evans says:</PARA>
<PARA> It might eventually prove possible and appropriate to subsume such arrangements in a wider new regional security community arrangement or understanding, but our objective at this stage should simply be participation in a gradually emerging sense of shared strategic and security interests. </PARA>
<PARA>More clearly, in the tabling statement Senator Evans gives the aspiration that:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . Australia should use its military assets and presence in the region to help foster the gradual development of a regional security community based on a sense of shared security interests: this is described in the Statement . . .</PARA>
<PARA>This politico-military emphasis of Senator Evans is a new emphasis and presumably is taking up the vacuum that will be caused by the end of the United States involvement that he has foreshadowed. I regard both of these statements as new emphases that are dangerous and that will need very careful attention along with much else that is in the statement. As time is no longer available to me, I will seek leave to continue my remarks later. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In the hearings of Estimates Committee D, which I attended, Senator Newman asked a question relating to the supply system redevelopment project of the Department of Defence, in which I was also interested. She said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I see in the annual report that there is a list of consultants to the Department-one of them is Arthur Young Services-who have undertaken a study to a contract value of $644,539 to identify ways to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of the defence supply services in meeting Defence needs and objectives. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am glad that the Government Deputy Whip recognises this. The Army representatives said they were quite pleased to provide a copy of that $644,000 report. But it has not turned up. It is now December and the report that the Army said it was quite happy to supply in early October is not available. Why is this? Let us face it: the report seemed fairly straightforward. Dr McIntosh of the Department of Defence said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Arthur Young Study deals with warehouse rationalisations and things way beyond simply the computer system. </PARA>
<PARA>One imagines that savings of some substance could well emerge from this report; but this Government has not released it. On 28 November, during debate on Appropriation Bill (No. 1), Senator Newman asked Senator Richardson whether she could have a copy of this report. This was a month and a half after the undertaking that it would be readily available. Senator Richardson responded:</PARA>
<PARA> With regard to the Arthur Young report it is being printed and the Minister for Defence will decide on the date of release when it is available to him. </PARA>
<PARA>That was an incredible response given that the report had been completed and a copy was capable of being provided by the Army. Clearly, the bureaucracy, the Ministry or both have found some reason not to provide this document. I want to know that reason. What do they have to hide? Is the Minister trying to hide something? Is the bureaucracy trying to hide something? I want to be convinced that the alleged hold-up in the printing of the report-a report which has been available for two months-is not in fact an excuse for the reprinting of an homogenised, pasteurised report-sanitised for bits that some people perhaps do not want to have included in it. </PARA>
<PARA> The question at the Estimates Committee hearing related to the report as it then was and an undertaking was given not only that it would be provided but also that the Army would be pleased to provide it. I want to know whether the document being printed is the same document that was promised to us, or is it a different document? If it is a different document, why have we had to wait such a long time for the unwanted comments to be removed? What concerns me most about this is that I understand that at the moment the Joint Standing Committee of Public Accounts is presently examining this whole issue of the supply system redevelopment project for the Army. I want to know whether the reason that this report has not been provided to this chamber is that it also has not been provided to the Public Accounts Committee. I fear that may be the reason for the delay. I have no knowledge of that; I do not know what happens on that Committee. It is naturally obliged to carry on in a confidential manner. If the report is good enough to go to the Joint Committee of Public Accounts, why is it not good enough to come here? Is it being kept out of both places?</PARA>
<PARA> This is grossly unsatisfactory. We have had a whole series of unsatisfactory activities and responses during the Senate Estimates committee hearings this year. I really hope that the Senate decides to take a serious look at this problem. I ask the Minister to look into this and to give a response as quickly as possible. Quite frankly, we deserve a copy of this report. Unless there is some pressing reason, I cannot see why we cannot have it before we rise at the end of this week. </PARA>
<PARA> I refer very briefly to one other issue. Today, Senator Robert Ray presented 55 papers to this chamber for debate in the normal 30-minute period for reports. In doing so, he said, `Well, I did not know that they were all going to be dumped in one day. It is not my fault that there were none on Monday or Tuesday and 55 today. Don't blame me.' Well, who are we to blame? It is clearly a stunt by this Government. Many of these reports listed today were delivered to my office on Monday; others were delivered on Tuesday. Why were they not on the lists on those days so that we could use the half-hour available for reports to debate them? It is clearly a stunt to prevent our giving proper scrutiny to these reports. It is remarkable that on the one day that 55 reports are listed we did not even get the half-hour to debate reports because the Senate rises early tonight and the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade (Senator Gareth Evans)-and defence-brought out his statement to be certain that we did not deal with reports today. It is absolutely incredible that this sort of thing goes on. </PARA>
<PARA> Clearly the objective of the Government is to try to make it impossible for us to deal with this mountain of reports with which we are being inundated. I bet there will be none listed for tomorrow because we will have a 30-minute period available tomorrow. I bet there will be none listed next Monday or whenever we next sit. It seems as though the Government has saved them up for the days when we cannot debate them. Not only have 55 reports been circulated, but also we have 20 treaties which are included with item 39. Do we get the chance to discuss these? No, we do not, except that we will have an hour tomorrow in general business when these and all the other accumulated reports from recent times-which we have not had time to deal with-will be presented to us. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government is treating the Senate with contempt in this matter. It is not as though these reports are inconsequential; there are many annual reports of departments. There is the annual report of the Repatriation Commission and the Department of Veterans' Affairs, and the annual report of the Department of Social Security. There is the annual report of the Commissioner of Taxation. Now, there is a lively report. There is the annual report of the Department of Industrial Relations, the annual report of the Department of Transport and Communications, and the annual reports of many major departments which we have every right to look at. There are other reports such as the annual report of the Australian Customs Service, which would be interesting to debate. Honourable senators would remember that the Australian Customs Service complained very strongly about the lax security at Sydney (Kingsford-Smith) Airport. We have the annual report of the National Companies and Securities Commission, which is a matter of some interest to the Minister who is at the table. We have the annual report of the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions who has made some statements that at least the Minister found interesting at Question Time today. We have the Industries Assistance Commission's report 422 on government non-tax charges. There are four volumes to that report. Volume 3 deals with efficiency issues and public enterprises, which is a matter of major concern to the Opposition. Volume 4 is entitled Studies-Public Rail Freight, Electricity and Workers Compensation Arrangements. These are matters of massive substance. We have a report entitled Schedules of Special Purpose Flights by the Royal Australian Air Force. It is two years out of date-is it not remarkable-yet it was brought on on a day when we could not debate it because we ran out of time before we got to reports. This is a farce. I hope that the Minister, who I know is a decent man and is concerned with the proprieties of this sort of thing, will chide his colleagues and ask whoever the smart alec was who determined this sort of procedure perhaps to try a little harder to give some proper respect to the requirements of the Senate. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="NJ4">Senator Tate</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Aboriginal Affairs has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Action taken in relation to the recommendations of the Report on the Review of the Aboriginals Benefit Trust Account (ABTA) and, where relevant, reasons why certain recommendations have not been put into effect, are described below, with reference to each of the numbered recommendations in the Report.</PARA>
<PARA> 1a The Government has accepted in principle the thrust of the major recommendations in the Report. Action has been taken towards a staged introduction of the major recommendations. Where some of those actions have not been completed a major consideration has been recent trends in the level of the ABTA's royalty equivalent income and Land Councils' administrative costs.</PARA>
<PARA> 1b Measures have been adopted to increase the autonomy of the ABTA Advisory Committee, as detailed below. The matter of complete Aboriginal control of the ABTA is still under consideration.</PARA>
<PARA> 1c (i) It was not found to be necessary to retain the working party as an advisory body because the Government has staged the implementation of recommendations and has established an ABTA Sub-Committee to assist the ABTA Advisory Committee in its annual policy formulation. Refer to answer to paragraph 5g.</PARA>
<PARA> 1c (ii) Aspects of the Report's recommendations and the structure of the ABTA are being considered in investigations currently being conducted into ways to overcome the decrease of the ABTA's reserve funds.</PARA>
<PARA> 1d The Report was widely circulated. I understand that my predecessor was informed of the views expressed by interested parties.</PARA>
<PARA> 1e The specific recommendations made at the end of each chapter of the Report have received consideration.</PARA>
<PARA> 2a and 2b The recommendation that the ABTA be divided into two distinct trust accounts will be considered in the context of the proposal that the ABTA become an autonomous statutory body.</PARA>
<PARA> 3a This recommendation will be included in consideration of the division of the ABTA into two distinct trust accounts. This matter is also being considered in the context of the current investigation of ABTA financial matters.</PARA>
<PARA> 3b The ABTA Advisory Committee, with the assistance of the Sub-Committee, has formulated positive policies relating to investments and grants. These policies are subject to annual review by the Advisory Committee.</PARA>
<PARA> 4a and 4b See the answer to paragraphs 2a and 2b.</PARA>
<PARA> 4c The Present ABTA Secretariat has established an office in Darwin physically separate from the office of the Department of Aboriginal Affairs. No regional office has been established in Alice Springs due to a lack of resources.</PARA>
<PARA> 4d and 4e No small regional offices of the present ABTA Secretariat have been established. The co-operation of the Department of Aboriginal Affairs and other relevant agencies is sought in relation to the assessment of grant applications.</PARA>
<PARA> 4f The budget of the present ABTA Secretariat, which is funded by subsection 64 (5) payments from the ABTA, is approved by the Minister's delegate, the Northern Territory State Director of the Department of Aboriginal Affairs. The present ABTA Secretariat submits audited annual financial statements to the Auditor-General and to the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs in accordance with section 41d of the Audit Act 1901. The Auditor-General reports to the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs on matters covered by the financial statements.</PARA>
<PARA> 4g A separate ABTA has not been established and there is no power under the present Act for the Minister to require an audit of the present ABTA or withhold the payment of mining royalty equivalents into the ABTA. The Australian Audit Office conducts annual audits of the ABTA's accounts and records (see answer to paragraph 4f).</PARA>
<PARA> 5a The recommendation that the name of the ABTA Advisory Committee be changed to the ABTA Committee will be considered in the context of proposals that the ABTA become an autonomous body. In electing members to the Advisory Committee, Land Councils have been asked to consider candidates most suitable to fulfilling the tasks now undertaken by the Advisory Committee having regard to the criteria suggested in the Report.</PARA>
<PARA> 5b and 5c The size of the Advisory Committee has been increased to twelve members. There are six members from the region of the Northern Land Council, four members from the region of the Central Land Council and one from the Tiwi Land Council.</PARA>
<PARA> 5d The Chairmanship of the Advisory Committee has remained a Ministerial appointment with a fixed term of three years. The policy of rotating the Chairmanship between Chairmen resident in the northern and central regions of the Northern Territory has been adopted.</PARA>
<PARA> 5e Members of the Advisory Committee are elected from time to time by Land Councils in accordance with paragraph 65 (1) (b) of the Act. The Land Councils are aware of the Report's recommendation that they elect Advisory Committee members to serve a two year term, with the possibility of a further term.</PARA>
<PARA> 5f The ABTA Advisory Committee is actively involved in the formulation of expenditure policies and the development of guidelines for the assessment of grant applications. These policies and guidelines and the general performance of the ABTA are subject to annual review by the Advisory Committee.</PARA>
<PARA> 5g An ABTA Sub-Committee has been established, consisting of the Chairman of the ABTA Advisory Committee, the Manager of the ABTA Secretariat, the Directors of the Northern and Central Land Councils, a nominee of the Tiwi Land Council Executive and the Northern Territory State Director of the Department of Aboriginal Affairs. The Sub-Committee provides advice to the ABTA Advisory Committee on policy formulation and grants assessment as recommended in the Report.</PARA>
<PARA> 5h The Chairman of the Advisory Committee has been given a delegation to approve grants of up to $100,000, in Committee, upon the advice of the Sub-Committee. The limit of the delegation will be reviewed.</PARA>
<PARA> 5i ABTA Advisory Committee and Sub-Committee procedures have been formulated. The incorporation of procedural requirements in the Act will be considered in the context of the proposal that the ABTA become an autonomous statutory body.</PARA>
<PARA> 6a New policies and guidelines have been formulated by the ABTA Advisory Committee, with the assistance of the Sub-Committee.</PARA>
<PARA> 6b This matter will be examined when the division of the present ABTA into two trust accounts is considered. The ABTA Advisory Committee has established a policy that grant approvals will be limited to $5 million per annum for five years, with the remaining moneys available being put into long-term investments.</PARA>
<PARA> 6c The policies and guidelines used in the assessment of grant applications are subject to annual review by the ABTA Advisory Committee, with the assistance of the Sub-Committee. At these policy meetings the Advisory Committee establishes categories under which funding proposals are considered and sets restrictions on the funding available under particular categories.</PARA>
<PARA> 6d These recommendations are being complied with in the context of the present system.</PARA>
<PARA> 6e The ABTA now publishes annual reports which include information on grant approvals.</PARA>
<PARA> 6f The Act enables loans to be made from the ABTA, but no loans have been made since the Trust Account was established. Loans made by the previous Aboriginal Benefits Trust Fund have been transferred to the ABTA.</PARA>
<PARA> 7a The NTATA has not been established. Refer to answers to paragraphs 2a, 2b and 3a.</PARA>
<PARA> 7b Refer to answer to paragraph 6b.</PARA>
<PARA> 7c The NTATA has not been established. Refer to answer to paragraphs 2a, 2b and 3a.</PARA>
<PARA> 7d, 7e, 7f and 7g The investment options of the ABTA remain within restrictions set by the Audit Act 1901. The ABTA Secretariat is consulting with the Department of Finance concerning ways to maximise returns on investment. Investment options available to the ABTA, should it become an autonomous statutory body, will be considered at an appropriate time.</PARA>
<PARA> 8a and 8b The ABTA Advisory Committee has adopted the policy that, in general, the ABTA will not provide funding for projects which fall within the responsibility of other Government agencies.</PARA>
<PARA> 8c The Commonwealth has taken the view that the Northern Territory has a proper role to play in funding the provision of services to Aboriginal people.</PARA>
<PARA> 9a and 9b As indicated earlier, the NTATA has not been established. On 19 June 1987, the Minister for Finance approved a determination under section 41d of the Audit Act 1901 for the purpose of having the accounts and records of the present ABTA subject to an annual audit by the Australian Audit Office. As a result, the ABTA now provides an annual report which includes audited financial statements. The annual report is tabled in the Parliament. The ABTA is covered in the Auditor-General's reports on the Aboriginal Affairs Portfolio. Reference is made to the activities of the ABTA in the annual report of the Department of Aboriginal Affairs.</PARA>
<PARA> 9c Information concerning details and results of grant applications is provided to the Land Councils and to the Department of Aboriginal Affairs within a month of each grants meeting. Individual applicants are also advised of the result of their applications within that time.</PARA>
<PARA> 9d and 9e Applications for grants are invited well in advance of the grants meetings of the ABTA Advisory Committee. Advertisements informing Aboriginals of grants policies are placed in the Northern Territory newspapers and the Land Rights News. Application forms include information on the ABTA's role and policies, administrative guidelines, application assessment factors and categories for funding. This method of seeking applications reaches a large number of Aboriginals and generates a large number of applications. The Department of Aboriginal Affairs and ABTA newsletters are no longer published and radio is not used for dissemination of information on grants.</PARA>
<PARA> 10a This recommendation has not been implemented because of doubts as to whether it offers a realistic alternative to supplementary funding arrangements for Land Councils. The exemptions of Land Councils from mining withholding tax was referred to the Treasurer in 1985 but was not agreed to at that time. The matter of mining withholding tax is currently under further consideration.</PARA>
<PARA> 10b This recommendation has not been implemented because the administrative expenses of the Northern and Central Land Councils exceed the moneys available under subsection 64 (1) of the Act.</PARA>
<PARA> 10c The Act has not been amended but procedures and a timetable related to the submission, evaluation and approval of Land Councils' estimates have been approved by the Minister.</PARA>
<PARA> 10d In accordance with section 34c of the Acts Interpretation Act 1901 the Land Councils are required to submit their annual reports to the Minister within six months of the end of the financial year. The Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act 1976 has been amended, by the addition of subsection 37a (3), to require the Minister to table Land Councils' annual reports and financial statements in the Parliament.</PARA>
<PARA> 10e This recommendation has been implemented.</PARA>
<PARA> 11a This recommendation will be included in the consideration of the division of the ABTA into two distinct trust accounts.</PARA>
<PARA> 11b Paragraph 35 (2) (b) of the Act has been amended by the insertion of the phrase ``or are the traditional Aboriginal owners of'' after the words ``live in''.</PARA>
<PARA> 11c Subsection 35 (2) of the Act already provided that Land Councils distribute the relevant moneys within six months of their receipt by the Land Council. Subsections 35 (3) and 35 (4) have been amended to require distribution of moneys within the same period. Subsection 35 (9) has been added to the Act to enable Aboriginal recipients of moneys under subsections 35 (1), 35 (2), 35 (3), 35 (4) and 35 (6) to request a Land Council to hold these moneys in trust.</PARA>
<PARA> 11d This recommendation has been addressed by the addition of subsections 35 (5) and 35 (6) to the Act. Subsection 35 (5) requires a Land Council to report to the Minister if it fails to disburse moneys under subsections 35 (1), 35 (2) and 35 (3) within the required time limit because it has not been able to make a determination on disbursement. Under subsection 35 (6), the Minister may then make a determination upon which the Land Council is required to act.</PARA>
<PARA> 11e The Act has been amended accordingly by the addition of subsections 35 (8), 35 (10) and 35 (11). Before the Act was amended, royalty trust accounts had been established by the Northern and Central Land Councils to receive payments under section 35 of the Act. These trust accounts now fulfil the purposes of the above amendments. The Tiwi Land Council distributes section 35 moneys as soon as they become available and has not established a trust fund.</PARA>
<PARA> 11f This recommendation has been put into effect by the addition of subsection 37a (1a) to the Act.</PARA>
<PARA> 11g The Act has been amended by the addition of subsection 35 (12), which requires Aboriginal communities and groups entitled to receive moneys under section 35 to be incorporated under the Aboriginal Councils and Associations Act 1976 unless they received section 35 moneys prior to the commencement of this subsection.</PARA>
<PARA> 11h The Act has been amended accordingly by the addition of section 35a. There is ongoing monitoring by the Department of Aboriginal Affairs and the Land Councils of the use of these moneys by recipient groups.</PARA>
<PARA> 12a It is proposed that an amendment be made to subsection 63 (3) of the Act to enable the payment into the ABTA from the Consolidated Revenue Fund of amounts directly equivalent to royalties received by the Northern Territory under the Mineral Royalty Act 1982.</PARA>
<PARA> 12b The recommendation that the Commonwealth investigate the possibility of annually adjusting the Northern Territory's General Revenue Assistance Grants, taking into account royalties raised by the Northern Territory on Aboriginal land has not been pursued. Its adoption would be contrary to principles followed by the Commonwealth Grants Commission which considers such grants on a revenue neutral basis.</PARA>
<PARA> 12c The amendment referred to in paragraph 12a above is in accordance with the principle that mining royalty equivalents are pegged to actual royalties paid by miners.</PARA>
<PARA> 12d Refer to answer to paragraph 12a. This amendment will overcome delays in the transfer into the ABTA of mining royalty equivalents related to the Northern Territory Mineral Royalty Act 1982. Delays between receipt of other royalties and payment of equivalents into the ABTA have not been a significant problem. The Act has not been amended to specify that royalty equivalents be paid into the ABTA within thirty days because, under its existing administrative procedures, the ABTA Secretariat is able to achieve the transfer of mining royalty equivalents from the Consolidated Revenue Fund within a short time of receiving notification of the amount of royalties paid.</PARA>
<PARA> 12e Refer to answer to paragraph 12d.</PARA>
<PARA> 13a and 13b Refer to answer to paragraph 10a.</PARA>
<PARA> 14a and 14b ABTA moneys are not used for the fencing of Aboriginal Land Trust areas. The Aboriginal Development Commission and the ABTA are aware of ongoing financial liabilities including the cost of boundary fencing associated with pastoral properties bought with their funds.</PARA>
<PARA> 15a, 15b, 15c and 15d Refer to answer to paragraph 3a.</PARA>
